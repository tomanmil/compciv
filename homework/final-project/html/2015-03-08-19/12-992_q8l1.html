(Haluch) in Federal District Court to&para;<br>collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law.&para;<br>The Funds also sought attorney’s fees and costs, which were obligations under both a federal statute and the parties’ collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The District Court issued an order on June 17,&para;<br>2011, on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on&para;<br>July 25 on the Funds’ motion for fees and costs. The Funds appealed&para;<br>both decisions on August 15. Haluch argued that the June 17 order&para;<br>was a final decision pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1291, and thus, the&para;<br>Funds’ notice of appeal was untimely since it was not filed within the&para;<br>Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure’s 30-day deadline. The Funds&para;<br>disagreed, arguing that there was no final decision until July 25. The&para;<br>First Circuit acknowledged that an unresolved attorney’s fees issue&para;<br>generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final,&para;<br>but held that no final decision was rendered until July 25 since the&para;<br>entitlement to fees and costs provided for in the CBA was an element&para;<br>of damages and thus part of the merits. Accordingly, the First Circuit addressed the appeal with respect to both the unpaid contributions and the fees and costs.&para;<br>Held: The appeal of the June 17 decision was untimely. Pp. 5–13.&para;<br>(a) This case has instructive similarities to Budinich v. Becton&para;<br>Dickinson &amp; Co., 486 U. S. 196. There, this Court held a district&para;<br>court judgment to be a “final decision” for §1291 purposes despite an&para;<br>&para;<br>2 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF&para;<br>OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>unresolved motion for statutory-based attorney’s fees, noting that fee&para;<br>awards do not remedy the injury giving rise to the action, are often&para;<br>available to the defending party, and were, at common law, an element of “costs” awarded to a prevailing party, not a part of the merits&para;<br>judgment. Id., at 200. Even if laws authorizing fees might sometimes treat them as part of the merits, considerations of “operational&para;<br>consistency and predictability in the overall application of §1291” favored a “uniform rule.” Id., at 202. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) The Funds’ attempts to distinguish Budinich fail. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(1) Their claim that contractual attorney’s fees provisions are always a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for such provisions often&para;<br>provide attorney’s fees to prevailing defendants. More basic, Budinich’s uniform rule did not depend on whether the law authorizing a&para;<br>particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits, 486 U. S.,&para;<br>at 201, and there is no reason to depart from that sound reasoning&para;<br>here. The operational consistency stressed in Budinich is not promoted by providing for different jurisdictional effect based solely on&para;<br>whether an asserted right to fees is based on contract or statute. Nor&para;<br>is predictability promoted since it is not always clear whether and to&para;<br>what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory. The&para;<br>Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation, but the&para;<br>Budinich Court was aware of such concerns when it adopted a uniform rule, and it suffices to say that those concerns are counterbalanced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity&para;<br>whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed, especially given&para;<br>the complexity and amount of time it may take to resolve attorney’s&para;<br>fees claims. Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in many cases. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Rules 54(d)(2), 58(e). Complex variations in statutory and contractual fee-shifting provisions also counsel against treating attorney’s fees&para;<br>claims authorized by contract and statute differently for finality purposes. The Budinich rule looks solely to the character of the issue&para;<br>that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits.&para;<br>The Funds suggest that it is unclear whether Budinich applies&para;<br>where, as here, nonattorney professional fees are included in a motion for attorney’s fees and costs. They are mistaken to the extent&para;<br>that they suggest that such fees will be claimed only where a contractual fee claim is involved. Many fee-shifting statutes authorize&para;<br>courts to award related litigation expenses like expert fees, see West&para;<br>Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 89, n. 4, and&para;<br>there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell that Budinich remains applicable where such fees are&para;<br>claimed and awarded incidental to attorney’s fees.

S. C. §1291. In Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.,&para;<br>486 U.

The issue in this case is whether a differ­&para;<br>ent result obtains if the unresolved claim for attorney’s&para;<br>fees is based on a contract rather than, or in addition to, a&para;<br>statute. The answer here, for purposes of §1291 and the&para;<br>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is that the result is not&para;<br>different. Whether the claim for attorney’s fees is based&para;<br>on a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling&para;<br>on an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a&para;<br>general rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for&para;<br>purposes of appeal.&para;<br>&para;<br>2 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF&para;<br>OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) is a land­&para;<br>scape supply company. Under a collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreement (CBA) with the International Union of Operat­&para;<br>ing Engineers, Local 98, Haluch was required to pay con­&para;<br>tributions to union-affiliated benefit funds. Various of&para;<br>those funds are respondents here.&para;<br>In 2007, respondents (Funds) commissioned an audit to&para;<br>determine whether Haluch was meeting its obligations&para;<br>under the CBA. Based on the audit, the Funds demanded&para;<br>additional contributions. Haluch refused to pay, and the&para;<br>Funds filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court&para;<br>for the District of Massachusetts.&para;<br>The Funds alleged that Haluch’s failure to make the&para;<br>required contributions was a violation of the Employee&para;<br>Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the&para;<br>Labor Management Relations Act, 1947. The Funds also&para;<br>sought attorney’s and auditor’s fees and costs, under&para;<br>§502(g)(2)(D) of ERISA, 94 Stat. 1295, 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1132(g)(2)(D) (providing for “reasonable attorney’s fees&para;<br>and costs of the action, to be paid by the defendant”),&para;<br>and the CBA itself, App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a (providing&para;<br>that “[a]ny costs, including legal fees, of collecting pay­&para;<br>ments due these Funds shall be borne by the defaulting&para;<br>Employer”).&para;<br>At the conclusion of a bench trial, the District Court&para;<br>asked the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and&para;<br>conclusions of law to allow the court “to consider both the&para;<br>possibility of enforcing [a] settlement and a decision on the&para;<br>merits at the same time.” Tr. 50 (Feb. 28, 2011). These&para;<br>submissions were due on March 14, 2011. The District&para;<br>Court went on to observe that “[u]nder our rules . . . if&para;<br>there is a judgment for the plaintiffs, typically a motion&para;<br>for attorney’s fees can be filed” shortly thereafter. Id., at&para;<br>51. It also noted that, “[o]n the other hand, attorney’s fees&para;<br>is part of the damages potentially here.” Ibid. It gave the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

They&para;<br>requested an extension of time to file their “request for&para;<br>reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and costs in the above&para;<br>matter.” Motion to Extend Time to Submit Request for&para;<br>Attorneys’ Fees in No. 09–cv–11607–MAP (D Mass.), p. 1.&para;<br>The District Court agreed; and on April 4, the Funds&para;<br>moved “for an [o]rder awarding the total attorneys’ fees&para;<br>and costs incurred . . . in attempting to collect this delin­&para;<br>quency, in obtaining the audit, in protecting Plaintiffs’&para;<br>interests, and in protecting the interests of the partici­&para;<br>pants and beneficiaries.” App. 72. The motion alleged&para;<br>that “[t]hose fees and costs . . . amount to $143,600.44,”&para;<br>and stated that “[d]efendants are liable for these monies&para;<br>pursuant to” ERISA, “and for the reasons detailed in the&para;<br>accompanying” affidavit. Ibid.

Id., at 74.&para;<br>As to the merits of the claim that Haluch had under­&para;<br>paid, on June 17, 2011, the District Court issued a memo­&para;<br>randum and order ruling that the Funds were entitled to&para;<br>certain unpaid contributions, though less than had been&para;<br>requested.

Supp. 2d 139, 143. On August 15, 2011, the Funds appealed from both decisions. Haluch filed a cross-appeal a&para;<br>week later.&para;<br>In the Court of Appeals Haluch argued that there had&para;<br>been no timely appeal from the June 17 decision on the&para;<br>merits. In its view, the June 17 decision was a final deci­&para;<br>sion under §1291, so that notice of appeal had to be filed&para;<br>within 30 days thereafter, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.&para;<br>4(a)(1)(A). The Funds disagreed. They argued that there&para;<br>was no final decision until July 25, when the District&para;<br>Court rendered a decision on their request for attorney’s&para;<br>fees and costs. In their view the appeal was timely as to&para;<br>all issues in the case. See Digital Equipment Corp. v.&para;<br>Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868 (1994).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals agreed with the Funds. 695 F. 3d&para;<br>1, 7 (CA1 2012). It acknowledged this Court’s holding that&para;<br>an unresolved issue of attorney’s fees generally does not&para;<br>prevent judgment on the merits from being final. But it&para;<br>held that this rule does not “mechanically . . . apply to all&para;<br>claims for attorneys’ fees, whatever their genesis,” and&para;<br>that, instead, “[w]here, as here, an entitlement to attor­&para;<br>neys’ fees derives from a contract . . . the critical question&para;<br>is whether the claim for attorneys’ fees is part of the mer­&para;<br>its.” Id., at 6. Interpreting the CBA in this case as&para;<br>“provid[ing] for the payment of attorneys’ fees as an ele­&para;<br>ment of damages in the event of a breach,” the Court of&para;<br>Appeals held that the June 17 decision was not final. Ibid.&para;<br>Concluding that the appeal was timely as to all issues, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals addressed the merits of the dispute with&para;<br>respect to the amount of unpaid remittances as well as the&para;<br>issue of fees and costs, remanding both aspects of the case&para;<br>to the District Court.

Catlin v. United&para;<br>States, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945). In Budinich, this Court&para;<br>addressed the question whether an unresolved issue of attorney’s fees for the litigation prevents a judgment from be­&para;<br>ing final. 486 U. S., at 202. There, a District Court in a&para;<br>diversity case had entered a judgment that left unresolved&para;<br>a motion for attorney’s fees based on a Colorado statute&para;<br>providing attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in certain&para;<br>cases. Id., at 197. The Court held that the judgment was&para;<br>final for purposes of §1291 despite the unresolved issue of&para;<br>attorney’s fees. Id., at 202.&para;<br>The Court in Budinich began by observing that “[a]s a&para;<br>general matter, at least, . . . a claim for attorney’s fees is&para;<br>not part of the merits of the action to which the fees per­&para;<br>tain.” Id., at 200. The Court noted that awards of attorney’s fees do not remedy the injury giving rise to the&para;<br>action, are often available to the party defending the action,&para;<br>and were regarded at common law as an element of “costs”&para;<br>awarded to a prevailing party, which are generally not&para;<br>treated as part of the merits judgment. Ibid. Though the&para;<br>Court acknowledged that the statutory or decisional law&para;<br>authorizing the fees might sometimes treat the fees as&para;<br>part of the merits, it held that considerations of “opera­&para;<br>tional consistency and predictability in the overall applica­&para;<br>tion of §1291” favored a “uniform rule that an unresolved&para;<br>issue of attorney’s fees for the litigation in question does&para;<br>not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.” Id.,&para;<br>at 202.&para;<br>The facts of this case have instructive similarities to&para;<br>Budinich. In both cases, a plaintiff sought to recover&para;<br>employment-related payments. In both cases, the District&para;<br>Court entered a judgment resolving the claim for unpaid&para;<br>amounts but left outstanding a request for attorney’s fees&para;<br>incurred in the course of litigating the case. Despite these&para;<br>similarities, the Funds offer two arguments to distinguish&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Budinich. First, they contend that unresolved claims for&para;<br>attorney’s fees authorized by contract, unlike those au­&para;<br>thorized by statute, are not collateral for finality purposes.&para;<br>Second, they argue that the claim left unresolved as of&para;<br>June 17 included fees incurred prior to the commencement&para;<br>of formal litigation and that those fees, at least, fall be­&para;<br>yond the scope of the rule announced in Budinich. For the&para;<br>reasons given below, the Court rejects these arguments.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Funds’ principal argument for the nonfinality of the&para;<br>June 17 decision is that a district court decision that does&para;<br>not resolve a fee claim authorized by contract is not final&para;<br>for purposes of §1291, because it leaves open a claim for&para;<br>contract damages. They argue that contractual provi­&para;<br>sions for attorney’s fees or costs of collection, in contrast&para;<br>to statutory attorney’s fees provisions, are liquidated­&para;<br>damages provisions intended to remedy the injury giving&para;<br>rise to the action.&para;<br>The premise that contractual attorney’s fees provisions&para;<br>are always a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for&para;<br>contractual fee provisions often provide attorney’s fees to&para;<br>prevailing defendants. See 1 R. Rossi, Attorneys’ Fees&para;<br>§9:25, p. 9–64 (3d ed. 2012); cf. Gleason, supra, at 137,&para;<br>n. 3. The Funds’ argument fails, however, for a more basic&para;<br>reason, which is that the Court in Budinich rejected the&para;<br>very distinction the Funds now attempt to draw.&para;<br>The decision in Budinich made it clear that the uniform&para;<br>rule there announced did not depend on whether the&para;<br>statutory or decisional law authorizing a particular fee&para;<br>claim treated the fees as part of the merits. 486 U. S., at&para;<br>201. The Court acknowledged that not all statutory or&para;<br>decisional law authorizing attorney’s fees treats those fees&para;<br>as part of “costs” or otherwise not part of the merits; and&para;<br>the Court even accepted for purposes of argument that the&para;<br>&para;<br>8 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF&para;<br>OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Colorado statute in that case “ma[de] plain” that the fees&para;<br>it authorized “are to be part of the merits judgment.” Ibid.&para;<br>But this did not matter. As the Court explained, the issue&para;<br>of attorney’s fees was still collateral for finality purposes&para;<br>under §1291. The Court was not then, nor is it now,&para;<br>“inclined to adopt a disposition that requires the merits&para;<br>or nonmerits status of each attorney’s fee provision to be&para;<br>clearly established before the time to appeal can be clearly&para;<br>known.” Id., at 202. There is no reason to depart here&para;<br>from this sound reasoning. By arguing that a different&para;<br>rule should apply to fee claims authorized by contract&para;<br>because they are more often a matter of damages and thus&para;<br>part of the merits, the Funds seek in substance to reliti­&para;<br>gate an issue already decided in Budinich.&para;<br>Were the jurisdictional effect of an unresolved issue of&para;<br>attorney’s fees to depend on whether the entitlement to&para;<br>fees is asserted under a statute, as distinct from a con­&para;<br>tract, the operational consistency and predictability&para;<br>stressed in Budinich would be compromised in many&para;<br>instances. Operational consistency is not promoted by&para;<br>providing for different jurisdictional effect to district court&para;<br>decisions that leave unresolved otherwise identical fee&para;<br>claims based solely on whether the asserted right to fees is&para;<br>based on a contract or a statute.&para;<br>The Funds’ proposed distinction also does not promote&para;<br>predictability.&para;<br>Although sometimes it may be clear&para;<br>whether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual&para;<br>rather than statutory in nature, that is not always so.&para;<br>This case provides an apt illustration. The Funds’ notice&para;<br>of motion itself cited just ERISA; only by consulting the&para;<br>accompanying affidavit, which included an oblique refer­&para;<br>ence to the CBA, could it be discerned that a contractual&para;<br>fee claim was being asserted in that filing. This may&para;<br>explain why the District Court’s July 25 decision cited&para;<br>just ERISA, without mention or analysis of the CBA provision or any other contractual provision. 792 F. Supp. 2d,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 140.&para;<br>The Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal&para;<br>litigation. The basic point is well taken, yet, in the context&para;<br>of distinguishing between different sources for awards of&para;<br>attorney’s fees, quite inapplicable. The Court was aware&para;<br>of piecemeal litigation concerns in Budinich, but it still&para;<br>adopted a uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attor­&para;<br>ney’s fees for the litigation does not prevent judgment on&para;<br>the merits from being final. Here it suffices to say that&para;<br>the Funds’ concern over piecemeal litigation, though start­&para;<br>ing from a legitimate principle, is counterbalanced by the&para;<br>interest in determining with promptness and clarity&para;<br>whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed. This&para;<br>is especially so because claims for attorney’s fees may be&para;<br>complex and require a considerable amount of time to&para;<br>resolve. Indeed, in this rather simple case, the fee-related&para;<br>submissions take up well over 100 pages in the joint ap­&para;<br>pendix. App. 64–198.&para;<br>The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, furthermore,&para;<br>provide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in the&para;<br>ordinary run of cases where circumstances warrant delay­&para;<br>ing the time to appeal. Rule 54(d)(2) provides for motions&para;<br>claiming attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses.&para;<br>Rule 58(e), in turn, provides that the entry of judgment&para;<br>ordinarily may not be delayed, nor may the time for ap­&para;<br>peal be extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. This&para;<br>accords with Budinich and confirms the general practice of&para;<br>treating fees and costs as collateral for finality purposes.&para;<br>Having recognized this premise, Rule 58(e) further pro­&para;<br>vides that if a timely motion for attorney’s fees is made&para;<br>under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of&para;<br>appeal has been filed and become effective to order that&para;<br>the motion have the same effect as a timely motion under&para;<br>Rule 59 for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Proce­&para;<br>dure 4(a)(4). This delays the running of the time to file an&para;<br>appeal until the entry of the order disposing of the fee&para;<br>&para;<br>10 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v.

Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(iii).&para;<br>In their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari,&para;<br>the Funds argued that in their case this procedure would&para;<br>not have been applicable. Brief in Opposition 34. Rule&para;<br>54(d)(2) provides that “[a] claim for attorney’s fees and&para;<br>related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion&para;<br>unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved&para;<br>at trial as an element of damages.” The Advisory Commit­&para;<br>tee Notes to Rule 54(d)(2) state that the procedure out­&para;<br>lined in that Rule “does not . . . apply to fees recoverable&para;<br>as an element of damages, as when sought under the&para;<br>terms of a contract; such damages typically are to be&para;<br>claimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be re­&para;<br>solved by a jury.” Advisory Committee’s 1993 Note on&para;<br>subd. (d), par. (2) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>App., pp. 240–241.&para;<br>The Funds no longer rely on their reading of Rule 54&para;<br>and the Advisory Committee Notes as a basis for their&para;<br>argument that the June 17 decision was not final under&para;<br>§1291. And this is not a case in which the parties at­&para;<br>tempted to invoke Rule 58(e) to delay the time to appeal.&para;<br>Regardless of how the Funds’ fee claims could or should&para;<br>have been litigated, however, the Rules eliminate concerns&para;<br>over undue piecemeal appeals in the vast range of cases&para;<br>where a claim for attorney’s fees is made by motion under&para;<br>Rule 54(d)(2). That includes some cases in which the fees&para;<br>are authorized by contract. See 2 M. Derfner &amp; A. Wolf,&para;<br>Court Awarded Attorney Fees ¶18.01[1][c], pp. 18–7 to 18–8&para;<br>(2013) (remarking that Rule 54(d)(2) applies “regardless&para;<br>of the statutory, contractual, or equitable basis of the&para;<br>request for fees,” though noting inapplicability where&para;<br>attorney’s fees are an element of damages under the sub­&para;<br>stantive law governing the action).&para;<br>The complex variations in statutory and contractual fee­&para;<br>shifting provisions also counsel against making the dis­&para;<br>tinction the Funds suggest for purposes of finality.

Some are bilateral, authorizing fees either&para;<br>to plaintiffs or defendants; some are unilateral. Some de­&para;<br>pend on prevailing party status; some do not. Some may&para;<br>be unclear on these points. The rule adopted in Budinich&para;<br>ignores these distinctions in favor of an approach that&para;<br>looks solely to the character of the issue that remains open&para;<br>after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits of the&para;<br>case.&para;<br>In support of their argument against treating contrac­&para;<br>tual and statutory fee claims alike the Funds suggest,&para;<br>nevertheless, that it is unclear whether Budinich still&para;<br>applies where, as here, auditor’s fees (or other nonattorney&para;<br>professional fees) are included as an incidental part of a&para;<br>motion for attorney’s fees and costs. (In this case, auditor’s&para;<br>fees accounted for $6,537 of the $143,600.44 requested&para;<br>in total.) To the extent the Funds suggest that similar&para;<br>fees will be claimed alongside attorney’s fees only where a&para;<br>contractual fee claim is involved, they are incorrect. Stat­&para;<br>utory fee claims are not always limited to attorney’s fees&para;<br>per se. Many fee-shifting statutes authorize courts to&para;<br>award additional litigation expenses, such as expert fees.&para;<br>See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S.&para;<br>83, 89, n. 4 (1991) (listing statutes); cf. Fed. Rule Civ.&para;<br>Proc. 54(d)(2)(A) (providing mechanism for claims by&para;<br>motion for “attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses”).&para;<br>Where, as here, those types of fees are claimed and&para;<br>awarded incidental to attorney’s fees, there is no apparent&para;<br>reason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell&para;<br>that Budinich remains applicable.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Funds separately contend that the June 17 decision&para;<br>was not final because their motion claimed some $8,561.75&para;<br>in auditor’s and attorney’s fees (plus some modest addi­&para;<br>tional expenses) incurred prior to the commencement of&para;<br>&para;<br>12 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF&para;<br>OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>litigation. These included fees for the initial audit to&para;<br>determine whether Haluch was complying with the CBA,&para;<br>as well as attorney’s fees incurred in attempting to obtain&para;<br>records from Haluch, researching fund auditing rights,&para;<br>drafting a letter demanding payment, and working on the&para;<br>initial complaint. Brief for Respondents 4–5; App. 64–67,&para;<br>81–88. The Funds argue that these fees do not fall within&para;<br>the scope of Budinich, because the Court in Budinich&para;<br>referred only to fees “for the litigation in question,” 486&para;<br>U. S., at 202, or, equivalently, “attributable to the case,”&para;<br>id., at 203.&para;<br>The fact that some of the claimed fees accrued before the&para;<br>complaint was filed is inconsequential. As this Court has&para;<br>observed, “some of the services performed before a lawsuit&para;<br>is formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are&para;<br>performed ‘on the litigation.’ ” Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of&para;<br>Ed., 471 U. S. 234, 243 (1985). “Most obvious examples”&para;<br>include “the drafting of the initial pleadings and the work&para;<br>associated with the development of the theory of the case.”&para;<br>Ibid. More generally, pre-filing tasks may be for the liti­&para;<br>gation if they are “both useful and of a type ordinarily&para;<br>necessary to advance the . . . litigation” in question. Ibid.&para;<br>The fees in this case fit that description. Investigation,&para;<br>preliminary legal research, drafting of demand letters, and&para;<br>working on the initial complaint are standard preliminary&para;<br>steps toward litigation. See id., at 250 (Brennan, J., con­&para;<br>curring in part and dissenting in part) (“[I]t is settled that&para;<br>a prevailing party may recover fees for the time spent&para;<br>before the formal commencement of the litigation on such&para;<br>matters as . . . investigation of the facts of the case, re­&para;<br>search on the viability of potential legal claims, [and]&para;<br>drafting of the complaint and accompanying documents&para;<br>. . . .”); 2 Derfner, supra, ¶16.02[2][b], at 16–15 (“[H]ours&para;<br>. . . spent investigating facts specific to the client’s case&para;<br>should be included in the lodestar, whether [or not] that&para;<br>time is spent prior to the filing of a complaint”).
