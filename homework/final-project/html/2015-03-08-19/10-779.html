ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–779.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 26, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through&para;<br>a process called “detailing.”&para;<br>Pharmacies receive “prescriber&para;<br>identifying information” when processing prescriptions and sell the&para;<br>information to “data miners,” who produce reports on prescriber be&para;<br>havior and lease their reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers.&para;<br>“Detailers” employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers then use the&para;<br>reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales to doctors.&para;<br>Vermont’s Prescription Confidentiality Law provides that, absent the&para;<br>prescriber’s consent, prescriber-identifying information may not be&para;<br>sold by pharmacies and similar entities, disclosed by those entities&para;<br>for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical&para;<br>manufacturers. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631(d). The prohibitions&para;<br>are subject to exceptions that permit the prescriber-identifying in&para;<br>formation to be disseminated and used for a number of purposes, e.g.,&para;<br>“health care research.” §4631(e).&para;<br>Respondents, Vermont data miners and an association of brand&para;<br>name drug manufacturers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief&para;<br>against state officials (hereinafter Vermont), contending that&para;<br>§4631(d) violates their rights under the Free Speech Clause of the&para;<br>First Amendment. The District Court denied relief, but the Second&para;<br>Circuit reversed, holding that §4631(d) unconstitutionally burdens&para;<br>the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without&para;<br>adequate justification.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Vermont’s statute, which imposes content- and speaker-based&para;<br>burdens on protected expression, is subject to heightened judicial&para;<br>scrutiny. Pp. 6–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) On its face, the law enacts a content- and speaker-based re&para;<br>striction on the sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying in&para;<br>formation. The law first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in&para;<br>large part on the content of a purchaser’s speech. It then bars phar&para;<br>macies from disclosing the information when recipient speakers will&para;<br>use that information for marketing. Finally, it prohibits pharmaceu&para;<br>tical manufacturers from using the information for marketing. The&para;<br>statute thus disfavors marketing, i.e., speech with a particular con&para;<br>tent, as well as particular speakers, i.e., detailers engaged in market&para;<br>ing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cincinnati v. Dis&para;<br>covery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426; Turner Broadcasting&para;<br>System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658. Yet the law allows pre&para;<br>scriber-identifying information to be purchased, acquired, and used&para;<br>for other types of speech and by other speakers. The record and for&para;<br>mal legislative findings of purpose confirm that §4631(d) imposes an&para;<br>aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in particular detailers who&para;<br>promote brand-name drugs. In practical operation, Vermont’s law&para;<br>“goes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination.” R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391. Heightened&para;<br>judicial scrutiny is warranted. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(b) Vermont errs in arguing that heightened scrutiny is unwar&para;<br>ranted. The State contends that its law is a mere commercial regula&para;<br>tion. Far from having only an incidental effect on speech, however,&para;<br>§4631(d) imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the&para;<br>identity of the speaker. The State next argues that, because pre&para;<br>scriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a&para;<br>legal mandate, §4631(d) is akin to a restriction on access to govern&para;<br>ment-held information. That argument finds some support in Los&para;<br>Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S.&para;<br>32, but that case is distinguishable. Vermont has imposed a restric&para;<br>tion on access to information in private hands. United Reporting re&para;<br>served that situation—i.e., “a case in which the government is prohib&para;<br>iting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already&para;<br>possesses.” Id., at 40. In addition, the United Reporting plaintiff was&para;<br>presumed to have suffered no personal First Amendment injury,&para;<br>while respondents claim that §4631(d) burdens their own speech.&para;<br>That circumstance warrants heightened scrutiny. Vermont also ar&para;<br>gues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales,&para;<br>transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct,&para;<br>not speech. However, the creation and dissemination of information&para;<br>are speech for First Amendment purposes. See, e.g., Bartnicki v.&para;<br>Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 527. There is no need to consider Vermont’s&para;<br>request for an exception to that rule. Section 4631(d) imposes a&para;<br>speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>circumstance is sufficient to justify applying heightened scrutiny,&para;<br>even assuming that prescriber-identifying information is a mere&para;<br>commodity. Pp. 11–15.&para;<br>2. Vermont’s justifications for §4631(d) do not withstand height&para;<br>ened scrutiny. Pp. 15–24.&para;<br>(a) The outcome here is the same whether a special commercial&para;<br>speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied, see,&para;<br>e.g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States,&para;<br>527 U. S. 173, 184. To sustain §4631(d)’s targeted, content-based&para;<br>burden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the&para;<br>statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and&para;<br>that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest. See Board of&para;<br>Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480–481. Ver&para;<br>mont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical privacy,&para;<br>including physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the&para;<br>integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and (2) is integral to the&para;<br>achievement of the policy objectives of improving public health and&para;<br>reducing healthcare costs. Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>(b) Assuming that physicians have an interest in keeping their&para;<br>prescription decisions confidential, §4631(d) is not drawn to serve&para;<br>that interest. Pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying informa&para;<br>tion with anyone for any reason except for marketing. Vermont&para;<br>might have addressed physician confidentiality through “a more co&para;<br>herent policy,” Greater New Orleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195,&para;<br>such as allowing the information’s sale or disclosure in only a few&para;<br>narrow and well-justified circumstances. But it did not. Given the in&para;<br>formation’s widespread availability and many permissible uses, Ver&para;<br>mont’s asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot justify&para;<br>the burdens that §4631(d) imposes on protected expression. It is true&para;<br>that doctors can forgo the law’s advantages by consenting to the sale,&para;<br>disclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information. But&para;<br>the State has offered only a contrived choice: Either consent, which&para;<br>will allow the doctor’s prescriber-identifying information to be dis&para;<br>seminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which&para;<br>will allow the information to be used by those speakers whose mes&para;<br>sage the State supports. Cf. Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S.&para;<br>728. Respondents suggest a further defect lies in §4631(d)’s pre&para;<br>sumption of applicability absent an individual election to the con&para;<br>trary. Reliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy&para;<br>measure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.&para;<br>Vermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary to&para;<br>avoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with detail&para;<br>ers. Cf. Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of&para;<br>Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 168. Vermont further argues that detailers’&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor&para;<br>patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment de&para;<br>cisions. But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions,&para;<br>it can do so only because it is persuasive. Fear that speech might&para;<br>persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it. Pp. 17–21.&para;<br>(c) While Vermont’s goals of lowering the costs of medical ser&para;<br>vices and promoting public health may be proper, §4631(d) does not&para;<br>advance them in a permissible way. Vermont seeks to achieve those&para;<br>objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by&para;<br>certain speakers—i.e., by diminishing detailers’ ability to influence&para;<br>prescription decisions. But “the fear that people would make bad de&para;<br>cisions if given truthful information” cannot justify content-based&para;<br>burdens on speech. Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535&para;<br>U. S. 357, 374. That precept applies with full force when the audi&para;<br>ence—here, prescribing physicians—consists of “sophisticated and&para;<br>experienced” consumers. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 775. The&para;<br>instant law’s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find&para;<br>detailing instructive. Vermont may be displeased that detailers with&para;<br>prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand&para;<br>name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in&para;<br>order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction. Vermont nowhere&para;<br>contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within&para;<br>the meaning of this Court’s First Amendment precedents. The&para;<br>State’s interest in burdening detailers’ speech thus turns on nothing&para;<br>more than a difference of opinion. Pp. 21–24.&para;<br>&para;<br>630 F. 3d 263, affirmed.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF &para;<br>&para;<br>VERMONT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.&para;<br>&para;<br>IMS HEALTH INC. ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 23, 2011] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Vermont law restricts the sale, disclosure, and use of&para;<br>pharmacy records that reveal the prescribing practices of&para;<br>individual doctors. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631 (Supp.&para;<br>2010). Subject to certain exceptions, the information may&para;<br>not be sold, disclosed by pharmacies for marketing pur&para;<br>poses, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufac&para;<br>turers. Vermont argues that its prohibitions safeguard&para;<br>medical privacy and diminish the likelihood that market&para;<br>ing will lead to prescription decisions not in the best inter&para;<br>ests of patients or the State. It can be assumed that these&para;<br>interests are significant. Speech in aid of pharmaceutical&para;<br>marketing, however, is a form of expression protected by&para;<br>the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. As a&para;<br>consequence, Vermont’s statute must be subjected to&para;<br>heightened judicial scrutiny. The law cannot satisfy that&para;<br>standard.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>doctors through a process called “detailing.” This often involves a scheduled visit to a doctor’s office to persuade&para;<br>the doctor to prescribe a particular pharmaceutical. De&para;<br>tailers bring drug samples as well as medical studies&para;<br>that explain the “details” and potential advantages of var&para;<br>ious prescription drugs. Interested physicians listen, ask&para;<br>questions, and receive followup data. Salespersons can be&para;<br>more effective when they know the background and pur&para;<br>chasing preferences of their clientele, and pharmaceutical&para;<br>salespersons are no exception. Knowledge of a physician’s prescription practices—called “prescriber-identifying&para;<br>information”—enables a detailer better to ascertain which&para;<br>doctors are likely to be interested in a particular drug and&para;<br>how best to present a particular sales message. Detailing&para;<br>is an expensive undertaking, so pharmaceutical companies&para;<br>most often use it to promote high-profit brand-name drugs&para;<br>protected by patent. Once a brand-name drug’s patent&para;<br>expires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives&para;<br>are manufactured and sold.&para;<br>Pharmacies, as a matter of business routine and federal&para;<br>law, receive prescriber-identifying information when proc&para;<br>essing prescriptions. See 21 U. S. C. §353(b); see also&para;<br>Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 9.1 (2009); Rule 9.2.&para;<br>Many pharmacies sell this information to “data miners,”&para;<br>firms that analyze prescriber-identifying information and&para;<br>produce reports on prescriber behavior. Data miners lease&para;<br>these reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers subject to&para;<br>nondisclosure agreements. Detailers, who represent the&para;<br>manufacturers, then use the reports to refine their mar&para;<br>keting tactics and increase sales.&para;<br>In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription Confidential&para;<br>ity Law. The measure is also referred to as Act 80. It has&para;<br>several components. The central provision of the present&para;<br>case is §4631(d).&para;<br>“A health insurer, a self-insured employer, an elec&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tronic transmission intermediary, a pharmacy, or other&para;<br>similar entity shall not sell, license, or exchange&para;<br>for value regulated records containing prescriber&para;<br>identifiable information, nor permit the use of&para;<br>regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable&para;<br>information for marketing or promoting a prescription&para;<br>drug, unless the prescriber consents . . . . Pharmaceu&para;<br>tical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers&para;<br>shall not use prescriber-identifiable information for&para;<br>marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless&para;<br>the prescriber consents . . . .”&para;<br>The quoted provision has three component parts. The&para;<br>provision begins by prohibiting pharmacies, health insur&para;<br>ers, and similar entities from selling prescriber-identifying&para;<br>information, absent the prescriber’s consent. The parties&para;<br>here dispute whether this clause applies to all sales or&para;<br>only to sales for marketing. The provision then goes on to&para;<br>prohibit pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from allowing prescriber-identifying information to be&para;<br>used for marketing, unless the prescriber consents. This&para;<br>prohibition in effect bars pharmacies from disclosing the&para;<br>information for marketing purposes. Finally, the provi&para;<br>sion’s second sentence bars pharmaceutical manufacturers&para;<br>and pharmaceutical marketers from using prescriber&para;<br>identifying information for marketing, again absent the&para;<br>prescriber’s consent. The Vermont attorney general may&para;<br>pursue civil remedies against violators. §4631(f).&para;<br>Separate statutory provisions elaborate the scope of the&para;<br>prohibitions set out in §4631(d). “Marketing” is defined to&para;<br>include “advertising, promotion, or any activity” that is&para;<br>“used to influence sales or the market share of a prescrip&para;<br>tion drug.” §4631(b)(5). Section 4631(c)(1) further pro&para;<br>vides that Vermont’s Department of Health must allow “a&para;<br>prescriber to give consent for his or her identifying infor&para;<br>mation to be used for the purposes” identified in §4631(d).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, the Act’s prohibitions on sale, disclosure, and use&para;<br>are subject to a list of exceptions. For example, prescriber&para;<br>identifying information may be disseminated or used for&para;<br>“health care research”; to enforce “compliance” with health&para;<br>insurance formularies, or preferred drug lists; for “care&para;<br>management educational communications provided to” pa&para;<br>tients on such matters as “treatment options”; for law&para;<br>enforcement operations; and for purposes “otherwise pro&para;<br>vided by law.” §4631(e).&para;<br>Act 80 also authorized funds for an “evidence-based pre&para;<br>scription drug education program” designed to provide&para;<br>doctors and others with “information and education on&para;<br>the therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescription&para;<br>drugs.” §4622(a)(1). An express aim of the program is&para;<br>to advise prescribers “about commonly used brand-name&para;<br>drugs for which the patent has expired” or will soon ex&para;<br>pire. §4622(a)(2). Similar efforts to promote the use of&para;<br>generic pharmaceuticals are sometimes referred to as&para;<br>“counter-detailing.” App. 211; see also IMS Health Inc. v.&para;<br>Ayotte, 550 F. 3d 42, 91 (CA1 2008) (Lipez, J., concurring&para;<br>and dissenting).&para;<br>The counterdetailer’s recommended&para;<br>substitute may be an older, less expensive drug and not a&para;<br>bioequivalent of the brand-name drug the physician might&para;<br>otherwise prescribe. Like the pharmaceutical manufac&para;<br>turers whose efforts they hope to resist, counterdetailers&para;<br>in some States use prescriber-identifying information to&para;<br>increase their effectiveness. States themselves may sup&para;<br>ply the prescriber-identifying information used in these&para;<br>programs. See App. 313; id., at 375 (“[W]e use the data&para;<br>given to us by the State of Pennsylvania . . . to figure out&para;<br>which physicians to talk to”); see also id., at 427–429&para;<br>(Director of the Office of Vermont Health Access explain&para;<br>ing that the office collects prescriber-identifying informa&para;<br>tion but “does not at this point in time have a counter&para;<br>detailing or detailing effort”). As first enacted, Act 80 also&para;<br>required detailers to provide information about alternative&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>treatment options. The Vermont Legislature, however,&para;<br>later repealed that provision. 2008 Vt. Laws No. 89, §3.&para;<br>Act 80 was accompanied by legislative findings. Vt. Acts&para;<br>No. 80, §1. Vermont found, for example, that the “goals of&para;<br>marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals&para;<br>of the state” and that the “marketplace for ideas on medi&para;<br>cine safety and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that&para;<br>brand-name companies invest in expensive pharmaceuti&para;<br>cal marketing campaigns to doctors.” §§1(3), (4). Detail&para;<br>ing, in the legislature’s view, caused doctors to make&para;<br>decisions based on “incomplete and biased information.”&para;<br>§1(4). Because they “are unable to take the time to re&para;<br>search the quickly changing pharmaceutical market,”&para;<br>Vermont doctors “rely on information provided by phar&para;<br>maceutical representatives.”&para;<br>§1(13).&para;<br>The legislature&para;<br>further found that detailing increases the cost of health&para;<br>care and health insurance, §1(15); encourages hasty and&para;<br>excessive reliance on brand-name drugs, before the profes&para;<br>sion has observed their effectiveness as compared with&para;<br>older and less expensive generic alternatives, §1(7); and&para;<br>fosters disruptive and repeated marketing visits tanta&para;<br>mount to harassment, §§1(27)–(28). The legislative find&para;<br>ings further noted that use of prescriber-identifying in&para;<br>formation “increase[s] the effect of detailing programs”&para;<br>by allowing detailers to target their visits to particular&para;<br>doctors. §§1(23)–(26). Use of prescriber-identifying data&para;<br>also helps detailers shape their messages by “tailoring” their&para;<br>“presentations to individual prescriber styles, preferences,&para;<br>and attitudes.” §1(25).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The present case involves two consolidated suits. One&para;<br>was brought by three Vermont data miners, the other&para;<br>by an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers that&para;<br>produce brand-name drugs. These entities are the re&para;<br>spondents here. Contending that §4631(d) violates their&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>First Amendment rights as incorporated by the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment, the respondents sought declaratory&para;<br>and injunctive relief against the petitioners, the Attorney&para;<br>General and other officials of the State of Vermont.&para;<br>After a bench trial, the United States District Court for&para;<br>the District of Vermont denied relief. 631 F. Supp. 2d 434&para;<br>(2009). The District Court found that “[p]harmaceutical&para;<br>manufacturers are essentially the only paying customers&para;<br>of the data vendor industry” and that, because detailing&para;<br>unpatented generic drugs is not “cost-effective,” pharma&para;<br>ceutical sales representatives “detail only branded drugs.”&para;<br>Id., at 451, 442. As the District Court further concluded, “the Legislature’s determination that [prescriber&para;<br>identifying] data is an effective marketing tool that en&para;<br>ables detailers to increase sales of new drugs is supported&para;<br>in the record.” Id., at 451. The United States Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. It&para;<br>held that §4631(d) violates the First Amendment by bur&para;<br>dening the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data&para;<br>miners without an adequate justification. 630 F. 3d 263.&para;<br>Judge Livingston dissented.&para;<br>The decision of the Second Circuit is in conflict with de&para;<br>cisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>First Circuit concerning similar legislation enacted by&para;<br>Maine and New Hampshire. See IMS Health Inc. v. Mills,&para;<br>616 F. 3d 7 (CA1 2010) (Maine); Ayotte, supra (New Hampshire). Recognizing a division of authority regarding the&para;<br>constitutionality of state statutes, this Court granted&para;<br>certiorari. 562 U. S. __ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The beginning point is the text of §4631(d). In the proceedings below, Vermont stated that the first sentence&para;<br>of §4631(d) prohibits pharmacies and other regulated&para;<br>entities from selling or disseminating prescriber&para;<br>identifying information for marketing. The information,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in other words, could be sold or given away for purposes&para;<br>other than marketing. The District Court and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals accepted the State’s reading. See 630 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 276. At oral argument in this Court, however, the&para;<br>State for the first time advanced an alternative reading of&para;<br>§4631(d)—namely, that pharmacies, health insurers, and&para;<br>similar entities may not sell prescriber-identifying infor&para;<br>mation for any purpose, subject to the statutory exceptions&para;<br>set out at §4631(e). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20. It might&para;<br>be argued that the State’s newfound interpretation comes&para;<br>too late in the day. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537&para;<br>U. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002) (waiver); New Hampshire v.&para;<br>Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 749 (2001) (judicial estoppel). The&para;<br>respondents, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals&para;<br>were entitled to rely on the State’s plausible interpretation&para;<br>of the law it is charged with enforcing. For the State to&para;<br>change its position is particularly troubling in a First&para;<br>Amendment case, where plaintiffs have a special interest&para;<br>in obtaining a prompt adjudication of their rights, despite&para;<br>potential ambiguities of state law. See Houston v. Hill,&para;<br>482 U. S. 451, 467–468, and n. 17 (1987); Zwickler v.&para;<br>Koota, 389 U. S. 241, 252 (1967).&para;<br>In any event, §4631(d) cannot be sustained even under&para;<br>the interpretation the State now adopts. As a consequence&para;<br>this Court can assume that the opening clause of §4631(d)&para;<br>prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities&para;<br>from selling prescriber-identifying information, subject to&para;<br>the statutory exceptions set out at §4631(e). Under that&para;<br>reading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or&para;<br>academic researchers, see §4631(e)(1), but not, for exam&para;<br>ple, to pharmaceutical marketers. There is no dispute as&para;<br>to the remainder of §4631(d). It prohibits pharmacies,&para;<br>health insurers, and similar entities from disclosing or&para;<br>otherwise allowing prescriber-identifying information to&para;<br>be used for marketing. And it bars pharmaceutical manu&para;<br>facturers and detailers from using the information for&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>marketing. The questions now are whether §4631(d) must&para;<br>be tested by heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so,&para;<br>whether the State can justify the law.&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>On its face, Vermont’s law enacts content- and speaker&para;<br>based restrictions on the sale, disclosure, and use of&para;<br>prescriber-identifying information. The provision first for&para;<br>bids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the&para;<br>content of a purchaser’s speech. For example, those who&para;<br>wish to engage in certain “educational communications,”&para;<br>§4631(e)(4), may purchase the information. The measure&para;<br>then bars any disclosure when recipient speakers will use&para;<br>the information for marketing. Finally, the provision’s&para;<br>second sentence prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers&para;<br>from using the information for marketing. The statute&para;<br>thus disfavors marketing, that is, speech with a particular&para;<br>content. More than that, the statute disfavors specific&para;<br>speakers, namely pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a&para;<br>result of these content- and speaker-based rules, detailers&para;<br>cannot obtain prescriber-identifying information, even&para;<br>though the information may be purchased or acquired by&para;<br>other speakers with diverse purposes and viewpoints.&para;<br>Detailers are likewise barred from using the information&para;<br>for marketing, even though the information may be used&para;<br>by a wide range of other speakers. For example, it ap&para;<br>pears that Vermont could supply academic organizations&para;<br>with prescriber-identifying information to use in counter&para;<br>ing the messages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufac&para;<br>turers and in promoting the prescription of generic drugs.&para;<br>But §4631(d) leaves detailers no means of purchasing,&para;<br>acquiring, or using prescriber-identifying information.&para;<br>The law on its face burdens disfavored speech by disfa&para;<br>vored speakers.&para;<br>Any doubt that §4631(d) imposes an aimed, content&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>based burden on detailers is dispelled by the record and by&para;<br>formal legislative findings. As the District Court noted,&para;<br>“[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only&para;<br>paying customers of the data vendor industry”; and the&para;<br>almost invariable rule is that detailing by pharmaceutical&para;<br>manufacturers is in support of brand-name drugs. 631&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 451. Vermont’s law thus has the effect of&para;<br>preventing detailers—and only detailers—from communi&para;<br>cating with physicians in an effective and informative&para;<br>manner. Cf. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 766 (1993)&para;<br>(explaining the “considerable value” of in-person solicita&para;<br>tion). Formal legislative findings accompanying §4631(d)&para;<br>confirm that the law’s express purpose and practical effect&para;<br>are to diminish the effectiveness of marketing by manu&para;<br>facturers of brand-name drugs. Just as the “inevitable&para;<br>effect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitu&para;<br>tional,” a statute’s stated purposes may also be considered.&para;<br>United States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968). Here,&para;<br>the Vermont Legislature explained that detailers, in&para;<br>particular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey&para;<br>messages that “are often in conflict with the goals of the&para;<br>state.” 2007 Vt. No. 80, §1(3). The legislature designed&para;<br>§4631(d) to target those speakers and their messages for&para;<br>disfavored treatment. “In its practical operation,” Ver&para;<br>mont’s law “goes even beyond mere content discrimina&para;<br>tion, to actual viewpoint discrimination.” R. A. V. v. St.&para;<br>Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391 (1992). Given the legislature’s&para;<br>expressed statement of purpose, it is apparent that&para;<br>§4631(d) imposes burdens that are based on the content&para;<br>of speech and that are aimed at a particular viewpoint.&para;<br>Act 80 is designed to impose a specific, content-based&para;<br>burden on protected expression. It follows that heightened&para;<br>judicial scrutiny is warranted. See Cincinnati v. Discovery&para;<br>Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 418 (1993) (applying height&para;<br>ened scrutiny to “a categorical prohibition on the use of&para;<br>newsracks to disseminate commercial messages”); id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v.

FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658 (1994) (explaining that&para;<br>strict scrutiny applies to regulations reflecting “aversion”&para;<br>to what “disfavored speakers” have to say). The Court has&para;<br>recognized that the “distinction between laws burdening&para;<br>and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree” and&para;<br>that the “Government’s content-based burdens must sat&para;<br>isfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans.”&para;<br>United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529&para;<br>U. S. 803, 812 (2000). Lawmakers may no more silence&para;<br>unwanted speech by burdening its utterance than by cen&para;<br>soring its content. See Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,&para;<br>115 (1991) (content-based financial burden); Minneapolis&para;<br>Star &amp; Tribune Co. v.

A government bent on frustrating an impend&para;<br>ing demonstration might pass a law demanding two years’&para;<br>notice before the issuance of parade permits. Even if the&para;<br>hypothetical measure on its face appeared neutral as to&para;<br>content and speaker, its purpose to suppress speech and&para;<br>its unjustified burdens on expression would render it&para;<br>unconstitutional.

See Discovery Network, supra, at 429–430 (commer&para;<br>cial speech restriction lacking a “neutral justification” was&para;<br>not content neutral). A “consumer’s concern for the free&para;<br>flow of commercial speech often may be far keener than&para;<br>his concern for urgent political dialogue.” Bates v. State&para;<br>Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977). That reality has&para;<br>great relevance in the fields of medicine and public health,&para;<br>where information can save lives.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The State argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is&para;<br>unwarranted because its law is a mere commercial regula&para;<br>tion. It is true that restrictions on protected expression&para;<br>are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more&para;<br>generally, on nonexpressive conduct. It is also true that&para;<br>the First Amendment does not prevent restrictions di&para;<br>rected at commerce or conduct from imposing inciden&para;<br>tal burdens on speech. That is why a ban on race-based&para;<br>hiring may require employers to remove “ ‘White Appli&para;<br>cants Only’ ” signs, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and&para;<br>Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 62 (2006); why “an&para;<br>ordinance against outdoor fires” might forbid “burning a&para;<br>flag,” R. A. V., supra, at 385; and why antitrust laws can&para;<br>prohibit “agreements in restraint of trade,” Giboney v.&para;<br>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 502 (1949).&para;<br>But §4631(d) imposes more than an incidental burden&para;<br>on protected expression. Both on its face and in its practi&para;<br>cal operation, Vermont’s law imposes a burden based on&para;<br>the content of speech and the identity of the speaker. See&para;<br>supra, at 8–11. While the burdened speech results from&para;<br>an economic motive, so too does a great deal of vital ex&para;<br>pression. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 818&para;<br>(1975); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266&para;<br>(1964); see also United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533&para;<br>U. S. 405, 410–411 (2001) (applying “First Amendment&para;<br>scrutiny” where speech effects were not incidental and&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>noting that “those whose business and livelihood depend&para;<br>in some way upon the product involved no doubt deem&para;<br>First Amendment protection to be just as important for&para;<br>them as it is for other discrete, little noticed groups”).&para;<br>Vermont’s law does not simply have an effect on speech,&para;<br>but is directed at certain content and is aimed at particu&para;<br>lar speakers. The Constitution “does not enact Mr. Her&para;<br>bert Spencer’s Social Statics.” Lochner v. New York, 198&para;<br>U. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). It does enact&para;<br>the First Amendment.&para;<br>Vermont further argues that §4631(d) regulates not&para;<br>speech but simply access to information. Prescriber&para;<br>identifying information was generated in compliance with&para;<br>a legal mandate, the State argues, and so could be consid&para;<br>ered a kind of governmental information. This argument&para;<br>finds some support in Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United&para;<br>Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32 (1999), where the&para;<br>Court held that a plaintiff could not raise a facial chal&para;<br>lenge to a content-based restriction on access to governmentheld information. Because no private party faced a&para;<br>threat of legal punishment, the Court characterized the&para;<br>law at issue as “nothing more than a governmental denial&para;<br>of access to information in its possession.” Id., at 40.&para;<br>Under those circumstances the special reasons for permit&para;<br>ting First Amendment plaintiffs to invoke the rights of&para;<br>others did not apply. Id., at 38–39. Having found that the&para;<br>plaintiff could not raise a facial challenge, the Court re&para;<br>manded for consideration of an as-applied challenge. Id.,&para;<br>at 41. United Reporting is thus a case about the availabil&para;<br>ity of facial challenges. The Court did not rule on the&para;<br>merits of any First Amendment claim.&para;<br>United Reporting is distinguishable in at least two&para;<br>respects. First, Vermont has imposed a restriction on&para;<br>access to information in private hands. This confronts the&para;<br>Court with a point reserved, and a situation not ad&para;<br>dressed, in United Reporting. Here, unlike in United&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Reporting, we do have “a case in which the government is&para;<br>prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the&para;<br>speaker already possesses.” Id., at 40. The difference is&para;<br>significant. An individual’s right to speak is implicated&para;<br>when information he or she possesses is subjected to “re&para;<br>straints on the way in which the information might be&para;<br>used” or disseminated. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,&para;<br>467 U. S. 20, 32 (1984); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532&para;<br>U. S. 514, 527 (2001); Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S.&para;<br>524 (1989); New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S.&para;<br>713 (1971) (per curiam). In Seattle Times, this Court&para;<br>applied heightened judicial scrutiny before sustaining a&para;<br>trial court order prohibiting a newspaper’s disclosure of&para;<br>information it learned through coercive discovery. It is&para;<br>true that the respondents here, unlike the newspaper in&para;<br>Seattle Times, do not themselves possess information&para;<br>whose disclosure has been curtailed. That information,&para;<br>however, is in the hands of pharmacies and other private&para;<br>entities. There is no question that the “threat of prosecu&para;<br>tion . . . hangs over their heads.” United Reporting, 528&para;<br>U. S., at 41. For that reason United Reporting does not&para;<br>bar respondents’ facial challenge.&para;<br>United Reporting is distinguishable for a second and&para;<br>even more important reason. The plaintiff in United&para;<br>Reporting had neither “attempt[ed] to qualify” for access to&para;<br>the government’s information nor presented an as-applied&para;<br>claim in this Court. Id., at 40. As a result, the Court&para;<br>assumed that the plaintiff had not suffered a personal&para;<br>First Amendment injury and could prevail only by invok&para;<br>ing the rights of others through a facial challenge. Here,&para;<br>by contrast, the respondents claim—with good reason—&para;<br>that §4631(d) burdens their own speech. That argument&para;<br>finds support in the separate writings in United Report&para;<br>ing, which were joined by eight Justices. All of those&para;<br>writings recognized that restrictions on the disclosure of&para;<br>government-held information can facilitate or burden the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>expression of potential recipients and so transgress the&para;<br>First Amendment. See id., at 42 (SCALIA, J., concurring)&para;<br>(suggesting that “a restriction upon access that allows&para;<br>access to the press . . . but at the same time denies access&para;<br>to persons who wish to use the information for certain&para;<br>speech purposes, is in reality a restriction upon speech”);&para;<br>id., at 43 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (noting that “the&para;<br>provision of [government] information is a kind of subsidy&para;<br>to people who wish to speak” about certain subjects, “and&para;<br>once a State decides to make such a benefit available to&para;<br>the public, there are no doubt limits to its freedom to&para;<br>decide how that benefit will be distributed”); id., at 46&para;<br>(Stevens, J., dissenting) (concluding that, “because the&para;<br>State’s discrimination is based on its desire to prevent the&para;<br>information from being used for constitutionally protected&para;<br>purposes, [i]t must assume the burden of justifying its&para;<br>conduct”). Vermont’s law imposes a content- and speaker&para;<br>based burden on respondents’ own speech. That consid&para;<br>eration provides a separate basis for distinguishing United&para;<br>Reporting and requires heightened judicial scrutiny.&para;<br>The State also contends that heightened judicial scru&para;<br>tiny is unwarranted in this case because sales, transfer,&para;<br>and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct,&para;<br>not speech. Consistent with that submission, the United&para;<br>States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has charac&para;<br>terized prescriber-identifying information as a mere “com&para;<br>modity” with no greater entitlement to First Amendment protection than “beef jerky.” Ayotte, 550 F. 3d, at&para;<br>52–53. In contrast the courts below concluded that a&para;<br>prohibition on the sale of prescriber-identifying informa&para;<br>tion is a content-based rule akin to a ban on the sale of&para;<br>cookbooks, laboratory results, or train schedules. See 630&para;<br>F. 3d, at 271–272 (“The First Amendment protects even&para;<br>dry information, devoid of advocacy, political relevance, or&para;<br>artistic expression” (internal quotation marks and altera&para;<br>tion omitted)); 631 F. Supp. 2d, at 445 (“A restriction on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>disclosure is a regulation of speech, and the ‘sale’ of [in&para;<br>formation] is simply disclosure for profit”).&para;<br>This Court has held that the creation and dissemination&para;<br>of information are speech within the meaning of the First&para;<br>Amendment. See, e.g., Bartnicki, supra, at 527 (“[I]f the&para;<br>acts of ‘disclosing’ and ‘publishing’ information do not&para;<br>constitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall&para;<br>within that category, as distinct from the category of&para;<br>expressive conduct” (some internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted)); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 481&para;<br>(1995) (“information on beer labels” is speech); Dun &amp;&para;<br>Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749,&para;<br>759 (1985) (plurality opinion) (credit report is “speech”).&para;<br>Facts, after all, are the beginning point for much of the&para;<br>speech that is most essential to advance human knowl&para;<br>edge and to conduct human affairs. There is thus a&para;<br>strong argument that prescriber-identifying information is&para;<br>speech for First Amendment purposes.&para;<br>The State asks for an exception to the rule that informa&para;<br>tion is speech, but there is no need to consider that re&para;<br>quest in this case. The State has imposed content- and&para;<br>speaker-based restrictions on the availability and use of&para;<br>prescriber-identifying information. So long as they do not&para;<br>engage in marketing, many speakers can obtain and use&para;<br>the information. But detailers cannot. Vermont’s statute&para;<br>could be compared with a law prohibiting trade magazines&para;<br>from purchasing or using ink. Cf. Minneapolis Star, 460&para;<br>U. S. 575. Like that hypothetical law, §4631(d) imposes a&para;<br>speaker- and content-based burden on protected expres&para;<br>sion, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applica&para;<br>tion of heightened scrutiny. As a consequence, this case&para;<br>can be resolved even assuming, as the State argues, that&para;<br>prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In the ordinary case it is all but dispositive to conclude&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that a law is content-based and, in practice, viewpoint&para;<br>discriminatory. See R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382 (“Content&para;<br>based regulations are presumptively invalid”); id., at 391–&para;<br>392. The State argues that a different analysis applies&para;<br>here because, assuming §4631(d) burdens speech at all, it&para;<br>at most burdens only commercial speech. As in previous&para;<br>cases, however, the outcome is the same whether a special&para;<br>commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial&para;<br>scrutiny is applied. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Broad&para;<br>casting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 184&para;<br>(1999). For the same reason there is no need to determine&para;<br>whether all speech hampered by §4631(d) is commercial,&para;<br>as our cases have used that term. Cf. Board of Trustees&para;<br>of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 474 (1989)&para;<br>(discussing whether “pure speech and commercial speech”&para;<br>were inextricably intertwined, so that “the entirety must&para;<br>. . . be classified as noncommercial”).&para;<br>Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the State’s&para;<br>burden to justify its content-based law as consistent with&para;<br>the First Amendment. Thompson v. Western States Medi&para;<br>cal Center, 535 U. S. 357, 373 (2002). To sustain the&para;<br>targeted, content-based burden §4631(d) imposes on pro&para;<br>tected expression, the State must show at least that the&para;<br>statute directly advances a substantial governmental in&para;<br>terest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that&para;<br>interest. See Fox, supra, at 480–481; Central Hudson Gas&para;<br>&amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S.&para;<br>557, 566 (1980). There must be a “fit between the legisla&para;<br>ture’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those&para;<br>ends.” Fox, supra, at 480 (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted). As in other contexts, these standards ensure not only&para;<br>that the State’s interests are proportional to the resulting burdens placed on speech but also that the law does&para;<br>not seek to suppress a disfavored message. See Turner&para;<br>Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 662–663.&para;<br>The State’s asserted justifications for §4631(d) come&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>under two general headings. First, the State contends&para;<br>that its law is necessary to protect medical privacy, includ&para;<br>ing physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment,&para;<br>and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Sec&para;<br>ond, the State argues that §4631(d) is integral to the&para;<br>achievement of policy objectives—namely, improved public&para;<br>health and reduced healthcare costs. Neither justification&para;<br>withstands scrutiny.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Vermont argues that its physicians have a “reasonable&para;<br>expectation” that their prescriber-identifying information&para;<br>“will not be used for purposes other than . . . filling and&para;<br>processing” prescriptions. See 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,&para;<br>§1(29). It may be assumed that, for many reasons, physi&para;<br>cians have an interest in keeping their prescription deci&para;<br>sions confidential. But §4631(d) is not drawn to serve that&para;<br>interest. Under Vermont’s law, pharmacies may share&para;<br>prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any rea&para;<br>son save one: They must not allow the information to&para;<br>be used for marketing. Exceptions further allow pharma&para;<br>cies to sell prescriber-identifying information for certain&para;<br>purposes, including “health care research.” §4631(e). And&para;<br>the measure permits insurers, researchers, journalists,&para;<br>the State itself, and others to use the information. See&para;<br>§4631(d); cf. App. 370–372; id., at 211. All but conceding&para;<br>that §4631(d) does not in itself advance confidentiality&para;<br>interests, the State suggests that other laws might impose&para;<br>separate bars on the disclosure of prescriber-identifying&para;<br>information. See Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 20.1.&para;<br>But the potential effectiveness of other measures cannot&para;<br>justify the distinctive set of prohibitions and sanctions&para;<br>imposed by §4631(d).&para;<br>Perhaps the State could have addressed physician confi&para;<br>dentiality through “a more coherent policy.” Greater New&para;<br>Orleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195; see also Discovery&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Network, 507 U. S., at 428. For instance, the State might&para;<br>have advanced its asserted privacy interest by allowing&para;<br>the information’s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow&para;<br>and well-justified circumstances. See, e.g., Health In&para;<br>surance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1320d–2; 45 CFR pts. 160 and 164 (2010). A&para;<br>statute of that type would present quite a different case&para;<br>than the one presented here. But the State did not enact&para;<br>a statute with that purpose or design. Instead, Vermont&para;<br>made prescriber-identifying information available to an&para;<br>almost limitless audience. The explicit structure of the&para;<br>statute allows the information to be studied and used by&para;<br>all but a narrow class of disfavored speakers. Given the&para;<br>information’s widespread availability and many permissi&para;<br>ble uses, the State’s asserted interest in physician confi&para;<br>dentiality does not justify the burden that §4631(d) places&para;<br>on protected expression.&para;<br>The State points out that it allows doctors to forgo the&para;<br>advantages of §4631(d) by consenting to the sale, disclo&para;<br>sure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.&para;<br>See §4631(c)(1). It is true that private decisionmaking can&para;<br>avoid governmental partiality and thus insulate privacy&para;<br>measures from First Amendment challenge. See Rowan v.&para;<br>Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728 (1970); cf. Bolger v. Youngs&para;<br>Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 72 (1983). But that&para;<br>principle is inapposite here. Vermont has given its doctors&para;<br>a contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow your&para;<br>prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and&para;<br>used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will&para;<br>allow your information to be used by those speakers whose&para;<br>message the State supports. Section 4631(d) may offer a&para;<br>limited degree of privacy, but only on terms favorable to&para;<br>the speech the State prefers. Cf. Rowan, supra, at 734,&para;<br>737, 739, n. 6 (sustaining a law that allowed private par&para;<br>ties to make “unfettered,” “unlimited,” and “unreviewable”&para;<br>choices regarding their own privacy). This is not to say&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that all privacy measures must avoid content-based rules.&para;<br>Here, however, the State has conditioned privacy on ac&para;<br>ceptance of a content-based rule that is not drawn to serve&para;<br>the State’s asserted interest. To obtain the limited privacy&para;<br>allowed by §4631(d), Vermont physicians are forced to&para;<br>acquiesce in the State’s goal of burdening disfavored&para;<br>speech by disfavored speakers.&para;<br>Respondents suggest that a further defect of §4631(d)&para;<br>lies in its presumption of applicability absent a physician’s&para;<br>election to the contrary. Vermont’s law might burden less&para;<br>speech if it came into operation only after an individual&para;<br>choice, but a revision to that effect would not necessarily&para;<br>save §4631(d). Even reliance on a prior election would not&para;<br>suffice, for instance, if available categories of coverage by&para;<br>design favored speakers of one political persuasion over&para;<br>another. Rules that burden protected expression may not&para;<br>be sustained when the options provided by the State are&para;<br>too narrow to advance legitimate interests or too broad to&para;<br>protect speech. As already explained, §4631(d) permits&para;<br>extensive use of prescriber-identifying information and so&para;<br>does not advance the State’s asserted interest in physician&para;<br>confidentiality. The limited range of available privacy&para;<br>options instead reflects the State’s impermissible purpose&para;<br>to burden disfavored speech. Vermont’s argument accord&para;<br>ingly fails, even if the availability and scope of private&para;<br>election might be relevant in other contexts, as when the&para;<br>statute’s design is unrelated to any purpose to advance a&para;<br>preferred message.&para;<br>The State also contends that §4631(d) protects doctors&para;<br>from “harassing sales behaviors.” 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,&para;<br>§1(28). “Some doctors in Vermont are experiencing an&para;<br>undesired increase in the aggressiveness of pharmaceuti&para;<br>cal sales representatives,” the Vermont Legislature found,&para;<br>“and a few have reported that they felt coerced and har&para;<br>assed.” §1(20). It is doubtful that concern for “a few”&para;<br>physicians who may have “felt coerced and harassed” by&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pharmaceutical marketers can sustain a broad content&para;<br>based rule like §4631(d). Many are those who must en&para;<br>dure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of&para;<br>freedom. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,&para;<br>210–211 (1975); Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21&para;<br>(1971). In any event the State offers no explanation why&para;<br>remedies other than content-based rules would be inade&para;<br>quate. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.&para;<br>484, 503 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.). Physicians can,&para;<br>and often do, simply decline to meet with detailers, includ&para;<br>ing detailers who use prescriber-identifying information.&para;<br>See, e.g., App. 180, 333–334. Doctors who wish to forgo&para;<br>detailing altogether are free to give “No Solicitation” or&para;<br>“No Detailing” instructions to their office managers or to&para;<br>receptionists at their places of work. Personal privacy&para;<br>even in one’s own home receives “ample protection” from&para;<br>the “resident’s unquestioned right to refuse to engage in&para;<br>conversation with unwelcome visitors.” Watchtower Bible&para;<br>&amp; Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S.&para;<br>150, 168 (2002); see also Bolger, supra, at 72. A physi&para;<br>cian’s office is no more private and is entitled to no greater&para;<br>protection.&para;<br>Vermont argues that detailers’ use of prescriber&para;<br>identifying information undermines the doctor-patient&para;<br>relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment&para;<br>decisions. According to the State, “unwanted pressure&para;<br>occurs” when doctors learn that their prescription deci&para;<br>sions are being “monitored” by detailers. 2007 Vt. Laws&para;<br>No. 80, §1(27). Some physicians accuse detailers of “spy&para;<br>ing” or of engaging in “underhanded” conduct in order to&para;<br>“subvert” prescription decisions. App. 336, 380, 407–408;&para;<br>see also id., at 326–328. And Vermont claims that detail&para;<br>ing makes people “anxious” about whether doctors have&para;<br>their patients’ best interests at heart. Id., at 327. But the&para;<br>State does not explain why detailers’ use of prescriber&para;<br>identifying information is more likely to prompt these&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>objections than many other uses permitted by §4631(d).&para;<br>In any event, this asserted interest is contrary to basic&para;<br>First Amendment principles. Speech remains protected&para;<br>even when it may “stir people to action,” “move them to&para;<br>tears,” or “inflict great pain.” Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). The more benign and,&para;<br>many would say, beneficial speech of pharmaceutical&para;<br>marketing is also entitled to the protection of the First&para;<br>Amendment. If pharmaceutical marketing affects treat&para;<br>ment decisions, it does so because doctors find it persua&para;<br>sive. Absent circumstances far from those presented here,&para;<br>the fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful&para;<br>basis for quieting it. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,&para;<br>447 (1969) (per curiam).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The State contends that §4631(d) advances important public policy goals by lowering the costs of medical&para;<br>services and promoting public health. If prescriber&para;<br>identifying information were available for use by detailers,&para;<br>the State contends, then detailing would be effective in&para;<br>promoting brand-name drugs that are more expensive and&para;<br>less safe than generic alternatives. This logic is set out at&para;<br>length in the legislative findings accompanying §4631(d).&para;<br>Yet at oral argument here, the State declined to acknowl&para;<br>edge that §4631(d)’s objective purpose and practical effect&para;<br>were to inhibit detailing and alter doctors’ prescription&para;<br>decisions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6. The State’s reluctance&para;<br>to embrace its own legislature’s rationale reflects the&para;<br>vulnerability of its position.&para;<br>While Vermont’s stated policy goals may be proper,&para;<br>§4631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way. As&para;<br>the Court of Appeals noted, the “state’s own explanation of&para;<br>how” §4631(d) “advances its interests cannot be said to be&para;<br>direct.” 630 F. 3d, at 277. The State seeks to achieve its&para;<br>policy objectives through the indirect means of restraining&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>certain speech by certain speakers—that is, by diminish&para;<br>ing detailers’ ability to influence prescription decisions.&para;<br>Those who seek to censor or burden free expression often&para;<br>assert that disfavored speech has adverse effects. But the&para;<br>“fear that people would make bad decisions if given truth&para;<br>ful information” cannot justify content-based burdens on&para;<br>speech. Thompson, 535 U. S., at 374; see also Virginia Bd.&para;<br>of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,&para;<br>425 U. S. 748, 769–770 (1976). “The First Amendment&para;<br>directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that&para;<br>seek to keep people in the dark for what the government&para;<br>perceives to be their own good.” 44 Liquormart, supra, at&para;<br>503 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also Linmark Associates,&para;<br>Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 97 (1977). These pre&para;<br>cepts apply with full force when the audience, in this&para;<br>case prescribing physicians, consists of “sophisticated and&para;<br>experienced” consumers. Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 775.&para;<br>As Vermont’s legislative findings acknowledge, the premise of §4631(d) is that the force of speech can justify&para;<br>the government’s attempts to stifle it. Indeed the State&para;<br>defends the law by insisting that “pharmaceutical market&para;<br>ing has a strong influence on doctors’ prescribing prac&para;<br>tices.” Brief for Petitioners 49–50. This reasoning is&para;<br>incompatible with the First Amendment. In an attempt to&para;<br>reverse a disfavored trend in public opinion, a State could&para;<br>not ban campaigning with slogans, picketing with signs, or&para;<br>marching during the daytime. Likewise the State may not&para;<br>seek to remove a popular but disfavored product from the&para;<br>marketplace by prohibiting truthful, nonmisleading adver&para;<br>tisements that contain impressive endorsements or catchy&para;<br>jingles. That the State finds expression too persuasive&para;<br>does not permit it to quiet the speech or to burden its&para;<br>messengers.&para;<br>The defect in Vermont’s law is made clear by the fact&para;<br>that many listeners find detailing instructive. Indeed the&para;<br>record demonstrates that some Vermont doctors view&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>targeted detailing based on prescriber-identifying infor&para;<br>mation as “very helpful” because it allows detailers to&para;<br>shape their messages to each doctor’s practice. App. 274;&para;<br>see also id., at 181, 218, 271–272. Even the United States,&para;<br>which appeared here in support of Vermont, took care to&para;<br>dispute the State’s “unwarranted view that the dangers&para;<br>of [n]ew drugs outweigh their benefits to patients.” Brief&para;<br>for United States as Amicus Curiae 24, n. 4. There are di&para;<br>vergent views regarding detailing and the prescription&para;<br>of brand-name drugs. Under the Constitution, resolution of&para;<br>that debate must result from free and uninhibited speech.&para;<br>As one Vermont physician put it: “We have a saying in&para;<br>medicine, information is power. And the more you know,&para;<br>or anyone knows, the better decisions can be made.” App.&para;<br>279. There are similar sayings in law, including that&para;<br>“information is not in itself harmful, that people will&para;<br>perceive their own best interests if only they are well&para;<br>enough informed, and that the best means to that end is&para;<br>to open the channels of communication rather than to&para;<br>close them.” Virginia Bd., 425 U. S., at 770. The choice&para;<br>“between the dangers of suppressing information, and the&para;<br>dangers of its misuse if it is freely available” is one that&para;<br>“the First Amendment makes for us.” Ibid.&para;<br>Vermont may be displeased that detailers who use&para;<br>prescriber-identifying information are effective in promot&para;<br>ing brand-name drugs. The State can express that view&para;<br>through its own speech. See Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97; cf.&para;<br>§4622(a)(1) (establishing a prescription drug educational&para;<br>program). But a State’s failure to persuade does not allow&para;<br>it to hamstring the opposition. The State may not burden&para;<br>the speech of others in order to tilt public debate in a&para;<br>preferred direction. “The commercial marketplace, like&para;<br>other spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a&para;<br>forum where ideas and information flourish. Some of the&para;<br>ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth. But&para;<br>the general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the government, assess the value of the information pre&para;<br>sented.” Edenfield, supra, at 767.&para;<br>It is true that content-based restrictions on protected&para;<br>expression are sometimes permissible, and that principle&para;<br>applies to commercial speech. Indeed the government’s&para;<br>legitimate interest in protecting consumers from “commer&para;<br>cial harms” explains “why commercial speech can be sub&para;<br>ject to greater governmental regulation than noncommer&para;<br>cial speech.” Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 426; see also&para;<br>44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., 502 (opinion of Stevens, J.). The&para;<br>Court has noted, for example, that “a State may choose to&para;<br>regulate price advertising in one industry but not in oth&para;<br>ers, because the risk of fraud . . . is in its view greater&para;<br>there.” R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 388–389 (citing Virginia Bd.,&para;<br>supra, at 771–772). Here, however, Vermont has not&para;<br>shown that its law has a neutral justification.&para;<br>The State nowhere contends that detailing is false or&para;<br>misleading within the meaning of this Court’s First&para;<br>Amendment precedents. See Thompson, 535 U. S., at 373.&para;<br>Nor does the State argue that the provision challenged&para;<br>here will prevent false or misleading speech. Cf. post, at&para;<br>10–11 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (collecting regulations that&para;<br>the government might defend on this ground). The State’s&para;<br>interest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turns&para;<br>on nothing more than a difference of opinion. See Bolger,&para;<br>463 U. S., at 69; Thompson, supra, at 376.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The capacity of technology to find and publish personal&para;<br>information, including records required by the govern&para;<br>ment, presents serious and unresolved issues with respect&para;<br>to personal privacy and the dignity it seeks to secure. In&para;<br>considering how to protect those interests, however, the&para;<br>State cannot engage in content-based discrimination to&para;<br>advance its own side of a debate.&para;<br>If Vermont’s statute provided that prescriber-identifying&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>information could not be sold or disclosed except in narrow&para;<br>circumstances then the State might have a stronger posi&para;<br>tion. Here, however, the State gives possessors of the&para;<br>information broad discretion and wide latitude in disclos&para;<br>ing the information, while at the same time restricting&para;<br>the information’s use by some speakers and for some pur&para;<br>poses, even while the State itself can use the information&para;<br>to counter the speech it seeks to suppress. Privacy is a&para;<br>concept too integral to the person and a right too essential&para;<br>to freedom to allow its manipulation to support just those&para;<br>ideas the government prefers.&para;<br>When it enacted §4631(d), the Vermont Legislature&para;<br>found that the “marketplace for ideas on medicine safety&para;<br>and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that brand&para;<br>name companies invest in expensive pharmaceutical mar&para;<br>keting campaigns to doctors.” 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,&para;<br>§1(4). “The goals of marketing programs,” the legislature&para;<br>said, “are often in conflict with the goals of the state.”&para;<br>§1(3). The text of §4631(d), associated legislative findings,&para;<br>and the record developed in the District Court establish&para;<br>that Vermont enacted its law for this end. The State has&para;<br>burdened a form of protected expression that it found too&para;<br>persuasive. At the same time, the State has left unbur&para;<br>dened those speakers whose messages are in accord with&para;<br>its own views.

It deprives pharmaceutical&para;<br>and data-mining companies of data, collected pursuant to&para;<br>the government’s regulatory mandate, that could help&para;<br>pharmaceutical companies create better sales messages.&para;<br>In my view, this effect on expression is inextricably related&para;<br>to a lawful governmental effort to regulate a commercial&para;<br>enterprise. The First Amendment does not require courts&para;<br>to apply a special “heightened” standard of review when&para;<br>reviewing such an effort. And, in any event, the statute&para;<br>meets the First Amendment standard this Court has&para;<br>previously applied when the government seeks to regulate&para;<br>commercial speech. For any or all of these reasons, the&para;<br>Court should uphold the statute as constitutional.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Vermont statute before us says pharmacies and&para;<br>certain other entities&para;<br>“shall not [1] sell . . . regulated records containing&para;<br>prescriber-identifiable information, nor [2] permit the&para;<br>use of [such] records . . . for marketing or promoting a&para;<br>prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents.” Vt.&para;<br>Stat.

In Part IV, I shall explain why the&para;<br>third prohibition makes no difference to the result.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., 521&para;<br>U. S. 457 (1997), this Court considered the First Amend&para;<br>ment’s application to federal agricultural commodity mar&para;<br>keting regulations that required growers of fruit to&para;<br>make compulsory contributions to pay for collective adver&para;<br>tising. The Court reviewed the lawfulness of the regula&para;<br>tion’s negative impact on the growers’ freedom voluntarily&para;<br>to choose their own commercial messages “under the&para;<br>standard appropriate for the review of economic regula&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 469.&para;<br>In this case I would ask whether Vermont’s regulatory&para;<br>provisions work harm to First Amendment interests that&para;<br>is disproportionate to their furtherance of legitimate regu&para;<br>latory objectives. And in doing so, I would give significant&para;<br>weight to legitimate commercial regulatory objectives—as&para;<br>this Court did in Glickman. The far stricter, specially&para;<br>“heightened” First Amendment standards that the major&para;<br>ity would apply to this instance of commercial regulation&para;<br>are out of place here. Ante, at 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Because many, perhaps most, activities of human beings&para;<br>living together in communities take place through speech,&para;<br>and because speech-related risks and offsetting justifica&para;<br>tions differ depending upon context, this Court has distin&para;<br>guished for First Amendment purposes among different&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>contexts in which speech takes place. See, e.g., Snyder v.&para;<br>Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6).&para;<br>Thus, the First Amendment imposes tight constraints&para;<br>upon government efforts to restrict, e.g., “core” political&para;<br>speech, while imposing looser constraints when the gov&para;<br>ernment seeks to restrict, e.g., commercial speech, the&para;<br>speech of its own employees, or the regulation-related&para;<br>speech of a firm subject to a traditional regulatory pro&para;<br>gram. Compare Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988)&para;<br>(political speech), with Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.&para;<br>v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U.

FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969);&para;<br>see Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919)&para;<br>(Holmes, J., dissenting). Without such a marketplace, the&para;<br>public could not freely choose a government pledged to&para;<br>implement policies that reflect the people’s informed will.&para;<br>At the same time, our cases make clear that the First&para;<br>Amendment offers considerably less protection to the&para;<br>maintenance of a free marketplace for goods and services.&para;<br>See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 623&para;<br>(1995) (“We have always been careful to distinguish com&para;<br>mercial speech from speech at the First Amendment’s&para;<br>core”). And they also reflect the democratic importance of&para;<br>permitting an elected government to implement through&para;<br>effective programs policy choices for which the people’s&para;<br>elected representatives have voted.&para;<br>Thus this Court has recognized that commercial speech&para;<br>including advertising has an “informational function” and&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v.

S. 809,&para;<br>826 (1975). But at the same time it has applied a less&para;<br>than strict, “intermediate” First Amendment test when&para;<br>the government directly restricts commercial speech.&para;<br>Under that test, government laws and regulations may&para;<br>significantly restrict speech, as long as they also “directly&para;<br>advance” a “substantial” government interest that could&para;<br>not “be served as well by a more limited restriction.”&para;<br>Central Hudson, supra, at 564. Moreover, the Court has&para;<br>found that “sales practices” that are “misleading, decep&para;<br>tive, or aggressive” lack the protection of even this “inter&para;<br>mediate” standard. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,&para;<br>772 (1976). And the Court has emphasized the need, in&para;<br>applying an “intermediate” test, to maintain the&para;<br>“ ‘commonsense’ distinction between speech proposing&para;<br>a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area&para;<br>traditionally subject to government regulation, and&para;<br>other varieties of speech.” Ohralik v.

In doing so, the&para;<br>Court has taken account of the need in this area of law to&para;<br>defer significantly to legislative judgment—as the Court&para;<br>has done in cases involving the Commerce Clause or the&para;<br>Due Process Clause.

S., at 589.&para;<br>B&para;<br>There are several reasons why the Court should review&para;<br>Vermont’s law “under the standard appropriate for the&para;<br>review of economic regulation,” not “under a heightened&para;<br>standard appropriate for the review of First Amendment&para;<br>issues.” Glickman, 521 U. S., at 469. For one thing, Ver&para;<br>mont’s statute neither forbids nor requires anyone to say&para;<br>anything, to engage in any form of symbolic speech, or to&para;<br>endorse any particular point of view, whether ideological&para;<br>or related to the sale of a product. Cf. id., at 469–470.&para;<br>(And I here assume that Central Hudson might otherwise&para;<br>apply. See Part III, infra.)&para;<br>For another thing, the same First Amendment stan&para;<br>dards that apply to Vermont here would apply to similar&para;<br>regulatory actions taken by other States or by the Federal&para;<br>Government acting, for example, through Food and Drug&para;<br>Administration (FDA) regulation. (And the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment’s ability to pre-empt state laws that interfere&para;<br>with existing or contemplated federal forms of regulation&para;<br>is here irrelevant.)&para;<br>Further, the statute’s requirements form part of a tra&para;<br>ditional, comprehensive regulatory regime. Cf. United&para;<br>Foods, supra, at 411. The pharmaceutical drug industry&para;<br>has been heavily regulated at least since 1906. See Pure&para;<br>Food and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768. Longstanding statutes&para;<br>and regulations require pharmaceutical companies to&para;<br>engage in complex drug testing to ensure that their drugs&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>are both “safe” and “effective.” 21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1),&para;<br>355(d). Only then can the drugs be marketed, at which&para;<br>point drug companies are subject to the FDA’s exhaustive&para;<br>regulation of the content of drug labels and the manner in&para;<br>which drugs can be advertised and sold. §352(f)(2); 21&para;<br>CFR pts. 201–203 (2010).&para;<br>Finally, Vermont’s statute is directed toward informa&para;<br>tion that exists only by virtue of government regulation.&para;<br>Under federal law, certain drugs can be dispensed only by&para;<br>a pharmacist operating under the orders of a medical&para;<br>practitioner. 21 U. S. C. §353(b). Vermont regulates the&para;<br>qualifications, the fitness, and the practices of pharma&para;<br>cists themselves, and requires pharmacies to maintain a&para;<br>“patient record system” that, among other things, tracks&para;<br>who prescribed which drugs. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26,&para;<br>§§2041(a), 2022(14) (Supp. 2010); Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy&para;<br>Admin. Rules (Pharmacy Rules) 9.1, 9.24(e) (2009). But&para;<br>for these regulations, pharmacies would have no way to&para;<br>know who had told customers to buy which drugs (as is&para;<br>the case when a doctor tells a patient to take a daily dose&para;<br>of aspirin).&para;<br>Regulators will often find it necessary to create tailored&para;<br>restrictions on the use of information subject to their&para;<br>regulatory jurisdiction. A car dealership that obtains&para;<br>credit scores for customers who want car loans can be&para;<br>prohibited from using credit data to search for new cus&para;<br>tomers. See 15 U. S. C. §1681b (2006 ed. and Supp. III);&para;<br>cf. Trans Union Corp. v. FTC, 245 F. 3d 809, reh’g denied,&para;<br>267 F. 3d 1138 (CADC 2001). Medical specialists who&para;<br>obtain medical records for their existing patients cannot&para;<br>purchase those records in order to identify new patients.&para;<br>See 45 CFR §164.508(a)(3) (2010). Or, speaking hypo&para;<br>thetically, a public utilities commission that directs local&para;<br>gas distributors to gather usage information for individual&para;<br>customers might permit the distributors to share the data&para;<br>with researchers (trying to lower energy costs) but forbid&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sales of the data to appliance manufacturers seeking to&para;<br>sell gas stoves.&para;<br>Such regulatory actions are subject to judicial review,&para;<br>e.g., for compliance with applicable statutes. And they&para;<br>would normally be subject to review under the Adminis&para;<br>trative Procedure Act to make certain they are not “arbi&para;<br>trary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§706(2)(A) (2006 ed.). In an appropriate case, such review&para;<br>might be informed by First Amendment considerations.&para;<br>But regulatory actions of the kind present here have not&para;<br>previously been thought to raise serious additional consti&para;<br>tutional concerns under the First Amendment. But cf.&para;<br>Trans Union LLC v. FTC, 536 U. S. 915 (2002) (KENNEDY,&para;<br>J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (questioning ban&para;<br>on use of consumer credit reports for target marketing).&para;<br>The ease with which one can point to actual or hypothet&para;<br>ical examples with potentially adverse speech-related&para;<br>effects at least roughly comparable to those at issue here&para;<br>indicates the danger of applying a “heightened” or “inter&para;<br>mediate” standard of First Amendment review where&para;<br>typical regulatory actions affect commercial speech (say,&para;<br>by withholding information that a commercial speaker&para;<br>might use to shape the content of a message).&para;<br>Thus, it is not surprising that, until today, this Court&para;<br>has never found that the First Amendment prohibits the&para;<br>government from restricting the use of information gath&para;<br>ered pursuant to a regulatory mandate—whether the&para;<br>information rests in government files or has remained in&para;<br>the hands of the private firms that gathered it. But cf.&para;<br>ante, at 11–14. Nor has this Court ever previously applied&para;<br>any form of “heightened” scrutiny in any even roughly&para;<br>similar case. See Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Re&para;<br>porting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32 (1999) (no height&para;<br>ened scrutiny); compare Cincinnati v. Discovery Network,&para;<br>Inc., 507 U.

It&para;<br>adds that “[c]ommercial speech is no exception.” Ante,&para;<br>at 10–11. And the Court then emphasizes that this is a&para;<br>case involving both “content-based” and “speaker-based”&para;<br>restrictions. See ante, at 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22,&para;<br>24.&para;<br>But neither of these categories—“content-based” nor&para;<br>“speaker-based”—has ever before justified greater scrutiny&para;<br>when regulatory activity affects commercial speech. See,&para;<br>e.g., Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 333 F. Supp.&para;<br>582 (DC 1971) (three-judge court), summarily aff’d&para;<br>sub nom. Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Acting Attorney&para;<br>General, 405 U. S. 1000 (1972) (upholding ban on radio&para;<br>and television marketing of tobacco). And the absence of&para;<br>any such precedent is understandable.&para;<br>Regulatory programs necessarily draw distinctions on&para;<br>the basis of content. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S.,&para;<br>at 761, 762 (“If there is a kind of commercial speech that&para;<br>lacks all First Amendment protection, . . . it must be dis&para;<br>tinguished by its content”). Electricity regulators, for&para;<br>example, oversee company statements, pronouncements,&para;<br>and proposals, but only about electricity. See, e.g., Vt.&para;<br>Pub. Serv. Bd. Rules 3.100 (1983), 4.200 (1986), 5.200&para;<br>(2004). The Federal Reserve Board regulates the content&para;<br>of statements, advertising, loan proposals, and interest&para;<br>rate disclosures, but only when made by financial institu&para;<br>tions. See 12 CFR pts. 226, 230 (2011). And the FDA&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>oversees the form and content of labeling, advertising, and&para;<br>sales proposals of drugs, but not of furniture. See 21 CFR&para;<br>pts. 201–203. Given the ubiquity of content-based regula&para;<br>tory categories, why should the “content-based” nature of&para;<br>typical regulation require courts (other things being equal)&para;<br>to grant legislators and regulators less deference? Cf.&para;<br>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.&para;<br>469, 481 (1989) (courts, in First Amendment area, should&para;<br>“provide the Legislative and Executive Branches needed&para;<br>leeway” when regulated industries are at issue).&para;<br>Nor, in the context of a regulatory program, is it un&para;<br>usual for particular rules to be “speaker-based,” affecting&para;<br>only a class of entities, namely, the regulated firms. An&para;<br>energy regulator, for example, might require the manu&para;<br>facturers of home appliances to publicize ways to reduce&para;<br>energy consumption, while exempting producers of indus&para;<br>trial equipment. See, e.g., 16 CFR pt. 305 (2011) (prescrib&para;<br>ing labeling requirements for certain home appliances);&para;<br>Nev. Admin. Code §§704.804, 704.808 (2010) (requiring&para;<br>utilities to provide consumers with information on conser&para;<br>vation). Or a trade regulator might forbid a particular&para;<br>firm to make the true claim that its cosmetic product&para;<br>contains “cleansing grains that scrub away dirt and ex&para;<br>cess oil” unless it substantiates that claim with detailed&para;<br>backup testing, even though opponents of cosmetics use&para;<br>need not substantiate their claims. Morris, F. T. C. Or&para;<br>ders Data to Back Ad Claims, N. Y. Times, Nov. 3, 1973,&para;<br>p. 32; Boys’ Life, Oct. 1973, p. 64; see 36 Fed. Reg. 12058&para;<br>(1971). Or the FDA might control in detail just what a&para;<br>pharmaceutical firm can, and cannot, tell potential pur&para;<br>chasers about its products. Such a firm, for example,&para;<br>could not suggest to a potential purchaser (say, a doctor)&para;<br>that he or she might put a pharmaceutical drug to an “off&para;<br>label” use, even if the manufacturer, in good faith and&para;<br>with considerable evidence, believes the drug will help.&para;<br>All the while, a third party (say, a researcher) is free to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tell the doctor not to use the drug for that purpose. See 21&para;<br>CFR pt. 99; cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm.,&para;<br>531 U. S. 341, 350–351 (2001) (discussing effect of similar&para;<br>regulations in respect to medical devices); see also Pro&para;<br>posed Rule, Revised Effectiveness Determination; Sun&para;<br>screen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,&para;<br>76 Fed. Reg. 35672 (2011) (proposing to prohibit market&para;<br>ing of sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) of&para;<br>greater than 50 due to insufficient data “to indicate that&para;<br>there is additional clinical benefit”).&para;<br>If the Court means to create constitutional barriers to&para;<br>regulatory rules that might affect the content of a com&para;<br>mercial message, it has embarked upon an unprecedented&para;<br>task—a task that threatens significant judicial interfer&para;<br>ence with widely accepted regulatory activity. Cf., e.g., 21&para;<br>CFR pts. 201–203. Nor would it ease the task to limit its&para;<br>“heightened” scrutiny to regulations that only affect cer&para;<br>tain speakers. As the examples that I have set forth&para;<br>illustrate, many regulations affect only messages sent by a&para;<br>small class of regulated speakers, for example, electricity&para;<br>generators or natural gas pipelines.&para;<br>The Court also uses the words “aimed” and “targeted”&para;<br>when describing the relation of the statute to drug manu&para;<br>facturers. Ante, at 8, 9, 12, 16. But, for the reasons just&para;<br>set forth, to require “heightened” scrutiny on this basis is&para;<br>to require its application early and often when the State&para;<br>seeks to regulate industry. Any statutory initiative stems&para;<br>from a legislative agenda. See, e.g., Message to Congress,&para;<br>May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4&para;<br>(request from President Franklin Roosevelt for legislation&para;<br>to ease the plight of factory workers). Any administrative&para;<br>initiative stems from a regulatory agenda. See, e.g., Exec.&para;<br>Order No. 12866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (1993) (specifying&para;<br>how to identify regulatory priorities and requiring agen&para;<br>cies to prepare agendas). The related statutes, regula&para;<br>tions, programs, and initiatives almost always reflect a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>point of view, for example, of the Congress and the ad&para;<br>ministration that enacted them and ultimately the voters.&para;<br>And they often aim at, and target, particular firms that&para;<br>engage in practices about the merits of which the Gov&para;<br>ernment and the firms may disagree. Section 2 of the&para;<br>Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §2, for example, which limits the&para;<br>truthful, nonmisleading speech of firms that, due to their&para;<br>market power, can affect the competitive landscape, is&para;<br>directly aimed at, and targeted at, monopolists.&para;<br>In short, the case law in this area reflects the need to&para;<br>ensure that the First Amendment protects the “market&para;<br>place of ideas,” thereby facilitating the democratic creation&para;<br>of sound government policies without improperly hamper&para;<br>ing the ability of government to introduce an agenda, to&para;<br>implement its policies, and to favor them to the exclusion&para;<br>of contrary policies. To apply “heightened” scrutiny when&para;<br>the regulation of commercial activities (which often in&para;<br>volve speech) is at issue is unnecessarily to undercut the&para;<br>latter constitutional goal. The majority’s view of this case&para;<br>presents that risk.&para;<br>Moreover, given the sheer quantity of regulatory initia&para;<br>tives that touch upon commercial messages, the Court’s&para;<br>vision of its reviewing task threatens to return us to a&para;<br>happily bygone era when judges scrutinized legislation for&para;<br>its interference with economic liberty. History shows that&para;<br>the power was much abused and resulted in the constitu&para;<br>tionalization of economic theories preferred by individual&para;<br>jurists. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75–76&para;<br>(1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). By inviting courts to&para;<br>scrutinize whether a State’s legitimate regulatory inter&para;<br>ests can be achieved in less restrictive ways whenever&para;<br>they touch (even indirectly) upon commercial speech,&para;<br>today’s majority risks repeating the mistakes of the past&para;<br>in a manner not anticipated by our precedents. See Cen&para;<br>tral Hudson, 447 U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting);&para;<br>cf. Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Rowan &amp; Nichols Oil Co.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Whether Vermont’s regulatory&para;<br>statute “targets” drug companies (as opposed to affecting&para;<br>them unintentionally) must be beside the First Amendment&para;<br>point.&para;<br>This does not mean that economic regulation having&para;<br>some effect on speech is always lawful. Courts typically&para;<br>review the lawfulness of statutes for rationality and of&para;<br>regulations (if federal) to make certain they are not “arbi&para;<br>trary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§706(2)(A). And our valuable free-speech tradition may&para;<br>play an important role in such review. But courts do not&para;<br>normally view these matters as requiring “heightened”&para;<br>First Amendment scrutiny—and particularly not the un&para;<br>forgiving brand of “intermediate” scrutiny employed by&para;<br>the majority. Because the imposition of “heightened”&para;<br>scrutiny in such instances would significantly change the&para;<br>legislative/judicial balance, in a way that would signifi&para;<br>cantly weaken the legislature’s authority to regulate&para;<br>commerce and industry, I would not apply a “heightened”&para;<br>First Amendment standard of review in this case.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Turning to the constitutional merits, I believe Vermont’s&para;<br>statute survives application of Central Hudson’s “interme&para;<br>diate” commercial speech standard as well as any more&para;<br>limited “economic regulation” test.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The statute threatens only modest harm to commercial&para;<br>speech. I agree that it withholds from pharmaceutical&para;<br>companies information that would help those entities&para;<br>create a more effective selling message. But I cannot&para;<br>agree with the majority that the harm also involves unjus&para;<br>tified discrimination in that it permits “pharmacies” to&para;<br>“share prescriber-identifying information with anyone for&para;<br>any reason” (but marketing). Ante, at 17. Whatever the&para;<br>First Amendment relevance of such discrimination, there&para;<br>is no evidence that it exists in Vermont. The record con&para;<br>tains no evidence that prescriber-identifying data is&para;<br>widely disseminated. See App. 248, 255. Cf. Burson v.&para;<br>Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207 (1992) (plurality opinion)&para;<br>(“States adopt laws to address the problems that confront&para;<br>them. The First Amendment does not require States to&para;<br>regulate for problems that do not exist”); Bates v. State&para;<br>Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 380 (1977) (“[T]he justification&para;<br>for the application of overbreadth analysis applies weakly,&para;<br>if at all, in the ordinary commercial context”).&para;<br>The absence of any such evidence likely reflects the&para;<br>presence of other legal rules that forbid widespread&para;<br>release of prescriber-identifying information. Vermont’s&para;<br>Pharmacy Rules, for example, define “unprofessional&para;<br>conduct” to include “[d]ivulging or revealing to unauthor&para;<br>ized persons patient or practitioner information or the&para;<br>nature of professional pharmacy services rendered.” Rule&para;<br>20.1(i) (emphasis added); see also Reply Brief for Petition&para;<br>ers 21. The statute reinforces this prohibition where&para;<br>pharmaceutical marketing is at issue. And the exceptions&para;<br>that it creates are narrow and concern common and often&para;<br>essential uses of prescription data. See Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.&para;<br>18, §4631(e)(1) (pharmacy reimbursement, patient care&para;<br>management, health care research); §4631(e)(2) (drug&para;<br>dispensing); §4631(e)(3) (communications between pre&para;<br>scriber and pharmacy); §4631(e)(4) (information to pa&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Trans Union Corp., 245 F. 3d, at 819&para;<br>(rejecting an underinclusiveness challenge because an&para;<br>exception to the Fair Credit Reporting Act concerned&para;<br>“ ‘exactly the sort of thing the Act seeks to promote’ ” (quot&para;<br>ing Trans Union Corp. v.

The Court apparently means that the&para;<br>statute (1) prevents pharmaceutical companies from creat&para;<br>ing individualized messages that would help them sell&para;<br>their drugs more effectively, but (2) permits “counterde&para;<br>tailing” programs, which often promote generic drugs, to&para;<br>create such messages using prescriber-identifying data. I&para;<br>am willing to assume, for argument’s sake, that this con&para;<br>sequence would significantly increase the statute’s nega&para;<br>tive impact upon commercial speech. But cf. 21 CFR&para;<br>§§202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii) (FDA’s “fair balance” require&para;<br>ment); App. 193 (no similar FDA requirement for nondrug&para;<br>manufacturers). The record before us, however, contains&para;<br>no evidentiary basis for the conclusion that any such&para;<br>individualized counterdetailing is widespread, or exists at&para;<br>all, in Vermont.&para;<br>The majority points out, ante, at 4, that Act 80, of which&para;<br>§4631 was a part, also created an “evidence-based pre&para;<br>scription drug education program,” in which the Vermont&para;<br>Department of Health, the Department of Vermont Health&para;<br>Access, and the University of Vermont, among others,&para;<br>work together “to provide information and education on&para;<br>the therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescrip&para;<br>tion drugs” to health professionals responsible for pre&para;<br>scribing and dispensing prescription drugs, Vt. Stat. Ann.,&para;<br>Tit. 18, §4622(a)(1). See generally §§4621–4622. But that&para;<br>program does not make use of prescriber-identifying data.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v.

One witness explained that&para;<br>academic detailers in Pennsylvania work with state health&para;<br>officials to identify physicians serving patients whose&para;<br>health care is likewise state provided. App. 375. The&para;<br>other, an IMS Health officer, observed that Vermont has&para;<br>its own multipayer database containing prescriber&para;<br>identifying data, which could be used to talk to doctors&para;<br>about their prescription patterns and the lower costs&para;<br>associated with generics. Id., at 313. But nothing in the&para;<br>record indicates that any “counterdetailing” of this kind&para;<br>has ever taken place in fact in Vermont. State-sponsored&para;<br>health care professionals sometimes meet with small&para;<br>groups of doctors to discuss best practices and generic&para;<br>drugs generally.

Nothing in Vermont’s statute&para;<br>prohibits brand-name manufacturers from undertaking a&para;<br>similar effort.&para;<br>The upshot is that the only commercial-speech-related&para;<br>harm that the record shows this statute to have brought&para;<br>about is the one I have previously described: The with&para;<br>holding of information collected through a regulatory&para;<br>program, thereby preventing companies from shaping a&para;<br>commercial message they believe maximally effective. The&para;<br>absence of precedent suggesting that this kind of harm&para;<br>is serious reinforces the conclusion that the harm here is&para;<br>modest at most.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The fact that the Court normally exempts&para;<br>the regulation of “misleading” and “deceptive” information&para;<br>even from the rigors of its “intermediate” commercial&para;<br>speech scrutiny testifies to the importance of securing&para;<br>“unbiased information,” see 44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at&para;<br>501 (opinion of Stevens, J.); Central Hudson, supra, at&para;<br>563, as does the fact that the FDA sets forth as a federal&para;<br>regulatory goal the need to ensure a “fair balance” of&para;<br>information about marketed drugs, 21 CFR §§202.1(e)(1),&para;<br>202.1(e)(5)(ii). As major payers in the health care system,&para;<br>health care spending is also of crucial state interest. And&para;<br>this Court has affirmed the importance of maintaining&para;<br>“privacy” as an important public policy goal—even in&para;<br>respect to information already disclosed to the public for&para;<br>particular purposes (but not others). See Department of&para;<br>Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S.&para;<br>749, 762–771 (1989); see also Solove, A Taxonomy of Pri&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v.

S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 8–9)&para;<br>(discussing privacy interests in nondisclosure).&para;<br>At the same time, the record evidence is sufficient to&para;<br>permit a legislature to conclude that the statute “directly&para;<br>advances” each of these objectives. The statute helps to&para;<br>focus sales discussions on an individual drug’s safety,&para;<br>effectiveness, and cost, perhaps compared to other drugs&para;<br>(including generics). These drug-related facts have every&para;<br>thing to do with general information that drug manufac&para;<br>turers likely possess. They have little, if anything, to do&para;<br>with the name or prior prescription practices of the par&para;<br>ticular doctor to whom a detailer is speaking. Shaping a&para;<br>detailing message based on an individual doctor’s prior&para;<br>prescription habits may help sell more of a particular&para;<br>manufacturer’s particular drugs. But it does so by divert&para;<br>ing attention from scientific research about a drug’s safety&para;<br>and effectiveness, as well as its cost. This diversion comes&para;<br>at the expense of public health and the State’s fiscal&para;<br>interests.&para;<br>Vermont compiled a substantial legislative record to&para;<br>corroborate this line of reasoning. See Testimony of Sean&para;<br>Flynn (Apr. 11, 2007), App. in No. 09–1913–cv(L) etc.&para;<br>(CA2), p. A–1156 (hereinafter CA2 App.) (use of data&para;<br>mining helps drug companies “to cover up information&para;<br>that is not in the best of light of their drug and to high&para;<br>light information that makes them look good”); Volker &amp;&para;<br>Outterson, New Legislative Trends Threaten the Way&para;<br>Health Information Companies Operate, Pharmaceutical&para;<br>Pricing &amp; Reimbursement 2007, id., at A–4235 (one for&para;<br>mer detailer considered prescriber-identifying data the&para;<br>“ ‘greatest tool in planning our approach to manipulating&para;<br>doctors’ ” (quoting Whitney, Big (Brother) Pharma: How&para;<br>Drug Reps Know Which Doctors to Target, New Republic,&para;<br>Aug. 29, 2006, http://www.tnr.com/article/84056/health&para;<br>care-eli-lilly-pfizer-ama); Testimony of Paul Harrington&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

And it is the job of regulatory agencies and&para;<br>legislatures to make just these kinds of judgments. Ver&para;<br>mont’s attempts to ensure a “fair balance” of information&para;<br>is no different from the FDA’s similar requirement, see&para;<br>21 CFR §§202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii). No one has yet sug&para;<br>gested that substantial portions of federal drug regulation&para;<br>are unconstitutional. Why then should we treat Vermont’s&para;<br>law differently?&para;<br>The record also adequately supports the State’s privacy&para;<br>objective. Regulatory rules in Vermont make clear that&para;<br>the confidentiality of an individual doctor’s prescribing&para;<br>practices remains the norm. See, e.g., Pharmacy Rule&para;<br>8.7(c) (“Prescription and other patient health care infor&para;<br>mation shall be secure from access by the public, and the&para;<br>information shall be kept confidential”); Pharmacy Rule&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>20.1(i) (forbidding disclosure of patient or prescriber in&para;<br>formation to “unauthorized persons” without consent).&para;<br>Exceptions to this norm are comparatively few. See, e.g.,&para;<br>ibid. (identifying “authorized persons”); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.&para;<br>18, §4631(e); App. 248, 255 (indicating that prescriber&para;<br>identifying data is not widely disseminated). There is no&para;<br>indication that the State of Vermont, or others in the&para;<br>State, makes use of this information for counterdetailing&para;<br>efforts. See supra, at 15.&para;<br>Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the data miners&para;<br>who sell information to those manufacturers would like to&para;<br>create (and did create) an additional exception, which&para;<br>means additional circulation of otherwise largely confi&para;<br>dential information. Vermont’s statute closes that door.&para;<br>At the same time, the statute permits doctors who wish&para;<br>to permit use of their prescribing practices to do so.&para;<br>§§4631(c)–(d). For purposes of Central Hudson, this would&para;<br>seem sufficiently to show that the statute serves a mean&para;<br>ingful interest in increasing the protection given to pre&para;<br>scriber privacy. See Fox, 492 U. S., at 480 (in commercial&para;<br>speech area, First Amendment requires “a fit that is not&para;<br>necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not&para;<br>necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope&para;<br>is in proportion to the interest served” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)); see also United States v. Edge Broadcast&para;<br>ing Co., 509 U.

In any event, physi&para;<br>cians are unlikely to turn detailers away at the door, for&para;<br>those detailers, whether delivering a balanced or imbal&para;<br>anced message, are nonetheless providers of much useful&para;<br>information. See Manchanda &amp; Honka, The Effects and&para;<br>Role of Direct-to-Physician Marketing in the Pharmaceuti&para;<br>cal Industry: An Integrative Review, 5 Yale J. Health Pol’y&para;<br>L. &amp; Ethics 785, 793–797, 815–816 (2005); Ziegler, Lew, &amp;&para;<br>Singer, The Accuracy of Drug Information from Pharma&para;<br>ceutical Sales Representatives, 273 JAMA 1296 (1995).&para;<br>Forcing doctors to choose between targeted detailing and&para;<br>no detailing at all could therefore jeopardize the State’s&para;<br>interest in promoting public health.&para;<br>The majority also suggests that if the “statute provided&para;<br>that prescriber-identifying information could not be sold or&para;<br>disclosed except in narrow circumstances then the State&para;<br>might have a stronger position.” Ante, at 24–25; see also&para;<br>ante, at 17. But the disclosure-permitting exceptions here&para;<br>are quite narrow, and they serve useful, indeed essential&para;<br>purposes. See supra, at 14. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.&para;<br>18, §4631(e) with note following 42 U. S. C. §1320d–2, p.&para;<br>1190, and 45 CFR §164.512 (uses and disclosures not&para;<br>requiring consent under the Health Insurance Portability&para;<br>and Accountability Act of 1996). Regardless, this alterna&para;<br>tive is not “a more limited restriction,” Central Hudson,&para;<br>supra, at 564 (emphasis added), for it would impose a&para;<br>greater, not a lesser, burden upon the dissemination of&para;<br>information.&para;<br>Respondents’ alternatives are no more helpful. Respon&para;<br>dents suggest that “Vermont can simply inform physicians&para;<br>that pharmaceutical companies . . . use prescription his&para;<br>tory information to communicate with doctors.” Brief for&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers&para;<br>of America 48. But how would that help serve the State’s&para;<br>basic purposes? It would not create the “fair balance” of&para;<br>information in pharmaceutical marketing that the State,&para;<br>like the FDA, seeks. Cf. Reno v. American Civil Liberties&para;<br>Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997) (alternative must be “at&para;<br>least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that&para;<br>the statute was enacted to serve”). Respondents also&para;<br>suggest policies requiring use of generic drugs or educat&para;<br>ing doctors about their benefits. Brief for Respondent&para;<br>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America&para;<br>54–55. Such programs have been in effect for some time&para;<br>in Vermont or other States, without indication that they&para;<br>have prevented the imbalanced sales tactics at which&para;<br>Vermont’s statute takes aim. See, e.g., Written Statement&para;<br>of Jerry Avorn &amp; Aaron Kesselheim, CA2 App. 4310; Doc.&para;<br>414, at 60–61. And in any event, such laws do not help&para;<br>protect prescriber privacy.&para;<br>Vermont has thus developed a record that sufficiently&para;<br>shows that its statute meaningfully furthers substantial&para;<br>state interests. Neither the majority nor respondents&para;<br>suggests any equally effective “more limited” restriction.&para;<br>And the First Amendment harm that Vermont’s statute&para;<br>works is, at most, modest. I consequently conclude that,&para;<br>even if we apply an “intermediate” test such as that in&para;<br>Central Hudson, this statute is constitutional.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>What about the statute’s third restriction, providing&para;<br>that “[p]harmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical&para;<br>marketers” may not “use prescriber-identifiable informa&para;<br>tion for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless&para;<br>the prescriber consents”? Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631(d)&para;<br>(emphasis added). In principle, I should not reach this&para;<br>question. That is because respondent pharmaceutical&para;<br>manufacturers, marketers, and data miners seek a de&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>claratory judgment and injunction prohibiting the en&para;<br>forcement of this statute. See 28 U. S. C. §2201; App. 49–&para;<br>128. And they have neither shown nor claimed that they&para;<br>could obtain significant amounts of “prescriber-identifiable&para;<br>information” if the first two prohibitions are valid. If, as&para;<br>I believe, the first two statutory prohibitions (related to&para;<br>selling and disclosing the information) are valid, then&para;<br>the dispute about the validity of the third provision is&para;<br>not “ ‘real and substantial’ ” or “ ‘definite and concrete.’ ”&para;<br>MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127&para;<br>(2007) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.&para;<br>227, 240–241 (1937)) (Article III does not permit courts to&para;<br>entertain such disputes).&para;<br>The Court, however, strikes down all three provisions,&para;<br>and so I add that I disagree with the majority as to the&para;<br>constitutionality of the third restriction as well—basically&para;<br>for the reasons I have already set out. The prohibition&para;<br>against pharmaceutical firms using this prescriber&para;<br>identifying information works no more than modest First&para;<br>Amendment harm; the prohibition is justified by the need&para;<br>to ensure unbiased sales presentations, prevent unneces&para;<br>sarily high drug costs, and protect the privacy of prescrib&para;<br>ing physicians. There is no obvious equally effective, more&para;<br>limited alternative.&para;<br>V&para;<br>In sum, I believe that the statute before us satisfies the&para;<br>“intermediate” standards this Court has applied to restric&para;<br>tions on commercial speech. A fortiori it satisfies less&para;<br>demanding standards that are more appropriately applied&para;<br>in this kind of commercial regulatory case—a case where&para;<br>the government seeks typical regulatory ends (lower drug&para;<br>prices, more balanced sales messages) through the use of&para;<br>ordinary regulatory means (limiting the commercial use&para;<br>of data gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate). The&para;<br>speech-related consequences here are indirect, incidental,&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and entirely commercial. See supra, at 6–9.&para;<br>The Court reaches its conclusion through the use of&para;<br>important First Amendment categories—“content-based,”&para;<br>“speaker-based,” and “neutral”—but without taking full&para;<br>account of the regulatory context, the nature of the speech&para;<br>effects, the values these First Amendment categories seek&para;<br>to promote, and prior precedent. See supra, at 2–6, 9–13,&para;<br>17. At best the Court opens a Pandora’s Box of First&para;<br>Amendment challenges to many ordinary regulatory&para;<br>practices that may only incidentally affect a commercial&para;<br>message. See, e.g., supra, at 7–8, 9–11. At worst, it re&para;<br>awakens Lochner’s pre-New Deal threat of substituting&para;<br>judicial for democratic decisionmaking where ordinary&para;<br>economic regulation is at issue. See Central Hudson, 447&para;<br>U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Regardless, whether we apply an ordinary commercial&para;<br>speech standard or a less demanding standard, I believe&para;<br>Vermont’s law is consistent with the First Amendment.&para;<br>And with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
