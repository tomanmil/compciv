DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–123.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 20, 2013—Decided June 10, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA), which was&para;<br>enacted to stabilize prices for agricultural commodities, regulates&para;<br>only “handlers,” i.e., “processors, associations of producers, and others&para;<br>engaged in the handling” of covered agricultural commodities, 7&para;<br>U. S. C. §608c(1). Any handler that violates the Secretary of Agriculture’s marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. §§608a(5), 608a(6), and 608c(14). One such order, the California Raisin Marketing Order (Marketing Order or Order), established&para;<br>a Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which recommends setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the&para;<br>open domestic market, and which recommends what portion of a particular year’s production should be included in the pool. The Order&para;<br>also requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover the RAC’s&para;<br>administrative costs.&para;<br>Petitioners, California raisin growers, started a business that processed more than 3 million pounds of raisins from their farm and 60&para;<br>other farms during the two crop years. When they refused to surrender the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve, the United States&para;<br>Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceedings, alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to retain raisins in reserve and pay assessments. Petitioners countered&para;<br>that as producers, they were not subject to the Order. They also&para;<br>raised an affirmative defense that the Order violated the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment’s prohibition against taking property without just compensation. An Administrative Law Judge found that petitioners were&para;<br>handlers, found that they had violated the AMAA and the Marketing&para;<br>Order, and rejected their takings defense. On appeal, a judicial officer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Marketing Order, imposed fines and civil penalties, and declined to&para;<br>address the takings claim. Petitioners sought review in the Federal&para;<br>District Court. Granting summary judgment to the USDA, it found&para;<br>that substantial evidence supported the agency’s determination that&para;<br>petitioners were handlers rather than producers, and it rejected petitioners’ takings claim. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed that&para;<br>petitioners were handlers subject to the Marketing Order, but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim, which&para;<br>they should have raised in the Court of Federal Claims. It recognized&para;<br>that when a handler raises a takings defense, Court of Federal&para;<br>Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to the AMAA’s comprehensive remedial scheme, see 7 U. S. C. §608c(15), but found that petitioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide petitioners’ takings&para;<br>claim. Pp. 9–15.&para;<br>(a) That court incorrectly determined that petitioners brought their&para;<br>takings claim as producers rather than handlers. Petitioners argued&para;<br>that they were producers—and thus not subject to the AMAA or the&para;<br>Marketing Order—but both the USDA and the District Court concluded that they were handlers. And the fines and civil penalties for&para;<br>failure to reserve raisins were levied on them in that capacity. Because the Marketing Order imposes duties on petitioners only in&para;<br>their capacity as handlers, their takings claim raised as a defense&para;<br>against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity. In&para;<br>finding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit confused petitioners’ statutory&para;<br>argument that they were producers with their constitutional argument that, assuming they were handlers, their fine violated the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. The relevant question is whether a federal court has&para;<br>jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seeking review of a final agency order. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(b) The Government’s claim that petitioners’ takings-based defense&para;<br>was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds is unpersuasive, and its&para;<br>reliance on Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, is misplaced. There, a&para;<br>plaintiff ’s claim that a zoning decision effected a taking without just&para;<br>compensation was not ripe. But the claim failed because the plaintiff&para;<br>could not show that it had been injured by the Government’s action&para;<br>when there had been no final decision. Here, petitioners were subject&para;<br>to a final agency order imposing concrete fines and penalties. The&para;<br>takings claim in Williamson County was also not yet ripe because the&para;<br>plaintiff had not sought “compensation through the procedures [provided by] the State.” Id., at 194. The Government argues that petitioners’ takings claim is premature because the Tucker Act affords a&para;<br>remedy, but, in fact, the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handler’s takings claim. As a result, there is no alternative remedy. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(c) A takings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the context of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the USDA under&para;<br>§608c(14). The provision’s text does not bar handlers from raising&para;<br>constitutional defenses to the USDA’s enforcement action. Allowing&para;<br>handlers to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges to marketing orders under §608c(15)(A), for a handler who refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement&para;<br>action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if the constitutional challenge fails. It would also make little sense to force a party&para;<br>to pay an assessed fine in one proceeding and then turn around and&para;<br>sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.

The AMAA and the Marketing Order were&para;<br>adopted to stabilize prices by limiting the supply of raisins&para;<br>on the market. Petitioners are California raisin growers&para;<br>who believe that this regulatory scheme violates the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. After petitioners refused to surrender the&para;<br>requisite portion of their raisins, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceedings against petitioners that led to the imposition&para;<br>of more than $650,000 in fines and civil penalties. Petitioners sought judicial review, claiming that the monetary&para;<br>sanctions were an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation. The Ninth Circuit held&para;<br>that petitioners were required to bring their takings claim&para;<br>in the Court of Federal Claims and that it therefore lacked&para;<br>jurisdiction to review petitioners’ claim. We disagree.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners’ takings claim, raised as an affirmative defense&para;<br>to the agency’s enforcement action, was properly before&para;<br>the court because the AMAA provides a comprehensive&para;<br>remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction&para;<br>over takings claims brought by raisin handlers. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Ninth Circuit.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted the AMAA during the Great Depression in an effort to insulate farmers from competitive&para;<br>market forces that it believed caused “unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices.” Ch. 296, 50 Stat. 246,&para;<br>as amended, 7 U. S. C. §602(4). To achieve this goal,&para;<br>Congress declared a national policy of stabilizing prices for&para;<br>agricultural commodities. Ibid. The AMAA authorizes&para;<br>the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate marketing orders that regulate the sale and delivery of agricultural&para;<br>goods. §608c(1); see also Block v.

In particular,&para;<br>“[t]he Raisin Marketing Order, like other fruit and vegetable orders adopted under the AMAA, [sought] to stabilize&para;<br>producer returns by limiting the quantity of raisins sold&para;<br>by handlers in the domestic competitive market.” Lion&para;<br>Raisins, Inc. v. United States, 416 F. 3d 1356, 1359 (CA&para;<br>Fed. 2005). The Marketing Order defines a raisin “handler” as “(a) [a]ny processor or packer; (b) [a]ny person&para;<br>who places . . . raisins in the current of commerce from&para;<br>within [California] to any point outside thereof; (c) [a]ny&para;<br>person who delivers off-grade raisins . . . into any eligible&para;<br>non-normal outlet; or (d) [a]ny person who blends raisins&para;<br>[subject to certain exceptions].” 7 CFR §989.15.&para;<br>The Marketing Order also established the Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which consists of 47 members, with 35 representing producers, ten representing&para;<br>handlers, one representing the cooperative bargaining&para;<br>associations, and one member of the public. See §989.26.&para;<br>The Marketing Order authorizes the RAC to recommend&para;<br>setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not&para;<br>to be sold on the open domestic market. See 7 U. S. C.&para;<br>§608c(6)(E); 7 CFR §§989.54(d) and 989.65. Each year, the&para;<br>RAC reviews crop yield, inventories, and shipments and&para;<br>makes recommendations to the Secretary whether or not&para;<br>there should be a reserve pool. §989.54. If the RAC recommends a reserve pool, it also recommends what portion&para;<br>of that year’s production should be included in the pool&para;<br>(“reserve-tonnage”).

The reserve-tonnage, calculated as a percentage&para;<br>of a producer’s crop, varies from year to year.2&para;<br>Under the Marketing Order’s reserve requirements, a&para;<br>producer is only paid for the free-tonnage raisins. §989.65.&para;<br>The reserve-tonnage raisins, on the other hand, must be&para;<br>held by the handler in segregated bins “for the account” of&para;<br>the RAC. §989.66(f ). The RAC may then sell the reservetonnage raisins to handlers for resale in overseas markets,&para;<br>or may alternatively direct that they be sold or given at no&para;<br>cost to secondary, noncompetitive domestic markets, such&para;<br>as school lunch programs. §989.67(b). The reserve pool&para;<br>sales proceeds are used to finance the RAC’s administrative costs. §989.53(a). In the event that there are any&para;<br>remaining funds, the producers receive a pro rata share. 7&para;<br>U. S. C. §608c(6)(E); 7 CFR §989.66(h). As a result, even&para;<br>though producers do not receive payment for reservetonnage raisins at the time of delivery to a handler, they&para;<br>retain a limited interest in the net proceeds of the RAC’s&para;<br>disposition of the reserve pool.&para;<br>Handlers have other duties beyond managing the RAC’s&para;<br>reserve pool. The Marketing Order requires them to file&para;<br>certain reports with the RAC, such as reports concerning&para;<br>the quantity of raisins that they hold or acquire. §989.73.&para;<br>They are also required to allow the RAC access to their&para;<br>premises, raisins, and business records to verify the accuracy of the handlers’ reports, §989.77, to obtain inspections of raisins acquired, §989.58(d), and to pay certain&para;<br>assessments, §989.80, which help cover the RAC’s administrative costs.

To&para;<br>this end, the Hornes entered into a partnership with Mrs.&para;<br>Horne’s parents called Lassen Vineyards.

Nor did&para;<br>they set aside reserve-tonnage raisins from those produced&para;<br>and owned by the more than 60 other farmers who contracted with Lassen Vineyards for packing services. They&para;<br>also declined to arrange for RAC inspection of the raisins they received for processing, denied the RAC access&para;<br>to their records, and held none of their own raisins in&para;<br>reserve.&para;<br>On April 1, 2004, the Administrator of the Agriculture&para;<br>Marketing Service (Administrator) initiated an enforcement action against the Hornes, Raisin Valley Farms, and&para;<br>Lassen Vineyards (petitioners). The complaint alleged&para;<br>that petitioners were “handlers” of California raisins&para;<br>during the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. It also&para;<br>alleged that petitioners violated the AMAA and the Marketing Order by submitting inaccurate forms to the RAC&para;<br>and failing to hold inspections of incoming raisins, retain&para;<br>raisins in reserve, pay assessments, and allow access to&para;<br>their records. Petitioners denied the allegations, countering that they were not “handlers” and asserting that they&para;<br>did not acquire physical possession of the other producers’&para;<br>raisins within the meaning of the regulations. Petitioners also raised several affirmative defenses, including a&para;<br>claim that the Marketing Order violated the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against taking property without just&para;<br>compensation.&para;<br>An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded in 2006&para;<br>that petitioners were handlers of raisins and thus subject&para;<br>to the Marketing Order.

The judicial officer imposed $202,600 in civil penalties under 7 U. S. C.&para;<br>§608c(14)(B); $8,783.39 in assessments for the two crop&para;<br>years under 7 CFR §989.80(a); and $483,843.53 for the&para;<br>value of the California raisins that petitioners failed to&para;<br>hold in reserve for the two crop years under §989.166(c).&para;<br>The judicial officer believed that he lacked “authority to&para;<br>judge the constitutionality of the various statutes administered by the [USDA],” App. 73, and declined to adjudicate petitioners’ takings claim.&para;<br>Petitioners filed a complaint in Federal District Court&para;<br>seeking judicial review of the USDA’s decision. See 7&para;<br>U. S. C. §608c(14)(B). The District Court granted summary judgment to the USDA. The court held that substantial evidence supported the agency’s determination&para;<br>that petitioners were “handlers” subject to the Marketing&para;<br>Order, and rejected petitioners’ argument that they were&para;<br>exempt from the Marketing Order due to their status as&para;<br>“producers” under §608c(13)(B). No. CV–F–08–1549 LJO&para;<br>SMS, 2009 WL 4895362, *15 (ED Cal., Dec. 11, 2009).&para;<br>Petitioners renewed their Fifth Amendment argument,&para;<br>asserting that the reserve-tonnage requirement constituted a physical taking. Though the District Court found&para;<br>that the RAC takes title to a significant portion of a California raisin producer’s crop through the reserve requirement, the court held that the transfer of title to the RAC&para;<br>did not constitute a physical taking. See id., at *26 (“ ‘[I]n&para;<br>essence, [petitioners] are paying an admissions fee or&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HORNE v.

United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 554, 563–564&para;<br>(2006))).&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court agreed that&para;<br>petitioners were “handlers” subject to the Marketing Order’s provisions, and rejected petitioners’ argument that&para;<br>they were producers, and, thus exempt from regulation.&para;<br>673 F. 3d 1071, 1078 (2012). The court did not resolve&para;<br>petitioners’ takings claim, however, because it concluded&para;<br>that that it lacked jurisdiction to do so. The court explained that “a takings claim against the federal government must be brought [in the Court of Federal Claims] in&para;<br>the first instance, ‘unless Congress has withdrawn the&para;<br>Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 1079 (quoting Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524&para;<br>U. S. 498, 520 (1998) (plurality opinion)). The court recognized that 7 U. S. C. §608c(15) provides an administrative remedy to handlers wishing to challenge marketing&para;<br>orders under the AMAA, and it agreed that “when a handler, or a producer-handler in its capacity as a handler,&para;<br>challenges a marketing order on takings grounds, Court of&para;<br>Federal Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to section [60]8c(15)’s comprehensive procedural scheme and&para;<br>administrative exhaustion requirements.” 673 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1079. But, the Ninth Circuit determined, petitioners&para;<br>brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers,&para;<br>not handlers. Id., at 1080. Consequently, the court was&para;<br>of the view that “[n]othing in the AMAA precludes the&para;<br>Hornes from alleging in the Court of Federal Claims that&para;<br>the reserve program injures them in their capacity as&para;<br>producers by subjecting them to a taking requiring compensation.” Ibid.

This determination is&para;<br>not correct. Although petitioners argued that they were&para;<br>producers—and thus not subject to the AMAA or Marketing Order at all—both the USDA and the District Court&para;<br>concluded that petitioners were “handlers.” Accordingly,&para;<br>the civil penalty, assessment, and reimbursement for failure to reserve raisins were all levied on petitioners in&para;<br>their capacity as “handlers.” If petitioners’ argument that&para;<br>they were producers had prevailed, they would not have&para;<br>been subject to any of the monetary sanctions imposed on&para;<br>them. See 7 U. S. C. §608c(13)(B) (“No order issued under&para;<br>this chapter shall be applicable to any producer in his&para;<br>capacity as a producer”).&para;<br>It is undisputed that the Marketing Order imposes&para;<br>duties on petitioners only in their capacity as handlers.&para;<br>As a result, any defense raised against those duties is&para;<br>necessarily raised in that same capacity. Petitioners argue that it would be unconstitutional for the Government&para;<br>to come on their land and confiscate raisins, or to confiscate the proceeds of raisin sales, without paying just compensation; and, that it is therefore unconstitutional to fine&para;<br>petitioners for not complying with the unconstitutional&para;<br>requirement.4 See Brief for Petitioners 54. Given that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The Ninth Circuit construed the takings argument quite differently,&para;<br>stating that petitioners believe the regulatory scheme “takes reservetonnage raisins belonging to producers.” 673 F. 3d 1071, 1080 (2012).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HORNE v.

According to the Government, because a takings claim can be pursued later in the Court&para;<br>of Federal Claims, the Ninth Circuit correctly refused to&para;<br>adjudicate petitioners’ takings defense. In support of its&para;<br>position, the Government relies largely on Williamson&para;<br>County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>When the agency brought its enforcement action against petitioners,&para;<br>however, it did not seek to recover reserve-tonnage raisins from the&para;<br>2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. Rather, it sought monetary&para;<br>penalties and reimbursement. Petitioners could not argue in the face of&para;<br>such agency action that the Secretary was attempting to take raisins&para;<br>that had already been harvested and sold. Instead, petitioners argued&para;<br>that they could not be compelled to pay fines for refusing to accede to&para;<br>an unconstitutional taking.&para;<br>5 The Government notes that petitioners did not own most of the raisins that they failed to reserve and argues that petitioners would have&para;<br>no takings claim based on those raisins. See Brief for Respondent 19.&para;<br>We take no position on the merits of petitioners’ takings claim. We&para;<br>simply recognize that insofar as the petitioners challenged the imposition of monetary sanctions under the Marketing Order, they raised&para;<br>their takings-based defense in their capacity as handlers. On remand,&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit can decide in the first instance whether petitioners&para;<br>may raise the takings defense with respect to raisins they never owned.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985). Brief for Respondent&para;<br>21–22 (“Just compensation need not ‘be paid in advance&para;<br>of, or contemporaneously with, the taking; all that is required is that a ‘reasonable, certain and adequate provision&para;<br>for obtaining compensation’ exist at the time of the taking’ ”&para;<br>(quoting Williamson County, 473 U. S., at 194)). In that&para;<br>case, the plaintiff filed suit against the Regional Planning&para;<br>Commission, claiming that a zoning decision by the Commission effected a taking of property without just compensation. Id., at 182. We found that the plaintiff ’s claim&para;<br>was not “ripe” for two reasons, neither of which supports&para;<br>the Government’s position.&para;<br>First, we explained that the plaintiff ’s takings claim in&para;<br>Williamson County failed because the plaintiff could not&para;<br>show that it had been injured by the Government’s action.&para;<br>Specifically, the plaintiff “ha[d] not yet obtained a final&para;<br>decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance&para;<br>and subdivision regulations to its property.” Id., at 186.&para;<br>Here, by contrast, petitioners were subject to a final agency&para;<br>order imposing concrete fines and penalties at the time&para;<br>they sought judicial review under §608c(14)(B). This was&para;<br>clearly sufficient “injury” for federal jurisdiction.&para;<br>Second, the Williamson County plaintiff ’s takings claim&para;<br>was not yet ripe because the plaintiff had not sought&para;<br>“compensation through the procedures the State ha[d]&para;<br>provided for doing so.” Id., at 194. We explained that&para;<br>“[i]f the government has provided an adequate process&para;<br>for obtaining compensation, and if resort to that process&para;<br>yields just compensation, then the property owner has no&para;<br>claim against the Government for a taking.” Id., at 194–&para;<br>195 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).&para;<br>Stated differently, a Fifth Amendment claim is premature&para;<br>until it is clear that the Government has both taken property and denied just compensation. Although we often&para;<br>refer to this consideration as “prudential ‘ripeness,’ ” Lucas&para;<br>v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1013&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1992), we have recognized that it is not, strictly speaking,&para;<br>jurisdictional.6 See Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.&para;<br>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___, and n. 10 (2010) (slip op., at 24, and n. 10).&para;<br>Here, the Government argues that petitioners’ takings&para;<br>claim is premature because the Tucker Act affords “the&para;<br>requisite reasonable, certain, and adequate provision for&para;<br>obtaining just compensation that a property owner must&para;<br>pursue.” Brief for Respondent 22. In the Government’s&para;<br>view, “[p]etitioners should have complied with the order,&para;<br>and, after a portion of their raisins were placed in reserve&para;<br>to be disposed of as directed by the RAC, . . . sought compensation as producers in the Court of Federal Claims&para;<br>for the alleged taking.” Id., at 24–25. We disagree with&para;<br>the Government’s argument, however, because the AMAA&para;<br>provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handler’s takings&para;<br>claim. As a result, there is no alternative “reasonable,&para;<br>certain, and adequate” remedial scheme through which&para;<br>petitioners (as handlers) must proceed before obtaining&para;<br>review of their claim under the AMAA.7&para;<br>The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over Tucker&para;<br>Act claims “founded either upon the Constitution, or any&para;<br>Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department.” 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1). “[A] claim for just&para;<br>compensation under the Takings Clause must be brought&para;<br>to the Court of Federal Claims in the first instance, unless&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 A “Case” or “Controversy” exists once the government has taken&para;<br>private property without paying for it. Accordingly, whether an alternative remedy exists does not affect the jurisdiction of the federal court.&para;<br>7 That is not to say that a producer who turns over her reservetonnage raisins could not bring suit for just compensation in the Court&para;<br>of Claims. Whether a producer could bring such a claim, and what&para;<br>impact the availability of such a claim would have on petitioners’&para;<br>takings-based defense, are questions going to the merits of petitioners’&para;<br>defense, not to a court’s jurisdiction to entertain it. We therefore do not&para;<br>address those issues here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.” Eastern Enterprises, 524&para;<br>U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion); see also United States v.&para;<br>Bormes, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5) (where “a&para;<br>statute contains its own self-executing remedial scheme,”&para;<br>a court “look[s] only to that statute”). To determine&para;<br>whether a statutory scheme displaces Tucker Act jurisdiction, a court must “examin[e] the purpose of the [statute],&para;<br>the entirety of its text, and the structure of review that it&para;<br>establishes.” United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 444&para;<br>(1988).&para;<br>Under the AMAA’s comprehensive remedial scheme,&para;<br>handlers may challenge the content, applicability, and enforcement of marketing orders. Pursuant to §§608c(15)&para;<br>(A)–(B), a handler may file with the Secretary a direct&para;<br>challenge to a marketing order and its applicability to&para;<br>him. We have held that “any handler” subject to a marketing order must raise any challenges to the order,&para;<br>including constitutional challenges, in administrative&para;<br>proceedings. See United States v. Ruzicka, 329 U. S. 287,&para;<br>294 (1946). Once the Secretary issues a ruling, the federal&para;<br>district court where the “handler is an inhabitant, or has&para;<br>his principal place of business” is “vested with jurisdiction&para;<br>. . . to review [the] ruling.”8 §608c(15)(B). These statutory&para;<br>provisions afford handlers a ready avenue to bring takings&para;<br>claim against the USDA. We thus conclude that the&para;<br>AMAA withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over petitioners’&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Petitioners filed an administrative petition before the Secretary in&para;<br>March 2007 pursuant to §608c(15)(A) challenging the Marketing Order&para;<br>and its application to them. The USDA argued that they had no&para;<br>standing to file the petition because they had not admitted that they&para;<br>were handlers. The judicial officer granted the USDA’s motion to&para;<br>dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners filed a complaint in District Court, but the court dismissed it as untimely. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit affirmed. See Horne v. Dept. of Agriculture, 395 Fed.&para;<br>Appx. 486 (2010).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>takings claim. Petitioners (as handlers) have no alternative remedy, and their takings claim was not “premature”&para;<br>when presented to the Ninth Circuit.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Although petitioners’ claim was not “premature” for&para;<br>Tucker Act purposes, the question remains whether a&para;<br>takings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the&para;<br>context of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the&para;<br>USDA under §608c(14). We hold that it may. The&para;<br>AMAA provides that the handler may not be subjected&para;<br>to an adverse order until he has been given “notice and&para;<br>an opportunity for an agency hearing on the record.”&para;<br>§608c(14)(B). The text of §608c(14)(B) does not bar handlers from raising constitutional defenses to the USDA’s&para;<br>enforcement action. Allowing handlers to raise constitutional challenges in the course of enforcement proceedings&para;<br>would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges&para;<br>to marketing orders under §608c(15)(A) because a handler&para;<br>who refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits&para;<br>for an enforcement action will be liable for significant&para;<br>monetary penalties if his constitutional challenge fails.&para;<br>In the case of an administrative enforcement proceeding, when a party raises a constitutional defense to an&para;<br>assessed fine, it would make little sense to require the&para;<br>party to pay the fine in one proceeding and then turn&para;<br>around and sue for recovery of that same money in another&para;<br>proceeding. See Eastern Enterprises, supra, at 520. We&para;<br>see no indication that Congress intended this result for&para;<br>handlers subject to enforcement proceedings under the&para;<br>AMAA. Petitioners were therefore free to raise their&para;<br>takings-based defense before the USDA. And, because&para;<br>§608c(14)(B) allows a handler to seek judicial review of an&para;<br>adverse order, the district court and Ninth Circuit were&para;<br>not precluded from reviewing petitioners’ constitutional&para;<br>challenge. The grant of jurisdiction necessarily includes&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the power to review any constitutional challenges properly&para;<br>presented to and rejected by the agency. We are therefore&para;<br>satisfied that the petitioners raised a cognizable takings&para;<br>defense and that the Ninth Circuit erred in declining to&para;<br>adjudicate it.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide whether the&para;<br>USDA’s imposition of fines and civil penalties on petitioners, in their capacity as handlers, violated the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment.
