SIEGEL, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–5196. Argued January 13, 2014—Decided March 4, 2014&para;<br>Petitioner Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He valued his California home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was covered by California’s homestead exemption and thus was exempt from&para;<br>the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(A). He also&para;<br>claimed that the sum of two voluntary liens—one of which was in favor of “Lin’s Mortgage &amp; Associates”—exceeded the home’s nonexempt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors. Respondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the “Lin”&para;<br>lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litigation ensued when a supposed “Lili Lin” in China claimed to be the&para;<br>beneficiary of Law’s deed of trust. Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his&para;<br>equity in the house. It thus granted Siegel’s motion to “surcharge”&para;<br>Law’s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to&para;<br>defray attorney’s fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Law’s fraudulent misrepresentations. The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate&para;<br>Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when&para;<br>it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law’s homestead exemption&para;<br>be made available to pay Siegel’s attorney’s fees. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(a) A bankruptcy court may not exercise its authority to “carry out”&para;<br>the provisions of the Code, 11 U. S. C. §105(a), or its “inherent power&para;<br>. . . to sanction ‘abusive litigation practices,’ ” Marrama v. Citizens&para;<br>Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375–376, by taking action prohibited&para;<br>elsewhere in the Code. Here, the Bankruptcy Court’s “surcharge”&para;<br>contravened §522, which (by reference to California law) entitled Law&para;<br>to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate,&para;<br>§522(b)(3)(A), and which made that $75,000 “not liable for payment of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>any administrative expense,” §522(k), including attorney’s fees, see&para;<br>§503(b)(2). The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the court’s&para;<br>authority under §105(a) and its inherent powers. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) Siegel argues that an equitable power to deny an exemption by&para;<br>“surcharging” exempt property in response to a debtor’s misconduct&para;<br>can coexist with §522. But insofar as that argument equates the surcharge with an outright denial of Law’s homestead exemption, it&para;<br>founders on this case’s procedural history. The Bankruptcy Appellate&para;<br>Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the homestead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.&para;<br>And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge&para;<br>an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland &amp; Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643–644.&para;<br>Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law’s entitlement to the exemption, §522 specifies the criteria that render property exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtor’s invocation&para;<br>of an exemption without a valid statutory basis. Federal courts may&para;<br>apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law&para;<br>itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemption on a ground not specified in the Code. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(c) Neither the holding of Marrama v. Citizens Bank nor its dictum&para;<br>points toward a different result. There, the debtor’s bad faith kept&para;<br>him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a&para;<br>Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by §706(a). But that was because his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13,&para;<br>and thus he could not satisfy §706(d), which expressly conditions&para;<br>conversion on the debtor’s ability to qualify under Chapter 13.&para;<br>Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(d) This ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden&para;<br>due to Law’s egregious misconduct and may produce inequitable results for other trustees and creditors, but it is not for courts to alter&para;<br>the balance that Congress struck in crafting §522.

It further&para;<br>provides that exempt assets generally are not liable for&para;<br>any expenses associated with administering the estate. In&para;<br>this case, we consider whether a bankruptcy court none­&para;<br>theless may order that a debtor’s exempt assets be used to&para;<br>pay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the&para;<br>debtor’s misconduct.&para;<br>I. Background&para;<br>A&para;<br>Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code gives an insolvent&para;<br>debtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidat­&para;<br>ing his assets to pay his creditors. 11 U. S. C. §§704(a)(1),&para;<br>726, 727. The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Chap­&para;<br>ter 7 creates a bankruptcy “estate” generally comprising&para;<br>all of the debtor’s property. §541(a)(1). The estate is&para;<br>placed under the control of a trustee, who is responsible&para;<br>for managing liquidation of the estate’s assets and distri­&para;<br>bution of the proceeds. §704(a)(1). The Code authorizes&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the debtor to “exempt,” however, certain kinds of property&para;<br>from the estate, enabling him to retain those assets post­&para;<br>bankruptcy. §522(b)(1). Except in particular situations&para;<br>specified in the Code, exempt property “is not liable” for&para;<br>the payment of “any [prepetition] debt” or “any adminis­&para;<br>trative expense.” §522(c), (k).&para;<br>Section 522(d) of the Code provides a number of exemp­&para;<br>tions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.&para;<br>§522(b)(2), (d). One, commonly known as the “homestead&para;<br>exemption,” protects up to $22,975 in equity in the debt­&para;<br>or’s residence. §522(d)(1) and note following §522; see&para;<br>Owen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). The debtor may&para;<br>elect, however, to forgo the §522(d) exemptions and in­&para;<br>stead claim whatever exemptions are available under&para;<br>applicable state or local law. §522(b)(3)(A). Some States&para;<br>provide homestead exemptions that are more generous&para;<br>than the federal exemption; some provide less generous&para;<br>versions; but nearly every State provides some type of&para;<br>homestead exemption. See López, State Homestead Ex­&para;<br>emptions and Bankruptcy Law: Is It Time for Congress To&para;<br>Close the Loophole? 7 Rutgers Bus. L. J. 143, 149–165&para;<br>(2010) (listing state exemptions).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner, Stephen Law, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy&para;<br>in 2004, and respondent, Alfred H. Siegel, was appointed&para;<br>to serve as trustee. The estate’s only significant asset was&para;<br>Law’s house in Hacienda Heights, California. On a sched­&para;<br>ule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Law valued the&para;<br>house at $363,348 and claimed that $75,000 of its value&para;<br>was covered by California’s homestead exemption. See&para;<br>Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §704.730(a)(1) (West Supp.&para;<br>2014). He also reported that the house was subject to two&para;<br>voluntary liens: a note and deed of trust for $147,156.52 in&para;<br>favor of Washington Mutual Bank, and a second note and&para;<br>deed of trust for $156,929.04 in favor of “Lin’s Mortgage &amp;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Associates.” Law thus represented that there was no&para;<br>equity in the house that could be recovered for his other&para;<br>creditors, because the sum of the two liens exceeded the&para;<br>house’s nonexempt value.&para;<br>If Law’s representations had been accurate, he presum­&para;<br>ably would have been able to retain the house, since Siegel&para;<br>would have had no reason to pursue its sale. Instead, a&para;<br>few months after Law’s petition was filed, Siegel initiated&para;<br>an adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of&para;<br>“Lin’s Mortgage &amp; Associates” was fraudulent. The deed&para;<br>of trust supporting that lien had been recorded by Law in&para;<br>1999 and reflected a debt to someone named “Lili Lin.”&para;<br>Not one but two individuals claiming to be Lili Lin ulti­&para;<br>mately responded to Siegel’s complaint. One, Lili Lin of&para;<br>Artesia, California, was a former acquaintance of Law’s&para;<br>who denied ever having loaned him money and described&para;<br>his repeated efforts to involve her in various sham trans­&para;<br>actions relating to the disputed deed of trust. That Lili&para;<br>Lin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaim­&para;<br>ing any interest in the house. But that was not the end of&para;<br>the matter, because the second “Lili Lin” claimed to be the&para;<br>true beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust. Over the&para;<br>next five years, this “Lili Lin” managed—despite suppos­&para;<br>edly living in China and speaking no English—to engage&para;<br>in extensive and costly litigation, including several ap­&para;<br>peals, contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and&para;<br>Siegel’s subsequent sale of the house.&para;<br>Finally, in 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order&para;<br>concluding that “no person named Lili Lin ever made a&para;<br>loan to [Law] in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.”&para;<br>In re Law, 401 B. R. 447, 453 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.). The&para;<br>court found that “the loan was a fiction, meant to preserve&para;<br>[Law’s] equity in his residence beyond what he was enti­&para;<br>tled to exempt” by perpetrating “a fraud on his creditors&para;<br>and the court.” Ibid. With regard to the second “Lili Lin,”&para;<br>the court declared itself “unpersuaded that Lili Lin of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>China signed or approved any declaration or pleading&para;<br>purporting to come from her.” Ibid. Rather, it said, the&para;<br>“most plausible conclusion” was that Law himself had&para;<br>“authored, signed, and filed some or all of these papers.”&para;<br>Ibid. It also found that Law had submitted false evidence&para;<br>“in an effort to persuade the court that Lili Lin of China—&para;<br>rather than Lili Lin of Artesia—was the true holder of the&para;<br>lien on his residence.” Id., at 452. The court determined&para;<br>that Siegel had incurred more than $500,000 in attorney’s&para;<br>fees overcoming Law’s fraudulent misrepresentations. It&para;<br>therefore granted Siegel’s motion to “surcharge” the en­&para;<br>tirety of Law’s $75,000 homestead exemption, making&para;<br>those funds available to defray Siegel’s attorney’s fees.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed.&para;<br>BAP No. CC–09–1077–PaMkH, 2009 WL 7751415 (Oct.&para;<br>22, 2009) ( per curiam). It held that the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court’s factual findings regarding Law’s fraud were not&para;<br>clearly erroneous and that the court had not abused its&para;<br>discretion by surcharging Law’s exempt assets. It ex­&para;<br>plained that in Latman v. Burdette, 366 F. 3d 774 (2004),&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit had recognized a bankruptcy court’s&para;<br>power to “equitably surcharge a debtor’s statutory ex­&para;<br>emptions” in exceptional circumstances, such as “when a&para;<br>debtor engages in inequitable or fraudulent conduct.” 2009&para;<br>WL 7751415, *5, *7. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel&para;<br>acknowledged that the Tenth Circuit had disagreed with&para;<br>Latman, see In re Scrivner, 535 F. 3d 1258, 1263–1265&para;<br>(2008), but the panel affirmed that Latman was correct.&para;<br>2009 WL 7751415, *7, n. 10. Judge Markell filed a con­&para;<br>curring opinion agreeing with the panel’s application of&para;<br>Latman but questioning “whether Latman remains good&para;<br>policy.” 2009 WL 7751415, *10.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed. In re Law, 435 Fed. Appx.&para;<br>697 (2011) ( per curiam). It held that the surcharge was&para;<br>proper because it was “calculated to compensate the estate&para;<br>for the actual monetary costs imposed by the debtor’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>misconduct, and was warranted to protect the integrity of&para;<br>the bankruptcy process.” Id., at 698. We granted certiorari.&para;<br>570 U. S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>II. Analysis&para;<br>A&para;<br>A bankruptcy court has statutory authority to “issue&para;<br>any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or ap­&para;<br>propriate to carry out the provisions of ” the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Code. 11 U. S. C. §105(a). And it may also possess “inher­&para;<br>ent power . . . to sanction ‘abusive litigation practices.’ ”&para;<br>Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375–&para;<br>376 (2007). But in exercising those statutory and inherent&para;<br>powers, a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific&para;<br>statutory provisions.&para;<br>It is hornbook law that §105(a) “does not allow the&para;<br>bankruptcy court to override explicit mandates of other&para;<br>sections of the Bankruptcy Code.” 2 Collier on Bankruptcy&para;<br>¶105.01[2], p. 105–6 (16th ed. 2013). Section 105(a) con­&para;<br>fers authority to “carry out” the provisions of the Code, but&para;<br>it is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the&para;<br>Code prohibits. That is simply an application of the axiom&para;<br>that a statute’s general permission to take actions of a&para;<br>certain type must yield to a specific prohibition found&para;<br>elsewhere. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550–551&para;<br>(1974); D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,&para;<br>206–208 (1932).1 Courts’ inherent sanctioning powers are&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The second sentence of §105(a) adds little to the analysis. It states:&para;<br>“No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a&para;<br>party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,&para;<br>sua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary&para;<br>or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to&para;<br>prevent an abuse of process.” Even if the “abuse of process” language&para;<br>were deemed to confer additional authority beyond that conferred by&para;<br>the first sentence (which is doubtful), that general authority would also&para;<br>be limited by more specific provisions of the Code.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>likewise subordinate to valid statutory directives and&para;<br>prohibitions. Degen v. United States, 517 U. S. 820, 823&para;<br>(1996); Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991).&para;<br>We have long held that “whatever equitable powers&para;<br>remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be&para;<br>exercised within the confines of ” the Bankruptcy Code.&para;<br>Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U. S. 197, 206&para;<br>(1988); see, e.g., Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530&para;<br>U. S. 15, 24–25 (2000); United States v. Noland, 517 U. S.&para;<br>535, 543 (1996); SEC v. United States Realty &amp; Improvement Co., 310 U. S. 434, 455 (1940).&para;<br>Thus, the Bankruptcy Court’s “surcharge” was unau­&para;<br>thorized if it contravened a specific provision of the Code.&para;<br>We conclude that it did. Section 522 (by reference to&para;<br>California law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity&para;<br>in his home from the bankruptcy estate. §522(b)(3)(A).&para;<br>And it made that $75,000 “not liable for payment of any&para;<br>administrative expense.” §522(k).2 The reasonable attor­&para;<br>ney’s fees Siegel incurred defeating the “Lili Lin” lien were&para;<br>indubitably an administrative expense, as a short march&para;<br>through a few statutory cross-references makes plain:&para;<br>Section 503(b)(2) provides that administrative expenses&para;<br>include “compensation . . . awarded under” §330(a);&para;<br>§330(a)(1) authorizes “reasonable compensation for actual,&para;<br>necessary services rendered” by a “professional person&para;<br>employed under” §327; and §327(a) authorizes the trustee&para;<br>to “employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist&para;<br>the trustee in carrying out the trustee’s duties under this&para;<br>title.” Siegel argues that even though attorney’s fees&para;<br>incurred responding to a debtor’s fraud qualify as “admin­&para;<br>istrative expenses” for purposes of determining the trus­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The statute’s general rule that exempt assets are not liable for&para;<br>administrative expenses is subject to two narrow exceptions, both per­&para;<br>taining to the use of exempt assets to pay expenses associated with the&para;<br>avoidance of certain voidable transfers of exempt property. §522(k)(1)–&para;<br>(2). Neither of those exceptions is relevant here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tee’s right to reimbursement under §503(b), they do not so&para;<br>qualify for purposes of §522(k); but he gives us no reason&para;<br>to depart from the “ ‘normal rule of statutory construc­&para;<br>tion’ ” that words repeated in different parts of the same&para;<br>statute generally have the same meaning. See Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.&para;<br>332, 342 (1994) (quoting Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury,&para;<br>475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986)).&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court thus violated §522’s express&para;<br>terms when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law’s&para;<br>homestead exemption be made available to pay Siegel’s&para;<br>attorney’s fees, an administrative expense. In doing so,&para;<br>the court exceeded the limits of its authority under §105(a)&para;<br>and its inherent powers.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy&para;<br>court’s §105(a) and inherent powers may not be exercised&para;<br>in contravention of the Code. Instead, his main argument&para;<br>is that the Bankruptcy Court’s surcharge did not contra­&para;<br>vene §522. That statute, Siegel contends, “establish[es]&para;<br>the procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemp­&para;<br>tions” but “contains no directive requiring [courts] to allow&para;<br>[an exemption] regardless of the circumstances.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 35. Thus, he says, recognition of an equitable&para;<br>power in the Bankruptcy Court to deny an exemption by&para;<br>“surcharging” the exempt property in response to the&para;<br>debtor’s misconduct can coexist comfortably with §522.&para;<br>The United States, appearing in support of Siegel, agrees,&para;<br>arguing that §522 “neither gives debtors an absolute right&para;<br>to retain exempt property nor limits a court’s authority to&para;<br>impose an equitable surcharge on such property.” Brief&para;<br>for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.&para;<br>Insofar as Siegel and the United States equate the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court’s surcharge with an outright denial of&para;<br>Law’s homestead exemption, their arguments founder&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>upon this case’s procedural history. The Bankruptcy&para;<br>Appellate Panel stated that because no one “timely op­&para;<br>pose[d] [Law]’s homestead exemption claim,” the exemp­&para;<br>tion “became final” before the Bankruptcy Court imposed&para;<br>the surcharge. 2009 WL 7751415, at *2. We have held&para;<br>that a trustee’s failure to make a timely objection prevents&para;<br>him from challenging an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland &amp;&para;<br>Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643–644 (1992).&para;<br>But even assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have&para;<br>revisited Law’s entitlement to the exemption, §522 does&para;<br>not give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions&para;<br>based on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.&para;<br>Rather, the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that&para;<br>will render property exempt. See §522(b), (d). Siegel&para;<br>insists that because §522(b) says that the debtor “may&para;<br>exempt” certain property, rather than that he “shall be&para;<br>entitled” to do so, the court retains discretion to grant or&para;<br>deny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.&para;<br>But the subject of “may exempt” in §522(b) is the debtor,&para;<br>not the court, so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests&para;<br>discretion. A debtor need not invoke an exemption to&para;<br>which the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court&para;<br>may not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid&para;<br>statutory basis for doing so.&para;<br>Moreover, §522 sets forth a number of carefully cali­&para;<br>brated exceptions and limitations, some of which relate to&para;<br>the debtor’s misconduct. For example, §522(c) makes&para;<br>exempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition&para;<br>debts, including debts arising from tax fraud, fraud in&para;<br>connection with student loans, and other specified types of&para;<br>wrongdoing. Section 522(o) prevents a debtor from claim­&para;<br>ing a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the&para;<br>homestead with nonexempt property in the previous 10&para;<br>years “with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a credi­&para;<br>tor.” And §522(q) caps a debtor’s homestead exemption at&para;<br>approximately $150,000 (but does not eliminate it en­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tirely) where the debtor has been convicted of a felony that&para;<br>shows “that the filing of the case was an abuse of the&para;<br>provisions of ” the Code, or where the debtor owes a debt&para;<br>arising from specified wrongful acts—such as securities&para;<br>fraud, civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and&para;<br>Corrupt Organizations Act, or “any criminal act, inten­&para;<br>tional tort, or willful or reckless misconduct that caused&para;<br>serious physical injury or death to another individual&para;<br>in the preceding 5 years.” §522(q) and note following&para;<br>§522. The Code’s meticulous—not to say mind-numbingly&para;<br>detailed—enumeration of exemptions and exceptions to&para;<br>those exemptions confirms that courts are not authorized&para;<br>to create additional exceptions. See Hillman v. Maretta,&para;<br>569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12); TRW Inc. v.&para;<br>Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28–29 (2001).&para;<br>Siegel points out that a handful of courts have claimed&para;<br>authority to disallow an exemption (or to bar a debtor from&para;<br>amending his schedules to claim an exemption, which is&para;<br>much the same thing) based on the debtor’s fraudulent&para;<br>concealment of the asset alleged to be exempt. See, e.g.,&para;<br>In re Yonikus, 996 F. 2d 866, 872–873 (CA7 1993); In re&para;<br>Doan, 672 F. 2d 831, 833 (CA11 1982) ( per curiam); Stewart v. Ganey, 116 F. 2d 1010, 1011 (CA5 1940). He sug­&para;<br>gests that those decisions reflect a general, equitable&para;<br>power in bankruptcy courts to deny exemptions based on a&para;<br>debtor’s bad-faith conduct. For the reasons we have given,&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Code admits no such power. It is of course&para;<br>true that when a debtor claims a state-created exemption,&para;<br>the exemption’s scope is determined by state law, which&para;<br>may provide that certain types of debtor misconduct war­&para;<br>rant denial of the exemption. E.g., In re Sholdan, 217&para;<br>F. 3d 1006, 1008 (CA8 2000); see 4 Collier on Bankruptcy&para;<br>¶522.08[1]–[2], at 522–45 to 522–47. Some of the early&para;<br>decisions on which Siegel relies, and which the Fifth Cir­&para;<br>cuit cited in Stewart, are instances in which federal courts&para;<br>applied state law to disallow state-created exemptions.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>See In re Denson, 195 F. 857, 858 (ND Ala. 1912); Cowan&para;<br>v. Burchfield, 180 F. 614, 619 (ND Ala. 1910); In re Ansley&para;<br>Bros., 153 F. 983, 984 (EDNC 1907). But federal law&para;<br>provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an&para;<br>exemption on a ground not specified in the Code.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Our decision in Marrama v. Citizens Bank, on which&para;<br>Siegel and the United States heavily rely, does not point&para;<br>toward a different result. The question there was whether&para;<br>a debtor’s bad-faith conduct was a valid basis for a bank­&para;<br>ruptcy court to refuse to convert the debtor’s bankruptcy&para;<br>from a liquidation under Chapter 7 to a reorganization&para;<br>under Chapter 13. Although §706(a) of the Code gave the&para;<br>debtor a right to convert the case, §706(d) “expressly&para;<br>conditioned” that right on the debtor’s “ability to qualify as&para;<br>a ‘debtor’ under Chapter 13.” 549 U. S., at 372. And&para;<br>§1307(c) provided that a proceeding under Chapter 13&para;<br>could be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding&para;<br>“for cause,” which the Court interpreted to authorize&para;<br>dismissal or conversion for bad-faith conduct. In light of&para;<br>§1307(c), the Court held that the debtor’s bad faith could&para;<br>stop him from qualifying as a debtor under Chapter 13,&para;<br>thus preventing him from satisfying §706(d)’s express&para;<br>condition on conversion. Id., at 372–373. That holding&para;<br>has no relevance here, since no one suggests that Law&para;<br>failed to satisfy any express statutory condition on his&para;<br>claiming of the homestead exemption.&para;<br>True, the Court in Marrama also opined that the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Court’s refusal to convert the case was authorized&para;<br>under §105(a) and might have been authorized under the&para;<br>court’s inherent powers. Id., at 375–376. But even that&para;<br>dictum does not support Siegel’s position. In Marrama,&para;<br>the Court reasoned that if the case had been converted to&para;<br>Chapter 13, §1307(c) would have required it to be either&para;<br>dismissed or reconverted to Chapter 7 in light of the debt­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>or’s bad faith. Therefore, the Court suggested, even if the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court’s refusal to convert the case had not&para;<br>been expressly authorized by §706(d), that action could&para;<br>have been justified as a way of providing a “prompt, rather&para;<br>than a delayed, ruling on [the debtor’s] unmeritorious at­&para;<br>tempt to qualify” under §1307(c). Id., at 376. At most,&para;<br>Marrama’s dictum suggests that in some circumstances a&para;<br>bankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with&para;<br>futile procedural niceties in order to reach more expedi­&para;<br>tiously an end result required by the Code. Marrama&para;<br>most certainly did not endorse, even in dictum, the view&para;<br>that equitable considerations permit a bankruptcy court to&para;<br>contravene express provisions of the Code.&para;<br>D&para;<br>We acknowledge that our ruling forces Siegel to shoul­&para;<br>der a heavy financial burden resulting from Law’s egre­&para;<br>gious misconduct, and that it may produce inequitable&para;<br>results for trustees and creditors in other cases. We have&para;<br>recognized, however, that in crafting the provisions of&para;<br>§522, “Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemp­&para;<br>tion limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that&para;<br>exemptions visit on creditors.” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.&para;<br>770, 791 (2010). The same can be said of the limits im­&para;<br>posed on recovery of administrative expenses by trustees.&para;<br>For the reasons we have explained, it is not for courts to&para;<br>alter the balance struck by the statute. Cf. Guidry v.&para;<br>Sheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365,&para;<br>376–377 (1990).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Our decision today does not denude bankruptcy courts&para;<br>of the essential “authority to respond to debtor misconduct&para;<br>with meaningful sanctions.” Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 17. There is ample authority to deny the&para;<br>dishonest debtor a discharge. See §727(a)(2)–(6). (That&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>LAW v. SIEGEL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sanction lacks bite here, since by reason of a postpetition&para;<br>settlement between Siegel and Law’s major creditor, Law&para;<br>has no debts left to discharge; but that will not often be&para;<br>the case.) In addition, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Pro­&para;<br>cedure 9011—bankruptcy’s analogue to Civil Rule 11—&para;<br>authorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith&para;<br>litigation conduct, which may include “an order directing&para;<br>payment. . . of some or all of the reasonable attorneys’ fees&para;<br>and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the viola­&para;<br>tion.” Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(c)(2). The court may&para;<br>also possess further sanctioning authority under either&para;<br>§105(a) or its inherent powers. Cf. Chambers, 501 U. S.,&para;<br>at 45–49. And because it arises postpetition, a bankruptcy&para;<br>court’s monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case&para;<br>and is thereafter enforceable through the normal proce­&para;<br>dures for collecting money judgments. See §727(b). Fraud­&para;<br>ulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor&para;<br>to criminal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. §152, which&para;<br>carries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.&para;<br>But whatever other sanctions a bankruptcy court may&para;<br>impose on a dishonest debtor, it may not contravene ex­&para;<br>press provisions of the Bankruptcy Code by ordering that&para;<br>the debtor’s exempt property be used to pay debts and&para;<br>expenses for which that property is not liable under the&para;<br>Code.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
