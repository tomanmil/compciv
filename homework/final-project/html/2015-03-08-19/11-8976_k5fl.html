UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–8976. Argued November 6, 2012—Decided January 9, 2013&para;<br>Petitioner Smith claimed that conspiracy charges brought against him&para;<br>for his role in an illegal drug business, see 21 U. S. C. §846 and 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1962(d), were barred by 18 U. S. C. §3282’s 5-year statute of&para;<br>limitations. The District Court instructed the jury to convict Smith&para;<br>of each conspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith was a member of those conspiracies, and that the conspiracies continued within&para;<br>the applicable statute-of-limitations period. As to the affirmative defense of withdrawal from the conspiracy, the court instructed the jury&para;<br>that once the Government proved that Smith was a member of the&para;<br>conspiracy, Smith had the burden to prove withdrawal outside the&para;<br>statute of limitations by a preponderance of the evidence. Smith was&para;<br>convicted, and the D. C. Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: A defendant bears the burden of proving a defense of withdrawal.&para;<br>Pp. 3–8.&para;<br>(a) Allocating to the defendant the burden of proving withdrawal&para;<br>does not violate the Due Process Clause. Unless an affirmative defense negates an element of the crime, the Government has no constitutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.&para;<br>See Dixon v. United States, 548 U. S. 1, 6. Withdrawal does not negate an element of the conspiracy crimes charged here, but instead&para;<br>presupposes that the defendant committed the offense. Withdrawal&para;<br>terminates a defendant’s liability for his co-conspirators’ postwithdrawal acts, but he remains guilty of conspiracy.&para;<br>Withdrawal that occurs beyond the statute-of-limitations period&para;<br>provides a complete defense to prosecution, but does not render the&para;<br>underlying conduct noncriminal. Thus, while union of withdrawal&para;<br>with a statute-of-limitations defense can free a defendant of criminal&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>liability, it does not place upon the prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that he did not withdraw. As with other affirmative defenses, the burden is on him. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) Although Congress may assign the Government the burden of&para;<br>proving the nonexistence of withdrawal, it did not do so here. Because Congress did not address the burden of proof for withdrawal in&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §846 or 18 U. S. C. §1962(d), it is presumed that Congress&para;<br>intended to preserve the common-law rule that affirmative defenses&para;<br>are for the defendant to prove. Dixon, supra, at 13–14. The analysis&para;<br>does not change when withdrawal is the basis for a statute-oflimitations defense. In that circumstance, the Government need only&para;<br>prove that the conspiracy continued past the statute-of-limitations&para;<br>period. A conspiracy continues until it is terminated or, as to a particular defendant, until that defendant withdraws. And the burden&para;<br>of establishing withdrawal rests upon the defendant.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 9, 2013]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Upon joining a criminal conspiracy, a defendant’s membership in the ongoing unlawful scheme continues until he&para;<br>withdraws. A defendant who withdraws outside the relevant statute-of-limitations period has a complete defense&para;<br>to prosecution. We consider whether, when the defendant produces some evidence supporting such a defense,&para;<br>the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt&para;<br>that he did not withdraw outside the statute-of-limitations&para;<br>period.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Calvin Smith was indicted for crimes connected to his role in an organization that distributed&para;<br>cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in Washington, D. C., for about a decade. The 158-count indictment&para;<br>charged Smith and 16 alleged co-conspirators with conspiring to run, and actually running, an illegal drug business, as well as with committing acts of violence, including&para;<br>31 murders, to further their goals. Smith was tried alongside five codefendants. A jury of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia convicted him of (1)&para;<br>conspiracy to distribute narcotics and to possess narcotics&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with the intent to distribute them, in violation of 21&para;<br>U. S. C. §846; (2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) conspiracy, in violation of 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1962(d); (3) murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U. S. C.&para;<br>§848(e)(1)(A); and (4) four counts of murder while armed,&para;<br>in violation of D. C. Code §§22–2401 and 22–3202 (1996).1&para;<br>At issue here are Smith’s conspiracy convictions. Before&para;<br>trial, Smith moved to dismiss the conspiracy counts as&para;<br>barred by the applicable 5-year statute of limitations, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3282, because he had spent the last six years of&para;<br>the charged conspiracies in prison for a felony conviction.&para;<br>The court denied his motion and Smith renewed his&para;<br>statute-of-limitations defense at trial. In the final jury&para;<br>charge, the court instructed the jury to convict Smith of each&para;<br>conspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith&para;<br>was a member of those conspiracies, and that the conspiracies “continued in existence within five years” before the&para;<br>indictment. App. 289a, 300a.&para;<br>After it began deliberations, the jury asked the court&para;<br>what to do in the event that a defendant withdrew from&para;<br>the conspiracies outside the relevant limitations period.2&para;<br>Smith had not yet raised an affirmative defense of withdrawal, so the court for the first time instructed the jury&para;<br>on the defense. The court explained that “[t]he relevant&para;<br>date for purposes of determining the statute of limitations&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 On appeal, the D. C. Circuit remanded two of the murder counts for&para;<br>the District Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding whether&para;<br>Smith received ineffective assistance of counsel as to those convictions.&para;<br>United States v. Moore, 651 F. 3d 30, 89 (2011) (per curiam).&para;<br>2 The note to the judge inquired: “ ‘If we find that the Narcotics or&para;<br>RICO conspiracies continued after the relevant date under the statute&para;<br>of limitations, but that a particular defendant left the conspiracy before&para;<br>the relevant date under the statute of limitations, must we find that&para;<br>defendant not guilty? ’ ” App. 174a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>is the date, if any, on which a conspiracy concludes or a&para;<br>date on which that defendant withdrew from that conspiracy.” Id., at 328a. It defined withdrawal as “affirmative&para;<br>acts inconsistent with the goals of the conspiracy” that&para;<br>“were communicated to the defendant’s coconspirators in&para;<br>a manner reasonably calculated to reach those conspirators.” “Withdrawal,” the court instructed, “must be unequivocal.” Ibid. Over the defense’s objection, the court&para;<br>told the jury that “[o]nce the government has proven that&para;<br>a defendant was a member of a conspiracy, the burden is&para;<br>on the defendant to prove withdrawal from a conspiracy&para;<br>by a preponderance of the evidence.” Ibid. The jury then&para;<br>convicted Smith of the conspiracy crimes.&para;<br>As relevant here, the Court of Appeals affirmed Smith’s&para;<br>conspiracy convictions. Recognizing that the Circuits are&para;<br>divided on which party bears the burden of proving or disproving a defense of withdrawal prior to the limitations&para;<br>period, the court concluded that the defendant bears the&para;<br>burden of proof and that such a disposition does not violate the Due Process Clause. United States v. Moore, 651&para;<br>F. 3d 30, 89–90 (CADC 2011) (per curiam). We granted&para;<br>certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Petitioner’s claim lies at the intersection of a withdrawal&para;<br>defense and a statute-of-limitations defense. He asserts&para;<br>that once he presented evidence that he ended his membership in the conspiracy prior to the statute-oflimitations period, it became the Government’s burden to&para;<br>prove that his individual participation in the conspiracy&para;<br>persisted within the applicable five-year window. This&para;<br>position draws support neither from the Constitution (as&para;<br>discussed in this Part II), nor from the conspiracy and&para;<br>limitations statutes at issue (as discussed in Part III,&para;<br>infra). Establishing individual withdrawal was a burden&para;<br>that rested firmly on the defendant regardless of when the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>purported withdrawal took place.&para;<br>Allocating to a defendant the burden of proving withdrawal does not violate the Due Process Clause. While the&para;<br>Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt “every&para;<br>fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the defendant] is charged,” In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364&para;<br>(1970), “[p]roof of the nonexistence of all affirmative defenses has never been constitutionally required,” Patterson&para;<br>v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). The State is foreclosed from shifting the burden of proof to the defendant&para;<br>only “when an affirmative defense does negate an element&para;<br>of the crime.” Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 237 (1987)&para;<br>(Powell, J., dissenting). Where instead it “excuse[s] conduct that would otherwise be punishable,” but “does not&para;<br>controvert any of the elements of the offense itself,” the&para;<br>Government has no constitutional duty to overcome the&para;<br>defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Dixon v. United&para;<br>States, 548 U. S. 1, 6 (2006).&para;<br>Withdrawal does not negate an element of the conspiracy crimes charged here. The essence of conspiracy is “the&para;<br>combination of minds in an unlawful purpose.” United&para;<br>States v. Hirsch, 100 U. S. 33, 34 (1879). To convict a defendant of narcotics or RICO conspiracy, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that two or&para;<br>more people agreed to commit a crime covered by the&para;<br>specific conspiracy statute (that a conspiracy existed) and&para;<br>that the defendant knowingly and willfully participated in&para;<br>the agreement (that he was a member of the conspiracy).3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Narcotics&para;<br>&para;<br>conspiracy under 21 U. S. C. §846 criminalizes “conspir[ing] to commit any offense” under the Controlled Substances&para;<br>Act, including the knowing distribution of, or possession with intent to&para;<br>distribute, controlled substances, §841(a)(1). Section 1962(d) of Title 18&para;<br>makes it unlawful to “conspire to violate” RICO, which makes it unlawful, among other things, “for any person employed by or associated with&para;<br>any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or&para;<br>foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Far from contradicting an element of the offense, withdrawal presupposes that the defendant committed the&para;<br>offense. Withdrawal achieves more modest ends than&para;<br>exoneration. Since conspiracy is a continuing offense,&para;<br>United States v. Kissel, 218 U. S. 601, 610 (1910), a defendant who has joined a conspiracy continues to violate&para;<br>the law “through every moment of [the conspiracy’s] existence,” Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 369 (1912),&para;<br>and he becomes responsible for the acts of his coconspirators in pursuit of their common plot, Pinkerton v.&para;<br>United States, 328 U. S. 640, 646 (1946). Withdrawal&para;<br>terminates the defendant’s liability for postwithdrawal&para;<br>acts of his co-conspirators, but he remains guilty of&para;<br>conspiracy.&para;<br>Withdrawal also starts the clock running on the time&para;<br>within which the defendant may be prosecuted, and provides a complete defense when the withdrawal occurs&para;<br>beyond the applicable statute-of-limitations period.4 A&para;<br>complete defense, however, is not necessarily one that&para;<br>establishes the defendant’s innocence. For example, we&para;<br>have held that although self-defense may entirely excuse&para;<br>or justify aggravated murder, “the elements of aggravated&para;<br>murder and self-defense [do not] overlap in the sense that&para;<br>evidence to prove the latter will often tend to negate the&para;<br>former.” Martin, supra, at 234; see Leland v. Oregon, 343&para;<br>U. S. 790, 794–796 (1952) (same for insanity defense).&para;<br>Likewise, although the statute of limitations may inhibit&para;<br>——————&para;<br>conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering&para;<br>activity,” §1962(c).&para;<br>4 The conspiracy statutes at issue here do not contain their own limitations periods, but are governed by §3282(a), which provides: “Except&para;<br>as otherwise expressly provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted,&para;<br>tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is&para;<br>found or the information is instituted within five years next after such&para;<br>offense shall have been committed.” At the time petitioner was indicted, §3282 contained no subsections; what was the full text of the section is now subsection (a).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>prosecution, it does not render the underlying conduct&para;<br>noncriminal. Commission of the crime within the statuteof-limitations period is not an element of the conspiracy&para;<br>offense. See United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. 168, 180&para;<br>(1872). The Government need not allege the time of the&para;<br>offense in the indictment, id., at 179–180, and it is up to&para;<br>the defendant to raise the limitations defense, Biddinger&para;<br>v. Commissioner of Police of City of New York, 245 U. S.&para;<br>128, 135 (1917). A statute-of-limitations defense does not&para;<br>call the criminality of the defendant’s conduct into question, but rather reflects a policy judgment by the legislature that the lapse of time may render criminal acts ill&para;<br>suited for prosecution. See, e.g., Toussie v. United States,&para;<br>397 U. S. 112, 114–115 (1970). Thus, although union of&para;<br>withdrawal with a statute-of-limitations defense can free&para;<br>the defendant of criminal liability, it does not place upon&para;<br>the prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that&para;<br>he did not withdraw. As with other affirmative defenses,&para;<br>the burden is on him.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Of course, Congress may choose to assign the Government the burden of proving the nonexistence of withdrawal,&para;<br>even if that is not constitutionally required. It did not&para;<br>do so here. “[T]he common-law rule was that affirmative&para;<br>defenses . . . were matters for the defendant to prove.”&para;<br>Martin, supra, at 235; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries&para;<br>on the Laws of England 201 (1769). Because Congress did&para;<br>not address in 21 U. S. C. §846 or 18 U. S. C. §1962(d)&para;<br>the burden of proof for withdrawal, we presume that Congress intended to preserve the common-law rule. Dixon, 548&para;<br>U. S., at 13–14.&para;<br>That Congress left the traditional burden of proof undisturbed is both practical and fair. “ ‘[W]here the facts with&para;<br>regard to an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a&para;<br>party,’ ” that party is best situated to bear the burden of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>proof. Id., at 9. On the matter of withdrawal, the informational asymmetry heavily favors the defendant. Passive nonparticipation in the continuing scheme is not&para;<br>enough to sever the meeting of minds that constitutes the&para;<br>conspiracy. “[T]o avert a continuing criminality” there&para;<br>must be “affirmative action . . . to disavow or defeat the&para;<br>purpose” of the conspiracy. Hyde, supra, at 369. The&para;<br>defendant knows what steps, if any, he took to dissociate&para;<br>from his confederates. He can testify to his act of withdrawal or direct the court to other evidence substantiating&para;<br>his claim.5 It would be nearly impossible for the Government to prove the negative that an act of withdrawal never happened. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486,&para;<br>p. 288 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (“It is often said that the&para;<br>burden is upon the party having in form the affirmative&para;<br>allegation”). Witnesses with the primary power to refute a&para;<br>withdrawal defense will often be beyond the Government’s&para;<br>reach: The defendant’s co-conspirators are likely to invoke&para;<br>their right against self-incrimination rather than explain&para;<br>their unlawful association with him.&para;<br>Here again, the analysis does not change when withdrawal is the basis for a statute-of-limitations defense. To&para;<br>be sure, we have held that the Government must prove&para;<br>the time of the conspiracy offense if a statute-of-limitations&para;<br>defense is raised. Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S.&para;<br>391, 396 (1957). But the Government satisfied that burden here when it proved that the conspiracy continued&para;<br>past the statute-of-limitations period. For the offense in&para;<br>these conspiracy prosecutions was not the initial act of&para;<br>agreement, but the banding-together against the law&para;<br>effected by that act, which continues until termination of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Here, Smith introduced a stipulation of his dates spent incarcerated,&para;<br>as well as “testimonial evidence showing that he was no longer a&para;<br>member of the charged conspiracies during his incarceration.” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 3. The jury found that this did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence an affirmative act of withdrawal.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the conspiracy or, as to a particular defendant, until that&para;<br>defendant’s withdrawal. And as we have discussed, the&para;<br>burden of establishing that withdrawal rests upon the&para;<br>defendant.&para;<br>Petitioner’s claim that assertion of a statute-oflimitations defense shifts that burden is incompatible with&para;<br>the established proposition that a defendant’s membership&para;<br>in the conspiracy, and his responsibility for its acts, endures even if he is entirely inactive after joining it. (“As&para;<br>he has started evil forces he must withdraw his support&para;<br>from them or incur the guilt of their continuance.” Hyde,&para;<br>225 U. S., at 369–370.) For as a practical matter, the only&para;<br>way the Government would be able to establish a failure&para;<br>to withdraw would be to show active participation in the&para;<br>conspiracy during the limitations period.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Having joined forces to achieve collectively more evil&para;<br>than he could accomplish alone, Smith tied his fate to that&para;<br>of the group. His individual change of heart (assuming it&para;<br>occurred) could not put the conspiracy genie back in the&para;<br>bottle. We punish him for the havoc wreaked by the unlawful scheme, whether or not he remained actively involved. It is his withdrawal that must be active, and it&para;<br>was his burden to show that.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
