NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK&para;<br>&para;<br>LTD. ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1191. Argued March 29, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010&para;<br>In 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank&para;<br>whose “ordinary shares” are not traded on any exchange in this coun&para;<br>try, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquar&para;<br>tered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgages—&para;<br>seeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc. In 2001, National&para;<br>had to write down the value of HomeSide’s assets, causing National’s&para;<br>share prices to fall. Petitioners, Australians who purchased Na&para;<br>tional’s shares before the write-downs, sued respondents—National,&para;<br>HomeSide, and officers of both companies—in Federal District Court&para;<br>for violation of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act&para;<br>of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b–5. They claimed that HomeSide and its&para;<br>officers had manipulated financial models to make the company’s&para;<br>mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really&para;<br>were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of&para;<br>this deception. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject&para;<br>matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)&para;<br>and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The District&para;<br>Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the&para;<br>domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that con&para;<br>cluded abroad. The Second Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Second Circuit erred in considering §10(b)’s extraterritorial&para;<br>reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing&para;<br>dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). What conduct §10(b) reaches is a mer&para;<br>its question, while subject-matter jurisdiction “refers to a tribunal’s&para;<br>power to hear a case.” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Loco&para;<br>motive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The&para;<br>District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U. S. C. §78aa to adjudicate&para;<br>the §10(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of&para;<br>that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule&para;<br>12(b)(6). Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>2. Section 10(b) does not provide a cause of action to foreign plain&para;<br>tiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in con&para;<br>nection with securities traded on foreign exchanges. Pp. 5–24.&para;<br>(a) It is a “longstanding principle of American law ‘that legisla&para;<br>tion of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply&para;<br>only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.’ ” EEOC&para;<br>v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (Aramco). When a&para;<br>statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it&para;<br>has none. Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange&para;<br>Act’s silence about §10(b)’s extraterritorial application permitted the&para;<br>court to “discern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute&para;<br>to apply. This disregard of the presumption against extraterritorial&para;<br>ity has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and&para;<br>has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent&para;<br>that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.&para;<br>The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against ex&para;<br>traterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court&para;<br>applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background&para;<br>against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects. Pp. 5–&para;<br>12.&para;<br>(b) Because Rule 10b–5 was promulgated under §10(b), it “does&para;<br>not extend beyond conduct encompassed by §10(b)’s prohibition.”&para;<br>United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651. Thus, if §10(b) is not&para;<br>extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b–5. On its face, §10(b) contains&para;<br>nothing to suggest that it applies abroad. Contrary to the argument&para;<br>of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign&para;<br>commerce in the definition of “interstate commerce,” see 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§78c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritorial&para;<br>ity, Aramco, supra, at 251. Nor does a fleeting reference, in §78b(2)’s&para;<br>description of the Exchange Act’s purposes, to the dissemination and&para;<br>quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities. Nor does&para;<br>Exchange Act §30(b), which says that the Act does not apply “to any&para;<br>person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the ju&para;<br>risdiction of the United States,” unless he does so in violation of regu&para;<br>lations promulgated by the SEC “to prevent . . . evasion of [the Act].”&para;<br>This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has ex&para;<br>traterritorial application; the Commission’s enabling regulations pre&para;<br>venting “evasion” seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal&para;<br>a domestic violation. The argument of petitioners and the Solicitor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>General also fails to account for §30(a), which explicitly provides for a&para;<br>specific extraterritorial application. That provision would be quite&para;<br>superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to trans&para;<br>actions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of that application to&para;<br>securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative. There being no&para;<br>affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that §10(b) applies extra&para;<br>territorially, it does not. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(c) The domestic activity in this case—Florida is where HomeSide and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and&para;<br>where some misleading public statements were made—does not&para;<br>mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act. It is a&para;<br>rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all con&para;<br>tact with United States territory. In Aramco, for example, where the&para;<br>plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see&para;<br>499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the “focus” of congres&para;<br>sional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither&para;<br>that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employ&para;<br>ment. Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Act’s focus is not&para;<br>on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and&para;<br>sales of securities in the United States. Section 10(b) applies only to&para;<br>transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic&para;<br>transactions in other securities. The primacy of the domestic ex&para;<br>change is suggested by the Exchange Act’s prologue, see 48 Stat. 881,&para;<br>and by the fact that the Act’s registration requirements apply only to&para;<br>securities listed on national securities exchanges, §78l(a). This focus&para;<br>is also strongly confirmed by §30(a) and (b). Moreover, the Court re&para;<br>jects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this coun&para;<br>try affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason&para;<br>that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probabil&para;<br>ity of incompatibility with other countries’ laws is so obvious that if&para;<br>Congress intended such foreign application “it would have addressed&para;<br>the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.” 499 U. S.,&para;<br>at 256. Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual&para;<br>support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a viola&para;<br>tion where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the&para;<br>United States.

Its Ordinary Shares—what in America would be&para;<br>called “common stock”—are traded on the Australian&para;<br>Stock Exchange Limited and on other foreign securities&para;<br>exchanges, but not on any exchange in the United States.&para;<br>There are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, how­&para;<br>ever, National’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs),&para;<br>which represent the right to receive a specified number of&para;<br>National’s Ordinary Shares. 547 F. 3d 167, 168, and n. 1&para;<br>(CA2 2008).&para;<br>The complaint alleges the following facts, which we&para;<br>accept as true. In February 1998, National bought re­&para;<br>spondent HomeSide Lending, Inc., a mortgage servicing&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>company headquartered in Florida. HomeSide’s business&para;<br>was to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the&para;<br>administrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage&para;<br>payments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and&para;<br>Financial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to re­&para;<br>ceive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can&para;<br>provide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Pal­&para;<br>grave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman,&para;<br>M. Milgate, &amp; J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of&para;<br>the rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the&para;<br>mortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is&para;<br>due, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calcu­&para;<br>lated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by&para;<br>using valuation models designed to take this likelihood&para;<br>into account. It recorded the value of its assets, and the&para;<br>numbers appeared in National’s financial statements.&para;<br>From 1998 until 2001, National’s annual reports and&para;<br>other public documents touted the success of HomeSide’s&para;<br>business, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National’s&para;<br>managing director and chief executive officer), Kevin Race&para;<br>(HomeSide’s chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris&para;<br>(HomeSide’s chief executive officer) did the same in public&para;<br>statements. But on July 5, 2001, National announced that&para;<br>it was writing down the value of HomeSide’s assets by&para;<br>$450 million; and then again on September 3, by another&para;<br>$1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and&para;<br>ADRs slumped. After downplaying the July write-down,&para;<br>National explained the September write-down as the&para;<br>result of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing&para;<br>interest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinanc­&para;<br>ings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other&para;<br>mistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the&para;<br>loss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however,&para;<br>HomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior&para;<br>executive who is also a respondent here had manipulated&para;<br>HomeSide’s financial models to make the rates of early&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>repayment unrealistically low in order to cause the mort­&para;<br>gage-servicing rights to appear more valuable than they&para;<br>really were. The complaint also alleges that National and&para;<br>Cicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did&para;<br>nothing about it.&para;<br>As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and&para;<br>Brian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased&para;<br>National’s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the&para;<br>write-downs.1 They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto,&para;<br>and the three HomeSide executives in the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Southern District of New York for&para;<br>alleged violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and&para;<br>Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §§78j(b)&para;<br>and 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5&para;<br>(2009), promulgated pursuant to §10(b).2 They sought to&para;<br>represent a class of foreign purchasers of National’s Ordi­&para;<br>nary Shares during a specified period up to the September&para;<br>write-down. 547 F. 3d, at 169.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Robert Morrison, an American investor in National’s ADRs, also&para;<br>brought suit, but his claims were dismissed by the District Court&para;<br>because he failed to allege damages. In re National Australia Bank&para;<br>Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *9&para;<br>(SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006). Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547&para;<br>F. 3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us.&para;<br>Inexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the&para;<br>Court of Appeals and here.&para;<br>2 The relevant text of §10(b) and SEC Rule 10b–5 are set forth later in&para;<br>this opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 899, provides:&para;<br>“Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable&para;<br>under any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation&para;<br>thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the&para;<br>same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such&para;<br>controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good&para;<br>faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constitut­&para;<br>ing the violation or cause of action.”&para;<br>Liability under §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some&para;<br>other provision of the Exchange Act; §10(b) is the only basis petitioners&para;<br>asserted.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter&para;<br>jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)&para;<br>and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The&para;<br>District Court granted the motion on the former ground,&para;<br>finding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country&para;<br>were, “at most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall&para;<br>securities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.” In re&para;<br>National Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ.&para;<br>6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on&para;<br>similar grounds. The acts performed in the United States&para;<br>did not “compris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.” 547&para;<br>F. 3d, at 175–176. We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Before addressing the question presented, we must&para;<br>correct a threshold error in the Second Circuit’s analysis.&para;<br>It considered the extraterritorial reach of §10(b) to raise a&para;<br>question of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it af­&para;<br>firmed the District Court’s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).&para;<br>See 547 F. 3d, at 177. In this regard it was following&para;<br>Circuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405&para;<br>F. 2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405&para;<br>F. 2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in&para;<br>taking this position, see, e.g., In re CP Ships Ltd. Securi&para;<br>ties Litigation, 578 F. 3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Conti&para;<br>nental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.,&para;<br>592 F. 2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).&para;<br>But to ask what conduct §10(b) reaches is to ask what&para;<br>conduct §10(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.&para;<br>Subject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, “refers to a tribu­&para;<br>nal’s ‘ “power to hear a case.” ’ ” Union Pacific R. Co. v.&para;<br>Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Ad&para;<br>justment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip&para;<br>op., at 12) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>514 (2006), in turn quoting United States v. Cotton, 535&para;<br>U. S. 625, 630 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate&para;<br>from the question whether the allegations the plaintiff&para;<br>makes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.&para;<br>678, 682 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction&para;<br>under 15 U. S. C. §78aa3 to adjudicate the question&para;<br>whether §10(b) applies to National’s conduct.&para;<br>In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute,&para;<br>petitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary.&para;<br>Since nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on&para;<br>the mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule&para;<br>12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we&para;<br>have done before in situations like this, see, e.g., Romero v.&para;<br>International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359,&para;<br>381–384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petition­&para;<br>ers’ allegations state a claim.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>It is a “longstanding principle of American law ‘that&para;<br>legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears,&para;<br>is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of&para;<br>the United States.’ ” EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,&para;<br>499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco) (quoting Foley Bros.,&para;<br>Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). This principle&para;<br>represents a canon of construction, or a presumption about&para;<br>a statute’s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress’s&para;<br>power to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284&para;<br>U. S. 421, 437 (1932). It rests on the perception that&para;<br>Congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Section&para;<br>&para;<br>78aa provides:&para;<br>“The district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive&para;<br>jurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula­&para;<br>tions thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought&para;<br>to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the&para;<br>rules and regulations thereunder.”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U. S.&para;<br>197, 204, n. 5 (1993). Thus, “unless there is the affirma­&para;<br>tive intention of the Congress clearly expressed” to give a&para;<br>statute extraterritorial effect, “we must presume it is&para;<br>primarily concerned with domestic conditions.” Aramco,&para;<br>supra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). The&para;<br>canon or presumption applies regardless of whether there&para;<br>is a risk of conflict between the American statute and a&para;<br>foreign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509&para;<br>U. S. 155, 173–174 (1993). When a statute gives no clear&para;<br>indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.&para;<br>Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often&para;<br>recited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that,&para;<br>because the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterrito­&para;<br>rial application of §10(b), it was left to the court to “dis­&para;<br>cern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute to&para;<br>apply. See 547 F. 3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). This disregard of the presumption against ex­&para;<br>traterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many&para;<br>decades by various courts of appeals in determining the&para;<br>application of the Exchange Act, and §10(b) in particular,&para;<br>to fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects&para;<br>abroad. That has produced a collection of tests for divin­&para;<br>ing what Congress would have wanted, complex in formu­&para;<br>lation and unpredictable in application.&para;<br>As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern Dis­&para;<br>trict of New York had consistently concluded that, by&para;<br>reason of the presumption against extraterritoriality,&para;<br>§10(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underly­&para;<br>ing the violation occurred abroad. See Schoenbaum v.&para;<br>Firstbrook, 268 F. Supp. 385, 392 (1967) (citing Ferraoli v.&para;<br>Cantor, CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. ¶91615 (SDNY 1965) and&para;<br>Kook v. Crang, 182 F. Supp. 388, 390 (SDNY 1960)).&para;<br>Schoenbaum involved the sale in Canada of the treasury&para;<br>shares of a Canadian corporation whose publicly traded&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>shares (but not, of course, its treasury shares) were listed&para;<br>on both the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto&para;<br>Stock Exchange. Invoking the presumption against extra­&para;<br>territoriality, the court held that §10(b) was inapplicable&para;<br>(though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional).&para;<br>268 F. Supp., at 391–392, 393–394. The decision in&para;<br>Schoenbaum was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit&para;<br>opinion which held that “neither the usual presumption&para;<br>against extraterritorial application of legislation nor the&para;<br>specific language of [§]30(b) show Congressional intent to&para;<br>preclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions&para;<br>regarding stocks traded in the United States which are&para;<br>effected outside the United States . . . .” Schoenbaum, 405&para;<br>F. 2d, at 206. It sufficed to apply §10(b) that, although the&para;<br>transactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they&para;<br>affected the value of the common shares publicly traded in&para;<br>the United States. See id., at 208–209. Application of&para;<br>§10(b), the Second Circuit found, was “necessary to protect&para;<br>American investors,” id., at 206.&para;<br>The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data&para;<br>Processing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (1972),&para;<br>which involved an American company that had been&para;<br>fraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There,&para;<br>unlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had&para;<br>occurred in the United States but the corporation whose&para;<br>securities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any&para;<br>domestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption&para;<br>against extraterritoriality apples only to matters over&para;<br>which the United States would not have prescriptive&para;<br>jurisdiction, 468 F. 2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive&para;<br>jurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this coun­&para;<br>try, the language of the Act could be read to cover that&para;<br>conduct, and the court concluded that “if Congress had&para;<br>thought about the point,” it would have wanted §10(b) to&para;<br>apply. Id., at 1334–1337.&para;<br>With Schoenbaum and Leasco on the books, the Second&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Circuit had excised the presumption against extraterrito­&para;<br>riality from the jurisprudence of §10(b) and replaced it&para;<br>with the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and&para;<br>hence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the&para;<br>statute to a given situation. As long as there was pre­&para;<br>scriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit ex­&para;<br>plained, whether to apply §10(b) even to “predominantly&para;<br>foreign” transactions became a matter of whether a court&para;<br>thought Congress “wished the precious resources of United&para;<br>States courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted&para;<br>to them rather than leave the problem to foreign coun­&para;<br>tries.” Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F. 2d 974, 985&para;<br>(1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1017–&para;<br>1018 (CA2 1975).&para;<br>The Second Circuit had thus established that applica­&para;<br>tion of §10(b) could be premised upon either some effect on&para;<br>American securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or&para;<br>significant conduct in the United States (Leasco). It later&para;<br>formalized these two applications into (1) an “effects test,”&para;<br>“whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in&para;<br>the United States or upon United States citizens,” and (2)&para;<br>a “conduct test,” “whether the wrongful conduct occurred&para;<br>in the United States.” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 192–&para;<br>193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Sec­&para;<br>ond Circuit’s §10(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to&para;<br>what Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second&para;<br>Circuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the&para;<br>ground that “an admixture or combination of the two often&para;<br>gives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United&para;<br>States involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by&para;<br>an American court.” Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54&para;<br>F. 3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put for­&para;<br>ward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.&para;<br>As early as Bersch, it confessed that “if we were asked to&para;<br>point to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative&para;<br>history, that compelled these conclusions, we would be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unable to respond,” 519 F. 2d, at 993.&para;<br>As they developed, these tests were not easy to adminis­&para;<br>ter. The conduct test was held to apply differently de­&para;<br>pending on whether the harmed investors were Americans&para;<br>or foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of&para;<br>losses to American investors abroad, it was enough that&para;<br>acts “of material importance” performed in the United&para;<br>States “significantly contributed” to that result; whereas&para;<br>those acts must have “directly caused” the result when&para;<br>losses to foreigners abroad were at issue. See Bersch, 519&para;<br>F. 2d, at 993. And “merely preparatory activities in the&para;<br>United States” did not suffice “to trigger application of the&para;<br>securities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.”&para;<br>Id., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between&para;<br>mere preparation and using the United States as a “base”&para;<br>for fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra,&para;<br>at 1017–1018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was&para;<br>sometimes insufficient without “ ‘some additional factor&para;<br>tipping the scales’ ” in favor of the application of American&para;<br>law. Interbrew v. Edperbrascan Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 425,&para;<br>432 (SDNY 1998) (quoting Europe &amp; Overseas Commodity&para;<br>Traders, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118,&para;<br>129 (CA2 1998)). District courts have noted the difficulty&para;<br>of applying such vague formulations. See, e.g., In re&para;<br>Alstom SA, 406 F. Supp. 2d 346, 366–385 (SDNY 2005).&para;<br>There is no more damning indictment of the “conduct” and&para;<br>“effects” tests than the Second Circuit’s own declaration&para;<br>that “the presence or absence of any single factor which&para;<br>was considered significant in other cases . . . is not neces­&para;<br>sarily dispositive in future cases.” IIT v. Cornfeld, 619&para;<br>F. 2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit’s approach,&para;<br>though not its precise application. Like the Second Cir­&para;<br>cuit, they described their decisions regarding the extrater­&para;<br>ritorial application of §10(b) as essentially resolving mat­&para;<br>ters of policy. See, e.g., SEC v. Kasser, 548 F. 2d 109, 116&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(CA3 1977); Continental Grain, 592 F. 2d, at 421–422;&para;<br>Grunenthal GmbH v. Hotz, 712 F. 2d 421, 424–425 (CA9&para;<br>1983); Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, 149 F. 3d 659, 667&para;<br>(CA7 1998). While applying the same fundamental meth­&para;<br>odology of balancing interests and arriving at what&para;<br>seemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of&para;<br>vaguely related variations on the “conduct” and “effects”&para;<br>tests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion:&para;<br>“Although the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are&para;<br>some transnational situations to which the antifraud&para;<br>provisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement&para;<br>appears to end at that point.”4 Id., at 665. See also id., at&para;<br>665–667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits&para;<br>and adopting yet another variation).&para;<br>At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of&para;<br>cases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.&para;<br>In Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 32&para;<br>(1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed&para;<br>that rather than courts’ “divining what ‘Congress would&para;<br>have wished’ if it had addressed the problem[, a] more&para;<br>natural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The principal concurrence (see post, p. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization,&para;<br>launching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure&para;<br>(and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice&para;<br>Rehnquist’s statement in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421&para;<br>U. S. 723, 737 (1975) that “[w]hen we deal with private actions under&para;<br>Rule 10b–5, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little&para;<br>more than a legislative acorn.” Post, at 3. The concurrence seemingly&para;<br>believes that the Courts of Appeals have carefully trimmed and&para;<br>sculpted this “judicial oak” into a cohesive canopy, under the watchful&para;<br>eye of Judge Henry Friendly, the “master arborist,” ibid. See post, at&para;<br>2–3. Even if one thinks that the “conduct” and “effects” tests are&para;<br>numbered among Judge Friendly’s many fine contributions to the law,&para;<br>his successors, though perhaps under the impression that they nurture&para;<br>the same mighty oak, are in reality tending each its own botanically&para;<br>distinct tree. It is telling that the concurrence never attempts its own&para;<br>synthesis of the various balancing tests the Circuits have adopted.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

See also Robinson v. TCI/US&para;<br>West Communications Inc., 117 F. 3d 900, 906–907 (CA5&para;<br>1997) (expressing agreement with Zoelsch’s criticism of&para;<br>the emphasis on policy considerations in some of the&para;<br>cases).&para;<br>Commentators have criticized the unpredictable and&para;<br>inconsistent application of §10(b) to transnational cases.&para;<br>See, e.g., Choi &amp; Silberman, Transnational Litigation and&para;<br>Global Securities Class-Action Lawsuits, 2009 Wis.

Probs. 241, 244–248&para;<br>(1992). Some have challenged the premise underlying the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals’ approach, namely that Congress did not&para;<br>consider the extraterritorial application of §10(b) (thereby&para;<br>leaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine&para;<br>what Congress would have wanted). See, e.g., Sachs, The&para;<br>International Reach of Rule 10b–5: The Myth of Congres­&para;<br>sional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat’l L. 677 (1990) (ar­&para;<br>guing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the&para;<br>Exchange Act to transactions abroad). Others, more&para;<br>fundamentally, have noted that using congressional si­&para;<br>lence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the&para;<br>traditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial&para;<br>application. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad):&para;<br>A Proposal for A New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to&para;<br>the Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provi­&para;<br>sions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law &amp; Pol’y&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Int’l Bus. 477, 492–493 (1997).&para;<br>The criticisms seem to us justified. The results of judi­&para;<br>cial-speculation-made-law—divining what Congress would&para;<br>have wanted if it had thought of the situation before the&para;<br>court—demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption&para;<br>against extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in&para;<br>each case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserv­&para;<br>ing a stable background against which Congress can legis­&para;<br>late with predictable effects.5&para;<br>B&para;<br>Rule 10b–5, the regulation under which petitioners have&para;<br>brought suit,6 was promulgated under §10(b), and “does&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The concurrence urges us to cast aside our inhibitions and join in&para;<br>the judicial lawmaking, because “[t]his entire area of law is replete with&para;<br>judge-made rules,” post, at 3. It is doubtless true that, because the&para;<br>implied private cause of action under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 is a thing&para;<br>of our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue&para;<br>Chip Stamps, supra. But when it comes to “the scope of [the] conduct&para;<br>prohibited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute controls&para;<br>our decision.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of&para;<br>Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). It is only with respect to the&para;<br>additional “elements of the 10b–5 private liability scheme” that we&para;<br>“have had ‘to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the&para;<br>issue[s] had the 10b–5 action been included as an express provision in&para;<br>the 1934 Act.’ ” Ibid.

Therefore, if §10(b) is not extraterritorial, neither&para;<br>is Rule 10b–5.&para;<br>On its face, §10(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies&para;<br>abroad:&para;<br>“It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi­&para;<br>rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of&para;<br>interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility&para;<br>of any national securities exchange . . .

But “we have repeatedly held that even stat­&para;<br>utes that contain broad language in their definitions of&para;<br>‘commerce’ that expressly refer to ‘foreign commerce’ do&para;<br>not apply abroad.” Aramco, 499 U.

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>toriality.7&para;<br>Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that&para;<br>Congress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act,&para;<br>observed that the “prices established and offered in such&para;<br>transactions are generally disseminated and quoted&para;<br>throughout the United States and foreign countries.” 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §78b(2). The antecedent of “such transactions,”&para;<br>however, is found in the first sentence of the section,&para;<br>which declares that “transactions in securities as com­&para;<br>monly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the­&para;<br>counter markets are affected with a national public inter­&para;<br>est.” §78b. Nothing suggests that this national public&para;<br>interest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign&para;<br>exchanges and markets. The fleeting reference to the&para;<br>dissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securi­&para;<br>ties traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot&para;<br>overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.&para;<br>Finally, there is §30(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§78dd(b), which does mention the Act’s extraterritorial&para;<br>application: “The provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of&para;<br>any rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any&para;<br>person insofar as he transacts a business in securities&para;<br>without the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he&para;<br>does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the&para;<br>Securities and Exchange Commission “to prevent . . .&para;<br>evasion of [the Act].” (The parties have pointed us to no&para;<br>regulation promulgated pursuant to §30(b).)

S. C. §78c(a)(17). For example, an issuer based abroad, whose&para;<br>executives approve the publication in the United States of misleading&para;<br>information affecting the price of the issuer’s securities traded on the&para;<br>New York Stock Exchange, probably will make use of some instrumen­&para;<br>tality of “communication . . . between [a] foreign country and [a] State.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

In the first place, it would be odd&para;<br>for Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of&para;<br>the whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing&para;<br>a condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the&para;<br>whole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission’s&para;<br>enabling regulations be limited to those preventing “eva­&para;<br>sion” of the Act, rather than all those preventing “viola­&para;<br>tion”? The provision seems to us directed at actions&para;<br>abroad that might conceal a domestic violation, or might&para;<br>cause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to&para;<br>escape on a technicality. At most, the Solicitor General’s&para;<br>proposed inference is possible; but possible interpretations&para;<br>of statutory language do not override the presumption&para;<br>against extraterritoriality. See Aramco, supra, at 253.&para;<br>The Solicitor General also fails to account for §30(a),&para;<br>which reads in relevant part as follows:&para;<br>“It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer . . . to&para;<br>make use of the mails or of any means or instrumen­&para;<br>tality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effect­&para;<br>ing on an exchange not within or subject to the juris­&para;<br>diction of the United States, any transaction in any&para;<br>security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is or­&para;<br>ganized under the laws of, or has its principal place of&para;<br>business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdic­&para;<br>tion of the United States, in contravention of such&para;<br>rules and regulations as the Commission may pre­&para;<br>scribe . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §78dd(a).&para;<br>Subsection 30(a) contains what §10(b) lacks: a clear&para;<br>statement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision&para;<br>for a specific extraterritorial application would be quite&para;<br>superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied&para;<br>to transactions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MORRISON v.

Even if that were not true, when a statute&para;<br>provides for some extraterritorial application, the pre­&para;<br>sumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that&para;<br>provision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&amp;T Corp.,&para;<br>550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). No one claims that §30(a)&para;<br>applies here.&para;<br>The concurrence claims we have impermissibly nar­&para;<br>rowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies&para;<br>abroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see&para;<br>post, at 6. But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to&para;<br>think, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a&para;<br>“clear statement rule,” ibid., if by that is meant a re­&para;<br>quirement that a statute say “this law applies abroad.”&para;<br>Assuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever&para;<br>sources of statutory meaning one consults to give “the&para;<br>most faithful reading” of the text, post, at 7, there is no&para;<br>clear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concur­&para;<br>rence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but&para;<br>merely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indica­&para;<br>tions relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.&para;<br>As the opinion for the Court in Aramco (which we prefer to&para;<br>the dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not&para;<br>suffice.8&para;<br>In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Ex­&para;<br>change Act that §10(b) applies extraterritorially, and we&para;<br>therefore conclude that it does not.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explic­&para;<br>itly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in&para;<br>Aramco. Post, at 6, n. 6. All this shows is that Congress knows how to&para;<br>give a statute explicit extraterritorial effect—and how to limit that&para;<br>effect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment&para;<br>did. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §109, 105 Stat. 1077.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

This is less an answer to the&para;<br>presumption against extraterritorial application than it is&para;<br>an assertion—a quite valid assertion—that that presump­&para;<br>tion here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its&para;<br>application requires further analysis. For it is a rare case&para;<br>of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all&para;<br>contact with the territory of the United States. But the&para;<br>presumption against extraterritorial application would be&para;<br>a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel&para;<br>whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.&para;<br>The concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid senti­&para;<br>nel, see post, at 7–8, but our cases are to the contrary. In&para;<br>Aramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired&para;<br>in Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U. S.,&para;<br>at 247. The Court concluded, however, that neither that&para;<br>territorial event nor that relationship was the “focus” of&para;<br>congressional concern, id., at 255, but rather domestic&para;<br>employment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 283, 285–&para;<br>286.&para;<br>Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that&para;<br>the focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where&para;<br>the deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of&para;<br>securities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not&para;<br>punish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct “in&para;<br>connection with the purchase or sale of any security regis­&para;<br>tered on a national securities exchange or any security not&para;<br>so registered.” 15 U.

Those purchase-and-sale trans­&para;<br>actions are the objects of the statute’s solicitude. It is&para;<br>those transactions that the statute seeks to “regulate,” see&para;<br>Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty&para;<br>Co., 404 U. S. 6, 12 (1971); it is parties or prospective&para;<br>parties to those transactions that the statute seeks to&para;<br>“protec[t],” id., at 10.&para;<br>See also Ernst &amp; Ernst v.&para;<br>Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976). And it is in our&para;<br>view only transactions in securities listed on domestic&para;<br>exchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities,&para;<br>to which §10(b) applies.9&para;<br>The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by&para;<br>the very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as&para;<br>its object “[t]o provide for the regulation of securities&para;<br>exchanges . . . operating in interstate and foreign com­&para;<br>merce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and&para;<br>unfair practices on such exchanges . . . .” 48 Stat. 881.

Section 1343 prohibits “any scheme or artifice&para;<br>to defraud,”—fraud simpliciter, without any requirement&para;<br>that it be “in connection with” any particular transaction&para;<br>or event. The Pasquantino Court said that the petitioners’&para;<br>“offense was complete the moment they executed the&para;<br>scheme inside the United States,” and that it was “[t]his&para;<br>domestic element of petitioners’ conduct [that] the Gov­&para;<br>ernment is punishing.” 544 U.

Section 10(b),&para;<br>by contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only&para;<br>such acts “in connection with the purchase or sale of any&para;<br>security registered on a national securities exchange or&para;<br>any security not so registered.” Not deception alone, but&para;<br>deception with respect to certain purchases or sales is&para;<br>necessary for a violation of the statute.&para;<br>The Solicitor General points out that the “significant&para;<br>and material conduct” test is in accord with prevailing&para;<br>notions of international comity.

In the two adjudications the Solicitor General&para;<br>cites, however, the Commission did not purport to be&para;<br>providing its own interpretation of the statute, but relied&para;<br>on decisions of federal courts—mainly Court of Appeals&para;<br>decisions that in turn relied on the Schoenbaum and&para;<br>Leasco decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed&para;<br>earlier.

Further, the relevant&para;<br>purchases of these unregistered securities took place&para;<br>entirely in Australia and involved only Australian inves&para;<br>tors.

As those types of&para;<br>frauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th&para;<br>century, the federal courts were increasingly called upon&para;<br>to wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Second Circuit, located in the Nation’s financial cen­&para;<br>ter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum&para;<br>v. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other&para;<br>grounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,&para;<br>over an extended series of cases, to “discern” under what&para;<br>circumstances “Congress would have wished the precious&para;<br>resources of the United States courts and law enforcement&para;<br>agencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,”&para;<br>547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the&para;<br>Second Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects&para;<br>test.

See id.,&para;<br>at 258 (“Congress’ awareness of the need to make a clear&para;<br>statement that a statute applies overseas is amply demon­&para;<br>strated by the numerous occasions on which it has ex­&para;<br>pressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a&para;<br>statute”). Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously ob­&para;<br>jected. See id., at 261 (“[C]ontrary to what one would&para;<br>conclude from the majority’s analysis, this canon is not a&para;<br>‘clear statement’ rule, the application of which relieves a&para;<br>court of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the&para;<br>legislative will”).&para;<br>Yet even Aramco—surely the most extreme application&para;<br>of the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time&para;<br>on the Court6—contained numerous passages suggesting&para;<br>that the presumption may be overcome without a clear&para;<br>directive. See id., at 248–255 (majority opinion) (repeat­&para;<br>edly identifying congressional “intent” as the touchstone of&para;<br>the presumption). And our cases both before and after&para;<br>Aramco make perfectly clear that the Court continues to&para;<br>give effect to “all available evidence about the meaning” of&para;<br>a provision when considering its extraterritorial applica­&para;<br>tion, lest we defy Congress’ will.

Hence, while the Court’s&para;<br>dictum that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of&para;<br>an extraterritorial application, it has none,” ante, at 6,&para;<br>makes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The&para;<br>presumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a&para;<br>theory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in­&para;<br>ternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It&para;<br>does not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the&para;<br>most faithful reading possible.&para;<br>Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in&para;<br>suggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial­&para;<br>ity is fatal to the Second Circuit’s test. For even if the&para;<br>presumption really were a clear statement (or “clear indi­&para;<br>cation,” ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal&para;<br>relevance to this case.&para;<br>It is true, of course, that “this Court ordinarily construes&para;<br>——————&para;<br>(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of&para;<br>Sherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v.

The text of the Exchange Act indicates that §10(b)&para;<br>extends to at least some activities with an international&para;<br>component, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.9&para;<br>The Second Circuit draws the line as follows: §10(b) ex­&para;<br>tends to transnational frauds “only when substantial acts&para;<br>in furtherance of the fraud were committed within the&para;<br>United States,” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 193 (CA2&para;<br>2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the&para;<br>fraud was “ ‘intended to produce’ ” and did produce “ ‘det­&para;<br>rimental effects within’ ” the United States, Schoenbaum,&para;<br>405 F. 2d, at 206.10&para;<br>This approach is consistent with the understanding&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 By&para;<br>&para;<br>its terms, §10(b) regulates “interstate commerce,” 15 U.

Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that&para;<br>Congress contemplated some amount of transnational application.
