NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS&para;<br>OF THE SPECIAL MASTER&para;<br>No. 132, Orig. Argued January 11, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010&para;<br>In 1986, Congress granted its consent to the Southeast Interstate LowLevel Radioactive Waste Management Compact (Compact), which&para;<br>was entered into by Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North&para;<br>Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Compact is&para;<br>administered by a Commission, which was required, inter alia, to&para;<br>“identif[y] a host State for the development of a [new] regional&para;<br>disposal facility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is licensed&para;<br>and ready to operate . . . no . . . later than 1991.” Art. 4(E)(6), 99&para;<br>Stat. 1875. The Commission designated North Carolina as a host&para;<br>State in 1986, thereby obligating North Carolina to take “appropriate&para;<br>steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and op&para;<br>erate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is filed with and&para;<br>issued by the appropriate authority.” Art. 5(C), id., at 1877.&para;<br>In 1988, North Carolina asked the Commission for assistance with&para;<br>the costs of licensing and building a facility. The Commission&para;<br>adopted a resolution declaring it “appropriate and necessary” to pro&para;<br>vide financial assistance, and ultimately paid almost $80 million to&para;<br>North Carolina from 1988 through 1997. North Carolina also ex&para;<br>pended $34 million of its own funds. Yet by the mid 1990s, North&para;<br>Carolina was still many years—and many tens of millions of dol&para;<br>lars—away from obtaining a license.&para;<br>In 1997, the Commission notified North Carolina that absent a&para;<br>plan for funding the remaining licensing steps, it would not disburse&para;<br>additional funds to North Carolina. North Carolina responded that it&para;<br>could not continue without additional funding. After the parties&para;<br>failed to agree on a long-term financing plan, in December 1997 the&para;<br>Commission ceased its financial assistance to North Carolina, and&para;<br>North Carolina subsequently began an orderly shutdown of its pro&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ject.&para;<br>In June 1999, Florida and Tennessee filed a complaint with the&para;<br>Commission seeking monetary sanctions against North Carolina. In&para;<br>July 1999, North Carolina exercised its right under Article 7(G) to&para;<br>withdraw from the Compact. In December 1999, the Commission&para;<br>concluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obligations un&para;<br>der the Compact and adopted a sanctions resolution demanding that&para;<br>the State repay approximately $80 million in addition to other mone&para;<br>tary penalties. North Carolina did not comply.&para;<br>In 2003, this Court granted Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia,&para;<br>and the Commission (Plaintiffs) leave to file a bill of complaint&para;<br>against North Carolina under this Court’s original jurisdiction, U. S.&para;<br>Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a). The complaint sets&para;<br>forth claims of violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Compact&para;<br>(Count I), breach of contract (Count II), unjust enrichment (Count&para;<br>III), promissory estoppel (Count IV), and money had and received&para;<br>(Count V), and requests monetary and other relief, including a decla&para;<br>ration that North Carolina is subject to sanctions and that the Com&para;<br>mission’s sanctions resolution is valid and enforceable.&para;<br>The Court assigned the case to a Special Master, who has con&para;<br>ducted proceedings and has filed two reports. The Preliminary Re&para;<br>port recommends denying without prejudice North Carolina’s motion&para;<br>to dismiss the Commission’s claims on sovereign immunity grounds;&para;<br>denying Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on Count I, which&para;<br>sought enforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution; grant&para;<br>ing North Carolina’s cross-motion to dismiss Count I and other por&para;<br>tions of the complaint seeking such enforcement; and denying North&para;<br>Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts II–V. The Master’s&para;<br>Second Report recommended denying Plaintiff’s motion for summary&para;<br>judgment and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary judg&para;<br>ment on Count II; and denying North Carolina’s motion for summary&para;<br>judgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V. The par&para;<br>ties filed a total of nine exceptions to the Master’s Reports.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Plaintiffs’ seven exceptions are overruled. Pp. 7–21.&para;<br>(a) The terms of the Compact do not authorize the Commission to&para;<br>impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina. The Court’s con&para;<br>clusion is confirmed by a comparison of the Compact’s terms with&para;<br>three other interstate compacts concerning low-level radioactive&para;<br>waste storage approved by Congress contemporaneously with the&para;<br>Compact, all of which expressly authorize their commissions to im&para;<br>pose monetary sanctions against their party States. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) Plaintiffs’ exception that North Carolina could not avoid&para;<br>monetary sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact is moot, be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cause the Compact does not permit the Commission to impose mone&para;<br>tary sanctions in any event. The Court deems their exception that&para;<br>North Carolina forfeited its right to object to a monetary penalty by&para;<br>failing to participate at the sanctions hearing both abandoned and&para;<br>meritless. P. 10.&para;<br>(c) Because the express terms of the Compact do not make the&para;<br>Commission the “sole arbiter” of disputes arising under the Compact,&para;<br>Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 569–570, the Court is not bound&para;<br>by the Commission’s conclusion that North Carolina breached its ob&para;<br>ligations under the Compact. Nor does the Court apply deferential&para;<br>administrative-law standards of review to the Commission’s conclu&para;<br>sion, but instead exercises its independent judgment as to both fact&para;<br>and law in executing its role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controver&para;<br>sies between the States, 28 U. S. C. §1251(a). Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>(d) North Carolina did not breach its contractual obligation to&para;<br>take “appropriate steps” toward the issuance of a license. Pp. 12–19.&para;<br>(1) The Compact requires North Carolina to take only those li&para;<br>censing steps that are “appropriate.” The parties’ course of perform&para;<br>ance establishes that it was not appropriate for North Carolina to&para;<br>proceed with the very expensive licensing process without external&para;<br>financial assistance. Nothing in the Compact’s text or structure re&para;<br>quires North Carolina to cover all licensing and building costs on its&para;<br>own. Plaintiffs’ assertion that it was understood that the host State&para;<br>would bear the up-front licensing and construction costs, but recoup&para;<br>those costs through its regional monopoly on radioactive waste dis&para;<br>posal, is not reflected in the Compact. Pp. 13–18.&para;<br>(2) Plaintiffs’ alternative argument that North Carolina repu&para;<br>diated its obligation to take appropriate steps when it announced it&para;<br>would take no further steps to obtain a license fails for the same rea&para;<br>sons their breach theory fails. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>(e) North Carolina did not breach an implied duty of good faith&para;<br>and fair dealing when it withdrew from the Compact. The Compact&para;<br>by its terms imposes no limitation on North Carolina’s right to exer&para;<br>cise its statutory right under Article 7(G) to withdraw from the Com&para;<br>pact. A comparison between the Compact and other contemporane&para;<br>ously enacted compacts confirms the absence of a good-faith&para;<br>limitation in the Compact. Pp. 19–21.&para;<br>2. North Carolina’s two exceptions are overruled. Pp. 21–26.&para;<br>(a) It was reasonable for the Special Master to deny without&para;<br>prejudice North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on the mer&para;<br>its of Plaintiffs’ equitable claims in Counts III–V. The Special Master&para;<br>concluded that those claims require further briefing, argument, and,&para;<br>possibly, discovery. The Court approves of the Special Master’s rea&para;<br>sonable exercise of his discretion to manage the proceedings. Pp. 21–&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>22.&para;<br>&para;<br>(b) Under Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 614, the Commis&para;<br>sion’s claims are not barred by sovereign immunity so long as the&para;<br>Commission asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the&para;<br>plaintiff States. Nothing in the Court’s subsequent cases suggests&para;<br>that Arizona v. California has been implicitly overruled, and North&para;<br>Carolina does not ask the Court to overrule that decision. At least&para;<br>with respect to Counts I and II, the Commission’s claims under those&para;<br>Compact-related Counts are wholly derivative of the plaintiff States’&para;<br>claims. The summary judgment disallowing the claims in Counts I&para;<br>and II on their merits renders the sovereign immunity question with&para;<br>regard to any relief the Commission alone might have on those claims&para;<br>moot. Counts III–V are on a different footing. The Special Master&para;<br>concluded that further factual and legal development was necessary&para;<br>to determine whether the Commission’s claims under these Counts&para;<br>were identical to those of the plaintiff States. The Special Master’s&para;<br>case-management decision was reasonable. Pp. 22–26.&para;<br>Exceptions to Special Master’s Reports overruled, and Master’s recom&para;<br>mendations adopted; North Carolina’s motions to dismiss Count I&para;<br>and for summary judgment on Count II granted; Plaintiffs’ motions&para;<br>for judgment on Counts I and II denied; and North Carolina’s mo&para;<br>tions to dismiss the Commission’s claims on sovereign immunity&para;<br>grounds and for summary judgment on Counts III–V denied without&para;<br>prejudice.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,&para;<br>GINSBURG, and ALITO, JJ., joined, in which ROBERTS, C.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>&para;<br>ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS&para;<br>OF THE SPECIAL MASTER&para;<br>[June 1, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In this case, which arises under our original jurisdiction,&para;<br>U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a), we&para;<br>consider nine exceptions submitted by the parties to two&para;<br>reports filed by the Special Master.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1986, Congress granted its consent under the Com­&para;<br>pact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3, to seven inter­&para;<br>state compacts providing for the creation of regional facili­&para;<br>ties to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. Omnibus&para;<br>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Interstate Compact Consent&para;<br>Act, 99 Stat. 1859. One of those compacts was the South­&para;<br>east Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management&para;<br>Compact (Compact), entered into by Alabama, Florida,&para;<br>Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,&para;<br>Tennessee, and Virginia. Id., at 1871–1880. That Com­&para;<br>pact established an “instrument and framework for a&para;<br>cooperative effort” to develop new facilities for the long­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>term disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated&para;<br>within the region. Art. 1, id., at 1872. The Compact was&para;<br>to be administered by a Southeast Interstate Low-Level&para;<br>Radioactive Waste Management Commission (Commis­&para;<br>sion), composed of two voting members from each party&para;<br>State. Art. 4(A), id., at 1874.&para;<br>A pre-existing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina was&para;<br>to serve as the initial facility for regional generators to&para;<br>dispose of their low-level radioactive waste. Art. 2(10), id.,&para;<br>at 1873. That facility was scheduled to close as the re­&para;<br>gional-disposal facility for the Compact by the end of 1992,&para;<br>ibid., and so the Compact required the Commission to&para;<br>develop “procedures and criteria for identifying . . . a host&para;<br>[S]tate for the development of a second regional disposal&para;<br>facility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is li­&para;<br>censed and ready to operate as soon as required but in no&para;<br>event later than 1991,” Art. 4(E)(6), id., at 1875. The&para;<br>Compact authorized the Commission to “designate” a&para;<br>party State as a host State for the facility. Art. 4(E)(7),&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>In September 1986, the Commission designated North&para;<br>Carolina as the host for the second facility. North Caro­&para;<br>lina therefore became obligated to “take appropriate steps&para;<br>to ensure that an application for a license to construct and&para;<br>operate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is&para;<br>filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.” Art.&para;<br>5(C), id., at 1877. In 1987, North Carolina’s General&para;<br>Assembly created the North Carolina Low-Level Radioac­&para;<br>tive Waste Management Authority (Authority) to fulfill&para;<br>the State’s obligation. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G (1987), 1987&para;<br>N. C. Sess. Laws ch. 850.&para;<br>Although “[t]he Commission is not responsible for any&para;<br>costs associated with,” among other things, “the creation of&para;<br>any facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876, North Carolina&para;<br>asked the Commission for financial assistance with build­&para;<br>ing and licensing costs. The Commission responded by&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>adopting a resolution, which declared it was both “appro­&para;<br>priate and necessary” for the Commission “to provide&para;<br>financial assistance” to North Carolina. App. 63. To that&para;<br>end, the Commission created a “Host States Assistance&para;<br>Fund” to help North Carolina with the “financial costs and&para;<br>burdens” of “preliminary planning, the administrative&para;<br>preparation, and other pre-operational” activities. Id., at&para;<br>64.&para;<br>The estimate in 1989 was that it would cost approxi­&para;<br>mately $21 million and take two years to obtain a license&para;<br>for North Carolina’s regional-disposal facility.&para;<br>That&para;<br>proved to be wildly optimistic. By 1990, the cost estimate&para;<br>had ballooned to $45.8 million, and the estimated date for&para;<br>obtaining a license now extended far into 1993. At the&para;<br>beginning of 1994 there still was no license, and the esti­&para;<br>mated cost had grown to $87.1 million. By end of 1994 the&para;<br>estimate was $112.5 million, and issuance of a license was&para;<br>not anticipated until 1997. And by December 1996 the&para;<br>estimated cost had increased by another $27 million and&para;<br>the projected date to receive a license had become August&para;<br>2000.&para;<br>North Carolina’s own appropriations—approximately&para;<br>$27 million from Fiscal Year 1988 through Fiscal Year&para;<br>(FY) 1995—did not cover the costs of the licensing phase.&para;<br>But during the same time period, the Commission pro­&para;<br>vided North Carolina with approximately $67 million.&para;<br>The funds came from surcharges and access fees collected&para;<br>for that purpose from generators disposing of low-level&para;<br>radioactive waste at the pre-existing Barnwell facility.&para;<br>Id., at 71–74, 145.&para;<br>In July 1995, however, South Carolina withdrew from&para;<br>the Compact, thereby depriving the Commission of contin­&para;<br>ued revenues from the Barnwell facility. In 1996, the&para;<br>Commission accordingly informed North Carolina that it&para;<br>would no longer be able to provide financial support for&para;<br>licensing activities. The Governor of North Carolina&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>responded that the State was not prepared to assume a&para;<br>greater portion of the project’s costs, and would not be able&para;<br>to proceed without continued Commission funding.&para;<br>Shortly thereafter the Commission adopted a resolution&para;<br>declaring that it was willing and able to provide additional&para;<br>funds, but calling on North Carolina to work with it to&para;<br>develop long-term funding sources for the facility. From&para;<br>FY 1996 through FY 1998, the Commission provided&para;<br>North Carolina approximately an additional $12.27 mil­&para;<br>lion in financial assistance. North Carolina, for its part,&para;<br>continued to provide its own funds toward licensing activi­&para;<br>ties—another $6 million during the same time period.&para;<br>In August 1997, the Commission notified North Caro­&para;<br>lina that absent a plan for funding the remaining steps of&para;<br>the licensing phase, it would not disburse additional funds&para;<br>to North Carolina after November 30, 1997. North Caro­&para;<br>lina responded that it would not be able to continue with­&para;<br>out additional guarantees of external funding. On Decem­&para;<br>ber 1, 1997, the parties having failed to agree upon a long­&para;<br>term financing plan, the Commission ceased financial&para;<br>assistance to North Carolina. By then it had provided&para;<br>almost $80 million.&para;<br>On December 19, 1997, North Carolina informed the&para;<br>Commission it would commence an orderly shutdown of its&para;<br>licensing project, and since that date has taken no further&para;<br>steps toward obtaining a license for the facility. But it did&para;<br>continue to fund the Authority for several more years, in&para;<br>the hope that the project would resume upon the restora­&para;<br>tion of external financial assistance. North Carolina&para;<br>maintained the proposed facility site, preserved the work&para;<br>it had completed to date, and retained the Authority’s&para;<br>books and records. It also participated in discussions with&para;<br>the Commission, generators of low-level radioactive waste,&para;<br>and other stakeholders regarding options to resolve the&para;<br>financing shortfall. From FY 1988 through FY 2000,&para;<br>North Carolina had expended almost $34 million toward&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>obtaining a license.&para;<br>In June 1999, after attempts to resolve the funding&para;<br>impasse had failed, Florida and Tennessee filed with the&para;<br>Commission a complaint for sanctions against North&para;<br>Carolina. It alleged that North Carolina had failed to&para;<br>fulfill its obligations under the Compact, and requested&para;<br>(among other things) return of the almost $80 million paid&para;<br>to North Carolina by the Commission, plus interest, as&para;<br>well as damages and attorney’s fees. The next month,&para;<br>North Carolina withdrew from the Compact by enacting a&para;<br>law repealing its status as a party State, see 1999 N. C.&para;<br>Sess. Laws ch. 357, as required by Article 7(G) of the&para;<br>Compact.&para;<br>More than four months later, in December 1999, the&para;<br>Commission held a sanctions hearing. North Carolina did&para;<br>not participate. After the hearing, the Commission con­&para;<br>cluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obliga­&para;<br>tions under the Compact. It adopted a resolution demand­&para;<br>ing that North Carolina repay approximately $80 million,&para;<br>plus interest, to the Commission; pay an additional $10&para;<br>million penalty to compensate the Commission for the loss&para;<br>of future revenue (surcharges and access fees) it would&para;<br>have received had a facility been completed in North&para;<br>Carolina; and pay the Commission’s attorney’s fees. North&para;<br>Carolina did not comply.&para;<br>In July 2000, seeking to enforce its sanctions resolution,&para;<br>the Commission moved for leave to file a bill of complaint&para;<br>under our original jurisdiction. Southeast Interstate LowLevel Radioactive Waste Management Commission v.&para;<br>North Carolina, No. 131, Orig. North Carolina opposed&para;<br>the motion on the grounds that the Commission could not&para;<br>invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction, and we invited&para;<br>the Solicitor General to express the views of the United&para;<br>States. 531 U. S. 942 (2000). The Solicitor General filed a&para;<br>brief urging denial of the Commission’s motion on the&para;<br>grounds that the Commission’s bill of complaint did not&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fall within our exclusive original jurisdiction over “contro­&para;<br>versies between two or more States.” §1251(a). We denied&para;<br>the Commission’s motion. 533 U. S. 926 (2001).&para;<br>In June 2002, the States of Alabama, Florida, Tennes­&para;<br>see, and Virginia, joined by the Commission (collectively&para;<br>Plaintiffs), moved for leave to file a bill of complaint&para;<br>against North Carolina. North Carolina opposed the&para;<br>motion, and we again sought the views of the Solicitor&para;<br>General. 537 U. S. 806 (2002). The United States urged&para;<br>that we grant Plaintiffs’ motion, which we did. 539 U. S.&para;<br>925 (2003). The bill of complaint contains five counts:&para;<br>violation of the party States’ rights under the Compact&para;<br>(Count I); breach of contract (Count II); unjust enrichment&para;<br>(Count III), promissory estoppel (Count IV); and money&para;<br>had and received (Count V). Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief&para;<br>requests a declaration that North Carolina is subject to&para;<br>sanctions and that the Commission’s sanctions resolution&para;<br>is valid and enforceable, as well as the award of damages,&para;<br>costs, and other relief.&para;<br>We assigned the case to a Special Master, 540 U. S.&para;<br>1014 (2003), who has conducted proceedings and now has&para;<br>filed two reports. The Master’s Preliminary Report ad­&para;<br>dressed three motions filed by the parties. He recom­&para;<br>mended denying without prejudice North Carolina’s mo­&para;<br>tion to dismiss the Commission’s claims against North&para;<br>Carolina on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Prelimi­&para;<br>nary Report 4–14. He recommended denying Plaintiffs’&para;<br>motion for summary judgment on Count I, which sought&para;<br>enforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution. Id.,&para;<br>at 14–33. He recommended granting North Carolina’s&para;<br>cross-motion to dismiss Count I and other portions of the&para;<br>bill of complaint that sought enforcement of the sanctions&para;<br>resolution. Id., at 33–34. And he recommended denying&para;<br>North Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts&para;<br>II–V. Id., at 34–43.&para;<br>After the Special Master issued his Preliminary Report,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The Special&para;<br>Master’s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs’&para;<br>motion for summary judgment on Count II, Second Report&para;<br>8–35, and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary&para;<br>judgment on Count II, id., at 35–40. Finally, he recom­&para;<br>mended denying North Carolina’s motion for summary&para;<br>judgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V.&para;<br>Id., at 41–45.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Plaintiffs present a total of seven exceptions to the&para;<br>Special Master’s two reports. We address them in turn.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Their first exception challenges the Special Master’s&para;<br>conclusion that the Commission lacked authority to im­&para;<br>pose monetary sanctions upon North Carolina. The terms&para;<br>of the Compact determine that question.&para;<br>Article 4(E) of the Compact sets forth the Commission’s&para;<br>“duties and powers.” Among its powers are the authority&para;<br>“[t]o revoke the membership of a party [S]tate that will­&para;<br>fully creates barriers to the siting of a needed regional&para;<br>facility,” Art. 4(E)(7), 99 Stat. 1875, and the authority “[t]o&para;<br>revoke the membership of a party [S]tate in accordance&para;<br>with Article 7(f),” Art. 4(E)(11), ibid. Conspicuously ab­&para;<br>sent from Article 4, however, is any mention of the author­&para;<br>ity to impose monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs contend that&para;<br>authority may be found elsewhere—in the first paragraph&para;<br>of Article 7(F), which provides in relevant part:&para;<br>“Any party [S]tate which fails to comply with the&para;<br>provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations&para;<br>incurred by becoming a party [S]tate to this compact&para;<br>may be subject to sanctions by the Commission, in­&para;<br>cluding suspension of its rights under this compact&para;<br>and revocation of its status as a party [S]tate.” Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1879.&para;<br>The sanctions expressly identified in Article 7(F)—&para;<br>“suspension” of rights and “revocation” of party-state&para;<br>status—flow directly from the Commission’s power in&para;<br>Articles 4(E)(7) and (11) to revoke a party State’s member­&para;<br>ship. That can fairly be understood to include the lesser&para;<br>power to suspend a party State’s rights. There is no simi­&para;<br>lar grounding in Article 4(E) of authority to impose mone­&para;<br>tary sanctions, and the absence is significant.&para;<br>According to Plaintiffs, however, the word “sanctions” in&para;<br>Article 7(F) naturally “includ[es]” monetary sanctions.&para;<br>Since the Compact contains no definition of “sanctions,”&para;<br>we give the word its ordinary meaning. A “sanction” (in&para;<br>the sense the word is used here) is “[t]he detriment loss of&para;<br>reward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a viola­&para;<br>tion of a law as a means of enforcing the law.” Webster’s&para;<br>New International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed. 1957) (herein­&para;<br>after Webster’s Second); see Black’s Law Dictionary 1458&para;<br>(9th ed. 2009) (“A penalty or coercive measure that results&para;<br>from failure to comply with a law, rule, or order”). A&para;<br>monetary penalty is assuredly one kind of “sanction.” See&para;<br>generally Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607,&para;<br>621 (1992). But there are many others, ranging from the&para;<br>withholding of benefits, or the imposition of a nonmone­&para;<br>tary obligation, to capital punishment. The Compact&para;<br>surely does not authorize the Commission to impose all of&para;<br>them.&para;<br>Ultimately, context dictates precisely which “sanctions”&para;<br>are authorized under Article 7(F), and nothing in the&para;<br>Compact suggests that these include monetary measures.&para;<br>The only two “sanctions” specifically identified as being&para;<br>included within Article 7(F) are “suspension” of a State’s&para;<br>rights under the Compact and “revocation” of its status as&para;<br>a party State. These are arguably merely examples, and&para;<br>may not exhaust the universe of sanctions the Commission&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>can impose. But they do establish “illustrative applica­&para;<br>tion[s] of the general principle,” Federal Land Bank of St.&para;<br>Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941),&para;<br>which underlies the kinds of sanctions the Commission&para;<br>can impose. It is significant that both these specifically&para;<br>authorized sanctions are prospective and nonmonetary in&para;<br>nature.&para;<br>Moreover, Article 3 of the Compact provides: “The rights&para;<br>granted to the party [S]tates by this compact are addi­&para;<br>tional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and noth­&para;<br>ing in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon,&para;<br>limit, or abridge those rights.” 99 Stat. 1873. Construing&para;<br>Article 7(F) to authorize monetary sanctions would violate&para;<br>this provision, since the primeval sovereign right is im­&para;<br>munity from levies against the government fisc. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 750–751 (1999).&para;<br>Finally, a comparison of the Compact’s terms with those&para;<br>of “[o]ther interstate compacts, approved by Congress&para;<br>contemporaneously,” Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554,&para;<br>565 (1983), confirms that Article 7(F) does not authorize&para;<br>monetary sanctions. At the same time Congress consented&para;<br>to this Compact, it consented to three other interstate&para;<br>compacts that expressly authorize their commissions to&para;<br>impose monetary sanctions against the parties to the&para;<br>compacts. See Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioac­&para;<br>tive Waste Management Compact, Art. IV(i)(14), 99 Stat.&para;<br>1915 (hereinafter Northeast Compact); Central Midwest&para;<br>Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art.&para;<br>VIII(f), 99 Stat. 1891 (hereinafter Central Midwest Com­&para;<br>pact); Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste&para;<br>Compact, Art. VII(e), 99 Stat. 1870 (hereinafter Central&para;<br>Compact). The Compact “clearly lacks the features of&para;<br>these other compacts, and we are not free to rewrite it” to&para;<br>empower the Commission to impose monetary sanctions.&para;<br>Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 565.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>Because the Compact does not authorize the Commis­&para;<br>sion to impose monetary sanctions, Plaintiffs’ second&para;<br>exception—that North Carolina could not avoid monetary&para;<br>sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact—is moot.&para;<br>The third exception also pertains to the Commission’s&para;<br>sanctions resolution: that North Carolina forfeited its&para;<br>right to object to a monetary penalty by failing to partici­&para;<br>pate at the sanctions hearing. Plaintiffs have failed to&para;<br>argue this exception. They have merely noted that North&para;<br>Carolina refused to participate at the sanctions hearing,&para;<br>and have cited no law in support of the proposition that&para;<br>this was a forfeit. We deem the exception abandoned. It&para;<br>was wisely abandoned, because it is meritless. North&para;<br>Carolina opposed the sanctions resolution and denied that&para;<br>the Commission had jurisdiction to impose sanctions&para;<br>against it.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Plaintiffs next take exception to the Special Master’s&para;<br>recommendation that no binding effect or even deference&para;<br>be accorded to the Commission’s conclusion that North&para;<br>Carolina violated Article 5(C) of the Compact. We are&para;<br>bound by the Commission’s conclusion of breach only if&para;<br>there is “an explicit provision or other clear indicatio[n]” in&para;<br>the Compact making the Commission the “sole arbiter of&para;<br>disputes” regarding a party State’s compliance with the&para;<br>Compact. Id., at 569–570. Plaintiffs assert there is such a&para;<br>provision, the second sentence of Article 7(C), which&para;<br>states: “The Commission is the judge of the qualifications&para;<br>of the party [S]tates and of its members and of their com­&para;<br>pliance with the conditions and requirements of this com­&para;<br>pact and the laws of the party [S]tates relating to the&para;<br>enactment of this compact.” 99 Stat. 1879.&para;<br>Plaintiffs greatly overread this provision. The limited&para;<br>nature of the authority to “judge” that it confers upon the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Commission is clear from its context. The first sentence of&para;<br>Article 7(C) states that an eligible State “shall be de­&para;<br>clared” a party State “upon enactment of this compact into&para;<br>law by the [S]tate and upon [the] payment of” a $25,000&para;<br>fee, as “required by Article 4(H)(1).” Ibid. The second&para;<br>sentence makes the Commission the “judge” of four mat­&para;<br>ters, all of which concern status as a party State or Com&para;<br>mission member. First, the Commission is the judge of the&para;<br>“qualifications” of a State to become a party State (the&para;<br>qualifications set forth in Article 7(A) for the initial party&para;<br>States and in Article 7(B) for States that subsequently&para;<br>petition to join). Second, the Commission is the judge of&para;<br>the qualifications of the members of the Commission,&para;<br>which are specified in Article 4(A). Third, the Commission&para;<br>is the judge of a party State’s compliance with the “condi­&para;<br>tions” and “requirements” of the Compact. The former&para;<br>term is an obvious reference to Article 7(B): “The Commis­&para;<br>sion may establish such conditions as it deems necessary&para;<br>and appropriate to be met by a [S]tate wishing . . . to&para;<br>become a party [S]tate to this [C]ompact.” Id., at 1878.&para;<br>The accompanying term “requirements” also refers to&para;<br>Article 7’s prescriptions for prospective party States, such&para;<br>as paying the “fees required” under Article 7(C), id., at&para;<br>1879, and obtaining, as Article 7(B) requires, a two-thirds&para;<br>vote of the Commission in favor of admission. Finally, the&para;<br>Commission is the judge of the “laws of the party [S]tates&para;<br>relating to the enactment of this compact.” Art. 7(C), ibid.&para;<br>Again, that concerns status as a party State, which re­&para;<br>quires that the State “enac[t] . . . this compact into law,”&para;<br>ibid. The Commission is the “judge” of only these specific&para;<br>matters.&para;<br>This is not to say the Commission lacks authority to&para;<br>interpret the Compact or to say whether a party State has&para;<br>violated its terms. That is of course implicit in its power&para;<br>to sanction under Article 7(F). But because “the express&para;<br>terms of the [Southeast] Compact do not constitute the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Commission as the sole arbiter” regarding North Caro­&para;<br>lina’s compliance with its obligations under the Compact,&para;<br>Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 569, we are not bound&para;<br>to follow the Commission’s findings.&para;<br>Plaintiffs argue that we nonetheless owe deference to&para;<br>the Commission’s conclusion. But unless the text of an&para;<br>interstate compact directs otherwise, we do not review the&para;<br>actions of a compact commission “on the deferential model&para;<br>of judicial review of administrative action by a federal&para;<br>agency.” Id., at 566–567. The terms of this Compact do&para;<br>not establish that “this suit may be maintained only as&para;<br>one for judicial review of the Commission’s” determination&para;<br>of breach. Id., at 567. Accordingly, we do not apply ad­&para;<br>ministrative-law standards of review, but exercise our&para;<br>independent judgment as to both fact and law in executing&para;<br>our role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controversies between&para;<br>the States, §1251(a).&para;<br>D&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ next two exceptions are to the Special Mas­&para;<br>ter’s recommendations to deny their motion for summary&para;<br>judgment on their breach-of-contract claims, and to grant&para;<br>North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on those&para;<br>claims. In resolving motions for summary judgment in&para;<br>cases within our original jurisdiction, we are not techni­&para;<br>cally bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but&para;<br>we use Rule 56 as a guide. This Court’s Rule 17.2; Ne&para;<br>braska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, 590 (1993). Hence,&para;<br>summary judgment is appropriate where there “is no&para;<br>genuine issue as to any material fact” and the moving&para;<br>party is “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.&para;<br>Rule Civ.

At that point, in their view,&para;<br>North Carolina was no longer “tak[ing] appropriate steps&para;<br>to ensure that an application for a license to construct and&para;<br>operate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is&para;<br>filed with and issued by the appropriate authority,” Art.&para;<br>5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. North Carolina says that once the&para;<br>Commission ceased providing financial assistance on&para;<br>December 1, and once it became clear there was insuffi­&para;<br>cient funding to complete the licensing phase, there were&para;<br>no more “appropriate” steps to take. The Special Master&para;<br>concluded that the phrase “appropriate steps” in Article&para;<br>5(C) was ambiguous, and that the parties’ course of per­&para;<br>formance established that North Carolina was not re­&para;<br>quired to take steps toward obtaining a license once it was&para;<br>made to bear the remaining financial burden of the licens­&para;<br>ing phase. Second Report 10–24, 35–36. Plaintiffs take&para;<br>exception to that conclusion.&para;<br>Article 5(C) does not require North Carolina to take any&para;<br>and all steps to license a regional-disposal facility; only&para;<br>those that are “appropriate.” Plaintiffs contend that this&para;<br>requires North Carolina to take the steps set forth in the&para;<br>regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission govern­&para;<br>ing the filing and disposition of applications for licenses to&para;<br>operate radioactive waste disposal facilities, 10 CFR pt. 61&para;<br>(1997). Those regulations set forth some, but certainly not&para;<br>all, of the “steps” the State would have to take to obtain a&para;<br>license. But Article 5(C) does not incorporate the regula­&para;<br>tions by reference, much less describe them as the appro&para;<br>priate steps.&para;<br>We could accept Plaintiffs’ contention if “appropriate”&para;<br>meant “necessary” (the steps set forth in the regulation&para;<br>are assuredly necessary to obtaining a license). But it&para;<br>does not. Whether a particular step is “appropriate”—&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“[s]pecially suitable; fit; proper,” Webster’s Second 133—&para;<br>could depend upon many factors other than its mere in­&para;<br>dispensability to obtaining a license. It would not be&para;<br>appropriate, for example, to take a step whose cost greatly&para;<br>exceeded whatever benefits the license would confer, or if&para;<br>it was highly uncertain the license would ever issue.&para;<br>In determining whether, in terminating its efforts to&para;<br>obtain a license, North Carolina failed to take what the&para;<br>parties considered “appropriate” steps, the parties’ course&para;<br>of performance under the Compact is highly significant.&para;<br>See, e.g., New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 830–831&para;<br>(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Contracts §§202(4), 203 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).&para;<br>That firmly establishes that North Carolina was not ex­&para;<br>pected to go it alone—to proceed with the very expensive&para;<br>licensing process without any external financial assis­&para;<br>tance. The history of the Compact consists entirely of&para;<br>shared financial burdens. From the beginning, North&para;<br>Carolina made clear that it required financial assistance&para;<br>to do the extensive work required for obtaining a license.&para;<br>The Commission promptly declared it was “appropriate&para;<br>and necessary” to assist North Carolina with the costs.&para;<br>App. 63. It provided the vast majority of funding for li­&para;<br>censing-related activities—$80 million, compared to North&para;<br>Carolina’s $34 million. The Commission repeatedly noted&para;<br>the necessity (and propriety) of providing financial assis­&para;<br>tance to North Carolina, and reiterated its dedication to&para;<br>sharing the substantial financial burdens of the licensing&para;<br>phase. See, e.g., id., at 63, 71, 145. There is nothing to&para;<br>support the proposition that the other States had an obli­&para;<br>gation under the Compact to share the licensing costs&para;<br>through the Commission; but we doubt that they did so&para;<br>out of love for the Tarheel State. They did it, we think,&para;<br>because that was their understanding of how the Compact&para;<br>was supposed to work. One must take the Commission at&para;<br>its word, that it was “appropriate” to share the cost—&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>which suggests that it would not have been appropriate to&para;<br>make North Carolina proceed on its own.&para;<br>Nor was North Carolina required after December 19,&para;<br>1997, to continue to expend its own funds at the same&para;<br>level it had previously (which Plaintiffs concede had satis­&para;<br>fied North Carolina’s obligation to take “appropriate&para;<br>steps”). Once the Commission refused to provide any&para;<br>further financial assistance, North Carolina would have&para;<br>had to assume an unlimited financial commitment to cover&para;<br>all remaining licensing costs. Even if it maintained its&para;<br>prior rate of appropriations going forward, it would not&para;<br>have come close to covering the at least $34 million needed&para;<br>for the last steps of the licensing phase. And since the&para;<br>income from the South Carolina facility had been termi­&para;<br>nated, there was no apparent prospect of funding for the&para;<br>construction phase (expected to cost at least $75 million).&para;<br>In connection with its August 1997 refusal to provide&para;<br>further assistance, the Commission itself had said, “[I]t&para;<br>will be imprudent to continue to deplete Commission&para;<br>resources for this purpose if a source of funds is not estab­&para;<br>lished soon for the ultimate completion of the project.” Id.,&para;<br>at 306, 307; Joint Supp. Fact Brief App. 36, 37. And in&para;<br>March 1998, the Commission “strongly” reiterated that “it&para;<br>would be imprudent to spend additional funds for licens­&para;<br>ing activities if funds will not be available to complete the&para;<br>project.” Id., at 59. What was imprudent for the Commis­&para;<br>sion would surely have been imprudent (and hence inap­&para;<br>propriate) for North Carolina as well. The State would&para;<br>have wasted millions of its taxpayers’ dollars on what&para;<br>seemed to be a futile effort.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER would uphold Plaintiffs’ challenge on&para;<br>this point. He believes that the Compact obligated North&para;<br>Carolina to fund and complete the licensing and construc­&para;<br>tion of a nuclear waste facility. Post, at 2, 4–6 (opinion&para;<br>concurring in part and dissenting in part). In fact, how­&para;<br>ever, North Carolina was not even contractually required&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to “secur[e] a license,” post, at 2, but only to take “appro­&para;<br>priate steps” to obtain one, Art. 5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. And&para;<br>nothing in the terms of the Compact required North Caro­&para;<br>lina either to provide “adequate funding” for or to “beg[i]n&para;<br>construction” on a regional facility, post, at 2. Other con­&para;<br>temporaneously enacted interstate compacts expressly&para;<br>provide that the host State is “responsible for the timely&para;<br>development” of a regional facility, Central Midwest Com­&para;<br>pact, Art. VI(f), 99 Stat. 1887; Midwest Compact,&para;<br>Art. VI(e), id., at 1898, or “shall . . . [c]ause a regional&para;<br>facility to be developed on a timely basis,” Rocky Mountain&para;<br>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. III(d)(i), id.,&para;<br>at 1903–1904. But the compact here before us has no such&para;<br>provision, and the contrast is telling.1 Texas v. New Mex&para;<br>ico, 462 U. S., at 565. Moreover, the Commission’s state­&para;<br>ments described in the preceding paragraph, that it would&para;<br>be imprudent to commit additional resources “ ‘if a source&para;<br>of funds is not established soon for the ultimate comple­&para;<br>tion of the project,’ ” or “ ‘if funds will not be available to&para;<br>complete the project,’ ” surely suggest that North Carolina&para;<br>is not committed to the funding by contract.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER asserts, post, at 4–5, that the rotating­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Compact provides only that the host State is “responsible for&para;<br>the availability . . . of their regional facilities in accordance with”&para;<br>Article 5(B). Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874. The latter section makes&para;<br>clear that responsibility for “availability” does not mean that the host&para;<br>State will fund construction of the facility, but that it will keep it open&para;<br>and not impose unreasonable restrictions on its use. JUSTICE BREYER is&para;<br>correct that the Compact says the Commission is not “responsible” for&para;<br>the costs of “the creation” of a regional facility. Art. 4(K)(1), id., at&para;<br>1876. But what is important here is that it does not say that the host&para;<br>State is responsible—which (if it were true) would almost certainly&para;<br>have been joined with saying who was not responsible. What JUSTICE&para;<br>BREYER overlooks is the possibility that no one is responsible, and the&para;<br>licensing and construction of the facility is meant to depend upon&para;<br>voluntary funding by interested parties, such as the party States, the&para;<br>Commission, and low-level radioactive waste generators.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>host requirement in the Compact, see Art. 5(A), 99 Stat.&para;<br>1873, necessarily implies that North Carolina is solely&para;<br>responsible for the licensing and construction costs of its&para;<br>facility. But all that requirement entails is that a party&para;<br>State “shall not be designated” as a host State for a second&para;<br>time before “each [other] party [S]tate” has taken a turn.&para;<br>Ibid. It can perfectly well envision that the States will&para;<br>take turns in bearing the lead responsibility for getting&para;<br>the facility licensed, supervising its construction, and&para;<br>operating the facility on its soil. In fact, that is just what&para;<br>its text suggests, since it describes the responsibility that&para;<br>is to be rotated as the host State’s “obligation . . . to have a&para;<br>regional facility operated within its borders.” Ibid. Not to&para;<br>construct it, or pay for its construction, but to “have [it]&para;<br>operated within its borders.” As noted above, other con­&para;<br>temporaneously enacted compacts do spell out the obliga­&para;<br>tion of the host State to construct the facility. Still others&para;<br>at least provide that the host State will recoup its costs&para;<br>through disposal fees—which arguably suggests that the&para;<br>host State is to bear the costs. See, e.g., Central Compact,&para;<br>Art. III(d),&para;<br>99&para;<br>Stat.&para;<br>1865;&para;<br>Northeast&para;<br>Compact,&para;<br>Art. III(c)(2), id., at 1913. The compact before us here&para;<br>does not even contain that arguable suggestion.&para;<br>What it comes down to, then, is JUSTICE BREYER’s intui­&para;<br>tion that the whole point of the Compact was that each&para;<br>designated host State would bear the up-front costs of&para;<br>licensing and construction, but would eventually recoup&para;<br>those costs through its regional monopoly on the disposal&para;<br>of low-level radioactive waste. Post, at 5–6. He can cite no&para;<br>provision in the Compact which reflects such an under­&para;<br>standing, and the behavior of the parties contradicts it.2 It&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The course-of-dealing evidence that JUSTICE BREYER identifies, post,&para;<br>at 6–7, is not probative. The Commission’s statements that it is not&para;<br>legally responsible for costs and that at some point Commission funds&para;<br>will no longer be available, and North Carolina’s assurances that it will&para;<br>keep its commitments and honor its obligations, are perfectly compati­&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would, moreover, have been a foolish understanding, since&para;<br>the regional monopoly to recoup construction costs would&para;<br>not be a monopoly if South Carolina withdrew and contin­&para;<br>ued to operate its facility—which is exactly what hap­&para;<br>pened in 1995.3 Even leaving aside the principle, dis­&para;<br>cussed infra, at 21, that implied obligations are not to be&para;<br>read into interstate compacts, JUSTICE BREYER’s intuition&para;<br>fails to reflect the reality of what was implied.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Plaintiffs take exception to the Special Master’s rejec­&para;<br>tion of their alternative argument that North Carolina&para;<br>repudiated the Compact when it announced it would not&para;<br>take further steps toward obtaining a license. They argue&para;<br>that North Carolina’s announcement that it was shutting&para;<br>down the project constituted a refusal to tender any fur­&para;<br>ther performance under the contract.&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ repudiation theory fails for the same reasons&para;<br>their breach theory fails. A repudiation occurs when an&para;<br>obligor either informs an obligee “that the obligor will&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ble with the proposition that North Carolina did not have to provide all&para;<br>funding for licensing the facility, and that it would be “inappropriate” to&para;<br>proceed toward obtaining a license for a facility that would never be&para;<br>needed or built.&para;<br>3 South Carolina’s withdrawal from the Compact not only “could”&para;<br>affect North Carolina’s ability to recoup its facility costs, as JUSTICE&para;<br>BREYER grudgingly concedes, post, at 5; it unquestionably would. With&para;<br>a regional competitor in the Barnwell facility and declining demand for&para;<br>waste disposal facilities due to technological and other factors, App.&para;<br>261, 263–264, North Carolina would receive significantly lower reve­&para;<br>nues from its facility, id., at 261–262, 265. The document attached to a&para;<br>1996 letter from North Carolina to the Commission trumpeting “$600&para;<br>million in cost savings” that would come from a new facility, post, at 5,&para;<br>proves precisely the opposite of what JUSTICE BREYER thinks. The cost&para;<br>savings were to accrue “to all generators” of waste, App. 266 (emphasis&para;<br>added)—that is, those who would use North Carolina’s facility.

But&para;<br>an interstate compact is not just a contract; it is a federal&para;<br>statute enacted by Congress. If courts were authorized to&para;<br>add a fairness requirement to the implementation of&para;<br>federal statutes, judges would be potent lawmakers in­&para;<br>deed. We do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal&para;<br>statute. See, e.g., Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503&para;<br>U. S. 249, 254 (1992). And in that regard a statute which&para;<br>is a valid interstate compact is no different. Texas v. New&para;<br>Mexico, 462 U. S., at 564, 565. We are especially reluctant&para;<br>to read absent terms into an interstate compact given the&para;<br>federalism and separation-of-powers concerns that would&para;<br>arise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign&para;<br>States, to which the political branches consented.

There is no&para;<br>restriction upon a party State’s enactment of such a law,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 After North Carolina was designated as a host State, the Compact&para;<br>was amended to add Article 7(H), which restricted the ability of a party&para;<br>State to withdraw to within 30 days after a second regional-disposal&para;<br>facility opened.

North Carolina’s motion was&para;<br>based on the ground that, as a matter of law, its obliga­&para;<br>tions are governed entirely by the Compact.

We granted the Special Master discretion to&para;<br>“direct subsequent proceedings” and “to submit such re­&para;<br>ports as he may deem appropriate.” 540 U.

Instead, he concluded&para;<br>that our immediate resolution of Counts I and II would&para;<br>facilitate the efficient disposition of the case; and in agree­&para;<br>ing to hear exceptions to his Preliminary Report and&para;<br>Second Report we implicitly agreed. His deferral of ruling&para;<br>on the merits of Counts III–V is part and parcel of the&para;<br>same case management, and we find no reason to upset it.&para;<br>B&para;<br>North Carolina takes exception to the Special Master’s&para;<br>recommendation in his Preliminary Report to deny with­&para;<br>out prejudice its motion to dismiss the Commission’s&para;<br>claims on the ground that they are barred by the Eleventh&para;<br>Amendment to the Constitution and by structural princi­&para;<br>ples of state sovereign immunity.

But he recommended denying&para;<br>North Carolina’s motion to dismiss “at this point in the&para;<br>proceedings.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Special Master relied upon our decision in Arizona&para;<br>v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), which held that the&para;<br>Eleventh Amendment did not bar the participation of&para;<br>several Indian Tribes in an original action concerning the&para;<br>allocation of rights to the waters of the Colorado River.&para;<br>The United States had already intervened, in its capacity&para;<br>as trustee for several Indian Tribes; but the Tribes moved&para;<br>to intervene as well, and the States opposed. We granted&para;<br>the Tribes’ motion, stating that the States do not enjoy&para;<br>sovereign immunity against the United States, and “[t]he&para;<br>Tribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against&para;<br>the States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudi­&para;<br>cation of their vital water rights that was commenced by&para;<br>the United States.” Id., at 614. Thus, “our judicial power&para;<br>over the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to&para;<br>intervene, and the States’ sovereign immunity protected&para;<br>by the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.” Ibid.&para;<br>Relying on this holding, the Special Master held that&para;<br>sovereign immunity does not bar the Commission’s suit, so&para;<br>long as the Commission asserts the same claims and seeks&para;<br>the same relief as the other plaintiffs. Whether that is so,&para;<br>he said, “cannot be resolved without further factual and&para;<br>legal development[s],” Preliminary Report 6, and so North&para;<br>Carolina is free to renew its motion at a later point, id., at&para;<br>13–14. See Second Report 45–48.&para;<br>Assuming (as the Special Master did) that the Commis­&para;<br>sion’s claims against North Carolina implicate sovereign&para;<br>immunity, we agree with his disposition.

See&para;<br>Arizona v. California, supra, at 614. The Commission is&para;<br>“a legal entity separate and distinct from” the States that&para;<br>are parties to the Compact. Art. 4(M)(1), 99 Stat. 1877.&para;<br>Since it is not a party it has neither a contractual right to&para;<br>performance by the party States nor enforceable statutory&para;<br>rights under Article 5 of the Compact, see Bennett v.&para;<br>Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). The Compact does,&para;<br>however, authorize the Commission to “act or appear on&para;<br>behalf of any party [S]tate or [S]tates . . . as an intervenor&para;<br>or party in interest before . . . any court of law,” Art.&para;<br>4(E)(10), 99 Stat. 1875, and it is obviously in this capacity&para;<br>that the Commission seeks to vindicate the plaintiff&para;<br>States’ statutory and contractual rights in Counts I and II.&para;<br>Its Count I and Count II claims therefore rise or fall with&para;<br>the claims of the States. While the Commission may not&para;<br>bring them in a stand-alone action under this Court’s&para;<br>original jurisdiction, see §1251(a), it may assert them in&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>this Court alongside the plaintiff States, see Arizona v.&para;<br>California, 460 U. S., at 614. The summary judgment&para;<br>disallowing the underlying claims on their merits renders&para;<br>the sovereign immunity question with regard to any relief&para;<br>the Commission alone might have on those claims moot.&para;<br>Counts III–V, which do not rely upon the Compact,&para;<br>stand on a different footing. As to them, while the Com­&para;<br>mission again seemingly makes the same claims and seeks&para;<br>the same relief as the States, it is conceivable that as a&para;<br>matter of law the Commission’s claims are not identical.&para;<br>The Commission can claim restitution as the party that&para;<br>paid the money to North Carolina; the other plaintiffs&para;<br>cannot claim it on that basis. Whether this means that&para;<br>the claims are not identical for Arizona v.

Rather, plaintiffs’ argu&para;<br>ment is that the Compact’s terms, properly construed,&para;<br>speak not only to the specific duties imposed upon the&para;<br>parties but also to the manner in which those duties must&para;<br>be carried out. This is an interpretive argument familiar&para;<br>to contract disputes. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Contracts §205 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).&para;<br>As the opinion for the Court notes, congressional con&para;<br>sent to an interstate compact gives it the status of a fed&para;<br>eral statute. See ante, at 20. This is an apt and proper&para;<br>way to indicate that a compact has all the dignity of an&para;<br>Act of Congress. And that is surely what was meant in&para;<br>New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 811 (1998), where&para;<br>it was stated that the Court may not “ ‘order relief incon&para;<br>sistent with [the] express terms’ ” of a compact.

S. 433, 438 (1981) (“[C]ongressional consent trans&para;<br>forms an interstate compact . . . into a law of the United&para;<br>States”).&para;<br>From this principle, however, it simply does not follow&para;<br>that a law’s nature and origin as a compact must be dis&para;<br>missed as irrelevant. Like a treaty, a compact represents&para;<br>an agreement between parties. See New Jersey, supra, at&para;<br>831 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Compact here is of&para;<br>course a treaty”). The Court’s duty in interpreting a com&para;<br>pact involves ascertaining the intent of the parties. See&para;<br>Sullivan v. Kidd, 254 U. S. 433, 439 (1921) (“[T]reaties are&para;<br>to be interpreted upon the principles which govern the&para;<br>interpretation of contracts . . . with a view to making&para;<br>effective the purposes of the high contracting parties”);&para;<br>Wright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 57 (1903) (“Treaties must&para;<br>receive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of&para;<br>the contracting parties”). Carrying out this duty may lead&para;<br>the Court to consult sources that might differ from those&para;<br>normally reviewed when an ordinary federal statute is at&para;<br>issue. That much is surely implicit in the Court’s refer&para;<br>ence to contract law principles elsewhere in its opinion in&para;<br>the instant case. See, e.g., ante, at 14 (“[T]he parties’&para;<br>course of performance under the Compact is highly signifi&para;<br>cant”); ibid. (citing the Restatement); id., at 18–19 (same);&para;<br>see also New Jersey, supra, at 830–831 (SCALIA, J., dis&para;<br>senting) (construing a compact in light of “hornbook con&para;<br>tracts law that the practical construction of an ambiguous&para;<br>agreement revealed by later conduct of the parties is good&para;<br>indication of its meaning”).&para;<br>That said, it is quite correct to hold here that the rea&para;<br>sonable expectations of the contracting States, as mani&para;<br>fested in the Compact, do not reveal an intent to limit&para;<br>North Carolina’s power of withdrawal.

One of these things is not like the others: The Com&para;<br>mission is not a sovereign State. The Court entertains its&para;<br>suit—despite North Carolina’s sovereign immunity—&para;<br>because the Commission “asserts the same claims and&para;<br>seeks the same relief as the other plaintiffs.” Ante, at 23.&para;<br>Our Constitution does not countenance such “no harm, no&para;<br>foul” jurisdiction, and I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>The Court has made this mistake before. In Arizona v.&para;<br>California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), we allowed Indian Tribes&para;<br>that could not sue sovereign States to piggyback on the&para;<br>claims of the United States, which could. We reasoned&para;<br>that once the United States had initiated suit, the state&para;<br>defendants could “no longer . . . assert [their] immunity&para;<br>with respect to the subject matter of [the] action,” so the&para;<br>Tribes were free to pile on and join the suit. Id., at 614.&para;<br>Today the Court retraces Arizona’s steps, quoting that&para;<br>case for the proposition that when private plaintiffs “ ‘do&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>not seek to bring new claims or issues, . . . our judicial&para;<br>power over the controversy is not enlarged . . . , and the&para;<br>States’ sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh&para;<br>Amendment is not compromised.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting&para;<br>Arizona, supra, at 614).&para;<br>That statement is contrary to the language of the Con&para;<br>stitution. The Eleventh Amendment provides:&para;<br>“The Judicial power of the United States shall not&para;<br>be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,&para;<br>commenced or prosecuted against one of the United&para;<br>States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or&para;<br>Subjects of any Foreign State.”&para;<br>The immunity conferred is against the “commence[ment]&para;<br>or prosecut[ion]” of “any suit in law or equity.” There is no&para;<br>carve-out for suits “prosecuted” by private parties so long&para;<br>as those parties “ ‘do not seek to bring new claims or is&para;<br>sues.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting Arizona, supra, at 614).&para;<br>Understandably, the Court’s opinion leans heavily on&para;<br>Arizona, which has never been squarely overruled.

There is no reason to&para;<br>suppose that the States, at the founding, made an excep&para;<br>tion for private suits that happen to mimic other plaintiffs’&para;<br>claims—and neither Arizona nor the Court today suggests&para;<br>otherwise.&para;<br>Whether or not a plaintiff “seeks the same relief” or&para;<br>imposes any “additional defense or liability,” ante, at 23–&para;<br>24, simply does not matter in light of our recognition that&para;<br>sovereign immunity provides an “immunity from suit,” not&para;<br>a “defense to . . . liability.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.&para;<br>South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002).&para;<br>As we have explained, “the relief sought by a plaintiff&para;<br>suing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit&para;<br>is barred.” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44,&para;<br>58 (1996). Indeed, we have suggested that private parties&para;<br>may not sue even if a court is “precluded . . . from award&para;<br>ing them any relief.” Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at&para;<br>766 (emphasis added) (dictum). It is the fact that a pri&para;<br>vate party is allowed to sue a sovereign State—not the&para;<br>burden of litigation or the relief sought—that infringes the&para;<br>immunity of the State. “The Eleventh Amendment is&para;<br>concerned not only with the States’ ability to withstand&para;<br>suit, but with their privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico&para;<br>Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,&para;<br>506 U.

And&para;<br>while doing so it continually assured its Compact partners&para;<br>that it “remain[ed] committed to fulfilling its obligations to&para;<br>the Compact to serve as the next host state.” App. 92&para;<br>(Letter from James G.

More to&para;<br>the point, if a builder promises that he will “take appro­&para;<br>priate steps to ensure” that a customer will be able to&para;<br>move into a new home in two years, and then does nothing&para;<br>at all, has the builder not broken his promise?&para;<br>As the majority notes, “[o]ther contemporaneously en­&para;<br>acted interstate compacts” delineated a host State’s obli­&para;<br>gations in more detail than the Southeast Compact does.&para;<br>Ante, at 16–17. But this fact may just as easily be read to&para;<br>indicate what the parties here intended, rather than, as&para;<br>the majority argues, what they did not intend. Regard­&para;<br>less, the language of the Compact and the context in which&para;<br>it was enacted—as part of a congressional effort to en­&para;<br>courage regional solutions to this Nation’s low-level radio­&para;<br>active waste problem, see Consent Act, 99 Stat. 1859; LowLevel Radioactive Waste Policy Act, §4(a)(1), 94 Stat.&para;<br>3348—both indicate that North Carolina was supposed to&para;<br>take “appropriate steps” to build a low-level radioactive&para;<br>waste disposal facility. And North Carolina’s General&para;<br>Assembly passed a state statute recognizing and accepting&para;<br>this responsibility. See N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G–4 (creating&para;<br>a state agency to “site, finance, [and] build” a waste dis­&para;<br>posal facility). How can it be that two years of inactivity&para;<br>followed by withdrawal satisfies this promise?&para;<br>The answer, says the Court, is that any further “appro­&para;<br>priate steps” would have cost a significant amount of&para;<br>money. Ante, at 14–15. In 1997, the Southeast Interstate&para;<br>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission&para;<br>(Commission), the entity responsible for administering the&para;<br>Compact, made clear that it would not advance North&para;<br>Carolina any more money toward building a facility. See&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>App. 315. In response, North Carolina concluded that it&para;<br>was unwilling to fund the rest of the project itself. See id.,&para;<br>at 317–319. And the Court agrees that it would have been&para;<br>“imprudent” for North Carolina to spend further funds, in&para;<br>light of the Commission’s refusal to do so also. Ante, at&para;<br>15–16.&para;<br>But this is an odd excuse. If a builder promises to “take&para;<br>appropriate steps” to build me a house, the fact that he&para;<br>runs out of funds would not normally excuse his breaking&para;<br>his promise—at least if it is he, and not I, who is responsi­&para;<br>ble for financing the project. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Con­&para;<br>tracts §9.6, p. 638 (3d ed. 2004) (Farnsworth) (courts&para;<br>“generally” conclude that “additional expense” “does not&para;<br>rise to the level of impracticability” so as to excuse a party&para;<br>from performance). And here it is North Carolina, and not&para;<br>anyone else, who bears ultimate responsibility for finding&para;<br>the funds.&para;<br>The text, structure, and purpose of the Compact all&para;<br>demonstrate this fact. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2,&para;<br>the Compact expressly provides that the Commission “is&para;<br>not responsible for any costs associated with . . . the crea­&para;<br>tion of any facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876. Rather,&para;<br>the Compact States determined that each “party state”&para;<br>should take a turn as the “host state,” during which time&para;<br>that State would be obligated to build a facility and then&para;<br>operate it for 20 years. See Art. 3(A), id., at 1873; Art.&para;<br>5(A), id., at 1877; Art. 5(C), ibid.; Art. 5(E), 103 Stat. 1289;&para;<br>see also Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874 (“Host states are&para;<br>responsible for the availability, the subsequent post­&para;<br>closure observation and maintenance, and the extended&para;<br>institutional control of their regional facilities”). The host&para;<br>State would then recover its upfront construction expenses&para;<br>from the considerable fees and surcharges charged to the&para;<br>waste generators served by the facility. N. C. Gen. Stat.&para;<br>§§104G–15(a)–(b) (repealed 2000) (“It is the intent of the&para;<br>General Assembly that the cost of all activities [toward&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

But, as far as I am aware, North Carolina did not&para;<br>seriously seek to amend the Compact when South Caro­&para;<br>lina departed (even though the State had sought and&para;<br>obtained an amendment previously, see ante, at 20, n. 4;&para;<br>Brief for North Carolina in Reply to Exceptions By Plain­&para;<br>tiffs to Reports of the Special Master 27), nor has it argued&para;<br>to this Court that South Carolina’s departure voided its&para;<br>contractual obligations. Indeed, there is evidence in the&para;<br>record indicating that, even after South Carolina left the&para;<br>Compact, North Carolina continued to believe that the&para;<br>operation of a waste disposal facility presented a substan­&para;<br>tial financial opportunity.

Rather, the Compact’s structure repre­&para;<br>sents what, in my view, was a understandable decision by&para;<br>the contracting States, all of whom needed a waste dis­&para;<br>posal facility, to bind themselves together so that each&para;<br>would take a turn “bear[ing] the cost of building” the&para;<br>necessary facility.

This rotational ap­&para;<br>proach is surely a sensible solution to the problems caused&para;<br>by the widespread existence of low-level nuclear waste and&para;<br>the political unpopularity of building the necessary facili­&para;<br>ties to house it. See id., at 13–16; New York v. United&para;<br>States, 505 U. S. 144, 149–151 (1992).&para;<br>The only contrary evidence—i.e., that indicates that&para;<br>North Carolina did not bear ultimate funding responsibil­&para;<br>ity—consists of the fact that the Commission voluntarily&para;<br>advanced North Carolina nearly $80 million between 1988&para;<br>and 1998 in order to help it defray its costs. Second Re­&para;<br>port 16. The Court believes that this “course of perform­&para;<br>ance” demonstrates that, once the Commission turned off&para;<br>its monetary spigot, North Carolina was no longer re­&para;<br>quired to do anything further. Ante, at 14–15. But why?&para;<br>If I advance my builder half the cost of a building, I have&para;<br>not thereby promised to advance him the whole cost. This&para;<br>is particularly true when the contract says I am responsi­&para;<br>ble for none of the cost of the building. At the very least,&para;<br>something more in the circumstances would have to show&para;<br>that additional expenditure had become a reasonable&para;<br>expectation.&para;<br>In this case, nothing suggests that North Carolina could&para;<br>reasonably expect further financing assistance. Indeed, I&para;<br>can find nothing in the majority’s opinion, or the record,&para;<br>that suggests that the Commission or the other Compact&para;<br>States intended to let North Carolina off the hook. And&para;<br>numerous documents indicate precisely the opposite—that&para;<br>despite the Commission’s funding assistance, North Caro­&para;<br>lina was still responsible for funding the project. See, e.g.,&para;<br>App. 63 (Resolution (Feb. 9, 1988) (“The Commission,&para;<br>although not obligated to do so under the Compact,” pro­&para;<br>vides funding for North Carolina)); id., at 215 (Letter from&para;<br>Richard S.
