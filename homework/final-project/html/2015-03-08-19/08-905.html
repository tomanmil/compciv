REYNOLDS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–905.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 30, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>On November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac&para;<br>tion under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging&para;<br>that petitioner Merck &amp; Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart&para;<br>attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com&para;<br>plaint is timely if filed no more than “2 years after the discovery of&para;<br>the facts constituting the violation” or 5 years after the violation. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un&para;<br>timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil&para;<br>ity of Merck’s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than&para;<br>2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under&para;<br>take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the&para;<br>relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 “VIGOR” study com&para;<br>paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car&para;<br>diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to&para;<br>the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm&para;<br>caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let&para;<br>ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck’s&para;<br>Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was “false,&para;<br>lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading”; and (3) pleadings&para;<br>filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al&para;<br>leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten&para;<br>tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding&para;<br>that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted&para;<br>with scienter, an element of a §10(b) violation, and consequently did&para;<br>not commence the running of the limitations period.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The limitations period in §1658(b)(1) begins to run once the&para;<br>plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>have “discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation”—whichever&para;<br>comes first. In the statute of limitations context, “discovery” is often&para;<br>used as a term of art in connection with the “discovery rule,” a doc&para;<br>trine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has&para;<br>“discovered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by&para;<br>state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures&para;<br>have sometimes codified this rule. When “discovery” is written di&para;<br>rectly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to re&para;<br>fer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery&para;<br>of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. Congress in&para;<br>tended courts to interpret the word “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) simi&para;<br>larly. That statute was enacted after this Court determined a gov&para;<br>erning limitations period for private §10(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva,&para;<br>Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding&para;<br>that such actions “must be commenced within one year after the dis&para;<br>covery of the facts constituting the violation . . . ,” id., at 364 (empha&para;<br>sis added). Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have&para;<br>held that “discovery” occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers&para;<br>the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would&para;<br>have discovered them. In 2002, Congress repeated Lampf’s critical&para;<br>language in enacting the present limitations statute. Normally,&para;<br>when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial prece&para;<br>dent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–&para;<br>117, and n. 13. Given the history and precedent surrounding the use&para;<br>of “discovery” in the limitations context generally as well as in this&para;<br>provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly&para;<br>strong here. Merck’s claims are evaluated accordingly. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>2. In determining the time at which “discovery” occurs, terms such&para;<br>as “inquiry notice” and “storm warnings” may be useful insofar as&para;<br>they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasona&para;<br>bly diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations pe&para;<br>riod does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a&para;<br>reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered “the facts consti&para;<br>tuting the violation,” including scienter—irrespective of whether the&para;<br>actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.&para;<br>Pp. 12–17.&para;<br>(a) Contrary to Merck’s argument, facts showing scienter are&para;<br>among those that “constitut[e] the violation.” Scienter is assuredly a&para;<br>“fact.” In a §10(b) action, it refers to “a mental state embracing in&para;<br>tent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,&para;<br>425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12, and “constitut[es]” an important and neces&para;<br>sary element of a §10(b) “violation.” See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues&para;<br>&amp; Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. Because the scienter element of&para;<br>§10(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2), unless a §10(b) complaint sets forth facts show&para;<br>ing that it is “at least as likely as” not that the defendant acted with the&para;<br>relevant intent, the claim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis de&para;<br>leted). It would frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule codified in&para;<br>§1658(b)(1) if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a&para;<br>plaintiff had “discover[ed]” any facts suggesting scienter. Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>(b) The Court also rejects Merck’s argument that, even if “discov&para;<br>ery” requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a mate&para;<br>rially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordi&para;<br>narily sufficient to show scienter. Where §10(b) is at issue, the&para;<br>relation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.&para;<br>For instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm’s future earnings,&para;<br>by itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliber&para;<br>ately lied or made an innocent error. Hence, “discovery” of additional&para;<br>scienter-related facts may be required. The statute’s inclusion of an&para;<br>unqualified bar on actions instituted “5 years after such violation,”&para;<br>§1658(b)(2), should diminish Merck’s fear that this requirement will&para;<br>give life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts&para;<br>taken long ago. P. 14.&para;<br>(c) And the Court cannot accept Merck’s argument that the limi&para;<br>tations period begins at “inquiry notice,” meaning the point where&para;<br>the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate fur&para;<br>ther, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the&para;<br>plaintiff would already have “discover[ed]” facts showing scienter or&para;<br>other “facts constituting the violation.” The statute says that the&para;<br>plaintiff’s claim accrues only after the “discovery” of those latter&para;<br>facts. It contains no indication that the limitations period can some&para;<br>times begin before “discovery” can take place. Merck also argues that&para;<br>determining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would&para;<br>have “discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for judges&para;<br>to undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have&para;<br>long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have&para;<br>known and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this&para;<br>kind of inquiry in securities fraud cases. Pp. 14–17.&para;<br>3. Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and&para;<br>Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have&para;<br>discovered, “the facts constituting the violation.” The FDA’s Septem&para;<br>ber 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here&para;<br>relevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hy&para;<br>pothesis with fraudulent intent. The FDA itself described the hy&para;<br>pothesis as a “possible explanation” for the VIGOR results, faulting&para;<br>Merck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable al&para;<br>ternative, that Vioxx might be harmful. The products-liability com&para;<br>plaints’ general statements about Merck’s state of mind show little&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>more. Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other preNovember 2001 circumstances reveal “facts” indicating the relevant&para;<br>scienter.

The complaint was&para;<br>timely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs&para;<br>“discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute&para;<br>for the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)&para;<br>when the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea&para;<br>sonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, “the facts&para;<br>constituting the violation”—whichever comes first. We&para;<br>also hold that the “facts constituting the violation” include&para;<br>the fact of scienter, “a mental state embracing intent to&para;<br>deceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst &amp; Ernst v.&para;<br>Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this&para;<br>standard, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ determination&para;<br>that the complaint filed here was timely.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves&para;<br>tors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck &amp; Co.&para;<br>and others (the petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) know&para;<br>ingly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing the use of Merck’s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to&para;<br>economic losses when the risks later became apparent).&para;<br>The plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under&para;<br>§10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.&para;<br>891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); SEC Rule 10b–5, 17&para;<br>CFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.&para;<br>Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005).&para;<br>The applicable statute of limitations provides that a&para;<br>“private right of action” that, like the present action,&para;<br>“involves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con&para;<br>trivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement&para;<br>concerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not&para;<br>later than the earlier of—&para;<br>“(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting&para;<br>the violation; or&para;<br>“(2) 5 years after such violation.” 28 U. S. C. §1658(b).&para;<br>The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,&para;<br>2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years&para;<br>of the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for&para;<br>timeliness purposes is November 6, 2001—two years&para;<br>before this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before&para;<br>this date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the&para;<br>“facts constituting the violation.” If so, by the time the&para;<br>plaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period&para;<br>in §1658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had&para;<br>not, and could not have, discovered by the critical date&para;<br>those “facts,” particularly not the facts related to scienter,&para;<br>and that their complaint was therefore timely.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts,&para;<br>as we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and&para;<br>the opinions below.&para;<br>1. 1990’s. In the mid-1990’s Merck developed Vioxx. In&para;<br>1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it&para;<br>for prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the body’s production of an enzyme called COX–2 (cyclooxygenase-2). COX–2 is associated with pain and inflammation. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its&para;<br>class like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not&para;<br>inhibit production of a second enzyme called COX–1&para;<br>(cyclooxygenase-1). COX–1 plays a part in the functioning&para;<br>of the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation&para;<br>(associated with blood clots). App. 50–51.&para;<br>2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,&para;<br>called the “VIGOR” study. Id., at 291–294. The study&para;<br>compared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The&para;<br>study showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer&para;<br>gastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But&para;<br>the study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every&para;<br>1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,&para;<br>compared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took&para;<br>naproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Comparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib&para;<br>and Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343&para;<br>New England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526–1527 (2000).&para;<br>Merck’s press release acknowledged VIGOR’s adverse&para;<br>cardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were&para;<br>“consistent with naproxen’s ability to block platelet aggregation.” App. 291. Merck noted that, since “Vioxx, like all&para;<br>COX–2 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggregation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.”&para;<br>Ibid. And Merck added that “safety data from all other&para;<br>completed and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indication of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic&para;<br>events between Vioxx” and either a placebo or comparable&para;<br>drugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>This theory—that VIGOR’s troubling cardiovascular&para;<br>findings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred&para;<br>by naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx—&para;<br>later became known as the “naproxen hypothesis.” In&para;<br>advancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>naproxen benefit “had not been observed previously.” Id.,&para;<br>at 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all&para;<br>of the above—the positive gastrointestinal results, the&para;<br>troubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,&para;<br>and the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.&para;<br>See id., at 355–391, 508–557.&para;<br>3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about&para;<br>the naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the&para;<br>FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider&para;<br>Merck’s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect&para;<br>VIGOR’s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR&para;<br>cardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392–&para;<br>395, 558–577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a&para;<br>products-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that&para;<br>“Merck’s own research” had demonstrated that “users of&para;<br>Vioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as&para;<br>compared to other less expensive, medications.” Id., at&para;<br>869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical&para;<br>Association wrote that the available data raised a “cau&para;<br>tionary flag” and strongly urged that “a trial specifically&para;<br>assessing cardiovascular risk” be done. Id., at 331–332;&para;<br>Mukherjee, Nissen, &amp; Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular&para;<br>Events Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286&para;<br>JAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg&para;<br>News quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck&para;<br>had “additional data” that were “very, very reassuring,”&para;<br>and Merck issued a press release stating that it stood&para;<br>“behind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of&para;<br>Vioxx.” App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted).&para;<br>4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a&para;<br>warning letter released to the public on September 21,&para;<br>2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,&para;<br>Merck’s Vioxx marketing was “false, lacking in fair bal&para;<br>ance, or otherwise misleading.” Id., at 339. At the same&para;<br>time, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was a “possible explanation” of the VIGOR results. Id., at&para;<br>340. But it found that Merck’s “promotional campaign&para;<br>selectively present[ed]” that hypothesis without adequately&para;<br>acknowledging “another reasonable explanation,” namely,&para;<br>“that Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio&para;<br>vascular] properties.” Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to&para;<br>send healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.&para;<br>After the FDA letter was released, more products&para;<br>liability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885–956. Merck’s&para;<br>share price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.&para;<br>By October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October&para;<br>9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam&para;<br>ined its own data and “found no evidence that Vioxx in&para;<br>creased the risk of heart attacks.” App. 504. It quoted the&para;<br>president of Merck Research Laboratories as positing&para;<br>“ ‘two possible interpretations’ ”: “ ‘Naproxen lowers the&para;<br>heart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.’ ” Ibid. Stock ana&para;<br>lysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that&para;<br>the FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis&para;<br>remained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,&para;<br>at 614, 626, 628.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We next set forth three important events that occurred&para;<br>after the critical date.&para;<br>1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the&para;<br>results of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos&para;<br>ton’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. After examining&para;<br>the medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa&para;<br>tients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to&para;<br>90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart&para;<br>attack than those given either a different painkiller or no&para;<br>painkiller at all. Id., at 164–165. (That is to say, if pa&para;<br>tients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at&para;<br>all suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of&para;<br>patients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Merck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study’s limita&para;<br>tions. Id., at 165–167.&para;<br>2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the&para;<br>market. It said that a new study had found “an increased&para;<br>risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18&para;<br>months of continuous therapy.” Id., at 182 (internal quo&para;<br>tation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly&para;<br>described the results as “totally unexpected.” Id., at 186.&para;<br>Merck’s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.&para;<br>3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published&para;<br>an article stating that “internal Merck e-mails and mar&para;<br>keting materials as well as interviews with outside scien&para;<br>tists show that the company fought forcefully for years to&para;<br>keep safety concerns from destroying the drug’s commer&para;<br>cial prospects.” Id., at 189–190. The article said that an&para;<br>early e-mail from Merck’s head of research had said that&para;<br>the VIGOR “results showed that the cardiovascular events&para;<br>‘are clearly there,’ ” that it was “ ‘a shame but . . . a low&para;<br>incidence,’ ” and that it “ ‘is mechanism based as we wor&para;<br>ried it was.’ ” Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had&para;<br>given its salespeople instructions to “ ‘DODGE’ ” questions&para;<br>about Vioxx’s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,&para;<br>2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged&para;<br>that Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the&para;<br>naproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.&para;<br>It said, for example, that Merck “knew, at least as early as&para;<br>1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,” and that a&para;<br>“1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .&para;<br>serious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more&para;<br>frequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a&para;<br>different arthritis drug or placebo.” Id., at 56, 58–59&para;<br>(emphasis and capitalization deleted).&para;<br>Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>known the “facts constituting the violation” at least two&para;<br>years earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it&para;<br>was filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.&para;<br>The court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the&para;<br>(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck’s (Octo&para;<br>ber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a&para;<br>“possibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented&para;<br>material facts” no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing&para;<br>the plaintiffs on “inquiry notice” to look further. In re&para;<br>Merck &amp; Co. Securities, Derivative &amp; “ERISA” Litigation,&para;<br>483 F. Supp. 2d 407, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Finding that the plaintiffs had failed to “show that they&para;<br>exercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were&para;<br>unable to discover their injuries,” the court took October 9,&para;<br>2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run&para;<br>and therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A&para;<br>majority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while&para;<br>constituting “storm warnings,” did not suggest much by&para;<br>way of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs&para;<br>on “inquiry notice,” requiring them to investigate further.&para;<br>In re Merck &amp; Co. Securities, Derivative &amp; “ERISA” Litiga&para;<br>tion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid&para;<br>ered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the&para;<br>2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).&para;<br>Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis&para;<br>agreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo&para;<br>harous v.

REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>run only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being&para;<br>put on “inquiry notice,” should have discovered facts con&para;<br>stituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>We granted Merck’s petition.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Before turning to Merck’s arguments, we consider a&para;<br>more basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General&para;<br>agree that §1658(b)(1)’s word “discovery” refers not only to&para;<br>a plaintiff’s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to&para;<br>the facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have&para;<br>discovered. We agree. But because the statute’s language&para;<br>does not make this interpretation obvious, and because we&para;<br>cannot answer the question presented without considering&para;<br>whether the parties are right about this matter, we set&para;<br>forth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.&para;<br>We recognize that one might read the statutory words&para;<br>“after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation”&para;<br>as referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the&para;<br>relevant facts. But in the statute of limitations context,&para;<br>the word “discovery” is often used as a term of art in con&para;<br>nection with the “discovery rule,” a doctrine that delays&para;<br>accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has “discov&para;<br>ered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to&para;<br>the general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues&para;<br>once a plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of ac&para;<br>tion,” Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust&para;<br>Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997)&para;<br>(citing Clark v. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875); inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). This Court long ago recog&para;<br>nized that something different was needed in the case of&para;<br>fraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent&para;<br>a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been&para;<br>defrauded. Otherwise, “the law which was designed to&para;<br>prevent fraud” could become “the means by which it is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>made successful and secure.” Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall.&para;<br>342, 349 (1875). Accordingly, “where a plaintiff has been&para;<br>injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without&para;<br>any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar&para;<br>of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is&para;<br>discovered.” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397&para;<br>(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis&para;<br>added). And for more than a century, courts have under&para;<br>stood that “[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in&para;<br>the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been&para;<br>discovered.” 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions §276b(11),&para;<br>p. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401–1403, and nn. 74–&para;<br>84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,&para;<br>supra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern&para;<br>R. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 138 (1887) (The rule “regard[s] the&para;<br>cause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud&para;<br>was or should have been discovered”).&para;<br>More recently, both state and federal courts have ap&para;<br>plied forms of the “discovery rule” to claims other than&para;<br>fraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions §§11.1.2.1,&para;<br>11.1.2.3, pp. 136–142, and nn. 6–13, 18–23 (1991 and 1993&para;<br>Supp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979). Legisla&para;<br>tures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.&para;<br>2 Corman §11.2, at 170–171, and nn. 1–9 (collecting stat&para;<br>utes); see, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2409a(g) (actions to quiet title&para;<br>against the United States). In doing so, legislators have&para;<br>written the word “discovery” directly into the statute. And&para;<br>when they have done so, state and federal courts have&para;<br>typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual&para;<br>discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a&para;<br>reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Pea&para;<br>cock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217–220, 55 S. E. 99, 100&para;<br>(1906); Davis v. Hibernia Sav. &amp; Loan Soc., 21 Cal.

Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76&para;<br>F. 3d 1245, 1254 (CA1 1996).&para;<br>Thus, treatise writers now describe “the discovery rule”&para;<br>as allowing a claim “to accrue when the litigant first&para;<br>knows or with due diligence should know facts that will&para;<br>form the basis for an action.” 2 Corman §11.1.1, at 134&para;<br>(emphasis added); see also ibid., n. 1 (collecting cases); 37&para;<br>Am.

Before Congress enacted that statute, this&para;<br>Court, having found in the federal securities laws the&para;<br>existence of an implied private §10(b) action, determined&para;<br>its governing limitations period by looking to other limita&para;<br>tions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,&para;<br>Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350&para;<br>(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations&para;<br>“differ[ing] slightly in terminology,” the Court chose the&para;<br>language in 15 U. S. C. §78i(e), the statutory provision&para;<br>that governs securities price manipulation claims. 501&para;<br>U. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that&para;<br>private §10(b) actions “must be commenced within one&para;<br>year after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola&para;<br>tion and within three years after such violation.” Id., at&para;<br>364 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the vari&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ous formulations the one in 15 U.

See post, at 2–4 (SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>in part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,&para;<br>and n. 7 (quoting §77m).)&para;<br>Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the&para;<br>matter held that “discovery of the facts constituting the&para;<br>violation” occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov&para;<br>ers the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably&para;<br>diligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Law v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785–786 (CA7&para;<br>1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,&para;<br>353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,&para;<br>306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).&para;<br>Some of those courts noted that other limitations provi&para;<br>sions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that&para;<br>the period begins to run “ ‘after the discovery of the untrue&para;<br>statement . . . or after such discovery should have been&para;<br>made by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,’ ” whereas&para;<br>the formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §78i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting&para;<br>§77m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at&para;<br>364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term “discov&para;<br>ery” in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long&para;<br>been understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili&para;<br>gent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit&para;<br>provision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at&para;<br>721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499–&para;<br>500.&para;<br>In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations&para;<br>statute, it repeated Lampf’s critical language. The statute&para;<br>says that an action based on fraud “may be brought not&para;<br>later than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of&para;<br>the facts constituting the violation” (or “5 years after such&para;<br>violation”). §804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,&para;<br>codified at 28 U. S. C. §1658(b) (emphasis added). (This&para;<br>statutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,&para;<br>§77m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an&para;<br>action be brought “three years after the earliest date on&para;<br>which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or&para;<br>violation” (emphasis added)).)&para;<br>Not surprisingly, the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter&para;<br>pret the word “discovery” in this statute as including not&para;<br>only facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts&para;<br>any reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Staehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d&para;<br>406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne&para;<br>Parish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).&para;<br>We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat&para;<br>utes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–117,&para;<br>and n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus&para;<br>tries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history&para;<br>and precedent surrounding the use of the word “discovery”&para;<br>in the limitations context generally as well as in this&para;<br>provision in particular, the reasons for making this as&para;<br>sumption are particularly strong here. We consequently&para;<br>hold that “discovery” as used in this statute encompasses&para;<br>not only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also&para;<br>those facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have&para;<br>known. And we evaluate Merck’s claims accordingly.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We turn now to Merck’s arguments in favor of holding&para;<br>that petitioners’ claims accrued before November 6, 2001.&para;<br>First, Merck argues that the statute does not require&para;<br>“discovery” of scienter-related “facts.” See Brief for Peti&para;<br>tioners 19–28. We cannot agree, however, that facts about&para;<br>scienter are unnecessary.&para;<br>The statute says that the limitations period does not&para;<br>begin to run until “discovery of the facts constituting the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>violation.”&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Scienter is assuredly a “fact.” In a §10(b) action, scienter&para;<br>refers to “a mental state embracing intent to deceive,&para;<br>manipulate, or defraud.” Ernst &amp; Ernst, 425 U. S., at 194,&para;<br>n. 12. And the “ ‘state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as&para;<br>the state of his digestion.’ ” Postal Service Bd. of Gover&para;<br>nors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging&para;<br>ton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).&para;<br>And this “fact” of scienter “constitut[es]” an important&para;<br>and necessary element of a §10(b) “violation.” A plaintiff&para;<br>cannot recover without proving that a defendant made a&para;<br>material misstatement with an intent to deceive—not&para;<br>merely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.&para;<br>Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);&para;<br>Ernst &amp; Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted&para;<br>special heightened pleading requirements for the scienter&para;<br>element of §10(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2)&para;<br>(requiring plaintiffs to “state with particularity facts&para;<br>giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted&para;<br>with the required state of mind” (emphasis added)). As a&para;<br>result, unless a §10(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the&para;<br>complaint showing that it is “at least as likely as” not that the&para;<br>defendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the&para;<br>claim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis deleted). It&para;<br>would therefore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery&para;<br>rule in this provision—which, after all, specifically applies&para;<br>only in cases “involv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipu&para;<br>lation, or contrivance,” §1658(b)—if the limitations period&para;<br>began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discov&para;<br>ered any facts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant&para;<br>concealed for two years that he made a misstatement with&para;<br>an intent to deceive, the limitations period would expire&para;<br>before the plaintiff had actually “discover[ed]” the fraud.&para;<br>We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are&para;<br>among those that “constitut[e] the violation.” In so hold&para;<br>ing, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a private §10(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a&para;<br>plaintiff’s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among&para;<br>those that constitute “the violation” and therefore need not&para;<br>be “discover[ed]” for a claim to accrue).&para;<br>Second, Merck argues that, even if “discovery” requires&para;<br>facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materi&para;<br>ally false or misleading statement (or material omission)&para;<br>are ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 22, 28–29. But we do not see how&para;<br>that is so. We recognize that certain statements are such&para;<br>that, to show them false is normally to show scienter as&para;<br>well. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would&para;<br>falsely say “I am not married” without being aware of the&para;<br>fact that his statement is false. Where §10(b) is at issue,&para;<br>however, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is&para;<br>more context specific. An incorrect prediction about a&para;<br>firm’s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell&para;<br>us whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an&para;<br>innocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the&para;<br>statute may require “discovery” of scienter-related facts&para;<br>beyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be&para;<br>materially false or misleading. Merck fears that this&para;<br>requirement will give life to stale claims or subject defen&para;<br>dants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress’&para;<br>inclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions&para;<br>instituted “5 years after such violation,” §1658(b)(2), giv&para;<br>ing defendants total repose after five years, should dimin&para;<br>ish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding compa&para;<br>rable bar not subject to equitable tolling).&para;<br>Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to&para;<br>run prior to November 2001 because by that point the&para;<br>plaintiffs were on “inquiry notice.” Merck uses the term&para;<br>“inquiry notice” to refer to the point “at which a plaintiff&para;<br>possesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive&para;<br>of wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of&para;<br>Appeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,&para;<br>e.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F. 3d 1250, 1254&para;<br>(CA11 2002) (“[I]nquiry notice [is] “ ‘the term used for&para;<br>knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to&para;<br>begin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had&para;<br>been infringed’ ”). Cf. Dodds, 12 F. 3d, at 350 (“duty of&para;<br>inquiry” arises once “circumstances would suggest to an&para;<br>investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she&para;<br>had been defrauded”); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v.&para;<br>Kapoor, 115 F. 3d 1332, 1335–1336 (CA7 1997) (“The facts&para;<br>constituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to&para;<br>incite the victim to investigate” and “to enable him to tie&para;<br>up any loose ends and complete the investigation in time&para;<br>to file a timely suit”); Great Rivers Cooperative of South&para;<br>eastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893,&para;<br>896 (CA8 1997) (“Inquiry notice exists when the victim is&para;<br>aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to&para;<br>investigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of&para;<br>the defendant’s misrepresentations” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>If the term “inquiry notice” refers to the point where the&para;<br>facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investi&para;<br>gate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which&para;<br>the plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing&para;<br>scienter or other “facts constituting the violation.” But the&para;<br>statute says that the plaintiff’s claim accrues only after the&para;<br>“discovery” of those latter facts. Nothing in the text sug&para;<br>gests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before&para;<br>“discovery” can take place. Merck points out that, as we&para;<br>have discussed, see supra, at 8–9, the court-created “discov&para;<br>ery rule” exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not&para;<br>generally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their&para;<br>claims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here&para;<br>with a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.&para;<br>Because the statute contains no indication that the limita&para;<br>tions period should occur at some earlier moment before&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“discovery,” when a plaintiff would have begun investigat&para;<br>ing, we cannot accept Merck’s argument.&para;<br>As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations&para;<br>period does generally begin at “discovery,” it should none&para;<br>theless run from the point of “inquiry notice” in one par&para;<br>ticular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to&para;<br>undertake an investigation once placed on “inquiry no&para;<br>tice.” In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual&para;<br>plaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not “effectively&para;<br>excuse a plaintiff’s failure to conduct a further investiga&para;<br>tion” by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably&para;<br>diligent plaintiff “in the same position.” Brief for Petition&para;<br>ers 48.&para;<br>We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same&para;<br>reason we reject “inquiry notice” as the standard gener&para;<br>ally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply&para;<br>provides that “discovery” is the event that triggers the 2&para;<br>year limitations period—for all plaintiffs. Cf. United&para;<br>States v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935) (“Laches within&para;<br>the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at&para;<br>law”). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plain&para;<br>tiffs “in the same position” no matter whether they inves&para;<br>tigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations&para;<br>period puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on “in&para;<br>quiry notice” at a disadvantage because it lapses two years&para;<br>after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered&para;<br>the necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to inves&para;<br>tigate or delays investigating may well not have discov&para;<br>ered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have&para;<br>found sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a §10(b)&para;<br>complaint that satisfies the applicable heightened plead&para;<br>ing standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F. 3d 1, 9 (CA1&para;<br>2002) (“[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may&para;<br>consume as little as a few days or as much as a few years&para;<br>to get to the bottom of the matter”).&para;<br>Merck further contends that its proposed “inquiry no&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tice” standard is superior, because determining when a&para;<br>hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have&para;<br>“discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for&para;<br>judges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional&para;<br>discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably&para;<br>diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad&para;<br>circumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already&para;<br>ask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,&para;<br>e.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New&para;<br>England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at&para;<br>1, 9–10; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201&para;<br>(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122&para;<br>F. 3d 363, 367–368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this&para;<br>precedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that&para;<br>the “discovery” of facts that put a plaintiff on “inquiry&para;<br>notice” does not automatically begin the running of the&para;<br>limitations period.&para;<br>We conclude that the limitations period in §1658(b)(1)&para;<br>begins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona&para;<br>bly diligent plaintiff would have “discover[ed] the facts&para;<br>constituting the violation”—whichever comes first. In&para;<br>determining the time at which “discovery” of those “facts”&para;<br>occurred, terms such as “inquiry notice” and “storm warn&para;<br>ings” may be useful to the extent that they identify a time&para;<br>when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent&para;<br>plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period&para;<br>does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov&para;<br>ers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov&para;<br>ered “the facts constituting the violation,” including sci&para;<br>enter—irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff&para;<br>undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal&para;<br>arguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v. REYNOLDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ber 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have&para;<br>discovered “the facts constituting the violation.” In re&para;<br>spect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA’s&para;<br>September 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck&para;<br>had “ ‘minimized’ ” the VIGOR study’s “ ‘potentially serious&para;<br>cardiovascular findings’ ” and (2) pleadings filed in prod&para;<br>ucts-liability actions in September and October 2001&para;<br>alleging that Merck had “ ‘omitted, suppressed, or con&para;<br>cealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks&para;<br>associated with Vioxx’ ” and “purposefully downplayed&para;<br>and/or understated the serious nature of the risks associ&para;<br>ated with Vioxx.” Brief for Petitioners 36–37 (quoting&para;<br>App. 340, 893).&para;<br>The FDA’s warning letter, however, shows little or&para;<br>nothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether&para;<br>Merck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent&para;<br>intent. See Part I–A(4), supra. The FDA itself described&para;<br>the pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a “possible explana&para;<br>tion” for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing&para;<br>sufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to&para;<br>Merck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.&para;<br>The products-liability complaints’ statements about&para;<br>Merck’s knowledge show little more. See Part I–A(3),&para;<br>supra. Merck does not claim that these complaints con&para;<br>tained any specific information suggesting the fraud al&para;<br>leged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis&para;<br>was false even as it promoted it. And, without providing&para;<br>any reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access&para;<br>to information about Merck’s state of mind, the complaints&para;<br>alleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed&para;<br>information about Vioxx and “purposefully downplayed&para;<br>and/or understated” the risks associated with Vioxx—the&para;<br>same charge made in the FDA warning letter. App. 893.&para;<br>In our view, neither these two circumstances nor any of&para;<br>the other pre-November 2001 circumstances that we have&para;<br>set forth in Part I–A, supra, whether viewed separately or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Thus, the plaintiffs’ suit&para;<br>is timely.

Ante, at 12–14 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). I also agree that respondents’ suit is&para;<br>timely, but for a reason different from the Court’s: Merck&para;<br>has not shown that respondents actually “discover[ed]”&para;<br>scienter more than two years before bringing suit.&para;<br>In ordinary usage, “discovery” occurs when one actually&para;<br>learns something new. See Webster’s New International&para;<br>Dictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)&para;<br>(defining “discovery” as “[f]inding out or ascertaining&para;<br>something previously unknown or unrecognized”). As the&para;<br>Court notes, however, ante, at 8–10, in the context of&para;<br>statutes of limitations “discovery” has long carried an&para;<br>additional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer&para;<br>cising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the&para;<br>facts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,&para;<br>101 U. S. 135, 140–142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v.

Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola&para;<br>tion, “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) might mean constructive&para;<br>discovery.&para;<br>In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13&para;<br>of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab&para;<br>lished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under §§11&para;<br>and 12 of that Act:&para;<br>“No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability&para;<br>created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title&para;<br>unless brought within one year after the discovery of&para;<br>the untrue statement or the omission, or after such&para;<br>discovery should have been made by the exercise of&para;<br>reasonable diligence . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §77m.&para;<br>“[D]iscovery” in §77m obviously cannot mean constructive&para;<br>discovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase&para;<br>“or after such discovery should have been made by the&para;<br>exercise of reasonable diligence.” Ibid. With §77m al&para;<br>ready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in&para;<br>the 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. §§78i(e), 78r(c), that did not&para;<br>contain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab&para;<br>lished a time bar that runs from “discovery” simpliciter.&para;<br>When Congress enacted §1658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing&para;<br>a limitations period for private actions for “fraud, deceit,&para;<br>manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula&para;<br>tory requirement concerning the securities laws,” specifi&para;<br>cally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§78c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery&para;<br>caveat. To interpret §1658(b)(1) as imposing a construc&para;<br>tive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con&para;<br>trary to common sense, that the same word means two&para;<br>very different things in the same statutory context of&para;<br>limitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the&para;<br>1933 and 1934 Acts.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>True, the sensible presumption that a word means the&para;<br>same thing when it appears more than once in the same&para;<br>statutory context—or even in the very same statute—is&para;<br>rebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.&para;<br>Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–596 (2004). Context may make&para;<br>clear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,&para;<br>and in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596–&para;<br>597. But nothing in the context of §77m or §1658(b)(1)&para;<br>suggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita&para;<br>tions periods for federal-law claims based on various false&para;<br>statements or omissions involving securities. The former&para;<br>applies to false statements or omissions in registration&para;<br>statements, §77k, and offers to sell securities, §77l(a)(2);&para;<br>the broad language of the latter (“claim[s] of fraud, deceit,&para;<br>manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula&para;<br>tory requirement concerning the securities laws”) covers&para;<br>other “manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv&para;<br>ance[s]” made “in connection with the purchase or sale” of&para;<br>a security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com&para;<br>mission regulations, §78j(b), including SEC Rule 10b–5, 17&para;<br>CFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009). There is good reason, more&para;<br>over, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private&para;<br>§10(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive&para;<br>discovery rule for claims governed by §77m: The elements&para;<br>of §10(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more&para;<br>difficult to discover than the elements of claims under&para;<br>§77k or §77l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman &amp; MacLean&para;<br>v.

And a constructive-discovery stan&para;<br>dard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by §77m.&para;<br>Determining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an&para;<br>untrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus&para;<br>is much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should&para;<br>have learned that the defendant deliberately misled him&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MERCK &amp; CO. v.

Ante, at 8–10, 12. But&para;<br>that history proves only that “discovery” can carry that&para;<br>technical meaning, and that without §77m it would be&para;<br>reasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.&para;<br>It does not show what “discovery” means in §1658(b)(1) in&para;<br>light of §77m’s codification of a constructive-discovery&para;<br>rule. In my view, the meaning of “discovery” in the&para;<br>broader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its&para;<br>meaning in the more specific context of the federal securi&para;<br>ties laws.&para;<br>The Court’s other reason for rejecting the more natural&para;<br>reading of §1658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals before the provision’s enactment. Ante,&para;<br>at 11–12. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v.&para;<br>Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we&para;<br>explicitly adopted the terms of §78i(e)—which like&para;<br>§1658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of&para;<br>reasonable diligence—as the limitations period for the&para;<br>private §10(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Court appears to believe that §77m’s distinction between actual&para;<br>and constructive discovery has no bearing on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning&para;<br>because the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at&para;<br>11–12. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word&para;<br>(“discovery”) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;&para;<br>and its use in §77m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.&para;<br>The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes&para;<br>are irrelevant, ante, at 11–12, but of course it does not believe that. Its&para;<br>entire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to “discov&para;<br>ery” in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state&para;<br>legislatures), ante, at 8–10.
