FRIEND ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1107. Argued November 10, 2009––Decided February 23, 2010&para;<br>Respondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a&para;<br>California state court for claimed state-law violations. Hertz sought&para;<br>removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2),&para;<br>1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of dif&para;<br>ferent States, §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diver&para;<br>sity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Respondents, however, claimed that&para;<br>Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, di&para;<br>versity jurisdiction was lacking under §1332(c)(1), which provides&para;<br>that “a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by&para;<br>which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its prin&para;<br>cipal place of business.” To show that its “principal place of business”&para;<br>was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration&para;<br>stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States,&para;<br>that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity,&para;<br>that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey,&para;<br>and that its core executive and administrative functions are primar&para;<br>ily carried out there. The District Court concluded that it lacked di&para;<br>versity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under&para;<br>Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount&para;<br>of the corporation’s business activity is “significantly larger” or “sub&para;<br>stantially predominates” in one State. Finding that California was&para;<br>Hertz’s “principal place of business” under that test because a plural&para;<br>ity of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court&para;<br>remanded the case to state court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Respondents’ argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under&para;<br>§1453(c)—which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as&para;<br>the District Court’s only to “court[s] of appeals,” not to the Supreme&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Court, and provides that if “a final judgment on the appeal” in a court&para;<br>of appeals “is not issued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible&para;<br>10-day extension), “the appeal shall be denied”—makes far too much&para;<br>of too little. The Court normally does not read statutory silence as&para;<br>implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute&para;<br>specifically grants. E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660–661.&para;<br>Here, replicating similar, older statutes, §1254 specifically gives the&para;<br>Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ of certiorari” cases that&para;<br>are “in the courts of appeals” when it grants the writ. The Court thus&para;<br>interprets §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as simply requiring a&para;<br>court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time—not to&para;<br>deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See,&para;<br>e.g., Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467.&para;<br>Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>2. The phrase “principal place of business” in §1332(c)(1) refers to&para;<br>the place where a corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and&para;<br>coordinate the corporation’s activities, i.e., its “nerve center,” which&para;<br>will typically be found at its corporate headquarters. Pp. 5–19.&para;<br>(a) A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdic&para;<br>tion demonstrates that Congress added §1332(c)(1)’s “principal place&para;<br>of business” language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in&para;<br>order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court juris&para;<br>diction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(b) However, the phrase “principal place of business” has proved&para;<br>more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected. After&para;<br>Congress’ amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to&para;<br>determine a corporation’s “principal place of business” for diversity&para;<br>purposes. If a corporation’s headquarters and executive offices were&para;<br>in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed&para;<br>straightforward. The “principal place of business” was in that State.&para;<br>But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were&para;<br>in one State, while the corporation’s plants or other centers of busi&para;<br>ness activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvi&para;<br>ous. Under these circumstances, for corporations with “far-flung”&para;<br>business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation’s&para;<br>“nerve center,” from which the corporation radiates out to its con&para;<br>stituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordi&para;<br>nate the corporation’s activities. However, this test did not go far&para;<br>enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corpora&para;<br>tion’s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few&para;<br>States. When faced with this question, various courts have focused&para;<br>more heavily on where a corporation’s actual business activities are&para;<br>located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to inter&para;<br>pret the statute. Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(c) In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of&para;<br>the statutory phrase, this Court returns to the “nerve center” ap&para;<br>proach: “[P]rincipal place of business” is best read as referring to the&para;<br>place where a corporation’s officers direct, control, and coordinate the&para;<br>corporation’s activities. In practice it should normally be the place&para;<br>where the corporation maintains its headquarters—provided that the&para;<br>headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordina&para;<br>tion, i.e., the “nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corpo&para;<br>ration holds its board meetings. Pp. 13–19.&para;<br>(i) Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the&para;<br>Court that the “nerve center” approach, while imperfect, is superior&para;<br>to other possibilities. First, §1332(c)(1)’s language supports the ap&para;<br>proach. The statute’s word “place” is singular, not plural. Its word&para;<br>“principal” requires that the main, prominent, or most important&para;<br>place be chosen. Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168,&para;<br>174. And the fact that the word “place” follows the words “State&para;<br>where” means that the “place” is a place within a State, not the State&para;<br>itself. A corporation’s “nerve center,” usually its main headquarters,&para;<br>is a single place. The public often considers it the corporation’s main&para;<br>place of business. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the&para;<br>application of a more general business activities test has led some&para;<br>courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within&para;<br>a State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total&para;<br>amount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and&para;<br>determining whether they are significantly larger than in the next&para;<br>ranking State. Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in&para;<br>a jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375. A “nerve&para;<br>center” approach, which ordinarily equates that “center” with a cor&para;<br>poration’s headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.&para;<br>By contrast, a corporation’s general business activities more often&para;<br>lack a single principal place where they take place. Third, the stat&para;<br>ute’s legislative history suggests that the words “principal place of&para;<br>business” should be interpreted to be no more complex than an ear&para;<br>lier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical&para;<br>to apply. A “nerve center” test offers such a possibility. A general&para;<br>business activities test does not. Pp. 14–17.&para;<br>(ii) While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all admin&para;<br>istrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under&para;<br>the “nerve center” test adopted today, this test is relatively easier to&para;<br>apply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets&para;<br>or revenues different in kind, one from the other. And though this&para;<br>test may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale&para;<br>of diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive re&para;<br>sults is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that ac&para;<br>company a more uniform legal system. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipula&para;<br>tion—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is nothing more&para;<br>than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of&para;<br>an annual executive retreat—the courts should instead take as the&para;<br>“nerve center” the place of actual direction, control, and coordination,&para;<br>in the absence of such manipulation. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>(d) Although petitioner’s unchallenged declaration suggests that&para;<br>Hertz’s “nerve center” and its corporate headquarters are one and the&para;<br>same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, re&para;<br>spondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their&para;<br>case in light of today’s holding.

S. C. §1332(c)(1)&para;<br>(emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different inter&para;<br>pretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In&para;<br>doing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judi&para;<br>cial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as&para;<br>simple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase&para;<br>“principal place of business” refers to the place where the&para;<br>corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and coordi&para;<br>nate the corporation’s activities. Lower federal courts&para;<br>have often metaphorically called that place the corpora&para;<br>tion’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., Wisconsin Knife Works v.&para;<br>National Metal Crafters, 781 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986);&para;<br>Scot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., 170 F. Supp. 862,&para;<br>865 (SDNY 1959) (Weinfeld, J.). We believe that the&para;<br>“nerve center” will typically be found at a corporation’s&para;<br>headquarters.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and&para;<br>John Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the&para;<br>Hertz Corporation, in a California state court. They&para;<br>sought damages for what they claimed were violations of&para;<br>California’s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential&para;<br>class composed of California citizens who had allegedly&para;<br>suffered similar harms.&para;<br>Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the&para;<br>plaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different&para;<br>States. §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court&para;<br>possessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and&para;<br>Nhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a&para;<br>California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver&para;<br>sity jurisdiction was lacking.&para;<br>To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration&para;<br>by an employee relations manager that sought to show&para;<br>that Hertz’s “principal place of business” was in New&para;<br>Jersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among&para;<br>other things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;&para;<br>and that California—which had about 12% of the Nation’s&para;<br>population, Pet. for Cert. 8—accounted for 273 of Hertz’s&para;<br>1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full&para;<br>time employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in&para;<br>annual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately&para;<br>21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara&para;<br>tion also stated that the “leadership of Hertz and its do&para;<br>mestic subsidiaries” is located at Hertz’s “corporate head&para;<br>quarters” in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its “core&para;<br>executive and administrative functions . . . are carried out”&para;<br>there and “to a lesser extent” in Oklahoma City, Okla&para;<br>homa; and that its “major administrative operations . . .&para;<br>are found” at those two locations.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court of the Northern District of California&para;<br>accepted Hertz’s statement of the facts as undisputed.&para;<br>But it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi&para;<br>zen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court&para;<br>applied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to&para;<br>identify a corporation’s “principal place of business” by&para;<br>first determining the amount of a corporation’s business&para;<br>activity State by State. If the amount of activity is “sig&para;<br>nificantly larger” or “substantially predominates” in one&para;<br>State, then that State is the corporation’s “principal place&para;<br>of business.” If there is no such State, then the “principal&para;<br>place of business” is the corporation’s “ ‘nerve center,’ ” i.e.,&para;<br>the place where “ ‘the majority of its executive and admin&para;<br>istrative functions are performed.’ ” Friend v. Hertz, No.&para;<br>C–07–5222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf&para;<br>ter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi&para;<br>ronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500–502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).&para;<br>Applying this test, the District Court found that the&para;<br>“plurality of each of the relevant business activities” was&para;<br>in California, and that “the differential between the&para;<br>amount of those activities” in California and the amount&para;<br>in “the next closest state” was “significant.” Order 4.&para;<br>Hence, Hertz’s “principal place of business” was Califor&para;<br>nia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The&para;<br>District Court consequently remanded the case to the&para;<br>state courts.&para;<br>Hertz appealed the District Court’s remand order. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief&para;<br>memorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz&para;<br>filed a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences&para;<br>among the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo&para;<br>rate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco&para;<br>Corp., supra, at 500–502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.&para;<br>Russellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap&para;<br>plying “total activity” test and looking at “all corporate&para;<br>activities”), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(applying “nerve center” test).&para;<br>II&para;<br>At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.&para;<br>Respondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz&para;<br>to appeal the District Court’s remand order to the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, 28 U. S. C. §1453(c), constitutes an exception to a&para;<br>more general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are&para;<br>“not reviewable on appeal.” §1447(d). They add that the&para;<br>language of §1453(c) refers only to “court[s] of appeals,”&para;<br>not to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if “a&para;<br>final judgment on the appeal” in a court of appeals “is not&para;<br>issued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible 10-day&para;<br>extension), “the appeal shall be denied.” And respondents&para;<br>draw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion&para;<br>that Congress intended to permit review of a remand&para;<br>order only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court&para;<br>(at least not if, as here, this Court’s grant of certiorari&para;<br>comes after §1453(c)’s time period has elapsed).&para;<br>This argument, however, makes far too much of too&para;<br>little. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic&para;<br>itly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that&para;<br>another statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518&para;<br>U. S. 651, 660–661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85,&para;<br>104–105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat&para;<br>ute gives this Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ&para;<br>of certiorari” cases that, like this case, are “in the courts of&para;<br>appeals” when we grant the writ. 28 U. S. C. §1254. This&para;<br>statutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants&para;<br>that yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., §1254, 62 Stat.&para;<br>928; §1, 43 Stat. 938–939 (amending §240, 36 Stat. 1157);&para;<br>§240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, §6, 26 Stat. 828. This&para;<br>history provides particularly strong reasons not to read&para;<br>§1453(c)’s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or&para;<br>limiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.&para;<br>We thus interpret §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>simply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision&para;<br>within a specified time—not to deprive this Court of sub&para;<br>sequent jurisdiction to review the case. See Aetna Casu&para;<br>alty &amp; Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467&para;<br>(1947); Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25, 28–31 (1934).&para;<br>III&para;<br>We begin our “principal place of business” discussion&para;<br>with a brief review of relevant history. The Constitution&para;<br>provides that the “judicial Power shall extend” to “Contro&para;<br>versies . . . between Citizens of different States.” Art. III,&para;<br>§2. This language, however, does not automatically confer&para;<br>diversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it&para;<br>authorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine&para;<br>the scope of the federal courts’ jurisdiction within constitu&para;<br>tional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,&para;<br>233–234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868).&para;<br>Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise&para;<br>diversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary&para;<br>Act, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear&para;<br>suits “between a citizen of the State where the suit is&para;<br>brought, and a citizen of another State.” §11, 1 Stat. 78.&para;<br>The statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,&para;<br>Chief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,&para;<br>described a corporation as an “invisible, intangible, and&para;<br>artificial being” which was “certainly not a citizen.” Bank&para;<br>of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But&para;<br>the Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal&para;<br>courts’ diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the&para;<br>corporation’s shareholders were all citizens of a different&para;<br>State from the defendants, as “the term citizen ought to be&para;<br>understood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is&para;<br>used in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons&para;<br>who come into court, in this case, under their corporate&para;<br>name.” Id., at 91–92.&para;<br>In Louisville, C. &amp; C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held&para;<br>that a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of&para;<br>the State by which it had been created, and its citizenship&para;<br>for jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at&para;<br>558–559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti&para;<br>more &amp; Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314 (1854), held that the&para;<br>reason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora&para;<br>tion was that, for the limited purpose of determining&para;<br>corporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi&para;<br>cially) presume that a corporation’s shareholders were&para;<br>citizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327–328.&para;<br>And it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325–326. Whatever&para;<br>the rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity&para;<br>purposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be&para;<br>a citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,&para;<br>A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure&para;<br>§3623, pp. 1–7 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).&para;<br>In 1928 this Court made clear that the “state of incorpo&para;<br>ration” rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora&para;<br>tion closely identified with State A could proceed in a&para;<br>federal court located in that State as long as the corpora&para;<br>tion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps&para;<br>a State where the corporation did no business at all. See&para;<br>Black and White Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co. v. Brown and&para;<br>Yellow Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522–525&para;<br>(refusing to question corporation’s reincorporation motives&para;<br>and finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in&para;<br>Congress and those who testified before it pointed out that&para;<br>this interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction’s&para;<br>basic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts’ doors&para;<br>to those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice&para;<br>against out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., 2, 4–7 (1932). Through its choice of the&para;<br>State of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate&para;<br>federal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal&para;<br>courts’ doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>business by filing incorporation papers elsewhere. Id., at&para;<br>4 (“Since the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora&para;<br>tion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for&para;<br>corporations to be incorporated in one State while they do&para;<br>business in another. And there is no doubt but that it&para;<br>often occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have&para;<br>the advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of&para;<br>litigation”). See also Hearings on S. 937 et al. before a&para;<br>Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,&para;<br>72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4–5 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George&para;<br>W. Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May&para;<br>24, 1930)) (citing a “common practice for individuals to&para;<br>incorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of&para;<br>taking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts”).&para;<br>Although various legislative proposals to curtail the corpo&para;<br>rate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, e.g.,&para;<br>S. 937, S. 939, H. R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932),&para;<br>none of these proposals were enacted into law.&para;<br>At the same time as federal dockets increased in size,&para;<br>many judges began to believe those dockets contained too&para;<br>many diversity cases. A committee of the Judicial Confer&para;<br>ence of the United States studied the matter. See Reports&para;<br>of the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and&para;<br>Special Meeting (Sept. 24–26 &amp; Mar. 19–20, 1951), in&para;<br>H. R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26–27 (1952).&para;<br>And on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on&para;<br>Jurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.&para;<br>Committee Rept.).&para;<br>Among its observations, the committee found a general&para;<br>need “to prevent frauds and abuses” with respect to juris&para;<br>diction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against&para;<br>eliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead&para;<br>it recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory&para;<br>amendment that would make a corporation a citizen both&para;<br>of the State of its incorporation and any State from which&para;<br>it received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14–&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>15 (requiring corporation to show that “less than fifty per&para;<br>cent of its gross income was derived from business trans&para;<br>acted within the state where the Federal court is held”).&para;<br>If, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state&para;<br>law in state court) a corporation that received half or more&para;<br>of its gross income from California, that corporation would&para;<br>not be able to remove the case to federal court, even if&para;<br>Delaware was its State of incorporation.&para;<br>During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem&para;<br>bers circulated their report and attended circuit confer&para;<br>ences at which federal judges discussed the report’s rec&para;<br>ommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee&para;<br>filed a new report in September, in which it revised its&para;<br>corporate citizenship recommendation. It now proposed&para;<br>that “ ‘a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state&para;<br>of its original creation . . . [and] shall also be deemed a&para;<br>citizen of a state where it has its principal place of busi&para;<br>ness.’ ” Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of&para;<br>the Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue 4 (Sept. 24,&para;<br>1951) (hereinafter Sept. Committee Rept.)—the source of&para;<br>the present-day statutory language. See Hearings on&para;<br>H. R. 2516 et al. before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House&para;<br>Committee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 9&para;<br>(1957) (hereinafter House Hearings). The committee&para;<br>wrote that this new language would provide a “simpler&para;<br>and more practical formula” than the “gross income” test.&para;<br>Sept. Committee Rept. 2. It added that the language&para;<br>“ha[d] a precedent in the jurisdictional provisions of the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Act.” Id., at 2–3.&para;<br>In mid-1957 the committee presented its reports to the&para;<br>House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary.&para;<br>House Hearings 9–27; see also H.

In respect to the “principal place of&para;<br>business” proposal, he said that the relevant language&para;<br>“ha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.” House Hear&para;<br>ings 37. He added:&para;<br>“All of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy&para;<br>cases, and as I recall the cases—and I wouldn’t want&para;<br>to be bound by this statement because I haven’t them&para;<br>before me—I think the courts have generally taken&para;<br>the view that where a corporation’s interests are&para;<br>rather widespread, the principal place of business is&para;<br>an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one. It is&para;<br>the actual place where its business operations are co&para;<br>ordinated, directed, and carried out, which would or&para;<br>dinarily be the place where its officers carry on its&para;<br>day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept,&para;<br>where its payments are made, and not necessarily a&para;<br>State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corpo&para;<br>ration, or something of that sort.&para;<br>“But that has been pretty well worked out in the&para;<br>bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available,&para;<br>you see, to be applied here without having to go over it&para;<br>again from the beginning.” Ibid.&para;<br>The House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference&para;<br>Committee Reports along with other reports and relevant&para;<br>testimony and circulated it to the general public “for the&para;<br>purpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.”&para;<br>Id., at III. Subsequently, in 1958, Congress both codified&para;<br>the courts’ traditional place of incorporation test and also&para;<br>enacted into law a slightly modified version of the Confer&para;<br>ence Committee’s proposed “principal place of business”&para;<br>language. A corporation was to “be deemed a citizen of&para;<br>any State by which it has been incorporated and of the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>State where it has its principal place of business.” §2, 72&para;<br>Stat. 415.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The phrase “principal place of business” has proved&para;<br>more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.&para;<br>Decisions under the Bankruptcy Act did not provide the&para;<br>firm guidance for which Judge Maris had hoped because&para;<br>courts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about&para;<br>how to determine a corporation’s “principal place of busi&para;<br>ness.” Compare Burdick v. Dillon, 144 F. 737, 738 (CA1&para;<br>1906) (holding that a corporation’s “principal office, rather&para;<br>than a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the ‘principal&para;<br>place of business’ ”), with Continental Coal Corp. v.&para;<br>Roszelle Bros., 242 F. 243, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the&para;<br>“principal place of business” as the location of mining&para;<br>activities, rather than the “principal office”); see also&para;<br>Friedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11&para;<br>Stan. L. Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (“The cases under the Bank&para;<br>ruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determi&para;<br>nation of the principal place of business”).&para;<br>After Congress’ amendment, courts were similarly&para;<br>uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation’s&para;<br>“principal place of business” for diversity purposes. If a&para;<br>corporation’s headquarters and executive offices were in&para;<br>the same State in which it did most of its business, the&para;<br>test seemed straightforward. The “principal place of&para;<br>business” was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.&para;<br>Silver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314–315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con&para;<br>sultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat. Corp., 101 F. 3d 900, 906–&para;<br>907 (CA2 1996).&para;<br>But suppose those corporate headquarters, including&para;<br>executive offices, are in one State, while the corporation’s&para;<br>plants or other centers of business activity are located in&para;<br>other States? In 1959 a distinguished federal district&para;<br>judge, Edward Weinfeld, relied on the Second Circuit’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act to answer this ques&para;<br>tion in part:&para;<br>“Where a corporation is engaged in far-flung and var&para;<br>ied activities which are carried on in different states,&para;<br>its principal place of business is the nerve center from&para;<br>which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from&para;<br>which its officers direct, control and coordinate all ac&para;<br>tivities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of&para;<br>the corporate objective. The test applied by our Court&para;<br>of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an&para;<br>‘office from which its business was directed and con&para;<br>trolled’—the place where ‘all of its business was under&para;<br>the supreme direction and control of its officers.’ ”&para;<br>Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at 865.&para;<br>Numerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying&para;<br>the “nerve center” test for corporations with “far-flung”&para;<br>business activities. See, e.g., Topp v. Compair Inc., 814&para;<br>F. 2d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J. Moore et al.,&para;<br>Moore’s Federal Practice §102.54[2], p. 102–112.1 (3d ed.&para;<br>2009) (hereinafter Moore’s).&para;<br>Scot’s analysis, however, did not go far enough. For it&para;<br>did not answer what courts should do when the operations&para;<br>of the corporation are not “far-flung” but rather limited to&para;<br>only a few States. When faced with this question, various&para;<br>courts have focused more heavily on where a corporation’s&para;<br>actual business activities are located. See, e.g., DiazRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60–61 (CA1&para;<br>2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v. Mushroom Makers, Inc., 612&para;<br>F. 2d 651, 656–657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore’s&para;<br>§102.54, at 102–112.1.&para;<br>Perhaps because corporations come in many different&para;<br>forms, involve many different kinds of business activities,&para;<br>and locate offices and plants for different reasons in differ&para;<br>ent ways in different regions, a general “business activi&para;<br>ties” approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Courts must decide which factors are more important than&para;<br>others: for example, plant location, sales or servicing&para;<br>centers; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.&para;<br>See, e.g., R. G. Barry Corp., supra, at 656–657 (place of&para;<br>sales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees);&para;<br>Diaz-Rodriguez, supra, at 61–62 (place of stores and in&para;<br>ventory, employees, income, and sales).&para;<br>The number of factors grew as courts explicitly com&para;<br>bined aspects of the “nerve center” and “business activity”&para;<br>tests to look to a corporation’s “total activities,” sometimes&para;<br>to try to determine what treatises have described as the&para;<br>corporation’s “center of gravity.” See, e.g., Gafford v.&para;<br>General Elec. Co., 997 F. 2d 150, 162–163 (CA6 1993);&para;<br>Amoco Rocmount Co. v. Anschutz Corp., 7 F. 3d 909, 915&para;<br>(CA10 1993); 13F Wright &amp; Miller §3625, at 100. A major&para;<br>treatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit&para;<br>by Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha&para;<br>size similar factors differently, and reporting that the&para;<br>“federal courts of appeals have employed various tests”—&para;<br>tests which “tend to overlap” and which are sometimes&para;<br>described in “language” that “is imprecise.” 15 Moore’s&para;<br>§102.54[2], at 102–112. See also id., §§102.54[2], [13], at&para;<br>102–112 to 102–122 (describing, in 14 pages, major tests&para;<br>as looking to the “nerve center,” “locus of operations,” or&para;<br>“center of corporate activities”). Not surprisingly, differ&para;<br>ent circuits (and sometimes different courts within a&para;<br>single circuit) have applied these highly general multifac&para;<br>tor tests in different ways. Id., §§102.54[3]–[7], [11]–[13]&para;<br>(noting that the First Circuit “has never explained a basis&para;<br>for choosing between ‘the center of corporate activity’ test&para;<br>and the ‘locus of operations’ test”; the Second Circuit uses&para;<br>a “two-part test” similar to that of the Fifth, Ninth, and&para;<br>Eleventh Circuits involving an initial determination as to&para;<br>whether “a corporation’s activities are centralized or de&para;<br>centralized” followed by an application of either the “place&para;<br>of operations” or “nerve center” test; the Third Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>applies the “center of corporate activities” test searching&para;<br>for the “headquarters of a corporation’s day-to-day activ&para;<br>ity”; the Fourth Circuit has “endorsed neither [the ‘nerve&para;<br>center’ or ‘place of operations’] test to the exclusion of the&para;<br>other”; the Tenth Circuit directs consideration of the “total&para;<br>activity of the company considered as a whole”). See also&para;<br>13F Wright &amp; Miller §3625 (describing, in 73 pages, the&para;<br>“nerve center,” “corporate activities,” and “total activity”&para;<br>tests as part of an effort to locate the corporation’s “center&para;<br>of gravity,” while specifying different ways in which differ&para;<br>ent circuits apply these or other factors).&para;<br>This complexity may reflect an unmediated judicial&para;<br>effort to apply the statutory phrase “principal place of&para;<br>business” in light of the general purpose of diversity juris&para;<br>diction, i.e., an effort to find the State where a corporation&para;<br>is least likely to suffer out-of-state prejudice when it is&para;<br>sued in a local court, Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595, 599&para;<br>(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.&para;<br>After all, the relevant purposive concern—prejudice&para;<br>against an out-of-state party—will often depend upon&para;<br>factors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a&para;<br>corporation’s image, its history, and its advertising, while&para;<br>the factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam&para;<br>ple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or&para;<br>the nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some&para;<br>times bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli&para;<br>hood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at&para;<br>war with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to&para;<br>achieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,&para;<br>an unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.&para;<br>V&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation&para;<br>of the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of&para;<br>Appeals’ divergent and increasingly complex interpreta&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions. Having done so, we now return to, and expand,&para;<br>Judge Weinfeld’s approach, as applied in the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit. See, e.g., Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at&para;<br>865; Wisconsin Knife Works, 781 F. 2d, at 1282. We con&para;<br>clude that “principal place of business” is best read as&para;<br>referring to the place where a corporation’s officers direct,&para;<br>control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. It is&para;<br>the place that Courts of Appeals have called the corpora&para;<br>tion’s “nerve center.” And in practice it should normally&para;<br>be the place where the corporation maintains its head&para;<br>quarters—provided that the headquarters is the actual&para;<br>center of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the&para;<br>“nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corpora&para;<br>tion holds its board meetings (for example, attended by&para;<br>directors and officers who have traveled there for the&para;<br>occasion).&para;<br>Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us&para;<br>that this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other&para;<br>possibilities. First, the statute’s language supports the&para;<br>approach. The statute’s text deems a corporation a citizen&para;<br>of the “State where it has its principal place of business. ”&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1332(c)(1).&para;<br>The word “place” is&para;<br>in the singular, not the plural. The word “principal” re&para;<br>quires us to pick out the “main, prominent” or “leading”&para;<br>place. 12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)&para;<br>(def. (A)(I)(2)). Cf. Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S.&para;<br>168, 174 (1993) (interpreting “principal place of business”&para;<br>for tax purposes to require an assessment of “whether any&para;<br>one business location is the ‘most important, consequen&para;<br>tial, or influential’ one”). And the fact that the word&para;<br>“place” follows the words “State where” means that the&para;<br>“place” is a place within a State. It is not the State itself.&para;<br>A corporation’s “nerve center,” usually its main head&para;<br>quarters, is a single place. The public often (though not&para;<br>always) considers it the corporation’s main place of busi&para;<br>ness. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>application of a more general business activities test has&para;<br>led some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a&para;<br>particular place within a State, but incorrectly at the&para;<br>State itself, measuring the total amount of business activi&para;<br>ties that the corporation conducts there and determining&para;<br>whether they are “significantly larger” than in the next&para;<br>ranking State. 297 Fed. Appx. 690.&para;<br>This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to&para;<br>strange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.&para;<br>Namely, if a “corporation may be deemed a citizen of&para;<br>California on th[e] basis” of “activities [that] roughly&para;<br>reflect California’s larger population . . . nearly every&para;<br>national retailer—no matter how far flung its operations—&para;<br>will be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur&para;<br>poses.” Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,&para;<br>1029–1030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity&para;<br>jurisdiction on the basis of a State’s population, whether&para;<br>measured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with&para;<br>modifications?&para;<br>Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a&para;<br>jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375&para;<br>(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing&para;<br>“the sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the&para;<br>area of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible”).&para;<br>Complex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up&para;<br>time and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of&para;<br>their claims, but which court is the right court to decide&para;<br>those claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.&para;<br>458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and&para;<br>reversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish&para;<br>the likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a&para;<br>claim’s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are&para;<br>at stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de&para;<br>termine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even&para;<br>when no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546&para;<br>U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Co., 526 U. S. 574, 583 (1999)). So courts benefit from&para;<br>straightforward rules under which they can readily assure&para;<br>themselves of their power to hear a case. Arbaugh, supra,&para;<br>at 514.&para;<br>Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predict&para;<br>ability. Predictability is valuable to corporations making&para;<br>business and investment decisions. Cf. First Nat. City&para;<br>Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462&para;<br>U. S. 611, 621 (1983) (recognizing the “need for certainty&para;<br>and predictability of result while generally protecting the&para;<br>justified expectations of parties with interests in the cor&para;<br>poration”). Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding&para;<br>whether to file suit in a state or federal court.&para;<br>A “nerve center” approach, which ordinarily equates&para;<br>that “center” with a corporation’s headquarters, is simple&para;<br>to apply comparatively speaking. The metaphor of a cor&para;<br>porate “brain,” while not precise, suggests a single loca&para;<br>tion. By contrast, a corporation’s general business activi&para;<br>ties more often lack a single principal place where they&para;<br>take place. That is to say, the corporation may have sev&para;<br>eral plants, many sales locations, and employees located in&para;<br>many different places. If so, it will not be as easy to de&para;<br>termine which of these different business locales is the&para;<br>“principal” or most important “place.”&para;<br>Third, the statute’s legislative history, for those who&para;<br>accept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive bench&para;<br>mark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version&para;<br>of its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corpora&para;<br>tion would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted&para;<br>for more than half of its gross income. Mar. Committee&para;<br>Rept. 14–15; see supra, at 8. The Conference changed its&para;<br>mind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too&para;<br>complex and impractical to apply. Sept. Committee Rept.&para;<br>2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S. Rep. 1830, at 31. That&para;<br>history suggests that the words “principal place of busi&para;<br>ness” should be interpreted to be no more complex than&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the initial “half of gross income” test. A “nerve center” test&para;<br>offers such a possibility. A general business activities test&para;<br>does not.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We recognize that there may be no perfect test that&para;<br>satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We&para;<br>recognize as well that, under the “nerve center” test we&para;<br>adopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this&para;<br>era of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their&para;<br>command and coordinating functions among officers who&para;<br>work at several different locations, perhaps communicat&para;<br>ing over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless&para;<br>points courts in a single direction, towards the center of&para;<br>overall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not&para;<br>have to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve&para;<br>nues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach&para;<br>provides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,&para;<br>not a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener&para;<br>ate a result.&para;<br>We also recognize that the use of a “nerve center” test&para;<br>may in some cases produce results that seem to cut&para;<br>against the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. §1332, see su&para;<br>pra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company’s business&para;<br>activities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,&para;<br>while its top officers direct those activities just across the&para;<br>river in New York, the “principal place of business” is New&para;<br>York. One could argue that members of the public in New&para;<br>Jersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the&para;<br>corporation than persons in New York—yet the corpora&para;<br>tion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case&para;<br>to federal court. And note too that the same corporation&para;<br>would be unable to remove a New York state case to fed&para;<br>eral court, despite the New York public’s presumed preju&para;<br>dice against the corporation.&para;<br>We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>However, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,&para;<br>we must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin&para;<br>tuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to&para;<br>avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while&para;<br>producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform&para;<br>legal system.&para;<br>The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity&para;<br>jurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.&para;<br>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.&para;<br>375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance&para;<br>Corp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &amp;&para;<br>Miller §3602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of&para;<br>jurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega&para;<br>tions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15&para;<br>Moore’s §102.14, at 102–32 to 102–32.1. And when faced&para;<br>with such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,&para;<br>for example, the one made by petitioner that the mere&para;<br>filing of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis&para;<br>sion’s Form 10–K listing a corporation’s “principal execu&para;<br>tive offices” would, without more, be sufficient proof to&para;<br>establish a corporation’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., SEC&para;<br>Form 10–K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/&para;<br>form10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in&para;<br>Clerk of Court’s case file). Cf. Dimmitt &amp; Owens Finan&para;<br>cial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190–1192 (CA7&para;<br>1986) (distinguishing “principal executive office” in the tax&para;<br>lien context, see 26 U. S.
