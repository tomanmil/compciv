HOLDER, ATTORNEY &para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL&para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–60. Argued March 31, 2010—Decided June 14, 2010&para;<br>Petitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, faced de&para;<br>portation after committing two misdemeanor drug offenses in Texas.&para;<br>For the first, possession of a small amount of marijuana, he received&para;<br>20 days in jail. For the second, possession without a prescription of&para;<br>one antianxiety tablet, he received 10 days. Texas law, like federal&para;<br>law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the State proved that&para;<br>petitioner had been previously convicted of a similar offense, but&para;<br>Texas did not seek such an enhancement here. After the second con&para;<br>viction, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings. Peti&para;<br>tioner conceded that he was removable, but claimed that he was eli&para;<br>gible for discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration&para;<br>and Nationality Act (INA) because he had not been convicted of any&para;<br>“aggravated felony,” 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3). Section 1101(a)(43)(B)&para;<br>defines that term to include, inter alia, “illicit trafficking in a con&para;<br>trolled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime” as defined in&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §924(c), which, in turn, defines a “drug trafficking crime”&para;<br>as a “felony punishable under,” inter alia, “the Controlled Substances&para;<br>Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq.).” A felony is a crime for which the&para;<br>“maximum term of imprisonment authorized” is “more than one&para;<br>year.” §3559(a). Simple possession offenses are ordinarily misde&para;<br>meanors punishable with shorter sentences, but a conviction “after a&para;<br>prior conviction under this subchapter [or] the law of any State . . .&para;<br>has become final”—a “recidivist” simple possession offense—is “pun&para;<br>ishable” as a “felony” under §924(c)(2) and subject to a 2-year sen&para;<br>tence. Only this “recidivist” simple possession category might be an&para;<br>“aggravated felony” under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43). A prosecutor must&para;<br>charge the existence of the prior conviction.&para;<br>See 21 U. S. C.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§851(a)(1). Notice and an opportunity to challenge its validity,&para;<br>§§851(b)–(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment&para;<br>based on the fact of the prior conviction and necessary prerequisites&para;<br>to “authorize” a felony punishment, 18 U. S. C. §3559(a), for the sim&para;<br>ple possession offense at issue.&para;<br>Here, the Immigration Judge held that petitioner’s second simple&para;<br>possession conviction was an “aggravated felony” that made him in&para;<br>eligible for cancellation of removal. The Board of Immigration Ap&para;<br>peals and Fifth Circuit affirmed. Relying on the holding in Lopez v.&para;<br>Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 56—that to be an “aggravated felony” for im&para;<br>migration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable&para;<br>as a felony under federal law—the court used a “hypothetical ap&para;<br>proach,” concluding that because petitioner’s “conduct” could have&para;<br>been prosecuted as a recidivist simple possession under state law, it&para;<br>could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggra&para;<br>vated felonies under §1101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state con&para;<br>viction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction. Pp. 9–19.&para;<br>(a) Considering the disputed provisions’ terms and their “common&para;<br>sense conception,” Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53, it would be counterintui&para;<br>tive and “unorthodox” to apply an “aggravated felony” or “illicit traf&para;<br>ficking” label to petitioner’s recidivist possession, see id., at 54. The&para;<br>same is true for his penalty. One does not usually think of a 10-day&para;<br>sentence for unauthorized possession of one prescription pill as an&para;<br>“aggravated felony.” This Court must be very wary in this case be&para;<br>cause the Government seeks a result that “the English language tells&para;<br>[the Court] not to expect.” Ibid. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(b) The Government’s position—that “conduct punishable as a fel&para;<br>ony” should be treated as the equivalent of a felony conviction when&para;<br>the underlying conduct could have been a felony under federal law—&para;<br>is unpersuasive. First, it ignores the INA’s text, which limits the At&para;<br>torney General’s cancellation power only when, inter alia, a nonciti&para;<br>zen “has . . . been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.” 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1229b(a)(3). Thus, the conviction itself is the starting place, not&para;<br>what might have or could have been charged. Under the Controlled&para;<br>Substances Act, simple possession offenses carry only a 1-year sen&para;<br>tence unless a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidi&para;<br>vist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend&para;<br>against that charge. Here, petitioner’s record of conviction contains&para;<br>no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense. An immigration court&para;<br>cannot, ex post, enhance the state offense of record just because facts&para;<br>known to it would have authorized a greater penalty. The Govern&para;<br>ment contends that had petitioner been prosecuted in federal court&para;<br>under identical circumstances, he would have committed an “aggra&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>vated felony” for immigration law purposes. But his circumstances&para;<br>were not identical to the Government’s hypothesis. And the Govern&para;<br>ment’s approach cannot be reconciled with 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3),&para;<br>which requires an “aggravated felony” conviction—not that the non&para;<br>citizen merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.&para;<br>Second, the Government’s position fails to effectuate 21 U. S. C.&para;<br>§851’s mandatory notice and process requirements, which have great&para;<br>practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are in&para;<br>tegral to the structure and design of federal drug laws. They author&para;<br>ize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pur&para;<br>sue a recidivist enhancement. So do many state criminal codes,&para;<br>including Texas’. Permitting an immigration judge to apply his own&para;<br>recidivist enhancement after the fact would denigrate state prosecu&para;<br>tors’ independent judgment to execute such laws. Third, the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit misread Lopez. This Court never used a “hypothetical ap&para;<br>proach” in its analysis. By focusing on facts known to the immigra&para;<br>tion court that could have but did not serve as the basis for the state&para;<br>conviction and punishment, the Circuit’s approach introduces a level&para;<br>of conjecture that has no basis in Lopez. Fourth, the Government’s&para;<br>argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts,&para;<br>for it is quite unlikely that petitioner’s conduct would have been pun&para;<br>ished as a felony in federal court. Finally, as the Court noted in Leo&para;<br>cal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8, ambiguities in criminal statutes&para;<br>referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti&para;<br>zen’s favor. Notably, here, the question whether petitioner has com&para;<br>mitted an “aggravated felony” is relevant to the type of relief he may&para;<br>obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact remov&para;<br>able. Thus, any relief he may obtain still depends on the Attorney&para;<br>General’s discretion.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 14, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Petitioner Jose Angel Carachuri-Rosendo, a lawful&para;<br>permanent resident who has lived in the United States&para;<br>since he was five years old, faced deportation under fed&para;<br>eral law after he committed two misdemeanor drug pos&para;<br>session offenses in Texas. For the first, possession of less&para;<br>than two ounces of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.&para;<br>For the second, possession without a prescription of one&para;<br>tablet of a common antianxiety medication, he received 10&para;<br>days in jail. After this second offense, the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment initiated removal proceedings against him. He&para;<br>conceded that he was removable, but claimed he was&para;<br>eligible for discretionary relief from removal under 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1229b(a).&para;<br>To decide whether Carachuri-Rosendo is eligible to seek&para;<br>cancellation of removal or waiver of inadmissibility under&para;<br>§1229b(a), we must decide whether he has been convicted&para;<br>of an “aggravated felony,” §1229b(a)(3), a category of&para;<br>crimes singled out for the harshest deportation conse&para;<br>quences. The Court of Appeals held that a simple drug&para;<br>possession offense, committed after the conviction for a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>first possession offense became final, is always an aggra&para;<br>vated felony. We now reverse and hold that second or&para;<br>subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated&para;<br>felonies under §1101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state&para;<br>conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66&para;<br>Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq., a lawful&para;<br>permanent resident subject to removal from the United&para;<br>States may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal&para;<br>if, inter alia, he “has not been convicted of any aggravated&para;<br>felony,” §1229b(a)(3). The statutory definition of the term&para;<br>“aggravated felony” includes a list of numerous federal&para;<br>offenses,1 one of which is “illicit trafficking in a controlled&para;<br>substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as de&para;<br>fined in section 924(c) of title 18).” §1101(a)(43)(B). Sec&para;<br>tion 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a “drug trafficking crime” to&para;<br>mean “any felony punishable under,” inter alia, “the Con&para;<br>trolled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq.).” A felony&para;<br>is a crime for which the “maximum term of imprisonment&para;<br>authorized” is “more than one year.” 18 U. S. C. §3559(a).2&para;<br>The maze of statutory cross-references continues. Sec&para;<br>tion 404 of the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes&para;<br>simple possession offenses, the type of offense at issue in&para;<br>this case. But it prescribes punishment for both misde&para;<br>meanor and felony offenses. Except for simple possession&para;<br>of crack cocaine or flunitrazepam, a first-time simple&para;<br>possession offense is a federal misdemeanor; the maxi&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>term “aggravated felony” “applies to an offense . . . whether in&para;<br>violation of Federal or State law” (or, in certain circumstances, “the law&para;<br>of a foreign country”). 8 U. S. C. § 1101(a)(43).&para;<br>2 The Controlled Substances Act itself defines the term “felony” as&para;<br>“any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State&para;<br>law as a felony.” 21 U. S. C. §802(13). The Government concedes that&para;<br>the classification of felonies under 18 U. S. C. §3559(a) controls in this&para;<br>case. Brief for Respondent 4.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mum term authorized for such a conviction is less than&para;<br>one year. 21 U. S. C. §844(a). However, a conviction for a&para;<br>simple possession offense “after a prior conviction under&para;<br>this subchapter [or] under the law of any State . . . has&para;<br>become final”—what we will call recidivist simple posses&para;<br>sion3—may be punished as a felony, with a prison sen&para;<br>tence of up to two years. Ibid.4 Thus, except for simple&para;<br>possession offenses involving isolated categories of drugs&para;<br>not presently at issue, only recidivist simple possession&para;<br>offenses are “punishable” as a federal “felony” under the&para;<br>Controlled Substances Act, 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2). And&para;<br>thus only a conviction within this particular category of&para;<br>simple possession offenses might, conceivably, be an “ag&para;<br>gravated felony” under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43).&para;<br>For a subsequent simple possession offense to be eligible&para;<br>for an enhanced punishment, i.e., to be punishable as a&para;<br>felony, the Controlled Substances Act requires that a&para;<br>prosecutor charge the existence of the prior simple posses&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>§844(a) does not expressly define a separate offense of&para;<br>“recidivist simple possession,” the fact of a prior conviction must none&para;<br>theless be found before a defendant is subject to a felony sentence.&para;<br>True, the statutory scheme comports with Almendarez-Torres v. United&para;<br>States, 523 U. S. 224, 247 (1998), in which we explained that the&para;<br>Constitution does not require treating recidivism as an element of the&para;<br>offense. In other words, Congress has permissibly set out a criminal&para;<br>offense for simple possession whereby a recidivist finding by the judge,&para;<br>by a preponderance of the evidence, authorizes a punishment that&para;<br>exceeds the statutory maximum penalty for a simple possession offense.&para;<br>But the fact of a prior conviction must still be found—if only by a judge&para;<br>and if only by a preponderance of the evidence—before a defendant is&para;<br>subject to felony punishment. For present purposes, we therefore view&para;<br>§844(a)’s felony simple possession provision as separate and distinct&para;<br>from the misdemeanor simple possession offense that section also&para;<br>prescribes.&para;<br>4 The statute provides in relevant part: “Any person who violates this&para;<br>subsection may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more&para;<br>than 1 year . . . except that if he commits such offense after a prior&para;<br>conviction . . . he shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not&para;<br>less than 15 days but not more than 2 years . . . .” 21 U.

S. C. §3559(a), for the type of simple posses&para;<br>sion offense at issue in this case.&para;<br>Neither the definition of an “illicit trafficking” offense&para;<br>under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(B) nor that of a “drug traf&para;<br>ficking crime” under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2) describes or&para;<br>references any state offenses. The “aggravated felony”&para;<br>definition does explain that the term applies “to an offense&para;<br>described in this paragraph whether in violation of Fed&para;<br>eral or State law.” §1101(a)(43). But in Lopez v. Gonzales,&para;<br>549 U.

See United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 754, n. 1 (1997) (“We note that imposition of an&para;<br>enhanced penalty [for recidivism] is not automatic. . . .

We held that “a state offense consti&para;<br>tutes a ‘felony punishable under the Controlled Sub&para;<br>stances Act’ only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a&para;<br>felony under that federal law.” Id., at 60. Despite the fact&para;<br>that the Lopez petitioner had been punished as a felon&para;<br>under state law—and, indeed, received a 5-year sen&para;<br>tence—the conduct of his offense was not punishable as a&para;<br>felony under federal law, and this prevented the state&para;<br>conviction from qualifying as an aggravated felony for&para;<br>immigration law purposes. Id., at 55 (“Unless a state&para;<br>offense is punishable as a federal felony it does not&para;<br>count”).&para;<br>In the case before us, the Government argues that Cara&para;<br>churi-Rosendo, despite having received only a 10-day&para;<br>sentence for his Texas misdemeanor simple possession&para;<br>offense, nevertheless has been “convicted” of an “aggra&para;<br>vated felony” within the meaning of the INA. This is so,&para;<br>the Government contends, because had CarachuriRosendo been prosecuted in federal court instead of state&para;<br>court, he could have been prosecuted as a felon and re&para;<br>ceived a 2-year sentence based on the fact of his prior&para;<br>simple possession offense. Our holding in Lopez teaches&para;<br>that, for a state conviction to qualify as an “aggravated&para;<br>felony” under the INA, it is necessary for the underlying&para;<br>conduct to be punishable as a federal felony. Id., at 60.&para;<br>We now must determine whether the mere possibility, no&para;<br>matter how remote, that a 2-year sentence might have&para;<br>been imposed in a federal trial is a sufficient basis for&para;<br>concluding that a state misdemeanant who was not&para;<br>charged as a recidivist has been “convicted” of an “aggra&para;<br>vated felony” within the meaning of §1229b(a)(3).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Carachuri-Rosendo was born in Mexico in 1978.&para;<br>&para;<br>He&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v.

In 2004, he&para;<br>pleaded guilty to possessing less than two ounces of mari&para;<br>juana, a Class B misdemeanor, and was sentenced to&para;<br>confinement for 20 days by a Texas court. See App. 19a–&para;<br>22a; Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§481.121(a) and&para;<br>(b)(1) (West 2003). In 2005, he pleaded nolo contendere to&para;<br>possessing less than 28 grams—one tablet—of alprazolam&para;<br>(known commercially as Xanax) without a prescription, a&para;<br>Class A misdemeanor. See App. 31a–34a; Tex. Health &amp;&para;<br>Safety Code Ann. §§481.117(a) and (b). Although Texas&para;<br>law, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhance&para;<br>ment if the prosecutor proved that Carachuri-Rosendo had&para;<br>been previously convicted of an offense of a similar class,&para;<br>the State did not elect to seek an enhancement based on&para;<br>his criminal history.

Dec. 382, 387, 391&para;<br>(2007).&para;<br>The BIA explained that the statutory question is com&para;<br>plicated by the fact that “ ‘recidivist possession’ ” is not a&para;<br>“discrete offense under Federal law.” Id., at 388. While&para;<br>most federal offenses are defined by elements that must be&para;<br>proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, recidivist&para;<br>possession is an “amalgam of elements, substantive sen&para;<br>tencing factors, and procedural safeguards.” Id., at 389.&para;<br>Section 844(a) defines simple possession by reference to&para;<br>statutory elements, but “facts leading to recidivist felony&para;<br>punishment, such as the existence of a prior conviction, do&para;<br>not qualify as ‘elements’ in the traditional sense.” Ibid.&para;<br>The BIA observed, however, that “21 U.

Ibid.&para;<br>On review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the BIA’s&para;<br>decision in Carachuri-Rosendo’s case, reading our decision&para;<br>in Lopez as dictating its outcome. “[I]f the conduct pro&para;<br>scribed by the state offense could have been prosecuted as&para;<br>a felony” under the Controlled Substances Act, the court&para;<br>reasoned, then the defendant’s conviction qualifies as an&para;<br>aggravated felony. 570 F. 3d 263, 267 (CA5 2009) (citing&para;<br>Lopez, 549 U. S., at 60). The court deemed its analysis&para;<br>“the hypothetical approach,” a term it derived from its&para;<br>understanding of our method of analysis in Lopez. 570&para;<br>F. 3d, at 266, and n. 3; see also United States v. PachecoDiaz, 513 F. 3d 776, 779 (CA7 2008) (per curiam) (employ&para;<br>ing the “hypothetical-federal-felony approach”). Under&para;<br>this approach, as the Court of Appeals understood it,&para;<br>courts “g[o] beyond the state statute’s elements to look at&para;<br>the hypothetical conduct a state statute proscribes.” 570&para;<br>F. 3d, at 266, n. 3. Accordingly, any “conduct” that “hypo&para;<br>thetically” “could have been punished as a felony” “had [it]&para;<br>been prosecuted in federal court” is an “aggravated felony”&para;<br>for federal immigration law purposes. Id., at 265. In&para;<br>applying this hypothetical approach, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>did not discuss the §851 procedural requirements. In&para;<br>stead, it concluded that because Carachuri-Rosendo’s&para;<br>“conduct” could have been prosecuted as simple possession&para;<br>with a recidivist enhancement under state law—even&para;<br>though it was not—it could have also been punished as a&para;<br>felony under federal law. Thus, in the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>view, his conviction for simple possession under state law,&para;<br>without a recidivist enhancement, was an “aggravated&para;<br>felony” for immigration law purposes.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Since the Court of Appeals issued its decision in this case, Cara&para;<br>churi-Rosendo has been removed.

S., at 53. This&para;<br>type of petty simple possession offense is not typically&para;<br>thought of as an “aggravated felony” or as “illicit traffick&para;<br>ing.” We explained in Lopez that “ordinarily ‘trafficking’&para;<br>means some sort of commercial dealing.” Id., at 53–54&para;<br>(citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed. 2004)). And&para;<br>just as in Lopez, “[c]ommerce . . . was no part of” Cara&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Rosendo was not convicted of an “aggravated felony,” and if he contin&para;<br>ues to satisfy the requirements of 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a), he may still seek&para;<br>cancellation of removal even after having been removed. See §1229b(a)&para;<br>(“The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who&para;<br>is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien” meets&para;<br>several criteria).&para;<br>9 Compare 570 F. 3d 263 (CA5 2009) (holding state conviction for&para;<br>simple possession after prior conviction for simple possession is a felony&para;<br>under the Controlled Substances Act and thus an aggravated felony),&para;<br>and Fernandez v.

As an initial matter, then, we observe that a read&para;<br>ing of this statutory scheme that would apply an “aggra&para;<br>vated” or “trafficking” label to any simple possession of&para;<br>fense is, to say the least, counterintuitive and&para;<br>“unorthodox,” ibid.&para;<br>The same is true for the type of penalty at issue. We do&para;<br>not usually think of a 10-day sentence for the unauthor&para;<br>ized possession of a trivial amount of a prescription drug&para;<br>as an “aggravated felony.” A “felony,” we have come to&para;<br>understand, is a “serious crime usu[ally] punishable by&para;<br>imprisonment for more than one year or by death.”&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter&para;<br>Black’s). An “aggravated” offense is one “made worse or&para;<br>more serious by circumstances such as violence, the pres&para;<br>ence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another&para;<br>crime.” Id., at 75. The term “aggravated felony” is unique&para;<br>to Title 8, which covers immigration matters; it is not a&para;<br>term used elsewhere within the United States Code. Our&para;<br>statutory criminal law classifies the most insignificant of&para;<br>federal felonies—“Class E” felonies—as carrying a sen&para;<br>tence of “less than five years but more than one year.” 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3559(a)(5). While it is true that a defendant’s&para;<br>criminal history might be seen to make an offense “worse”&para;<br>by virtue thereof, Black’s 75, it is nevertheless unorthodox&para;<br>to classify this type of petty simple possession recidivism&para;<br>as an “aggravated felony.”&para;<br>Of course, as Justice Souter observed in his opinion for&para;<br>the Court in Lopez, Congress, like “Humpty Dumpty,” has&para;<br>the power to give words unorthodox meanings. 549 U. S.,&para;<br>at 54. But in this case the Government argues for a result&para;<br>that “the English language tells us not to expect,” so we&para;<br>must be “very wary of the Government’s position.” Ibid.&para;<br>Because the English language tells us that most aggra&para;<br>vated felonies are punishable by sentences far longer than&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

We find this reasoning—and the “hypothetical&para;<br>approach” itself—unpersuasive for the following reasons.&para;<br>First, and most fundamentally, the Government’s posi&para;<br>tion ignores the text of the INA, which limits the Attorney&para;<br>General’s cancellation power only when, inter alia, a&para;<br>noncitizen “has . . . been convicted of a[n] aggravated&para;<br>felony.” 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3) (emphasis added). The&para;<br>text thus indicates that we are to look to the conviction&para;<br>itself as our starting place, not to what might have or&para;<br>could have been charged.

What&para;<br>we had no occasion to decide in Lopez, and what we now address, is&para;<br>what it means to be convicted of an aggravated felony. Lopez teaches&para;<br>us that it is necessary that the conduct punished under state law&para;<br>correspond to a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act&para;<br>to be an aggravated felony under §1101(a)(43)(B). But it does not&para;<br>instruct as to whether the mere possibility that conduct could be—but&para;<br>is not—charged as an offense punishable as a felony under federal law&para;<br>is sufficient.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v.

Congress, recall, chose to authorize only a 1&para;<br>year sentence for nearly all simple possession offenses, but&para;<br>it created a narrow exception for those cases in which a&para;<br>prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist&para;<br>and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to&para;<br>defend against that charge. See 21 U. S. C. §851; Part I,&para;<br>supra.&para;<br>Indisputably, Carachuri-Rosendo’s record of conviction&para;<br>contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.&para;<br>Carachuri-Rosendo argues that even such a finding would&para;<br>be insufficient, and that a prosecutorial charge of recidi&para;<br>vism and an opportunity to defend against that charge&para;<br>also would be required before he could be deemed “con&para;<br>victed” of a felony punishable under the Controlled Sub&para;<br>stances Act. In the absence of any finding of recidivism,&para;<br>we need not, and do not, decide whether these additional&para;<br>procedures would be necessary. Although a federal immi&para;<br>gration court may have the power to make a recidivist&para;<br>finding in the first instance, see, e.g., Almendarez-Torres&para;<br>v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 247 (1998), it cannot,&para;<br>ex post, enhance the state offense of record just because&para;<br>facts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty&para;<br>under either state or federal law.11 Carachuri-Rosendo&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Our decision last Term in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___ (2009),&para;<br>also relied upon by the Government, is not to the contrary. In that&para;<br>case, we rejected the so-called categorical approach employed in cases&para;<br>like United States v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), when assessing&para;<br>whether, under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i), a noncitizen has commit&para;<br>ted “an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the&para;<br>. . . victims exceeds $10,000.” Our analysis was tailored to the “circum&para;<br>stance-specific” language contained in that particular subsection of the&para;<br>aggravated felony definition. Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>8). And we specifically distinguished the “generic” categories of aggra&para;<br>vated felonies for which a categorical approach might be appropriate—&para;<br>including the “illicit trafficking” provision—from the “circumstance&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was not actually “convicted,” §1229b(a)(3), of a drug pos&para;<br>session offense committed “after a prior conviction . . . has&para;<br>become final,” §844(a), and no subsequent development&para;<br>can undo that history.12&para;<br>The Government contends that if Carachuri-Rosendo&para;<br>had been prosecuted in federal court for simple possession&para;<br>under 21 U. S. C. §844(a) under identical circumstances,&para;<br>he would have committed an “aggravated felony” for im&para;<br>migration law purposes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36–37. This is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>specific” offense at hand. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6–7, 8). Moreover,&para;<br>unlike the instant case, there was no debate in Nijhawan over whether&para;<br>the petitioner actually had been “convicted” of fraud; we only consid&para;<br>ered how to calculate the amount of loss once a conviction for a particu&para;<br>lar category of aggravated felony has occurred.&para;<br>12 Linking our inquiry to the record of conviction comports with how&para;<br>we have categorized convictions for state offenses within the definition&para;<br>of generic federal criminal sanctions under the Armed Career Criminal&para;<br>Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e). The United States urges that our&para;<br>decision in Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377, an ACCA case, supports its&para;<br>position in this case. Brief for Respondent 29–30. To the extent that&para;<br>Rodriquez is relevant to the issue at hand, we think the contrary is&para;<br>true. In that decision we considered whether a recidivist finding under&para;<br>state law that had the effect of increasing the “maximum term of&para;<br>imprisonment” to 10 years, irrespective of the actual sentence imposed,&para;<br>made the offense a “serious drug offense” within the meaning of 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §924(e)(1) and therefore an ACCA predicate offense. 553 U. S.,&para;<br>at 382. We held that a recidivist finding could set the “maximum term&para;<br>of imprisonment,” but only when the finding is a part of the record of&para;<br>conviction. Id., at 389. Indeed, we specifically observed that “in those&para;<br>cases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show&para;<br>that the defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it&para;<br>may well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing&para;<br>that a conviction was for a qualifying offense.” Ibid. In other words,&para;<br>when the recidivist finding giving rise to a 10-year sentence is not&para;<br>apparent from the sentence itself, or appears neither as part of the&para;<br>“judgment of conviction” nor the “formal charging document,” ibid., the&para;<br>Government will not have established that the defendant had a prior&para;<br>conviction for which the maximum term of imprisonment was 10 years&para;<br>or more (assuming the recidivist finding is a necessary precursor to&para;<br>such a sentence).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>so, the Government suggests, because the only statutory&para;<br>text that matters is the word “punishable” in 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(c)(2): Whatever conduct might be “punishable” as a&para;<br>felony, regardless of whether it actually is so punished or&para;<br>not, is a felony for immigration law purposes. But for the&para;<br>reasons just stated, the circumstances of CarachuriRosendo’s prosecution were not identical to those hypothe&para;<br>sized by the Government. And the Government’s ab&para;<br>stracted approach to §924(c)(2) cannot be reconciled with&para;<br>the more concrete guidance of 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3),&para;<br>which limits the Attorney General’s cancellation authority&para;<br>only when the noncitizen has actually been “convicted of&para;<br>a[n] aggravated felony”—not when he merely could have&para;<br>been convicted of a felony but was not.&para;<br>Second, and relatedly, the Government’s position fails to&para;<br>give effect to the mandatory notice and process require&para;<br>ments contained in 21 U. S. C. §851. For federal law&para;<br>purposes, a simple possession offense is not “punishable”&para;<br>as a felony unless a federal prosecutor first elects to&para;<br>charge a defendant as a recidivist in the criminal informa&para;<br>tion. The statute, as described in Part I, supra, at 3–4,&para;<br>speaks in mandatory terms, permitting “[n]o person” to be&para;<br>subject to a recidivist enhancement—and therefore, in this&para;<br>case, a felony sentence—“unless” he has been given notice&para;<br>of the Government’s intent to prove the fact of a prior&para;<br>conviction. Federal law also gives the defendant an oppor&para;<br>tunity to challenge the fact of the prior conviction itself.&para;<br>§§851(b)–(c). The Government would dismiss these proce&para;<br>dures as meaningless, so long as they may be satisfied&para;<br>during the immigration proceeding.&para;<br>But these procedural requirements have great practical&para;<br>significance with respect to the conviction itself and are&para;<br>integral to the structure and design of our drug laws.&para;<br>They authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when&para;<br>electing whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement. See&para;<br>United States v. Dodson, 288 F. 3d 153, 159 (CA5 2002)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Because the&para;<br>procedures are prerequisites to an enhanced sentence,&para;<br>§851 allows federal prosecutors to choose whether to seek&para;<br>a conviction that is “punishable” as a felony under §844(a).&para;<br>Underscoring the significance of the §851 procedures,&para;<br>the United States Attorney’s Manual places decisions&para;<br>with respect to seeking recidivist enhancements on&para;<br>par with the filing of a criminal charge against a&para;<br>defendant.

(“Every&para;<br>prosecutor should regard the filing of an information&para;<br>under 21 U. S.

Texas is one such&para;<br>State. See, e.g., Tex. Penal Code Ann. §§12.42, 12.43&para;<br>(West 2003) (recidivist enhancement is available “[i]f it is&para;<br>shown on the trial” that defendant was previously con&para;<br>victed of identified categories of felonies and misdemean&para;<br>ors). And, in this case, the prosecutor specifically elected&para;<br>to “[a]bandon” a recidivist enhancement under state law.&para;<br>App. 32a (reproducing state judgment). Were we to permit&para;<br>a federal immigration judge to apply his own recidivist&para;<br>enhancement after the fact so as to make the noncitizen’s&para;<br>offense “punishable” as a felony for immigration law pur&para;<br>poses, we would denigrate the independent judgment of&para;<br>state prosecutors to execute the laws of those sovereigns.&para;<br>Third, the Court of Appeals’ hypothetical felony ap&para;<br>proach is based on a misreading of our decision in Lopez.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We never used the term “hypothetical” to describe our&para;<br>analysis in that case. We did look to the “proscribe[d]&para;<br>conduct” of a state offense to determine whether it is&para;<br>“punishable as a felony under that federal law.” 549 U. S.,&para;<br>at 60. But the “hypothetical approach” employed by the&para;<br>Court of Appeals introduces a level of conjecture at the&para;<br>outset of this inquiry that has no basis in Lopez. It ig&para;<br>nores both the conviction (the relevant statutory hook),&para;<br>and the conduct actually punished by the state offense.&para;<br>Instead, it focuses on facts known to the immigration court&para;<br>that could have but did not serve as the basis for the state&para;<br>conviction and punishment. As the Sixth Circuit has&para;<br>explained, this approach is really a “ ‘hypothetical to a&para;<br>hypothetical.’ ” Rashid v. Mukasey, 531 F. 3d 438, 445&para;<br>(2008). Not only does the Government wish us to consider&para;<br>a fictional federal felony—whether the crime for which&para;<br>Carachuri-Rosendo was actually convicted would be a&para;<br>felony under the Controlled Substances Act—but the&para;<br>Government also wants us to consider facts not at issue in&para;<br>the crime of conviction (i.e., the existence of a prior convic&para;<br>tion) to determine whether Carachuri-Rosendo could have&para;<br>been charged with a federal felony. This methodology is&para;<br>far removed from the more focused, categorical inquiry&para;<br>employed in Lopez.&para;<br>Fourth, it seems clear that the Government’s argument&para;<br>is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts.&para;<br>It is quite unlikely that the “conduct” that gave rise to&para;<br>Carachuri-Rosendo’s conviction would have been punished&para;<br>as a felony in federal court. Under the United States&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines, Carachuri-Rosendo’s recom&para;<br>mended sentence, based on the type of controlled sub&para;<br>stance at issue, would not have exceeded one year and&para;<br>very likely would have been less than 6 months. See&para;<br>United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual&para;<br>§2D2.1(a)(3) (Nov. 2009) (base offense level of 4). And as&para;<br>was true in Lopez, the Government has provided us with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 57–58. The Government’s “hypothetical” ap&para;<br>proach to this case is therefore misleading as well as&para;<br>speculative, in that Carachuri-Rosendo’s federal-court&para;<br>counterpart would not, in actuality, have faced any felony&para;<br>charge.&para;<br>Finally, as we noted in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1,&para;<br>11, n. 8 (2004), ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced&para;<br>in immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti&para;<br>zen’s favor. And here the critical language appears in a&para;<br>criminal statute, 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).&para;<br>We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an&para;<br>“aggravated felony” is relevant, inter alia, to the type of&para;<br>relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to&para;<br>whether he is in fact removable. In other words, to the&para;<br>extent that our rejection of the Government’s broad un&para;<br>derstanding of the scope of “aggravated felony” may have&para;<br>any practical effect on policing our Nation’s borders, it is a&para;<br>limited one. Carachuri-Rosendo, and others in his posi&para;<br>tion, may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby&para;<br>avoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal. But&para;<br>he will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him, in&para;<br>the first instance, removable. Any relief he may obtain&para;<br>depends upon the discretion of the Attorney General.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In sum, the Government is correct that to qualify as an&para;<br>“aggravated felony” under the INA, the conduct prohibited&para;<br>by state law must be punishable as a felony under federal&para;<br>law. See Lopez, 549 U. S., at 60. But as the text and&para;<br>structure of the relevant statutory provisions demon&para;<br>strate, the defendant must also have been actually con&para;<br>victed of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under&para;<br>federal law. The mere possibility that the defendant’s&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v.

S. C. §1101(a)(43)(B). But my&para;<br>reasoning is more straightforward than the Court’s, and so&para;<br>I concur only in the judgment.&para;<br>Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attor&para;<br>ney General may cancel the removal of an alien from the&para;<br>United States provided the alien “has not been convicted&para;<br>of any aggravated felony.” §1229b(a)(3). There is no&para;<br>statutory definition of “convicted,” but a “conviction” is&para;<br>defined to mean a “formal judgment of guilt of the alien&para;<br>entered by a court.” §1101(a)(48)(A). The term “aggra&para;<br>vated felony” includes, among many other offenses, “a&para;<br>drug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. §924(c)]).”&para;<br>§1101(a)(43)(B). A “drug trafficking crime” is in turn&para;<br>defined as “any felony punishable under the Controlled&para;<br>Substances Act.” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).&para;<br>It could be concluded from the provisions discussed&para;<br>above that only a federal conviction for a felony offense&para;<br>under the Controlled Substances Act would qualify under&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(B). But the penultimate sentence&para;<br>in §1101(a)(43) provides that the statutory definition of&para;<br>“aggravated felony” “applies to an offense described in this&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.”&para;<br>This language, we have said, confirms that “a state offense&para;<br>whose elements include the elements of a felony punish&para;<br>able under the [Controlled Substances Act] is an aggra&para;<br>vated felony.” Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 57 (2006).&para;<br>The conceptual problem in the present case is that the&para;<br>only crime defined by 21 U. S. C. §844(a) of the Controlled&para;<br>Substances Act, simple possession of prohibited drugs, is a&para;<br>misdemeanor.&para;<br>That misdemeanor becomes a “felony&para;<br>punishable under the Controlled Substances Act” only&para;<br>because the sentencing factor of recidivism authorizes&para;<br>additional punishment beyond one year, the criterion for a&para;<br>felony. We held in Almendarez-Torres v. United States,&para;<br>523 U. S. 224 (1998), that recidivism can constitutionally&para;<br>be made a sentencing factor rather than an element of the&para;<br>crime, despite the fact that it is used to increase the al&para;<br>lowable sentence. And we said in Lopez that a “state&para;<br>possession crim[e] that correspond[s] to” the “felony viola&para;<br>tio[n]” of “recidivist possession” in §844(a) “clearly fall[s]&para;<br>within the definitions used by Congress . . . in&para;<br>§1101(a)(43)(B) and . . . §924(c)(2).” 549 U. S., at 55, n. 6.&para;<br>But to say all that is not to say that an alien has been&para;<br>“convicted of” an aggravated felony (which is what&para;<br>§1229b(a)(3) requires) when he has been convicted of&para;<br>nothing more than a second state misdemeanor violation,&para;<br>the punishment for which could, because of recidivism, be&para;<br>extended beyond one year. Just because, by reason of&para;<br>Almendarez-Torres, the federal misdemeanor offense has&para;<br>been raised to a felony offense without changing its ele&para;<br>ments, solely by increasing its penalty pursuant to a&para;<br>recidivist “sentencing factor”; it does not follow that when&para;<br>the question is asked whether someone has been “con&para;<br>victed of” a state offense that “corresponds” to the federal&para;<br>misdemeanor-become-felony, the answer can be sought in&para;<br>sentencing factors. A defendant is not “convicted” of sen&para;<br>tencing factors, but only of the elements of the crime&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>charged in the indictment. In other words, a misdemeanor&para;<br>offense with a sentencing factor that raises its punishment&para;<br>to the felony level qualifies for purposes of establishing the&para;<br>elements of a “felony punishable under the Controlled&para;<br>Substances Act”; but does not qualify for purposes of de&para;<br>termining what elements the alien has been “convicted of.”&para;<br>Here, Carachuri-Rosendo was only “convicted of” the&para;<br>crime of knowing possession of a controlled substance&para;<br>without a valid prescription, a Class A misdemeanor&para;<br>under Texas law. Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann.&para;<br>§§481.117(a) and (b) (West Supp. 2009). Since the ele&para;<br>ments of that crime did not include recidivism, the crime&para;<br>of his conviction did not “correspond” to the Controlled&para;<br>Substances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism under&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §844(a).&para;<br>For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §924(c)(2) identifies two&para;<br>requirements that must be satisfied for CarachuriRosendo’s state conviction to qualify as a “ ‘drug trafficking&para;<br>crime’ ” that renders him ineligible for cancellation of&para;<br>removal:* “First, the offense must be a felony; second, the&para;<br>offense must be capable of punishment under the Con&para;<br>trolled Substances Act (CSA).” Lopez v. Gonzales, 549&para;<br>U. S. 47, 61 (2006) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). CarachuriRosendo’s offense of simple possession was “punishable&para;<br>under the [CSA],” §924(c)(2), and thus satisfied the second&para;<br>requirement, but his crime of conviction in state court was&para;<br>only a misdemeanor. Accordingly, that offense does not&para;<br>bar him from obtaining cancellation of removal.&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit understandably felt constrained by&para;<br>this Court’s decision in Lopez to rule otherwise. In Lopez,&para;<br>this Court held that “a state offense constitutes a ‘felony&para;<br>punishable under the [CSA]’ only if it proscribes conduct&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* See 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a) (permitting cancellation of removal);&para;<br>§1229b(a)(3) (barring aliens convicted of an “aggravated felony” from&para;<br>cancellation of removal); §1101(a)(43)(B) (defining “aggravated felony”&para;<br>as “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug&para;<br>trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. §924(c)])”); 18 U. S.

Though Lopez addressed a felony&para;<br>conviction under state law that did not correlate to a&para;<br>felony under the CSA, the Court’s rule preordained the&para;<br>result in this case:&para;<br>“[T]he Court admits that its reading will subject an&para;<br>alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to&para;<br>deportation if his conduct was punishable as a felony&para;<br>under the CSA. Accordingly, even if never convicted&para;<br>of an actual felony, an alien defendant becomes eligi&para;<br>ble for deportation based on a hypothetical federal&para;<br>prosecution.” Id., at 67 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Today, the Court engages in jurisprudential gymnastics&para;<br>to avoid Lopez. I will not contort the law to fit the case.&para;<br>Lopez was wrongly decided.
