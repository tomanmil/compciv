D. B., a 13-year-old, sev&para;<br>enth-grade student, upon seeing him near the site of two home break&para;<br>ins. Five days later, after a digital camera matching one of the stolen&para;<br>items was found at J. D. B.’s school and seen in his possession, Inves&para;<br>tigator DiCostanzo went to the school. A uniformed police officer on&para;<br>detail to the school took J. D. B. from his classroom to a closed-door&para;<br>conference room, where police and school administrators questioned&para;<br>him for at least 30 minutes. Before beginning, they did not give him&para;<br>Miranda warnings or the opportunity to call his grandmother, his le&para;<br>gal guardian, nor tell him he was free to leave the room. He first de&para;<br>nied his involvement, but later confessed after officials urged him to&para;<br>tell the truth and told him about the prospect of juvenile detention.&para;<br>DiCostanzo only then told him that he could refuse to answer ques&para;<br>tions and was free to leave. Asked whether he understood, J. D. B.&para;<br>nodded and provided further detail, including the location of the sto&para;<br>len items. He also wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo’s request. When&para;<br>the school day ended, he was permitted to leave to catch the bus&para;<br>home. Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., charging&para;<br>him with breaking and entering and with larceny. His public de&para;<br>fender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived&para;<br>therefrom, arguing that J. D. B. had been interrogated in a custodial&para;<br>setting without being afforded Miranda warnings and that his&para;<br>statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.&para;<br>J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to the charges, but renewed&para;<br>his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress. The court adju&para;<br>dicated him delinquent, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals and&para;<br>State Supreme Court affirmed. The latter court declined to find&para;<br>J. D. B.’s age relevant to the determination whether he was in police&para;<br>custody.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: A child’s age properly informs Miranda’s custody analysis. Pp. 5–&para;<br>18.&para;<br>(a) Custodial police interrogation entails “inherently compelling&para;<br>pressures,” Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 467, that “can induce&para;<br>a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they&para;<br>never committed,” Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Recent&para;<br>studies suggest that risk is all the more acute when the subject of&para;<br>custodial interrogation is a juvenile. Whether a suspect is “in cus&para;<br>tody” for Miranda purposes is an objective determination involving&para;<br>two discrete inquires: “first, what were the circumstances surround&para;<br>ing the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a&para;<br>reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the&para;<br>interrogation and leave.” Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112&para;<br>(footnote omitted). The police and courts must “examine all of the&para;<br>circumstances surrounding the interrogation,” Stansbury v. Califor&para;<br>nia, 511 U. S. 318, 322, including those that “would have affected&para;<br>how a reasonable person” in the suspect’s position “would perceive&para;<br>his or her freedom to leave,” id., at 325. However, the test involves&para;<br>no consideration of the particular suspect’s “actual mindset.” Yar&para;<br>borough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 667. By limiting analysis to ob&para;<br>jective circumstances, the test avoids burdening police with the task&para;<br>of anticipating each suspect’s idiosyncrasies and divining how those&para;<br>particular traits affect that suspect’s subjective state of mind. Berke&para;<br>mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430–431. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) In some circumstances, a child’s age “would have affected how a&para;<br>reasonable person” in the suspect’s position “would perceive his or&para;<br>her freedom to leave.” Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 325. Courts can ac&para;<br>count for that reality without doing any damage to the objective na&para;<br>ture of the custody analysis. A child’s age is far “more than a chrono&para;<br>logical fact.” Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115. It is a fact&para;<br>that “generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and percep&para;<br>tion,” Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 674, that apply broadly to children as a&para;<br>class. Children “generally are less mature and responsible than&para;<br>adults,” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115; they “often lack the experience,&para;<br>perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could&para;<br>be detrimental to them,” Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635; and&para;<br>they “are more vulnerable or susceptible to . . . outside pressures”&para;<br>than adults, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569. In the specific&para;<br>context of police interrogation, events that “would leave a man cold&para;<br>and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a” teen. Haley v. Ohio,&para;<br>332 U. S. 596, 599. The law has historically reflected the same as&para;<br>sumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise&para;<br>mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to under&para;<br>stand the world around them. Legal disqualifications on children as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>a class—e.g., limitations on their ability to marry without parental&para;<br>consent—exhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating&para;<br>characteristics of youth are universal.&para;<br>Given a history “replete with laws and judicial recognition” that&para;<br>children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults, Eddings, 455&para;<br>U. S., at 115–116, there is no justification for taking a different&para;<br>course here. So long as the child’s age was known to the officer at the&para;<br>time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to a&para;<br>reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis re&para;<br>quires officers neither to consider circumstances “unknowable” to&para;<br>them, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to“ ‘ “anticipat[e] the frailties&para;<br>or idiosyncrasies” of the particular suspect being questioned.” ’ ” Al&para;<br>varado, 541 U. S., at 662. Precisely because childhood yields objec&para;<br>tive conclusions, considering age in the custody analysis does not in&para;<br>volve a determination of how youth affects a particular child’s&para;<br>subjective state of mind. In fact, were the court precluded from tak&para;<br>ing J. D. B.’s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the&para;<br>circumstances here through the eyes of a reasonable adult, when&para;<br>some objective circumstances surrounding an interrogation at school&para;<br>are specific to children. These conclusions are not undermined by the&para;<br>Court’s observation in Alvarado that accounting for a juvenile’s age&para;<br>in the Miranda custody analysis “could be viewed as creating a sub&para;<br>jective inquiry,” 541 U. S., at 668. The Court said nothing about&para;<br>whether such a view would be correct under the law or whether it&para;<br>simply merited deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective&para;<br>Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214. So long as the child’s age&para;<br>was known to the officer, or would have been objectively apparent to&para;<br>a reasonable officer, including age in the custody analysis is consis&para;<br>tent with the Miranda test’s objective nature. This does not mean&para;<br>that a child’s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor&para;<br>in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(c) Additional arguments that the State and its amici offer for ex&para;<br>cluding age from the custody inquiry are unpersuasive. Pp. 14–18.&para;<br>(d) On remand, the state courts are to address the question&para;<br>whether J. D. B. was in custody when he was interrogated, taking ac&para;<br>count of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation, includ&para;<br>ing J. D. B.’s age at the time. P. 18.&para;<br>363 N.

Arizona, 384 U. S. 436&para;<br>(1966). It is beyond dispute that children will often feel&para;<br>bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the&para;<br>same circumstances would feel free to leave. Seeing no&para;<br>reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to&para;<br>that commonsense reality, we hold that a child’s age prop&para;<br>erly informs the Miranda custody analysis.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade&para;<br>student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel&para;<br>Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his class&para;<br>room by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed&para;<br>door conference room, and questioned by police for at least&para;<br>half an hour.&para;<br>This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B.&para;<br>in the span of a week. Five days earlier, two home break&para;<br>ins occurred, and various items were stolen. Police&para;<br>stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>J. D. B. v.

D. B.’s middle school and seen in J. D. B.’s possession.&para;<br>Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with&para;<br>the local police force who had been assigned to the case,&para;<br>went to the school to question J. D. B. Upon arrival,&para;<br>DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail&para;<br>to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assis&para;<br>tant principal, and an administrative intern that he was&para;<br>there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins. Although&para;<br>DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify&para;<br>J. D. B.’s date of birth, address, and parent contact in&para;<br>formation from school records, neither the police offi&para;<br>cers nor the school administrators contacted J. D. B.’s&para;<br>grandmother.&para;<br>The uniformed officer interrupted J. D. B.’s afternoon&para;<br>social studies class, removed J. D. B. from the classroom,&para;<br>and escorted him to a school conference room.1 There,&para;<br>J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal,&para;<br>and the administrative intern. The door to the conference&para;<br>room was closed. With the two police officers and the two&para;<br>administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the&para;<br>next 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the commencement of&para;<br>questioning, J. D. B. was given neither Miranda warnings&para;<br>nor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother.

B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain&para;<br>work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one&para;<br>of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her&para;<br>house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.&para;<br>The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to “do the right&para;<br>thing,” warning J. D. B. that “the truth always comes out&para;<br>in the end.” App. 99a, 112a.&para;<br>Eventually, J. D. B. asked whether he would “still be in&para;<br>trouble” if he returned the “stuff.” Ibid.

(“[W]hat’s done is done[;] now you&para;<br>need to help yourself by making it right”); see also id., at&para;<br>99a.

Though less than perfectly&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stood, J. D. B. nodded and provided further detail, includ&para;<br>ing information about the location of the stolen items.&para;<br>Eventually J. D. B. wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo’s&para;<br>request. When the bell rang indicating the end of the&para;<br>schoolday, J. D. B. was allowed to leave to catch the bus&para;<br>home.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., each&para;<br>alleging one count of breaking and entering and one count&para;<br>of larceny. J. D. B.’s public defender moved to suppress&para;<br>his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, argu&para;<br>ing that suppression was necessary because J. D. B. had&para;<br>been “interrogated by police in a custodial setting without&para;<br>being afforded Miranda warning[s],” App. 89a, and be&para;<br>cause his statements were involuntary under the totality&para;<br>of the circumstances test, id., at 142a; see Schneckloth v.&para;<br>Bustamonte, 412 U.

D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, decid&para;<br>ing that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the&para;<br>schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were&para;<br>voluntary. As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of&para;<br>admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the&para;<br>denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated&para;<br>J. D. B. delinquent. &para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>explicit, the trial court’s order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially&para;<br>&para;<br>confessed prior to DiCostanzo’s warnings.

D. B. confessed for the first time. See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5. Because we remand for a&para;<br>determination whether J. D.

A student—whose presence&para;<br>at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school&para;<br>is cause for disciplinary action—is in a far different posi&para;<br>tion than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to&para;<br>chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on&para;<br>school grounds to attend a basketball game.

In that case, we held that a state-court&para;<br>decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old’s age as part&para;<br>of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively un&para;<br>reasonable under the deferential standard of review set&para;<br>forth by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty&para;<br>Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.

Despite the supposed&para;<br>significance of this distinction, however, at oral argument&para;<br>counsel for the State suggested without hesitation that at&para;<br>least some undeniably personal characteristics—for in&para;<br>stance, whether the individual being questioned is blind—&para;<br>are circumstances relevant to the custody analysis. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Thus, the State’s quarrel cannot be&para;<br>that age is a personal characteristic, without more.9&para;<br>The State further argues that age is irrelevant to the&para;<br>custody analysis because it “go[es] to how a suspect may&para;<br>internalize and perceive the circumstances of an interro&para;<br>gation.” Brief for Respondent 12; see also Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 21 (hereinafter U.

But the same&para;<br>can be said of every objective circumstance that the State&para;<br>agrees is relevant to the custody analysis: Each circum&para;<br>stance goes to how a reasonable person would “internalize&para;<br>and perceive” every other.

In either case, the question&para;<br>becomes how a reasonable person would understand the circumstances,&para;<br>either from the perspective of a blind person or, as here, a 13-year-old&para;<br>child.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>J.

Because the Miranda custody inquiry turns&para;<br>on the mindset of a reasonable person in the suspect’s&para;<br>position, it cannot be the case that a circumstance is sub&para;<br>jective simply because it has an “internal” or “psychologi&para;<br>cal” impact on perception.

In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendant’s&para;<br>age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see supra,&para;<br>at 12–13, and thus only add confusion.

Though the State and the dissent&para;<br>worry about gradations among children of different ages,&para;<br>that concern cannot justify ignoring a child’s age alto&para;<br>gether. Just as police officers are competent to account for&para;<br>other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree&para;<br>such as the length of questioning or the number of officers&para;<br>present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of&para;<br>relative age.

This&para;<br>rigidity, however, has brought with it one of Miranda’s&para;<br>principal strengths—“the ease and clarity of its applica­&para;<br>tion” by law enforcement officials and courts. See Moran&para;<br>v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425–426 (1986). A key contribu­&para;<br>tor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been&para;<br>Miranda’s objective reasonable-person test for determin­&para;<br>ing custody.&para;<br>Miranda’s custody requirement is based on the proposi­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 See&para;<br>&para;<br>Miranda v.

When this custodial threshold is&para;<br>reached, Miranda warnings must precede police question­&para;<br>ing. But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis&para;<br>considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypo­&para;<br>thetical reasonable person would consider himself to be&para;<br>confined.&para;<br>Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypotheti­&para;<br>cal reasonable person. Some, including those who have&para;<br>been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need&para;<br>for Miranda warnings at all. And for other suspects—&para;<br>those who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of&para;<br>police questioning—Miranda warnings may come too late&para;<br>to be of any use. That is a necessary consequence of&para;<br>Miranda’s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the&para;<br>constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects&para;<br>are left unprotected.

Age, however, is in no&para;<br>way the only personal characteristic that may correlate&para;<br>with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced&para;<br>to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.

First, many minors subjected to police interro­&para;<br>gation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects&para;<br>the one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule may not be a&para;<br>bad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying the&para;<br>Miranda custody rule to minors arise because of the&para;<br>unique circumstances present when the police conduct&para;<br>interrogations at school. The Miranda custody rule has&para;<br>always taken into account the setting in which question­&para;<br>ing occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such&para;<br>cases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases&para;<br>like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially&para;<br>young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness&para;<br>standard can take special care to ensure that incriminat­&para;<br>ing statements were not obtained through coercion.&para;<br>Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does&para;<br>not require the extreme makeover of Miranda that today’s&para;<br>decision may portend.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In the days before Miranda, this Court’s sole metric for&para;<br>evaluating the admissibility of confessions was a volun­&para;<br>tariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment’s&para;<br>Self-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bram v. United States,&para;<br>168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause);&para;<br>Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936) (due process).&para;<br>The question in these voluntariness cases was whether the&para;<br>particular “defendant’s will” had been “overborne.”&para;<br>Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.

S. 156, 185 (1953).&para;<br>All manner of individualized, personal characteristics&para;<br>were relevant in this voluntariness inquiry. Among the&para;<br>most frequently mentioned factors were the defendant’s&para;<br>education, physical condition, intelligence, and mental&para;<br>health. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 693 (1993);&para;<br>see Clewis v. Texas, 386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967) (“only a&para;<br>fifth-grade education”); Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U.

The suspect’s age also&para;<br>received prominent attention in several cases, e.g.,&para;<br>Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U.

The weight&para;<br>assigned to any one consideration varied from case to case.&para;<br>But all of these factors, along with anything else that&para;<br>might have affected the “individual’s . . . capacity for&para;<br>effective choice,” were relevant in determining whether&para;<br>the confession was coerced or compelled. See Miranda&para;<br>v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 506–507 (1966) (Harlan, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>The all-encompassing nature of the voluntariness in­&para;<br>quiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to accommodate a&para;<br>“complex of values,” Schneckloth, supra, at 223, 224, and&para;<br>to make a careful, highly individualized determination as&para;<br>to whether the police had wrung “a confession out of [the]&para;<br>accused against his will.” Blackburn v.

Shatzer, 559 U. S. __, __&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Miranda, 384 U.

Its requirements&para;<br>are no doubt “rigid,” see Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S.&para;<br>1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they&para;<br>often require courts to suppress “trustworthy and highly&para;<br>probative” statements that may be perfectly “voluntary&para;<br>under [a] traditional Fifth Amendment analysis.” Fare v.&para;<br>Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 718 (1979). But with this rigid­&para;<br>ity comes increased clarity. Miranda provides “a worka­&para;<br>ble rule to guide police officers,” New York v. Quarles, 467&para;<br>U. S. 649, 658 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted),&para;<br>and an administrable standard for the courts. As has&para;<br>often been recognized, this gain in clarity and administra­&para;<br>bility is one of Miranda’s “principal advantages.” Berke&para;<br>mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430 (1984); see also Mis&para;<br>souri v. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600, 622 (2004) (KENNEDY, J., con­&para;<br>curring in judgment).&para;<br>No less than other facets of Miranda, the threshold&para;<br>requirement that the suspect be in “custody” is “designed&para;<br>to give clear guidance to the police.” Yarborough v. Alva&para;<br>rado, 541 U. S. 652, 668, 669 (2004). Custody under&para;<br>Miranda attaches where there is a “formal arrest” or a&para;<br>“restraint on freedom of movement” akin to formal arrest.&para;<br>California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983) (per&para;<br>curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). This stan­&para;<br>dard is “objective” and turns on how a hypothetical “rea­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>J. D. B. v.

E.g., Berkemer, supra, at 442, and n. 35;&para;<br>but cf. Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at 226 (voluntariness in­&para;<br>quiry requires consideration of “the details of the interro­&para;<br>gation” and “the characteristics of the accused”). Relevant&para;<br>factors have included such things as where the question­&para;<br>ing occurred,2 how long it lasted,3 what was said,4&para;<br>any physical restraints placed on the suspect’s movement,5&para;<br>and whether the suspect was allowed to leave when&para;<br>the questioning was through.6 The totality of these&para;<br>circumstances—the external circumstances, that is, of the&para;<br>interrogation itself—is what has mattered in this Court’s&para;<br>cases. Personal characteristics of suspects have consis­&para;<br>tently been rejected or ignored as irrelevant under a one­&para;<br>size-fits-all reasonable-person standard. Stansbury, supra,&para;<br>at 323 (“[C]ustody depends on the objective circumstances&para;<br>of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored&para;<br>by either the interrogating officers or the person being&para;<br>questioned”).&para;<br>For example, in Berkemer v.

Instead, the Court focused&para;<br>only on the external circumstances of the interrogation&para;<br>itself. The opinion concluded that a typical “traffic stop” is&para;<br>akin to a “Terry stop”7 and does not qualify as the equiva­&para;<br>lent of “formal arrest.” Id., at 439.&para;<br>California v. Beheler, supra, is another useful example.&para;<br>There, the circumstances of the interrogation were “re­&para;<br>markably similar” to the facts of the Court’s earlier deci­&para;<br>sion in Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492 (1977) (per&para;<br>curiam)—the suspect was “not placed under arrest,” he&para;<br>“voluntarily [came] to the police station,” and he was&para;<br>“allowed to leave unhindered by police after a brief inter­&para;<br>view.” 463 U. S., at 1123, 1121. A California court in&para;<br>Beheler had nonetheless distinguished Mathiason because&para;<br>the police knew that Beheler “had been drinking earlier in&para;<br>the day” and was “emotionally distraught.” 463 U. S., at&para;<br>1124–1125. In a summary reversal, this Court explained&para;<br>that the fact “[t]hat the police knew more” personal infor­&para;<br>mation about Beheler than they did about Mathiason was&para;<br>“irrelevant.” Id., at 1125. Neither one of them was in&para;<br>custody under the objective reasonable-person standard.&para;<br>Ibid.; see also Alvarado, supra, at 668, 669 (experience&para;<br>with law enforcement irrelevant to Miranda custody&para;<br>analysis “as a de novo matter”).8&para;<br>The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteris­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 See&para;<br>&para;<br>Terry v.

Surely this is incorrect. The&para;<br>very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all&para;<br>sorts of “relevant and objective” circumstances—for example, all the&para;<br>objective circumstances of a suspect’s life history—that might otherwise&para;<br>bear on a custody determination.&para;<br>8 The&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tics in these and other custody cases should come as no&para;<br>surprise. To account for such individualized considera­&para;<br>tions would be to contradict Miranda’s central premise.&para;<br>The Miranda Court’s decision to adopt its inflexible pro­&para;<br>phylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion&para;<br>that “[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant pos­&para;<br>sessed, based on information as to his age, education,&para;<br>intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be&para;<br>more than speculation.” 384 U. S., at 468–469.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In light of this established practice, there is no denying&para;<br>that, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is&para;<br>embarking on a new expansion of the established custody&para;<br>standard. And since Miranda is this Court’s rule, “not a&para;<br>constitutional command,” it is up to the Court “to justify&para;<br>its expansion.” Cf. Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 688&para;<br>(1988) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to&para;<br>do.&para;<br>In its present form, Miranda’s prophylactic regime&para;<br>already imposes “high cost[s]” by requiring suppression of&para;<br>confessions that are often “highly probative” and “volun­&para;<br>tary” by any traditional standard. Oregon v. Elstad, 470&para;<br>U. S. 298, 312 (1985); see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 444&para;<br>(under Miranda “statements which may be by no means&para;<br>involuntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his&para;<br>‘rights,’ may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defen­&para;<br>dant go free as a result”). Nonetheless, a “core virtue” of&para;<br>Miranda has been the clarity and precision of its guidance&para;<br>to “police and courts.” Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680,&para;<br>694 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Moran,&para;<br>475 U. S., at 425 (“[O]ne of the principal advantages of&para;<br>Miranda is the ease and clarity of its application” (inter­&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted)). This increased clarity “has&para;<br>been thought to outweigh the burdens” that Miranda&para;<br>imposes. Fare, 442 U. S., at 718. The Court has, however,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>repeatedly cautioned against upsetting the careful “bal­&para;<br>ance” that Miranda struck, Moran, supra, at 424, and it&para;<br>has “refused to sanction attempts to expand [the] Miranda&para;<br>holding” in ways that would reduce its “clarity.” See&para;<br>Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (citing cases). Given this prac­&para;<br>tice, there should be a “strong presumption” against the&para;<br>Court’s new departure from the established custody test.&para;<br>See United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 640 (2004)&para;<br>(plurality opinion). In my judgment, that presumption&para;<br>cannot be overcome here.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court’s rationale for importing age into the custody&para;<br>standard is that minors tend to lack adults’ “capacity to&para;<br>exercise mature judgment” and that failing to account for&para;<br>that “reality” will leave some minors unprotected under&para;<br>Miranda in situations where they perceive themselves to&para;<br>be confined. See ante, at 10, 8. I do not dispute that many&para;<br>suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to&para;<br>police pressure than the average adult. As the Court&para;<br>notes, our pre-Miranda cases were particularly attuned to&para;<br>this “reality” in applying the constitutional requirement of&para;<br>voluntariness in fact. Ante, at 9 (relying on Haley, 332&para;<br>U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and Gallegos, 370 U. S.,&para;<br>at 54). It is no less a “reality,” however, that many per­&para;<br>sons over the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police&para;<br>pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person. See&para;<br>Payne, 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a “men­&para;<br>tally dull 19-year-old youth” relevant in voluntariness&para;<br>inquiry). Yet the Miranda custody standard has never&para;<br>accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any&para;<br>other individual defendants.&para;<br>Indeed, it has always been the case under Miranda that&para;<br>the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same&para;<br>fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as&para;<br>those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>J.

Miranda’s rigid&para;<br>standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.&para;<br>They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a&para;<br>windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who&para;<br>often have no need for Miranda’s protections. Compare&para;<br>Miranda, supra, at 471–472 (“[N]o amount of circumstan­&para;<br>tial evidence that the person may have been aware of ” his&para;<br>rights can overcome Miranda’s requirements), with Orozco&para;<br>v.

Are those facts more or less important than the&para;<br>student’s age in determining whether he or she “felt . . . at&para;<br>liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave”? See&para;<br>Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). An I. Q.&para;<br>score, like age, is more than just a number. Ante, at 8&para;<br>(“[A]ge is far ‘more than a chronological fact’ ”). And an&para;<br>individual’s intelligence can also yield “conclusions” simi­&para;<br>lar to those “we have drawn ourselves” in cases far afield&para;<br>of Miranda. Ante, at 12. Compare ibid. (relying on Ed&para;<br>dings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Roper v.&para;<br>Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005)), with Smith v. Texas, 543&para;<br>U.

Suppose&para;<br>the police learn (or should have learned, see ante, at 11)&para;<br>that a suspect they wish to question is a recent immigrant&para;<br>from a country in which dire consequences often befall any&para;<br>person who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting with&para;<br>the police.9 Is this really less relevant than the fact that a&para;<br>suspect is a month or so away from his 18th birthday?&para;<br>The defendant’s education is another personal charac­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Cf.&para;<br>&para;<br>United States v.

NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>teristic that may generate “conclusions about behavior and&para;<br>perception.” Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). Under today’s decision, why should police officers&para;<br>and courts “blind themselves,” ante, at 1, to the fact that a&para;<br>suspect has “only a fifth-grade education”? See Clewis,&para;<br>386 U. S., at 712 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what&para;<br>if the police know or should know that the suspect is “a&para;<br>college-educated man with law school training”? See&para;<br>Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 440 (1958), overruled&para;<br>by Miranda, supra, at 479, and n. 48. How are these&para;<br>individual considerations meaningfully different from age&para;<br>in their “relationship to a reasonable person’s understand­&para;<br>ing of his freedom of action”? Ante, at 11. The Court&para;<br>proclaims that “[a] child’s age . . . is different,” ante, at 12,&para;<br>but the basis for this ipse dixit is dubious.&para;<br>I have little doubt that today’s decision will soon be cited&para;<br>by defendants—and perhaps by prosecutors as well—for&para;<br>the proposition that all manner of other individual charac­&para;<br>teristics should be treated like age and taken into account&para;<br>in the Miranda custody calculus. Indeed, there are al­&para;<br>ready lower court decisions that take this approach. See&para;<br>United States v. Beraun-Panez, 812 F. 2d 578, 581, modi­&para;<br>fied 830 F. 2d 127 (CA9 1987) (“reasonable person who&para;<br>was an alien”); In re Jorge D., 202 Ariz. 277, 280, 43&para;<br>P. 3d 605, 608 (App. 2002) (age, maturity, and experience);&para;<br>State v.

App. 580,&para;<br>594, 698 A. 2d 1155, 1162 (1997) (“education, age, and&para;<br>intelligence”).&para;<br>In time, the Court will have to confront these issues,&para;<br>and it will be faced with a difficult choice. It may choose&para;<br>to distinguish today’s decision and adhere to the arbitrary&para;<br>proclamation that “age . . . is different.” Ante, at 12. Or it&para;<br>may choose to extend today’s holding and, in doing so,&para;<br>further undermine the very rationale for the Miranda&para;<br>regime.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>If the Court chooses the latter course, then a core virtue&para;<br>of Miranda—the “ease and clarity of its application”—will&para;<br>be lost. Moran, 475 U. S., at 425; see Fare, 442 U. S., at&para;<br>718 (noting that the clarity of Miranda’s requirements&para;<br>“has been thought to outweigh the burdens that the deci­&para;<br>sion . . . imposes”). However, even today’s more limited&para;<br>departure from Miranda’s one-size-fits-all reasonable­&para;<br>person test will produce the very consequences that&para;<br>prompted the Miranda Court to abandon exclusive reli­&para;<br>ance on the voluntariness test in the first place: The&para;<br>Court’s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will&para;<br>be hard for judges to apply. See Dickerson v. United&para;<br>States, 530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000).&para;<br>The Court holds that age must be taken into account&para;<br>when it “was known to the officer at the time of the inter­&para;<br>view,” or when it “would have been objectively apparent”&para;<br>to a reasonable officer. Ante, at 11. The first half of this&para;<br>test overturns the rule that the “initial determination of&para;<br>custody” does not depend on the “subjective views har­&para;<br>bored by . . . interrogating officers.” Stansbury, 511 U. S.,&para;<br>at 323. The second half will generate time-consuming&para;<br>satellite litigation over a reasonable officer’s perceptions.&para;<br>When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the&para;<br>inquiry may be relatively simple. But not all police ques­&para;<br>tioning of minors takes place in schools. In many cases,&para;<br>courts will presumably have to make findings as to&para;<br>whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful&para;<br>look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the&para;<br>suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer&para;<br>would have recognized that a suspect’s I. D. was a fake.&para;<br>The inquiry will be both “time-consuming and disruptive”&para;<br>for the police and the courts. See Berkemer, 468 U. S., at&para;<br>432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar&para;<br>considerations). It will also be made all the more compli­&para;<br>cated by the fact that a suspect’s dress and manner will&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>often be different when the issue is litigated in court than&para;<br>it was at the time of the interrogation.&para;<br>Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further prob­&para;<br>lems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put them­&para;<br>selves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year­&para;<br>old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be. Consider, for&para;<br>example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a cus­&para;<br>tody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical,&para;<br>average 15-year-old. Forty-five years of personal experi­&para;<br>ence and societal change separate this judge from the days&para;<br>when he or she was 15 years old. And this judge may or&para;<br>may not have been an average 15-year-old. The Court’s&para;<br>answer to these difficulties is to state that “no imaginative&para;<br>powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or]&para;<br>training in cognitive science” will be necessary. Ante, at&para;<br>17. Judges “simply need the common sense,” the Court&para;<br>assures, “to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old&para;<br>and neither is an adult.” Ante, at 17. It is obvious, how­&para;<br>ever, that application of the Court’s new rule demands&para;<br>much more than this.&para;<br>Take a fairly typical case in which today’s holding may&para;<br>make a difference. A 16½-year-old moves to suppress&para;<br>incriminating statements made prior to the administra­&para;<br>tion of Miranda warnings. The circumstances are such&para;<br>that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not&para;<br>find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant&para;<br>argues that a reasonable 16½-year-old would view the&para;<br>situation differently. The judge will not have the luxury of&para;<br>merely saying: “It is common sense that a 16½-year-old is&para;<br>not an 18-year-old. Motion granted.” Rather, the judge&para;<br>will be required to determine whether the differences&para;<br>between a typical 16½-year-old and a typical 18-year-old&para;<br>with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interroga­&para;<br>tion are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody&para;<br>determination. Today’s opinion contains not a word of&para;<br>actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

In particular, the Court&para;<br>relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant&para;<br>factor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in&para;<br>negligence suits. Ante, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third)&para;<br>of Torts §10, Comment b, p. 117 (2005)). But negligence is&para;<br>generally a question for the jury, the members of which&para;<br>can draw on their varied experiences with persons of&para;<br>different ages. It also involves a post hoc determination,&para;<br>in the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about&para;<br>whether the defendant conformed to a standard of care.&para;<br>The Miranda custody determination, by contrast, must be&para;<br>made in the first instance by police officers in the course of&para;<br>an investigation that may require quick decisionmaking.&para;<br>See Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (noting “the importance”&para;<br>under Miranda of providing “a workable rule ‘to guide&para;<br>police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to&para;<br>reflect on and balance the social and individual interests&para;<br>involved in the specific circumstances they confront’ ”);&para;<br>Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 668, 669 (“[T]he custody inquiry&para;<br>states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to&para;<br>the police”).&para;<br>Equally inapposite are the Eighth Amendment cases the&para;<br>Court cites in support of its new rule.

Those decisions&para;<br>involve the “judicial exercise of independent judgment”&para;<br>about the constitutionality of certain punishments. E.g.,&para;<br>id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Like the negligence standard,&para;<br>they do not require on-the-spot judgments by the police.&para;<br>Nor do state laws affording extra protection for juveniles&para;<br>during custodial interrogation provide any support for&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>J.

In addition, these state statutes generally&para;<br>create clear, workable rules to guide police conduct. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 16–17 (citing statutes that require or&para;<br>permit parents to be present during custodial interroga­&para;<br>tion of a minor, that require minors to be advised of a&para;<br>statutory right to communicate with a parent or guardian,&para;<br>and that require parental consent to custodial interroga­&para;<br>tion). Today’s decision, by contrast, injects a new, compli­&para;<br>cating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied&para;<br>prophylactic rule. See Alvarado, supra, at 668–669.10&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court’s decision greatly diminishes the clarity and&para;<br>administrability that have long been recognized as “prin­&para;<br>cipal advantages” of Miranda’s prophylactic requirements.&para;<br>See, e.g., Moran, 475 U. S., at 425. But what is worse, the&para;<br>Court takes this step unnecessarily, as there are other,&para;<br>less disruptive tools available to ensure that minors are&para;<br>not coerced into confessing.&para;<br>As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Court’s&para;<br>standard introduces will likely yield little added protection&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court also relies on North Carolina’s concession at oral argu­&para;<br>ment that a court could take into account a suspect’s blindness as a&para;<br>factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination. Ante, at 15, and&para;<br>n. 9. This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor&para;<br>their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.&para;<br>Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind&para;<br>defendant was given “a typed document advising him that he [was] free&para;<br>to leave.” See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23. In&para;<br>such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelli­&para;<br>gible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the&para;<br>advice at all. And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to&para;<br>leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the&para;<br>conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in&para;<br>making the Miranda custody determination.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Most juveniles who are&para;<br>subjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the&para;<br>age of majority.11 These defendants’ reactions to police&para;<br>pressure are unlikely to be much different from the reac­&para;<br>tion of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances. A&para;<br>one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule thus provides a&para;<br>roughly reasonable fit for these defendants.&para;<br>In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises&para;<br>regarding the application of the Miranda custody rule to&para;<br>minors can be accommodated by considering the unique&para;<br>circumstances present when minors are questioned in&para;<br>school. See Brief for Petitioner 10–11 (reciting at length&para;<br>the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody&para;<br>determination here, including the fact that petitioner was&para;<br>removed from class by a police officer, that the interview&para;<br>took place in a school conference room, and that a uni­&para;<br>formed officer and a vice principal were present). The&para;<br>Miranda custody rule has always taken into account the&para;<br>setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a&para;<br>suspect’s freedom of movement, and the presence of police&para;<br>officers or other authority figures. See Alvarado, supra, at&para;<br>665; Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 14).
