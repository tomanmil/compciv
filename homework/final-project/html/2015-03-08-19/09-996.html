Saf&para;<br>fold, 536 U. S. 214, 222. Under that standard, “a [habeas] petition&para;<br>should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow . . . ,” In re&para;<br>Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729, 738, n. 5. Three deci&para;<br>sions, Clark, In re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 959 P. 2d 311, and In re&para;<br>Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290, describe California’s timeli&para;<br>ness requirement. A prisoner must seek habeas relief without “sub&para;<br>stantial delay,” e.g., Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 3d, at 317, as&para;<br>“measured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasona&para;<br>bly should have known, of the information offered in support of the&para;<br>claim and the legal basis of the claim,” id., at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.&para;<br>All California courts have “original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro&para;<br>ceedings.” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10. Because a habeas petitioner&para;<br>may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Su&para;<br>preme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas peti&para;<br>tions each year. A summary denial citing Clark and Robbins means&para;<br>that the petition is rejected as untimely. California courts, however,&para;<br>have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily&para;<br>reject the petition for want of merit.&para;<br>Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was&para;<br>sentenced to life in prison without parole. After the California Su&para;<br>preme Court denied Martin’s first state habeas petition, he filed a&para;<br>federal habeas petition. The District Court ordered a stay to permit&para;<br>Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of&para;<br>counsel claims he had not previously aired. Martin raised those&para;<br>claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WALKER v. MARTIN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until&para;<br>nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final. The&para;<br>California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing Clark and Rob&para;<br>bins. Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an&para;<br>amended federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed his&para;<br>belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to&para;<br>determine the “adequacy” of the State’s time bar. Again rejecting&para;<br>Martin’s petition, the District Court found California’s bar an ade&para;<br>quate state ground for denying Martin’s new pleas. Concluding that&para;<br>the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martin’s&para;<br>claims.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: California’s timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent&para;<br>state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.&para;<br>Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(a) Absent showings of “cause” and “prejudice,” see Wainwright v.&para;<br>Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85, federal habeas relief will be unavailable&para;<br>when (1) “a state court [has] declined to address a prisoner’s federal&para;<br>claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural re&para;<br>quirement,” and (2) “the state judgment rests on independent and&para;<br>adequate state procedural grounds,” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.&para;<br>722, 729–730. P. 7.&para;<br>(b) A “rule can be ‘firmly established’ and ‘regularly followed,’ ” and&para;<br>therefore adequate, “even if the appropriate exercise of discretion&para;<br>may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not&para;<br>others.” Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___. California’s time rule,&para;<br>although discretionary, meets this “firmly established” criterion. The&para;<br>California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of&para;<br>cases, instructing habeas petitioners to “alleg[e] with specificity” the&para;<br>absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for&para;<br>one of four exceptions to the time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838,&para;<br>959 P. 2d, at 299. And California’s case law made it plain that Mar&para;<br>tin’s nearly five-year delay was “substantial.” See, e.g., id., at 829–&para;<br>831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P. 2d, at 293–294, 299, and n. 13. The Court&para;<br>finds unpersuasive Martin’s argument that the terms “reasonable&para;<br>time” period and “substantial delay” make California’s rule too vague&para;<br>to be regarded as “firmly established.” While indeterminate language&para;<br>is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particu&para;<br>lar circumstances can supply the requisite clarity. Congressional&para;<br>statutes and this Court’s decisions have employed time limitations&para;<br>that are not stated in precise, numerical terms. For example, current&para;<br>federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one&para;<br>year. The clock runs from “the date on which the [supporting] facts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>. . . could have been discovered through . . . due diligence.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2255(f)(4). Although “ ‘due diligence’ is an inexact measure&para;<br>of how much delay is too much,” Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S.&para;<br>295, 309, n. 7, “use of an imprecise standard is no justification for de&para;<br>priving [a rule’s] language of any meaning,” ibid. Nor is California’s&para;<br>time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.&para;<br>Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies&para;<br>hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Contrary&para;<br>to Martin’s argument, California’s time bar is not infirm simply be&para;<br>cause a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and&para;<br>summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.&para;<br>Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a&para;<br>showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. Discre&para;<br>tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to&para;<br>avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an&para;<br>unyielding rule. A state ground may be found inadequate when a&para;<br>court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,&para;<br>but Martin makes no such contention here. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(c) This decision leaves unaltered the Court’s repeated recognition&para;<br>that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural require&para;<br>ments to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against&para;<br>claims of federal rights. See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala.,&para;<br>338 U. S. 294, 298–299. On the record here, however, there is no ba&para;<br>sis for concluding that California’s rule operates in such a discrimina&para;<br>tory manner. P. 13.&para;<br>357 Fed.

The&para;<br>question presented: Does California’s timeliness require&para;<br>ment qualify as an independent state ground adequate to&para;<br>bar habeas corpus relief in federal court?&para;<br>California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to&para;<br>determine the timeliness of a state prisoner’s petition for&para;<br>habeas corpus. Instead, California directs petitioners to&para;<br>file known claims “as promptly as the circumstances al&para;<br>low.” In re Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729,&para;<br>738, n. 5 (1993).

Ibid.; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th,&para;<br>at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at 738, n. 5.&para;<br>California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied&para;<br>as untimely by citing the controlling decisions, i.e., Clark&para;<br>and Robbins. A spare order denying a petition without&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WALKER v. MARTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>explanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on&para;<br>the merits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see Harrington v. Richter,&para;<br>ante, at 9–10. California courts may elect to pretermit the&para;<br>question whether a petition is timely and simply deny the&para;<br>petition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.&para;<br>Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin,&para;<br>presented the claims at issue—all alleging ineffective&para;<br>assistance of counsel—in a habeas petition filed in the&para;<br>California Supreme Court nearly five years after his con&para;<br>viction became final. He stated no reason for the long&para;<br>delay. Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Mar&para;<br>tin’s petition. In turn, the U. S. District Court for the&para;<br>Eastern District of California dismissed Martin’s federal&para;<br>habeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance&para;<br>claims. Denial of Martin’s state-court petition as un&para;<br>timely, the District Court held, rested on an adequate and&para;<br>independent state ground, i.e., Martin’s failure to seek&para;<br>relief in state court “without substantial delay.” See&para;<br>Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.&para;<br>The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re&para;<br>versed the District Court’s decision. Contrasting the&para;<br>precision of “fixed statutory deadlines” with California’s&para;<br>proscription of “substantial delay,” the appeals court held&para;<br>that California’s standard lacked the clarity and certainty&para;<br>necessary to constitute an adequate state bar. 357 Fed.&para;<br>Appx. 793, 794 (2009) (relying on Townsend v. Knowles,&para;<br>562 F. 3d 1200 (CA9 2009)).&para;<br>In a recent decision, Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.

Guided by&para;<br>that decision, we hold that California is not put to the&para;<br>choice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions&para;<br>(which would almost certainly rule out Martin’s nearly&para;<br>five-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

In so&para;<br>ruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that Califor&para;<br>nia’s time bar, either by design or in operation, discrimi&para;<br>nates against federal claims or claimants.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>While most States set determinate time limits for collat&para;<br>eral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor&para;<br>rule of court does so.

The basic instruction provided by the&para;<br>California Supreme Court is simply that “a [habeas] peti&para;<br>tion should be filed as promptly as the circumstances&para;<br>allow . . . .” Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at&para;<br>738, n. 5.&para;<br>Three leading decisions describe California’s timeliness&para;<br>requirement: Robbins, Clark, and In re Gallego, 18 Cal.&para;<br>4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290 (1998).

MARTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>California’s collateral review regime differs from that of&para;<br>other States in a second notable respect: All California&para;<br>courts “have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro&para;<br>ceedings,” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10, thus “no appeal lies&para;<br>from the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,”&para;<br>Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 767, n. 7, 855 P. 2d, at 740, n. 7. “[A]&para;<br>prisoner whose petition has been denied by the superior&para;<br>court can obtain review of his claims only by the filing of a&para;<br>new petition in the Court of Appeal.” Ibid. The new&para;<br>petition, however, must be confined to claims raised in the&para;<br>initial petition. See In re Martinez, 46 Cal. 4th 945, 956,&para;<br>209 P. 3d 908, 915 (2009).&para;<br>Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower&para;<br>courts and file directly in the California Supreme Court,&para;<br>In re Kler, 188 Cal. App. 4th 1399, 1403, 115 Cal.

Finding that&para;<br>Martin’s federal petition included ineffective-assistance-of&para;<br>counsel claims he had not aired in state court, the District&para;<br>Court stayed the federal proceedings pending Martin’s&para;<br>return to state court to exhaust his remedies there.3&para;<br>In March 2002, Martin filed his second habeas petition&para;<br>in the California Supreme Court, raising the federal in&para;<br>effective assistance claims his earlier filing omitted.

A “rule can be ‘firmly&para;<br>established’ and ‘regularly followed,’ ” Kindler observed,&para;<br>“even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit&para;<br>consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not&para;<br>others.” Ibid.&para;<br>California’s time rule, although discretionary, meets the&para;<br>“firmly established” criterion, as Kindler comprehended&para;<br>that requirement. The California Supreme Court, as&para;<br>earlier noted, framed the timeliness requirement for ha&para;<br>beas petitioners in a trilogy of cases. See supra, at 3.&para;<br>Those decisions instruct habeas petitioners to “alleg[e]&para;<br>with specificity” the absence of substantial delay, good&para;<br>cause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to&para;<br>the time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P. 2d, at&para;<br>299; see Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 We&para;<br>&para;<br>have also recognized a “limited category” of “exceptional cases in&para;<br>which exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state&para;<br>ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.” Lee v.&para;<br>Kemna, 534 U. S. 362, 376 (2002). In Lee, for example, the defendant&para;<br>unsuccessfully moved for a continuance when, for reasons unknown to&para;<br>him, his alibi witnesses left the courthouse the day they were scheduled&para;<br>to testify. This Court held inadequate to bar federal review a state&para;<br>court’s persnickety application of a rule detailing formal requirements&para;<br>for continuance motions. The defendant had substantially complied&para;<br>with the rule’s key requirement and flawless compliance would have&para;<br>been unavailing given the trial court’s reason for denying the motion.&para;<br>See id., at 381–382. Martin does not suggest that the application of&para;<br>California’s timeliness rule in his case falls within the exceptional&para;<br>category Lee described and illustrated. See Brief for Respondent 28, 29,&para;<br>54.&para;<br>5 An untimely petition “will be entertained on the merits if the peti&para;<br>tioner demonstrates (i) that error of constitutional magnitude led to a&para;<br>trial that was so fundamentally unfair that absent the error no reason&para;<br>able judge or jury would have convicted the petitioner; (ii) that the&para;<br>petitioner is actually innocent of the crime or crimes of which he or she&para;<br>was convicted; (iii) that the death penalty was imposed by a sentencing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

App., July 23, 2002) (delay of 16 months&para;<br>barred claim). See also In re Miller, No. B186447, 2006&para;<br>WL 1980385, *2–3 (Cal. App., July 17, 2006) (delay of two&para;<br>years and six months barred claim).&para;<br>Martin nevertheless urges that California’s rule is too&para;<br>vague to be regarded as “firmly established.” “[R]eason&para;<br>able time” period and “substantial delay,” he maintains,&para;<br>are “meaningless terms.” Brief for Respondent 48 (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). We disagree. Indetermi&para;<br>nate language is typical of discretionary rules. Applica&para;<br>tion of those rules in particular circumstances, however,&para;<br>can supply the requisite clarity.&para;<br>Congressional statutes and this Court’s decisions, we&para;<br>note, have employed time limitations that are not stated&para;<br>in precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas&para;<br>Corpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on&para;<br>submission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dis&para;<br>missal of a state prisoner’s petition when it appeared that&para;<br>delay in commencing litigation “prejudiced [the State] in&para;<br>its ability to respond.” 28 U. S. C. §2254 Rule 9(a) (1994&para;<br>ed.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show&para;<br>that he could not earlier have known, “by the exercise of&para;<br>reasonable diligence,” the grounds on which he based the&para;<br>petition. Ibid. In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269 (2005),&para;<br>we instructed district courts, when employing stay and&para;<br>abeyance procedure, see supra, at 5, n. 3, to “place reason&para;<br>——————&para;<br>authority that had such a grossly misleading profile of the petitioner&para;<br>before it that, absent the trial error or omission, no reasonable judge or&para;<br>jury would have imposed a sentence of death; or (iv) that the petitioner&para;<br>was convicted or sentenced under an invalid statute.” In re Robbins, 18&para;<br>Cal. 4th 770, 780–781, 959 P. 2d 311, 318 (1998).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>WALKER v.

S., at 278.&para;<br>Current federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for&para;<br>filing a petition to one year. The clock runs from “the date&para;<br>on which the [supporting] facts . . . could have been dis&para;<br>covered through the exercise of due diligence.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2255(f)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (applicable to federal&para;<br>prisoners); see §2244(d)(1)(D) (2006 ed.) (similar provision&para;<br>applicable to state prisoners). “[D]ue diligence,” we have&para;<br>observed, “ is an inexact measure of how much delay is too&para;<br>much.” Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S. 295, 309, n. 7&para;<br>(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). But “use of an&para;<br>imprecise standard,” we immediately added, “is no justifi&para;<br>cation for depriving [a rule’s] language of any meaning.”&para;<br>Ibid. “[I]t would seem particularly strange to disregard&para;<br>state procedural rules that are substantially similar to&para;<br>those to which we give full force in our own courts.” Kindler, 558 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8).&para;<br>Nor is California’s time rule vulnerable on the ground&para;<br>that it is not regularly followed. Each year, the California&para;<br>Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas&para;<br>petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Brief for Appellant&para;<br>in No. 08–15752 (CA9), pp. 31–32. On the same day the&para;<br>court denied Martin’s petition, it issued 21 other&para;<br>Clark/Robbins summary denials. See Brief for Habeas&para;<br>Corpus Resource Center as Amicus Curiae 20. In rea&para;<br>soned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke&para;<br>Clark, Robbins, and Gallego to determine whether a ha&para;<br>beas petition is time barred.6&para;<br>Martin argued below that California’s time bar is not&para;<br>regularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 See, e.g., In re Sanders, 21 Cal. 4th 697, 703, 981 P. 2d 1038, 1042&para;<br>(1999); In re Hamilton, 20 Cal. 4th 273, 283, n. 5, 975 P. 2d 600, 605,&para;<br>n. 5 (1999); In re Watson, 104 Cal. Rptr. 3d 403, 407 (App. 2010) (offi&para;<br>cially depublished); In re Nunez, 173 Cal. App. 4th 709, 723, 93 Cal.&para;<br>Rptr. 3d 242, 252 (2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>makes it “impossible to tell” why the California Supreme&para;<br>Court “decides some delayed petitions on the merits and&para;<br>rejects others as untimely.” Brief for Appellant in No. 08–&para;<br>15752 (CA9), pp. 37–38. We see no reason to reject Cali&para;<br>fornia’s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass&para;<br>the Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a&para;<br>petition on the merits, if that is the easier path. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984) (“[A]&para;<br>court need not determine whether counsel’s performance&para;<br>was deficient . . . [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffec&para;<br>tiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice&para;<br>. . . .”); cf. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574,&para;<br>585 (1999) (“It is hardly novel for a federal court to choose&para;<br>among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case&para;<br>on the merits.”).&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit concluded that California’s time bar&para;<br>is not consistently applied because outcomes under the&para;<br>rule vary from case to case. See 357 Fed. Appx., at 794.&para;<br>For example, in People v. Fairbanks, No. C047810, 2006&para;<br>WL 950267, *2–*3 (Cal. App., Apr. 11, 2006), a one-year&para;<br>delay was found substantial, while in In re Little, No.&para;<br>D047468, 2008 WL 142832, *4, n. 6 (Cal. App., Jan. 16,&para;<br>2008), a delay of 14 months was determined to be&para;<br>insubstantial.&para;<br>A discretionary rule ought not be disregarded automati&para;<br>cally upon a showing of seeming inconsistencies.7 Discre&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Closer&para;<br>&para;<br>inspection may reveal that “seeming ‘inconsistencie[s]’ . . . are&para;<br>not necessarily . . . arbitrar[y] or irrationa[l].” Thornburgh v. Abbott,&para;<br>490 U. S. 401, 417, n. 15 (1989). Fairbanks and Little are illustrative.&para;<br>In Fairbanks, the court found that petitioner did not act diligently&para;<br>when she waited to withdraw her guilty plea until one year after&para;<br>learning that revocation of her driver’s license was irreversible. 2006&para;<br>WL 950267, *2–*3. In Little, a pro se prisoner claimed that his trial&para;<br>counsel should have raised a posttraumatic stress disorder defense.&para;<br>Although the filing delay was 14 months, the court entertained it on&para;<br>the merits. 2008 WL 142832, *4, *14. Given the discrete context in&para;<br>which each case arose, the two decisions present no square conflict.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WALKER v. MARTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considera&para;<br>tions and to avoid the harsh results that sometimes&para;<br>attend consistent application of an unyielding rule. See&para;<br>Prihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990)&para;<br>(“Uncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state’s&para;<br>procedural ground as one ‘adequate’ under federal law. If&para;<br>it were, states would be induced to make their rules&para;<br>draconian . . . .”).&para;<br>A state ground, no doubt, may be found inadequate&para;<br>when “discretion has been exercised to impose novel and&para;<br>unforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial&para;<br>support in prior state law . . . .” 16B C. Wright, A. Miller,&para;<br>&amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §4026, p. 386&para;<br>(2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller); see Prihoda,&para;<br>910 F. 2d, at 1383 (state ground “applied infrequently,&para;<br>unexpectedly, or freakishly” may “discriminat[e] against&para;<br>the federal rights asserted” and therefore rank as “inade&para;<br>quate”). Martin does not contend, however, that in his&para;<br>case, the California Supreme Court exercised its discretion&para;<br>in a surprising or unfair manner.&para;<br>“[S]ound procedure often requires discretion to exact or&para;<br>excuse compliance with strict rules,” 16B Wright &amp; Miller&para;<br>§4028, p. 403, and we have no cause to discourage stan&para;<br>dards allowing courts to exercise such discretion. As this&para;<br>Court observed in Kindler, if forced to choose between&para;<br>mandatory rules certain to be found “adequate,” or more&para;<br>supple prescriptions that federal courts may disregard as&para;<br>“inadequate,” “many States [might] opt for mandatory&para;<br>rules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary fed&para;<br>eral review.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). “Th[at]&para;<br>result would be particularly unfortunate for [habeas peti&para;<br>tioners], who would lose the opportunity to argue that a&para;<br>procedural default should be excused through the exercise&para;<br>of judicial discretion.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 See&para;<br>&para;<br>also 16B Wright &amp; Miller §4026, pp. 385–386 (“Precisely defined&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.
