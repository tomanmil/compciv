MARETTA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA&para;<br>No. 11–1221. Argued April 22, 2013—Decided June 3, 2013&para;<br>The Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA)&para;<br>establishes an insurance program for federal employees. FEGLIA&para;<br>permits an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds,&para;<br>and specifies an “order of precedence” providing that an employee’s&para;<br>death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential&para;<br>recipients. 5 U. S. C. §8705(a). A Virginia statute revokes a beneficiary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a&para;<br>former spouse where there has been a change in the decedent’s marital status. Va. Code Ann. §20–111.1(A) (Section A). In the event that&para;<br>this provision is pre-empted by federal law, a separate provision of&para;<br>Virginia law, Section D, provides a cause of action rendering the former spouse liable for the principal amount of the proceeds to the party who would have received them were Section A not pre-empted.&para;<br>§20–111.1(D).&para;<br>Warren Hillman named then-spouse, respondent Judy Maretta, as&para;<br>the beneficiary of his Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance&para;<br>(FEGLI) policy. After their divorce, he married petitioner Jacqueline&para;<br>Hillman but never changed his named FEGLI beneficiary. After&para;<br>Warren’s death, Maretta, still the named beneficiary, filed a claim for&para;<br>the FEGLI proceeds and collected them. Hillman sued in Virginia&para;<br>court, seeking recovery of the proceeds under Section D. Maretta argued in response that Section D is pre-empted by federal law. The&para;<br>parties agreed that Section A is pre-empted. The Virginia Circuit&para;<br>Court found Maretta liable to Hillman under Section D for the&para;<br>FEGLI policy proceeds. The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Section D is pre-empted by FEGLIA because it conflicts with&para;<br>the purposes and objectives of Congress.&para;<br>Held: Section D of the Virginia statute is pre-empted by FEGLIA.&para;<br>Pp. 6–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HILLMAN v. MARETTA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) State law is pre-empted “to the extent of any conflict with a&para;<br>federal statute.” Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S.&para;<br>363, 372. This case raises the question whether Virginia law “stands&para;<br>as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,&para;<br>67. Pp. 6–13.&para;<br>(1) To determine whether a state law conflicts with Congress’&para;<br>purposes and objectives, the nature of the federal interest must first&para;<br>be ascertained. Crosby, 530 U. S., at 372–373. Two previous cases&para;<br>govern the analysis of the relationship between Section D and&para;<br>FEGLIA here. In Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655, a California&para;<br>court granted a decedent’s widow, who was not the named beneficiary&para;<br>of a policy under the federal National Service Life Insurance Act of&para;<br>1940 (NSLIA), an interest in the insurance proceeds as community&para;<br>property under state law. This Court reversed. Because NSLIA provided that the insured had a right to designate a beneficiary and&para;<br>could change that designation at any time, the Court reasoned that&para;<br>Congress had “spoken with force and clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.” Id., at 658. The&para;<br>Court addressed a similar question regarding the federal Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA) in Ridgway v.&para;<br>Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46. There, a Maine court imposed a constructive&para;<br>trust on insurance proceeds paid to a servicemember’s widow, the&para;<br>named beneficiary, and ordered that they be paid to the decedent’s&para;<br>first wife as required by a divorce decree. Holding the constructive&para;<br>trust pre-empted, the Ridgway Court explained that Wissner controlled and that SGLIA made clear that “the insured service member&para;<br>possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter&para;<br>that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to&para;<br>the proper office.” Id., at 56. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(2) The reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal&para;<br>force here. NSLIA and SGLIA are strikingly similar to FEGLIA,&para;<br>which creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insured’s&para;<br>designated beneficiary, §8705(a), and which underscores that the&para;<br>employee’s “right” of designation “cannot be waived or restricted,” 5&para;<br>CFR §843.205(e). Section D interferes with this scheme, because it&para;<br>directs that the proceeds actually belong to someone other than the&para;<br>named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by&para;<br>a third party. FEGLIA establishes a clear and predictable procedure&para;<br>for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary shall be and&para;<br>evinces Congress’ decision to accord federal employees an unfettered&para;<br>freedom of choice in selecting a beneficiary and to ensure the proceeds actually belong to that beneficiary. This conclusion is confirmed by another provision of FEGLIA, §8705(e), which creates a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>limited exception to the order of precedence by allowing proceeds to&para;<br>be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary, if, and only if,&para;<br>the requisite documentation is filed with the Government before the&para;<br>employee’s death, so that any departure from the beneficiary designation is managed within, not outside, the federal system. If States&para;<br>could make alternative distributions outside the clear procedure&para;<br>Congress established, §8705(e)’s narrow exception would be transformed into a general license for state law to override FEGLIA.&para;<br>Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>(b) Hillman’s additional arguments in support of a different result&para;<br>are unpersuasive.

MARETTA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1954, Congress enacted FEGLIA to “provide low-cost&para;<br>group life insurance to Federal employees.” H. R. Rep. No.&para;<br>2579, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1954). The program is administered by the federal Office of Personnel Management&para;<br>(OPM). 5 U. S. C. §8716. Pursuant to the authority&para;<br>granted to it by FEGLIA, OPM entered into a life insurance contract with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. See §8709; 5 CFR §870.102 (2013). Individual&para;<br>employees enrolled in the Federal Employees’ Group Life&para;<br>Insurance (FEGLI) Program receive coverage through this&para;<br>contract. The program is of substantial size. In 2010, the&para;<br>total amount of FEGLI insurance coverage in force was&para;<br>$824 billion. GAO, Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance: Retirement Benefit and Retained Asset Account&para;<br>Disclosures Could Be Improved 1 (GAO–12–94, 2011).&para;<br>FEGLIA provides that, upon an employee’s death, life&para;<br>insurance benefits are paid in accordance with a specified&para;<br>“order of precedence.” 5 U. S. C. §8705(a). The proceeds&para;<br>accrue “[f]irst, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing&para;<br>received before death.” Ibid. “[I]f there is no designated&para;<br>beneficiary,” the benefits are paid “to the widow or widower&para;<br>of the employee.” Ibid. Absent a widow or widower, the&para;<br>benefits accrue to “the child or children of the employee&para;<br>and descendants of [the] deceased children”; “the parents&para;<br>of the employee” or their survivors; the “executor or administrator of the estate of the employee”; and last, to&para;<br>“other next of kin.” Ibid.&para;<br>To be effective, the beneficiary designation and any&para;<br>accompanying revisions to it must be in writing and duly&para;<br>filed with the Government. See ibid. (“[A] designation,&para;<br>change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other&para;<br>document not so executed and filed has no force or effect”).&para;<br>An OPM regulation provides that an employee may&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“change [a] beneficiary at any time without the knowledge&para;<br>or consent of the previous beneficiary,” and makes clear&para;<br>that “[t]his right cannot be waived or restricted.” 5 CFR&para;<br>§870.802(f). Employees are informed of these requirements through materials that OPM disseminates in&para;<br>connection with the program. See, e.g., OPM, FEGLI Program Booklet 21–22 (rev. Aug. 2004) (setting forth the&para;<br>order of precedence and stating that OPM “will pay benefits” “[f]irst, to the beneficiary [the employee] designate[s]”). The order of precedence is also described on the&para;<br>form that employees use to designate a beneficiary. See&para;<br>Designation of Beneficiary, FEGLI Program, SF 2823 (rev.&para;<br>Mar. 2011) (Back of Part 2). And the enrollment form&para;<br>advises employees to update their designations if their&para;<br>“[i]ntentions [c]hange” as a result of, for example, “marriage [or] divorce.” Ibid.&para;<br>In 1998, Congress amended FEGLIA to create a limited&para;<br>exception to an employee’s right of designation. The statute now provides that “[a]ny amount which would otherwise be paid to a person determined under the order of&para;<br>precedence . . . shall be paid (in whole or in part) by [OPM]&para;<br>to another person if and to the extent expressly provided&para;<br>for in the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment,&para;<br>or legal separation” or related settlement, but only in the&para;<br>event the “decree, order, or agreement” is received by&para;<br>OPM or the employing agency before the employee’s&para;<br>death. 5 U. S. C. §§8705(e)(1)–(2).&para;<br>FEGLIA also includes an express pre-emption provision.&para;<br>That provision states in relevant part that “[t]he provisions of any contract under [FEGLIA] which relate to the&para;<br>nature or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and&para;<br>preempt any law of any State . . . , which relates to group&para;<br>life insurance to the extent that the law or regulation is&para;<br>inconsistent with the contractual provisions.” §8709(d)(1).&para;<br>This case turns on the interaction between these provi-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HILLMAN v. MARETTA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sions of FEGLIA and a Virginia statute. Section 20–&para;<br>111.1(A) (Section A) of the Virginia Code provides that a&para;<br>divorce or annulment “revoke[s]” a “beneficiary designation contained in a then existing written contract owned&para;<br>by one party that provides for the payment of any death&para;<br>benefit to the other party.” A “death benefit” includes&para;<br>“payments under a life insurance contract.” §20.111.1(B).&para;<br>In the event that Section A is pre-empted by federal law,&para;<br>§20–111.1(D) (Section D) of the Virginia Code applies.&para;<br>Section D provides as follows:&para;<br>“If [Va. Code Ann. §20–111.1] is preempted by federal law with respect to the payment of any death&para;<br>benefit, a former spouse who, not for value, receives&para;<br>the payment of any death benefit that the former&para;<br>spouse is not entitled to under [§20–111.1] is personally liable for the amount of the payment to the person who would have been entitled to it were&para;<br>[§20.111.1] not preempted.”&para;<br>In other words, where Section A is pre-empted, Section D&para;<br>creates a cause of action rendering a former spouse liable&para;<br>for the principal amount of the insurance proceeds to the&para;<br>person who would have received them had Section A&para;<br>continued in effect.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Warren Hillman (Warren) and respondent Judy Maretta&para;<br>were married. In 1996, Warren named Maretta as the&para;<br>beneficiary of his FEGLI policy. Warren and Maretta&para;<br>divorced in 1998 and, four years later, he married petitioner Jacqueline Hillman. Warren died unexpectedly in&para;<br>2008. Because Warren had never changed the named&para;<br>beneficiary under his FEGLI policy, it continued to identify Maretta as the beneficiary at the time of his death&para;<br>despite his divorce and subsequent remarriage to Hillman.&para;<br>Hillman filed a claim for the proceeds of Warren’s life&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>insurance, but the FEGLI administrator informed her that&para;<br>the proceeds would accrue to Maretta, because she had&para;<br>been named as the beneficiary. Maretta filed a claim for&para;<br>the benefits with OPM and collected the FEGLI proceeds&para;<br>in the amount of $124,558.03. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a.&para;<br>Hillman then filed a lawsuit in Virginia Circuit Court,&para;<br>arguing that Maretta was liable to her under Section D for&para;<br>the proceeds of her deceased husband’s FEGLI policy. The&para;<br>parties agreed that Section A, which directly reallocates the benefits, is pre-empted by FEGLIA. Id., at 36a.&para;<br>Maretta contended that Section D is also pre-empted by&para;<br>federal law and that she should keep the insurance proceeds. The Circuit Court rejected Maretta’s argument and&para;<br>granted summary judgment to Hillman, finding Maretta&para;<br>liable to Hillman under Section D for the proceeds of&para;<br>Warren’s policy. Id., at 58a.&para;<br>The Virginia Supreme Court reversed and entered&para;<br>judgment for Maretta. 283 Va. 34, 46, 722 S. E. 2d 32, 38&para;<br>(2012). The court found that FEGLIA clearly instructed&para;<br>that the insurance proceeds should be paid to a named&para;<br>beneficiary. Id., at 44–46, 722 S. E. 2d, at 36–38. The&para;<br>court reasoned that “Congress did not intend merely for&para;<br>the named beneficiary in a FEGLI policy to receive the&para;<br>proceeds, only then to have them subject to recovery by a&para;<br>third party under state law.” Id., at 44, 722 S. E. 2d, at&para;<br>37. It therefore concluded that Section D is pre-empted by&para;<br>FEGLIA, because it “stand[s] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Id., at 45, 722 S. E. 2d, at 37 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve a&para;<br>conflict among the state and federal courts over whether&para;<br>FEGLIA pre-empts a rule of state law that automatically&para;<br>assigns an interest in the proceeds of a FEGLI policy to a&para;<br>person other than the named beneficiary or grants that&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HILLMAN v. MARETTA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>person a right to recover such proceeds.1 We now affirm.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Under the Supremacy Clause, Congress has the power&para;<br>to pre-empt state law expressly. See Brown v. Hotel&para;<br>Employees, 468 U. S. 491, 500–501 (1984). Although&para;<br>FEGLIA contains an express pre-emption provision, see&para;<br>§8709(d)(1), the court below considered only whether&para;<br>Section D is pre-empted under conflict pre-emption principles. We limit our analysis here to that holding. State&para;<br>law is pre-empted “to the extent of any conflict with a&para;<br>federal statute.” Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000) (citing Hines v. Davidowitz,&para;<br>312 U. S. 52, 66–67 (1941)). Such a conflict occurs when&para;<br>compliance with both federal and state regulations is&para;<br>impossible, Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,&para;<br>373 U. S. 132, 142–143 (1963), or when the state law&para;<br>“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,”&para;<br>Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. This case raises a question of&para;<br>purposes and objectives pre-emption.&para;<br>The regulation of domestic relations is traditionally the&para;<br>domain of state law. See In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593–&para;<br>594 (1890). There is therefore a “presumption against preemption” of state laws governing domestic relations,&para;<br>Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 151 (2001), and “family&para;<br>and family-property law must do ‘major damage’ to ‘clear&para;<br>and substantial’ federal interests before the Supremacy&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Compare,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins.

But&para;<br>family law is not entirely insulated from conflict preemption principles, and so we have recognized that state&para;<br>laws “governing the economic aspects of domestic relations&para;<br>. . . must give way to clearly conflicting federal enactments.” Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46, 55 (1981).&para;<br>A&para;<br>To determine whether a state law conflicts with Congress’ purposes and objectives, we must first ascertain&para;<br>the nature of the federal interest. Crosby, 530 U. S., at&para;<br>372–373.&para;<br>Hillman contends that Congress’ purpose in enacting&para;<br>FEGLIA was to advance administrative convenience by&para;<br>establishing a clear rule to dictate where the Government&para;<br>should direct insurance proceeds. See Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>25. There is some force to Hillman’s argument that a&para;<br>significant legislative interest in a large federal program&para;<br>like FEGLIA is to enable its efficient administration. If&para;<br>Hillman is correct that administrative convenience was&para;<br>Congress’ only purpose, then there might be no conflict&para;<br>between Section D and FEGLIA: Section D’s cause of&para;<br>action takes effect only after benefits have been paid, and&para;<br>so would not necessarily impact the Government’s distribution of insurance proceeds. Cf. Hardy v. Hardy, 963&para;<br>N. E. 2d 470, 477–478 (Ind. 2012).&para;<br>For her part, Maretta insists that Congress had a more&para;<br>substantial purpose in enacting FEGLIA: to ensure that a&para;<br>duly named beneficiary will receive the insurance proceeds and be able to make use of them. Brief for Respondent 21–22. If Maretta is correct, then Section D would&para;<br>directly conflict with that objective, because its cause of&para;<br>action would take the insurance proceeds away from the&para;<br>named beneficiary and reallocate them to someone else.&para;<br>We must therefore determine which understanding of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HILLMAN v. MARETTA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>FEGLIA’s purpose is correct.&para;<br>We do not write on a clean slate. In two previous cases,&para;<br>we considered federal insurance statutes requiring that&para;<br>insurance proceeds be paid to a named beneficiary and&para;<br>held they pre-empted state laws that mandated a different&para;<br>distribution of benefits. The statutes we addressed in&para;<br>these cases are similar to FEGLIA. And the impediments&para;<br>to the federal interests in these prior cases are analogous&para;<br>to the one created by Section D of the Virginia statute.&para;<br>These precedents accordingly govern our analysis of the&para;<br>relationship between Section D and FEGLIA in this case.&para;<br>In Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950), we considered whether the National Service Life Insurance Act of&para;<br>1940 (NSLIA), 54 Stat. 1008, pre-empted a rule of state&para;<br>marital property law. Congress had enacted NSLIA to&para;<br>“affor[d] a uniform and comprehensive system of life insurance for members and veterans of the armed forces of&para;<br>the United States.” Wissner, 338 U. S., at 658. A California court granted the decedent’s widow, who was not the&para;<br>named beneficiary, an interest in the insurance proceeds&para;<br>as community property under state law. Id., at 657.&para;<br>We reversed, holding that NSLIA pre-empted the widow’s state-law action to recover the proceeds. Id., at 658.&para;<br>In pertinent part, NSLIA provided that the insured “ ‘shall&para;<br>have the right to designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries&para;<br>of the insurance [within a designated class], . . . and shall&para;<br>. . . at all times have the right to change the beneficiary or&para;<br>beneficiaries.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 38 U. S. C. §802(g) (1946&para;<br>ed.)). We reasoned that “Congress has spoken with force&para;<br>and clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the&para;<br>named beneficiary and no other.” 338 U. S., at 658. The&para;<br>California court’s decision could not stand, we found,&para;<br>because it “substitute[d] the widow for the mother, who&para;<br>was the beneficiary Congress directed shall receive the&para;<br>insurance money.” Id., at 659.&para;<br>In Ridgway, we considered a similar question regarding&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Id., at 49–50.&para;<br>In holding the constructive trust pre-empted, we explained that the issue was “controlled by Wissner.” Id., at&para;<br>55. As in Wissner, the applicable provisions of SGLIA&para;<br>made clear that “the insured service member possesses the&para;<br>right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that&para;<br>choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to the proper office.” 454 U. S., at 56 (citing Wissner,&para;<br>338 U. S., at 658). We also noted that SGLIA established an “ ‘order of precedence,’ ” which provided that the&para;<br>benefits would be first paid to “ such ‘beneficiary or beneficiaries as the member . . . may have designated by [an&para;<br>appropriately filed] writing received prior to death.’ ” 454&para;<br>U.

Notwithstanding “some small differences” between SGLIA&para;<br>and NSLIA, we concluded that SGLIA’s “unqualified directive to pay the proceeds to the properly designated beneficiary clearly suggest[ed] that no different result was&para;<br>intended by Congress.” 454 U. S., at 57.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Our reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with&para;<br>equal force here. The statutes we considered in these&para;<br>earlier cases are strikingly similar to FEGLIA. Like&para;<br>NSLIA and SGLIA, FEGLIA creates a scheme that gives&para;<br>highest priority to an insured’s designated beneficiary. 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §8705(a). Indeed, FEGLIA includes an “order of&para;<br>precedence” that is nearly identical to the one in SGLIA:&para;<br>Both require that the insurance proceeds be paid first to&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HILLMAN v.

C. §770(a) (1976 ed.)&para;<br>(now §1970(a) (2006 ed.)). FEGLIA’s implementing regulations further underscore that the employee’s “right” of&para;<br>designation “cannot be waived or restricted.” 5 CFR&para;<br>§843.205(e). In FEGLIA, as in these other statutes, Congress “ ‘spok[e] with force and clarity in directing that the&para;<br>proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.’ ”&para;<br>Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 55 (quoting Wissner, 338 U. S., at&para;<br>658; emphasis added). 2&para;<br>Section D interferes with Congress’ scheme, because it&para;<br>directs that the proceeds actually “belong” to someone&para;<br>other than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of&para;<br>action for their recovery by a third party. Ridgway, 454&para;<br>U. S., at 55; see Va. Code Ann. §20–111.1(D). It makes no&para;<br>difference whether state law requires the transfer of the&para;<br>proceeds, as Section A does, or creates a cause of action,&para;<br>like Section D, that enables another person to receive the&para;<br>proceeds upon filing an action in state court. In either&para;<br>case, state law displaces the beneficiary selected by the&para;<br>insured in accordance with FEGLIA and places someone&para;<br>else in her stead. As in Wissner, applicable state law&para;<br>“substitutes the widow” for the “beneficiary Congress&para;<br>directed shall receive the insurance money,” 338 U. S., at&para;<br>659, and thereby “frustrates the deliberate purpose of&para;<br>Congress” to ensure that a federal employee’s named&para;<br>beneficiary receives the proceeds.

Reply Brief 21.&para;<br>Even if there are “some small differences” in the statutory language,&para;<br>however, they do not diminish the critical similarity shared by the&para;<br>three statutes: Each reflects Congress’ “unqualified directive” that the&para;<br>proceeds accrue to a named beneficiary.

Many employees perhaps neglect to update their&para;<br>beneficiary designations after a change in marital status.&para;<br>As a result, a legislature could have thought that a default&para;<br>rule providing that insurance proceeds accrue to a widow&para;<br>or widower, and not a named beneficiary, would be more&para;<br>likely to align with most people’s intentions. Or, similarly,&para;<br>a legislature might have reasonably believed that an&para;<br>employee’s will is more reliable evidence of his intent than&para;<br>a beneficiary designation form executed years earlier.&para;<br>But that is not the judgment Congress made.3 Rather&para;<br>than draw an inference about an employee’s probable&para;<br>intent from a range of sources, Congress established a&para;<br>clear and predictable procedure for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary of his life insurance&para;<br>shall be. Like the statutes at issue in Ridgway and&para;<br>Wissner, FEGLIA evinces Congress’ decision to accord&para;<br>federal employees an unfettered “freedom of choice” in&para;<br>selecting the beneficiary of the insurance proceeds and to&para;<br>ensure the proceeds would actually “belong” to that beneficiary. Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 56. An employee’s ability&para;<br>to name a beneficiary acts as a “guarantee of the complete&para;<br>and full performance of the contract to the exclusion of&para;<br>conflicting claims.” Wissner, 338 U.

This provision allows the proceeds&para;<br>to be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary,&para;<br>but if and only if the requisite documentation is filed with&para;<br>the Government, so that any departure from the beneficiary designation is managed within, not outside, the&para;<br>federal system.4&para;<br>We have explained that “[w]here Congress explicitly&para;<br>enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,&para;<br>additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence&para;<br>of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.” Andrus v.&para;<br>Glover Constr. Co., 446 U. S. 608, 616–617 (1980). Section&para;<br>8705(e) creates a limited exception to the order of precedence. If States could make alternative distributions&para;<br>outside the clear procedure Congress established, that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>enacted 5 U. S.

See, e.g., Gonzalez, 839 F. 2d,&para;<br>at 1439–1440. Reflecting this backdrop, the House Report noted that&para;<br>“Under current law, . . . divorce decrees . . . do not affect the payment of&para;<br>life insurance proceeds.

No.&para;<br>105–134, p. 2 (1997). To address the issue raised by these lower court&para;<br>cases, Congress could have amended FEGLIA to allow state law to take&para;<br>precedence over the named beneficiary when there is any conflict with&para;<br>a divorce decree or annulment.

In Wissner and Ridgway,&para;<br>we found that the relevant state laws violated these provisions and that this further conflict supported our conclusion that the state laws were pre-empted.&para;<br>These discussions of the anti-attachment provisions,&para;<br>however, were alternative grounds to support the judgment in each case, and not necessary components of the&para;<br>holdings.

The benefits&para;<br>are distributed first to “the beneficiary or beneficiaries&para;<br>designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed&para;<br>writing received before death.” 5 U. S.

Indeed, the “right” to designate a beneficiary—as&para;<br>well as the term “beneficiary” itself—would be meaningless if the only effect of a designation were to saddle the&para;<br>nominal beneficiary with liability under state law for the&para;<br>full value of the proceeds.

If the right to designate a beneficiary means&para;<br>anything, we must conclude that Section D directly conflicts with FEGLIA’s order of precedence.&para;<br>The direct conflict between Section D and FEGLIA is&para;<br>also evident in the fact that Section D’s only function is to&para;<br>accomplish what Section A would have achieved, had&para;<br>Section A not been pre-empted. Section A provides that,&para;<br>“upon the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce&para;<br>from the bond of matrimony . . . , any revocable beneficiary designation contained in a then existing written contract owned by one party that provides for the&para;<br>payment of any death benefit to the other party is revoked.

By purporting to so alter FEGLIA’s statutory order of precedence, Section A is clearly pre-empted&para;<br>by federal law.

Because one of the purposes&para;<br>of the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Act of&para;<br>1954 (FEGLIA) is to implement the expressed wishes of&para;<br>the insured, I would hold that a state law is pre-empted&para;<br>if it effectively overrides an insured’s actual, articulated&para;<br>choice of beneficiary. The challenged provision of Virginia&para;<br>law has that effect.&para;<br>By way of background, Va. Code Ann. §20–111.1(A)&para;<br>(Lexis Supp. 2012) provides that the entry of a divorce decree automatically revokes an insured’s prior designation of his or her former spouse as the beneficiary of the&para;<br>policy. And where, as in this case, the insured remarries&para;<br>after the divorce and dies before making a new FEGLIA&para;<br>designation, the proceeds, under 5 U. S. C. §8705(a), are&para;<br>automatically paid to the insured’s former spouse. Under&para;<br>the provision of Virginia law at issue here, the surviving&para;<br>spouse is entitled to recover those proceeds from the former spouse. See Va. Code Ann. §20–111.1(D). Section&para;<br>20–111.1(D) apparently requires this result even if the insured manifests a clear contrary intent, such as by providing specifically in a recent will that the proceeds are to go&para;<br>to another party—for example, the insured’s children by&para;<br>the former marriage. Because §20–111.1(D) overrides the&para;<br>insured’s express intent (whether that intent is expressed&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HILLMAN v. MARETTA&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>via a beneficiary designation or through other reliable&para;<br>means), I agree that it is pre-empted by FEGLIA.&para;<br>Interpreted in light of our prior decisions in Wissner v.&para;<br>Wissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950), and Ridgway v. Ridgway,&para;<br>454 U. S. 46 (1981), FEGLIA seems to me to have two&para;<br>primary purposes or objectives.&para;<br>The first is administrative convenience. It is easier for&para;<br>an insurance administrator to pay insurance proceeds to&para;<br>the person whom the insured has designated on a specified&para;<br>form without having to consider claims made by others&para;<br>based on some other ground. But §20–111.1(D) does not&para;<br>affect the initial payment of proceeds. It operates after&para;<br>the funds are received by the designated beneficiary, and it&para;<br>thus causes no inconvenience for those who administer the&para;<br>payment of FEGLIA proceeds.&para;<br>The second purpose or objective is the effectuation of the&para;<br>insured’s expressed intent above all other considerations.&para;<br>That was the basis for the decisions in Wissner and Ridgway, as I understand them. In both cases, there was a&para;<br>conflict between a person whom the insured had designated as his beneficiary and another person whose claim to&para;<br>the proceeds was not based on the insured’s expressed&para;<br>intent, and in both cases, the Court held in favor of the&para;<br>designated beneficiary.&para;<br>The present case bears a similarity to Wissner and&para;<br>Ridgway in that petitioner’s claim depends upon a state statute that automatically alters the ultimate recipient of&para;<br>a divorced employee’s insurance proceeds. To be sure,&para;<br>Virginia’s provision may well reflect the unexpressed&para;<br>preferences of the majority of insureds whose situations&para;<br>are similar to that of the insured in this case—that is,&para;<br>individuals who, after divorce and remarriage, fail to&para;<br>change a prior designation of a former spouse as the beneficiary of the policy. But FEGLIA prioritizes the insured’s&para;<br>expressed intent. And it is telling that, on petitioner’s&para;<br>theory, she would still be entitled to the insurance pro-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

This shows that her claim is based on something&para;<br>other than a manifestation of the insured’s intent. Because §20–111.1(D) operates as a blunt tool to override the&para;<br>insured’s express declaration of his or her intent, it conflicts with FEGLIA’s purpose of prioritizing an insured’s&para;<br>articulated wishes above all other considerations.&para;<br>In affirming the decision below, the Court goes well&para;<br>beyond what is necessary and opines that the party designated as the beneficiary under a FEGLIA policy must&para;<br>be allowed to keep the insurance proceeds even if the insured’s contrary and expressed intent is indisputable—for&para;<br>example, when the insured writes a postdivorce will specifically leaving the proceeds to someone else.

The Court’s explanation is as follows: “Congress&para;<br>sought to ensure that an employee’s intent would be given&para;<br>effect only through the designation of a beneficiary or&para;<br>through the narrow exceptions specifically provided in the&para;<br>statute.” Ibid., n. 3. In other words, Congress wanted the&para;<br>designated beneficiary—rather than the person named&para;<br>in a later will—to keep the proceeds because Congress&para;<br>wanted the named beneficiary to keep the proceeds. Needless the say, this circular reasoning does not explain why&para;<br>Congress might have wanted the designated beneficiary to&para;<br>keep the proceeds even when that is indisputably contrary&para;<br>to the insured’s expressed wishes at the time of death. I&para;<br>am doubtful that any purpose or objective of FEGLIA&para;<br>would be honored by such a holding, but it is not necessary&para;<br>to resolve that question in this case.&para;<br>For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
