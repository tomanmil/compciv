In 1994, he kidnaped 16-year-old Adria&para;<br>Sauceda, raped her with a large stick, and bludgeoned her&para;<br>to death with a piece of asphalt. He was convicted of mur­&para;<br>der and sentenced to death by a Texas court. He now&para;<br>seeks a stay of execution on the ground that his conviction&para;<br>was obtained in violation of the Vienna Convention on&para;<br>Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Apr. 24, 1963, 21&para;<br>U. S. T. 77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. He relies on Case Con­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>cerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.),&para;<br>2004 I. C. J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the&para;<br>International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United&para;<br>States had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to&para;<br>notify him of his right to consular assistance. His ar­&para;<br>gument is foreclosed by Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491&para;<br>(2008) (Medellín I), in which we held that neither the&para;<br>Avena decision nor the President’s Memorandum purport­&para;<br>ing to implement that decision constituted directly en­&para;<br>forceable federal law. 552 U. S., at 498–499.&para;<br>Leal and the United States ask us to stay the execution&para;<br>so that Congress may consider whether to enact legisla­&para;<br>tion implementing the Avena decision. Leal contends that&para;<br>the Due Process Clause prohibits Texas from executing&para;<br>him while such legislation is under consideration. This&para;<br>argument is meritless. The Due Process Clause does not&para;<br>prohibit a State from carrying out a lawful judgment in&para;<br>light of unenacted legislation that might someday author­&para;<br>ize a collateral attack on that judgment.&para;<br>The United States does not endorse Leal’s due process&para;<br>claim. Instead, it asks us to stay the execution until&para;<br>January 2012 in support of our “future jurisdiction to&para;<br>review the judgment in a proceeding” under this yet-to-be­&para;<br>enacted legislation. Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 2–3, n. 1. It relies on the fact that on June 14,&para;<br>2011, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced implementing&para;<br>legislation in the Senate with the Executive Branch’s sup­&para;<br>port. No implementing legislation has been introduced in&para;<br>the House.&para;<br>We reject this suggestion. First, we are doubtful that it&para;<br>is ever appropriate to stay a lower court judgment in light&para;<br>of unenacted legislation. Our task is to rule on what&para;<br>the law is, not what it might eventually be. In light of&para;<br>Medellín I, it is clear that there is no “fair prospect that a&para;<br>majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below&para;<br>was erroneous,” O’Brien v. O’Laughlin, 557 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 2) (BREYER, J., in chambers), and our&para;<br>task should be at an end. Neither the United States nor&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, post, at 1–6 (dissenting opinion), cites a&para;<br>single instance in this Court’s history in which a stay&para;<br>issued under analogous circumstances.&para;<br>Even if there were circumstances under which a stay&para;<br>could issue in light of proposed legislation, this case would&para;<br>not present them. Medellín himself sought a stay of exe­&para;<br>cution on the ground that Congress might enact imple­&para;<br>menting legislation. We denied his stay application, ex­&para;<br>plaining that “Congress has not progressed beyond the&para;<br>bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ&para;<br>ruling and the four months since our ruling in [Medellín&para;<br>I].” Medellín v. Texas, 554 U. S. 759, 760 (2008) (per&para;<br>curiam) (Medellín II). It has now been seven years since&para;<br>the ICJ ruling and three years since our decision in&para;<br>Medellín I, making a stay based on the bare introduction&para;<br>of a bill in a single house of Congress even less justified. If&para;<br>a statute implementing Avena had genuinely been a prior­&para;<br>ity for the political branches, it would have been enacted&para;<br>by now.&para;<br>The United States and JUSTICE BREYER complain of the&para;<br>grave international consequences that will follow from&para;<br>Leal’s execution. Post, at 4. Congress evidently did not&para;<br>find these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its&para;<br>enactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow&para;<br>the law as written by Congress. We have no authority to&para;<br>stay an execution in light of an “appeal of the President,”&para;<br>post, at 6, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign&para;<br>policy consequences, when those assertions come unac­&para;<br>companied by a persuasive legal claim.&para;<br>Finally, we noted in Medellín II that “[t]he beginning&para;<br>premise for any stay . . . must be that petitioner’s confes­&para;<br>sion was obtained unlawfully,” and that “[t]he United&para;<br>States has not wavered in its position that petitioner was&para;<br>not prejudiced by his lack of consular access.” 554 U.

Here, the United States studiously refuses to&para;<br>argue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention&para;<br>violation, contending instead that the Court should issue a&para;<br>stay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be&para;<br>able to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court,&para;<br>regardless of whether his conviction will be found to be&para;<br>invalid. We decline to follow the United States’ suggestion&para;<br>of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on&para;<br>hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to&para;<br>say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any&para;<br>prospect of success. We may note that in a portion of its&para;<br>opinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural&para;<br>grounds, the District Court found that any violation of the&para;<br>Vienna Convention would have been harmless.

The United&para;<br>States has signed and ratified the Vienna Convention, a&para;<br>treaty under which the United States has promised,&para;<br>among other things, to inform an arrested foreign na&para;<br>tional, such as Leal, that he has a right to request the&para;<br>assistance of his country’s consulate. Vienna Convention&para;<br>on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Art. 36, Apr.&para;<br>24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 77, 100–101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The&para;<br>United States has also signed and ratified an optional&para;<br>protocol, a treaty in which the United States agrees that&para;<br>“[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation of application&para;<br>of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdic&para;<br>tion of the International Court of Justice.” Optional Pro&para;<br>tocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes&para;<br>(Optional Protocol), Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 325,&para;<br>326, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. Although the United States has&para;<br>since given notice of withdrawal from the Optional Proto&para;<br>col, see Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State,&para;<br>to Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations&para;<br>(Mar. 7, 2005), that withdrawal does not alter the binding&para;<br>status of its prewithdrawal obligations, see U. S. Brief 22,&para;<br>n. 4.&para;<br>When officials of the State of Texas arrested Leal,&para;<br>they failed to inform him of his Vienna Convention rights,&para;<br>thereby placing the United States in violation of its obliga&para;<br>tions under that Convention. And so far neither Texas nor&para;<br>any other judicial authority has implemented what the&para;<br>International Court of Justice found (in a related case&para;<br>brought by the Government of Mexico) to be the proper&para;<br>remedy for that Convention violation, namely a hearing&para;<br>to determine whether that violation amounted in effect to&para;<br>harmless error. Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexi­&para;<br>can Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12, 61–64. See&para;<br>also U. S. Brief 15 (explaining that “President Bush ac&para;<br>knowledged the international legal obligation created by&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Avena”). In other words, the international court made&para;<br>clear that Leal is entitled to a certain procedure, namely&para;<br>a hearing. That being so, a domestic court’s guesses as&para;<br>to the results of that procedure are, as far as our treaty&para;<br>obligations are concerned, irrelevant.&para;<br>This Court subsequently held that, because Congress&para;<br>had not embodied our international legal obligations in a&para;<br>statute, the Court lacked the power to enforce those obliga&para;<br>tions as a matter of domestic law. Medellín v. Texas, 552&para;<br>U. S. 491, 525–526 (2008) (“The responsibility for trans&para;<br>forming an international obligation arising from a non&para;<br>self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress”).&para;<br>And the Court later refused to grant a stay of execution in&para;<br>a similar case in significant part because “the President&para;<br>. . . has [not] represented to us that there is any likelihood&para;<br>of congressional . . . action.” Medellín v. Texas, 554 U. S.&para;<br>759, 759–760 (2008) (per curiam).&para;<br>But these applications for stay do not suffer from this&para;<br>last mentioned legal defect. The Solicitor General has&para;<br>filed an amicus brief in which he states that “after ex&para;<br>tensive consultation with the Department of State and&para;<br>the Department of Justice,” Senator Patrick Leahy, the&para;<br>chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has&para;<br>introduced (and expressed an intention to hold speedy&para;<br>hearings on) a bill that would permit Leal and other simi&para;<br>larly situated individuals to obtain the hearing that inter&para;<br>national law requires. U. S. Brief 8; see id., at 8–9, 12–13&para;<br>(describing the Consular Notification Compliance Act of&para;<br>2011, S. 1194, 112th Cong., 1st Sess.). The amicus brief&para;<br>indicates that “congressional . . . action” is a reasonable&para;<br>possibility. Medellín, 554 U. S., at 760. And the Solicitor&para;<br>General urges this Court to grant a stay, providing Con&para;<br>gress with adequate time to carry out the legal responsi&para;<br>bility that this Court has held belongs to the Legislative&para;<br>Branch, Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 525–526 (2008),&para;<br>namely the enactment of a law that will bring the United&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>States into compliance with its treaty obligations and&para;<br>provide Leal with the hearing that those obligations le&para;<br>gally demand. U. S. Brief 2.&para;<br>At the same time, the Solicitor General sets forth strong&para;<br>reasons, related to the conduct of foreign affairs, for grant&para;<br>ing a stay. Representing the Executive Branch (hence&para;<br>the President), the Solicitor General tells us that “[p]e&para;<br>titioner’s execution would cause irreparable harm” to&para;<br>“foreign-policy interests of the highest order.” Id., at 11.&para;<br>The Solicitor General says that failing to halt Leal’s execu&para;<br>tion would place “the United States in irremediable breach&para;<br>of its international-law obligation,” with&para;<br>“serious repercussions for United States foreign rela&para;<br>tions, law-enforcement and other cooperation with&para;<br>Mexico, and the ability of American citizens traveling&para;<br>abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in&para;<br>the event of detention.” Id., at 12.&para;<br>These statements are supported by the fact that the&para;<br>Government of Mexico has also filed a brief in which it&para;<br>states that declining to stay Leal’s imminent execution&para;<br>“would seriously jeopardize the ability of the Govern&para;<br>ment of Mexico to continue working collaboratively&para;<br>with the United States on a number of joint ventures,&para;<br>including extraditions, mutual judicial assistance, and&para;<br>our efforts to strengthen our common border.” Brief&para;<br>for United Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 23 (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>This Court has described interests of the kind set forth&para;<br>by the Solicitor General as “plainly compelling.” Medellín,&para;<br>552 U. S., at 524; id., at 537 (Stevens, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment); see also id., at 566 (BREYER, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(observing harms that would flow from noncompliance).&para;<br>The Court has long recognized the President’s special&para;<br>constitutionally based authority in matters of foreign&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>relations. See, e.g., United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export&para;<br>Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936). And it has ordinarily&para;<br>given his views significant weight in such matters. Jama&para;<br>v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335,&para;<br>348 (2005) (noting the Court’s “customary policy of defer&para;<br>ence to the President in matters of foreign affairs”). It&para;<br>should do so here.&para;<br>Finally, this Court has adequate legal authority to grant&para;<br>the requested stay. Should Senator Leahy’s bill become&para;<br>law by the end of September (when we would consider the&para;<br>petition in the ordinary course), this Court would almost&para;<br>certainly grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate&para;<br>the judgment below, and remand the case for further&para;<br>proceedings consistent with that law. Indeed, were the&para;<br>Solicitor General to indicate at that time that the bill was&para;<br>about to become law, I believe it likely that we would hold&para;<br>the petition for at least several weeks until the bill was&para;<br>enacted and then do the same. And this Court, under the&para;<br>All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651, can take appropriate&para;<br>action to preserve its “potential jurisdiction.” FTC v. Dean&para;<br>Foods Co., 384 U. S. 597, 603 (1966).&para;<br>Thus, on the one hand, international legal obligations,&para;<br>related foreign policy considerations, the prospect of legis&para;<br>lation, and the consequent injustice involved should that&para;<br>legislation, coming too late for Leal, help others in identi&para;<br>cal circumstances all favor granting a stay. And issuing a&para;<br>brief stay until the end of September, when the Court&para;<br>could consider this matter in the ordinary course, would&para;<br>put Congress on clear notice that it must act quickly. On&para;<br>the other hand, the State has an interest in proceeding&para;<br>with an immediate execution. But it is difficult to see how&para;<br>the State’s interest in the immediate execution of an&para;<br>individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago&para;<br>can outweigh the considerations that support additional&para;<br>delay, perhaps only until the end of the summer.&para;<br>Consequently I would grant the stay that the petitioner&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>requests. In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Court&para;<br>ignores the appeal of the President in a matter related&para;<br>to foreign affairs, it substitutes its own views about the&para;<br>likelihood of congressional action for the views of Execu&para;<br>tive Branch officials who have consulted with Members of&para;<br>Congress, and it denies the request by four Members of&para;<br>the Court to delay the execution until the Court can dis&para;<br>cuss the matter at Conference in September. In my view,&para;<br>the Court is wrong in each respect.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
