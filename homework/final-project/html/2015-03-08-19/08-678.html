CARPENTER&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–678.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 5, 2009—Decided December 8, 2009&para;<br>&para;<br>When respondent Norman Carpenter informed the human resources&para;<br>department of his employer, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc., that&para;<br>the company employed undocumented immigrants, he was unaware&para;<br>that Mohawk stood accused in a pending class action—the Williams&para;<br>case—of conspiring to drive down its legal employees’ wages by know&para;<br>ingly hiring undocumented workers. Mohawk directed Carpenter to&para;<br>meet with the company’s retained counsel in Williams, who allegedly&para;<br>pressured Carpenter to recant his statements. When he refused,&para;<br>Carpenter maintains in this unlawful termination suit, Mohawk fired&para;<br>him under false pretenses. In granting Carpenter’s motion to compel&para;<br>Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with re&para;<br>tained counsel and the company’s termination decision, the District&para;<br>Court agreed with Mohawk that the requested information was pro&para;<br>tected by the attorney-client privilege, but concluded that Mohawk&para;<br>had implicitly waived the privilege through its disclosures in the Wil&para;<br>liams case. The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory&para;<br>appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mohawk’s appeal for lack&para;<br>of jurisdiction, holding, inter alia, that the District Court’s ruling did&para;<br>not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order under&para;<br>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, because a&para;<br>discovery order implicating the attorney-client privilege can be ade&para;<br>quately reviewed on appeal from final judgment.&para;<br>Held: Disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege do not&para;<br>qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.&para;<br>Pp. 4–13.&para;<br>(a) Courts of Appeals “have jurisdiction of appeals from all final de&para;<br>cisions of the district courts.” 28 U. S. C. §1291. “Final decisions”&para;<br>encompass not only judgments that “terminate an action,” but also a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“small class” of prejudgment orders that are “collateral to” an action’s&para;<br>merits and “too important” to be denied immediate review, Cohen,&para;<br>supra, at 545–546. “That small category includes only decisions that&para;<br>are . . . effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in&para;<br>the underlying action.” Swint v. Chambers County Comm’n, 514&para;<br>U. S. 35, 42. The decisive consideration in determining whether a&para;<br>right is effectively unreviewable is whether delaying review until the&para;<br>entry of final judgment “would imperil a substantial public interest”&para;<br>or “some particular value of a high order.” Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.&para;<br>345, 352–353. In making this determination, the Court does not en&para;<br>gage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry,” Coopers &amp; Lybrand&para;<br>v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 473, but focuses on “the entire category to&para;<br>which a claim belongs,” Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,&para;<br>Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868. If the class of claims, taken as a whole, can&para;<br>be adequately vindicated by other means, “the chance that the litiga&para;<br>tion at hand might be speeded, or a ‘particular injustic[e]’ averted,”&para;<br>does not provide a basis for §1291 jurisdiction. Ibid. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) Effective appellate review of disclosure orders adverse to the at&para;<br>torney-client privilege can be had by means other than collateral or&para;<br>der appeal, including postjudgment review. Appellate courts can&para;<br>remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same&para;<br>way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by va&para;<br>cating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which&para;<br>the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.&para;<br>Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel&para;<br>privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review&para;<br>apart from collateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district&para;<br>court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory&para;<br>appeal involving “a controlling question of law” the prompt resolution&para;<br>of which “may materially advance the ultimate termination of the&para;<br>litigation.” §1292(b). Second, in extraordinary circumstances where&para;<br>a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition&para;<br>the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. Cheney v. United States&para;<br>Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380. Another option is for a party&para;<br>to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that,&para;<br>e.g., “direc[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other desig&para;<br>nated facts be taken as established,” “prohibi[t] the disobedient party&para;<br>from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses,” or&para;<br>“strik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2).&para;<br>Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may&para;<br>issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then&para;<br>appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation&para;<br>can be characterized as a criminal punishment. See, e.g., Church of&para;<br>Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11. These es&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(c) The admonition that the class of collaterally appealable orders&para;<br>must remain “narrow and selective in its membership,” Will, supra,&para;<br>at 350, has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment&para;<br>of legislation designating rulemaking, “not expansion by court deci&para;<br>sion,” as the preferred means for determining whether and when pre&para;<br>judgment orders should be immediately appealable, Swint, supra, at&para;<br>48.

CARPENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>serve the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 2007, respondent Norman Carpenter, a former shift&para;<br>supervisor at a Mohawk manufacturing facility, filed suit&para;<br>in the United States District Court for the Northern Dis&para;<br>trict of Georgia, alleging that Mohawk had terminated&para;<br>him in violation of 42 U. S. C. §1985(2) and various Geor&para;<br>gia laws. According to Carpenter’s complaint, his termi&para;<br>nation came after he informed a member of Mohawk’s&para;<br>human resources department in an e-mail that the com&para;<br>pany was employing undocumented immigrants. At the&para;<br>time, unbeknownst to Carpenter, Mohawk stood accused&para;<br>in a pending class-action lawsuit of conspiring to drive&para;<br>down the wages of its legal employees by knowingly hiring&para;<br>undocumented workers in violation of federal and state&para;<br>racketeering laws. See Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.,&para;<br>No. 4:04–cv–00003–HLM (ND Ga., Jan. 6, 2004). Com&para;<br>pany officials directed Carpenter to meet with the com&para;<br>pany’s retained counsel in the Williams case, and counsel&para;<br>allegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.&para;<br>When he refused, Carpenter alleges, Mohawk fired him&para;<br>under false pretenses. App. 57a–64a.&para;<br>After learning of Carpenter’s complaint, the plaintiffs in&para;<br>the Williams case sought an evidentiary hearing to ex&para;<br>plore Carpenter’s allegations. In its response to their&para;<br>motion, Mohawk described Carpenter’s accusations as&para;<br>“pure fantasy” and recounted the “true facts” of Carpen&para;<br>ter’s dismissal. Id., at 208a. According to Mohawk, Car&para;<br>penter himself had “engaged in blatant and illegal mis&para;<br>conduct” by attempting to have Mohawk hire an&para;<br>undocumented worker. Id., at 209a. The company “com&para;<br>menced an immediate investigation,” during which re&para;<br>tained counsel interviewed Carpenter. Id., at 210a. Be&para;<br>cause Carpenter’s “efforts to cause Mohawk to circumvent&para;<br>federal immigration law” “blatantly violated Mohawk&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>policy,” the company terminated him. Ibid.&para;<br>As these events were unfolding in the Williams case,&para;<br>discovery was underway in Carpenter’s case. Carpenter&para;<br>filed a motion to compel Mohawk to produce information&para;<br>concerning his meeting with retained counsel and the&para;<br>company’s termination decision. Mohawk maintained that&para;<br>the requested information was protected by the attorney&para;<br>client privilege.&para;<br>The District Court agreed that the privilege applied to&para;<br>the requested information, but it granted Carpenter’s&para;<br>motion to compel disclosure after concluding that Mohawk&para;<br>had implicitly waived the privilege through its representa&para;<br>tions in the Williams case. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.&para;<br>The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory&para;<br>appeal under 28 U. S. C. §1292(b). But, recognizing “the&para;<br>seriousness of its [waiver] finding,” it stayed its ruling to&para;<br>allow Mohawk to explore other potential “avenues to&para;<br>appeal . . . , such as a petition for mandamus or appealing&para;<br>this Order under the collateral order doctrine.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 52a.&para;<br>Mohawk filed a notice of appeal and a petition for a writ&para;<br>of mandamus to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1291, holding that the District Court’s ruling did&para;<br>not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order&para;<br>within the meaning of Cohen, 337 U. S. 541. “Under&para;<br>Cohen,” the Court of Appeals explained, “an order is ap&para;<br>pealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed&para;<br>question; (2) resolves an important issue completely sepa&para;<br>rate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively&para;<br>unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” 541 F. 3d&para;<br>1048, 1052 (2008) (per curiam). According to the court,&para;<br>the District Court’s waiver ruling satisfied the first two of&para;<br>these requirements but not the third, because “a discovery&para;<br>order that implicates the attorney-client privilege” can be&para;<br>adequately reviewed “on appeal from a final judgment.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ibid. The Court of Appeals also rejected Mohawk’s man&para;<br>damus petition, finding no “clear usurpation of power or&para;<br>abuse of discretion” by the District Court. Id., at 1055.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. __ (2009), to resolve a&para;<br>conflict among the Circuits concerning the availability of&para;<br>collateral appeals in the attorney-client privilege context.1&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>By statute, Courts of Appeals “have jurisdiction of ap&para;<br>peals from all final decisions of the district courts of the&para;<br>United States, . . . except where a direct review may be&para;<br>had in the Supreme Court.” 28 U. S. C. §1291. A “final&para;<br>decisio[n]” is typically one “by which a district court disas&para;<br>sociates itself from a case.” Swint v. Chambers County&para;<br>Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995). This Court, however,&para;<br>“has long given” §1291 a “practical rather than a technical&para;<br>construction.” Cohen, 337 U. S., at 546. As we held in&para;<br>Cohen, the statute encompasses not only judgments that&para;<br>“terminate an action,” but also a “small class” of collateral&para;<br>rulings that, although they do not end the litigation, are&para;<br>appropriately deemed “final.” Id., at 545–546. “That&para;<br>small category includes only decisions that are conclusive,&para;<br>that resolve important questions separate from the merits,&para;<br>and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Three Circuits have permitted collateral order appeals of attorney&para;<br>client privilege rulings.

The remaining Circuits to consider the&para;<br>question have found such orders nonappealable. See, e.g., Boughton v.&para;<br>Cotter Corp., 10 F. 3d 746, 749–750 (CA10 1993); Texaco Inc. v.

S., at 42.&para;<br>In applying Cohen’s collateral order doctrine, we have&para;<br>stressed that it must “never be allowed to swallow the&para;<br>general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to&para;<br>be deferred until final judgment has been entered.” Digi&para;<br>tal Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863,&para;<br>868 (1994) (citation omitted); see also Will v. Hallock, 546&para;<br>U. S. 345, 350 (2006) (“emphasizing [the doctrine’s] mod&para;<br>est scope”). Our admonition reflects a healthy respect for&para;<br>the virtues of the final-judgment rule. Permitting piece&para;<br>meal, prejudgment appeals, we have recognized, under&para;<br>mines “efficient judicial administration” and encroaches&para;<br>upon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a&para;<br>“special role” in managing ongoing litigation. Firestone&para;<br>Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981);&para;<br>see also Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424,&para;<br>436 (1985) (“[T]he district judge can better exercise [his or&para;<br>her] responsibility [to police the prejudgment tactics of&para;<br>litigants] if the appellate courts do not repeatedly inter&para;<br>vene to second-guess prejudgment rulings”).&para;<br>The justification for immediate appeal must therefore be&para;<br>sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of defer&para;<br>ring appeal until litigation concludes. This requirement&para;<br>finds expression in two of the three traditional Cohen&para;<br>conditions. The second condition insists upon “important&para;<br>questions separate from the merits.” Swint, 514 U. S., at&para;<br>42 (emphasis added). More significantly, “the third Cohen&para;<br>question, whether a right is ‘adequately vindicable’ or&para;<br>‘effectively reviewable,’ simply cannot be answered with&para;<br>out a judgment about the value of the interests that would&para;<br>be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment&para;<br>requirement.” Digital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 878–879.&para;<br>That a ruling “may burden litigants in ways that are only&para;<br>imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final&para;<br>district court judgment . . . has never sufficed.” Id., at 872.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

Rather, our&para;<br>focus is on “the entire category to which a claim belongs.”&para;<br>Digital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 868. As long as the class&para;<br>of claims, taken as a whole, can be adequately vindicated&para;<br>by other means, “the chance that the litigation at hand&para;<br>might be speeded, or a ‘particular injustic[e]’ averted,”&para;<br>does not provide a basis for jurisdiction under §1291.

Because we agree with the&para;<br>Court of Appeals that collateral order appeals are not&para;<br>necessary to ensure effective review of orders adverse to&para;<br>the attorney-client privilege, we do not decide whether the&para;<br>other Cohen requirements are met.&para;<br>Mohawk does not dispute that “we have generally de&para;<br>nied review of pretrial discovery orders.” Firestone, 449&para;<br>U. S., at 377; see also 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Coo&para;<br>per, Federal Practice and Procedure §3914.23, p. 123 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1992) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (“[T]he rule re&para;<br>mains settled that most discovery rulings are not final”).&para;<br>Mohawk contends, however, that rulings implicating the&para;<br>attorney-client privilege differ in kind from run-of-the-mill&para;<br>discovery orders because of the important institutional&para;<br>interests at stake. According to Mohawk, the right to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>maintain attorney-client confidences—the sine qua non of&para;<br>a meaningful attorney-client relationship—is “irreparably&para;<br>destroyed absent immediate appeal” of adverse privilege&para;<br>rulings. Brief for Petitioner 23.&para;<br>We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney&para;<br>client privilege, which “is one of the oldest recognized&para;<br>privileges for confidential communications.” Swidler &amp;&para;<br>Berlin v. United States, 524 U. S. 399, 403 (1998). By&para;<br>assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients&para;<br>to make “full and frank” disclosures to their attorneys,&para;<br>who are then better able to provide candid advice and&para;<br>effective representation. Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449&para;<br>U. S. 383, 389 (1981). This, in turn, serves “broader public&para;<br>interests in the observance of law and administration of&para;<br>justice.” Ibid.&para;<br>The crucial question, however, is not whether an inter&para;<br>est is important in the abstract; it is whether deferring&para;<br>review until final judgment so imperils the interest as to&para;<br>justify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of the entire&para;<br>class of relevant orders. We routinely require litigants to&para;<br>wait until after final judgment to vindicate valuable&para;<br>rights, including rights central to our adversarial system.&para;<br>See, e.g., Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 426 (holding an&para;<br>order disqualifying counsel in a civil case did not qualify&para;<br>for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine);&para;<br>Flanagan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984)&para;<br>(reaching the same result in a criminal case, notwith&para;<br>standing the Sixth Amendment rights at stake). In Digi&para;<br>tal Equipment, we rejected an assertion that collateral&para;<br>order review was necessary to promote “the public policy&para;<br>favoring voluntary resolution of disputes.” 511 U. S., at&para;<br>881. “It defies common sense,” we explained, “to maintain&para;<br>that parties’ readiness to settle will be significantly damp&para;<br>ened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a&para;<br>rule that a district court’s decision to let allegedly barred&para;<br>litigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>right only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff’s&para;<br>favor.” Ibid.&para;<br>We reach a similar conclusion here. In our estimation,&para;<br>postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the&para;<br>rights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney&para;<br>client privilege. Appellate courts can remedy the improper&para;<br>disclosure of privileged material in the same way they&para;<br>remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by&para;<br>vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new&para;<br>trial in which the protected material and its fruits are&para;<br>excluded from evidence.&para;<br>Dismissing such relief as inadequate, Mohawk empha&para;<br>sizes that the attorney-client privilege does not merely&para;<br>“prohibi[t] use of protected information at trial”; it pro&para;<br>vides a “right not to disclose the privileged information in&para;<br>the first place.” Brief for Petitioner 25. Mohawk is un&para;<br>doubtedly correct that an order to disclose privileged&para;<br>information intrudes on the confidentiality of attorney&para;<br>client communications. But deferring review until final&para;<br>judgment does not meaningfully reduce the ex ante incen&para;<br>tives for full and frank consultations between clients and&para;<br>counsel.&para;<br>One reason for the lack of a discernible chill is that, in&para;<br>deciding how freely to speak, clients and counsel are&para;<br>unlikely to focus on the remote prospect of an erroneous&para;<br>disclosure order, let alone on the timing of a possible&para;<br>appeal. Whether or not immediate collateral order ap&para;<br>peals are available, clients and counsel must account for&para;<br>the possibility that they will later be required by law to&para;<br>disclose their communications for a variety of reasons—for&para;<br>example, because they misjudged the scope of the privi&para;<br>lege, because they waived the privilege, or because their&para;<br>communications fell within the privilege’s crime-fraud&para;<br>exception. Most district court rulings on these matters&para;<br>involve the routine application of settled legal principles.&para;<br>They are unlikely to be reversed on appeal, particularly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

See, e.g., Richardson-Merrell,&para;<br>472 U.

The&para;<br>breadth of the privilege and the narrowness of its excep&para;<br>tions will thus tend to exert a much greater influence on&para;<br>the conduct of clients and counsel than the small risk that&para;<br>the law will be misapplied.2&para;<br>Moreover, were attorneys and clients to reflect upon&para;<br>their appellate options, they would find that litigants&para;<br>confronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege&para;<br>ruling have several potential avenues of review apart from&para;<br>collateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district&para;<br>court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an&para;<br>interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1292(b). The&para;<br>preconditions for §1292(b) review—“a controlling question&para;<br>of law,” the prompt resolution of which “may materially&para;<br>advance the ultimate termination of the litigation”—are&para;<br>most likely to be satisfied when a privilege ruling involves&para;<br>a new legal question or is of special consequence, and&para;<br>district courts should not hesitate to certify an interlocu&para;<br>tory appeal in such cases. Second, in extraordinary cir&para;<br>cumstances—i.e., when a disclosure order “amount[s] to a&para;<br>judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,”&para;<br>or otherwise works a manifest injustice—a party may&para;<br>petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.&para;<br>Cheney v.

Digital&para;<br>Equipment, 511 U. S., at 883.&para;<br>Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a&para;<br>disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions. Dis&para;<br>trict courts have a range of sanctions from which to&para;<br>choose, including “directing that the matters embraced in&para;<br>the order or other designated facts be taken as established&para;<br>for purposes of the action,” “prohibiting the disobedient&para;<br>party from supporting or opposing designated claims or&para;<br>defenses,” or “striking pleadings in whole or in part.” Fed.&para;<br>Rule Civ.

Alternatively, when the&para;<br>circumstances warrant it, a district court may hold a&para;<br>noncomplying party in contempt. The party can then&para;<br>appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the con&para;<br>tempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punish&para;<br>ment. See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United&para;<br>States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11 (1992); Firestone, 449 U. S., at&para;<br>377; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.

But the same can&para;<br>be said about many categories of pretrial discovery orders&para;<br>for which collateral order appeals are unavailable. As&para;<br>with these other orders, rulings adverse to the privilege&para;<br>vary in their significance; some may be momentous, but&para;<br>others are more mundane. Section 1292(b) appeals, man&para;<br>damus, and appeals from contempt citations facilitate&para;<br>immediate review of some of the more consequential at&para;<br>torney-client privilege rulings. Moreover, protective or&para;<br>ders are available to limit the spillover effects of disclosing&para;<br>sensitive information. That a fraction of orders adverse to&para;<br>the attorney-client privilege may nevertheless harm indi&para;<br>vidual litigants in ways that are “only imperfectly repara&para;<br>ble” does not justify making all such orders immediately&para;<br>appealable as of right under §1291. Digital Equipment,&para;<br>511 U.

Id., at 883. Permitting&para;<br>parties to undertake successive, piecemeal appeals of all&para;<br>adverse attorney-client rulings would unduly delay the&para;<br>resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden&para;<br>the Courts of Appeals. See Wright &amp; Miller §3914.23, at&para;<br>123 (“Routine appeal from disputed discovery orders&para;<br>would disrupt the orderly progress of the litigation, swamp&para;<br>the courts of appeals, and substantially reduce the district&para;<br>court’s ability to control the discovery process.”); cf.

Attempting to downplay such con&para;<br>cerns, Mohawk asserts that the three Circuits in which&para;<br>the collateral order doctrine currently applies to adverse&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>privilege rulings have seen only a trickle of appeals.

Were&para;<br>this Court to approve collateral order appeals in the attor&para;<br>ney-client privilege context, many more litigants would&para;<br>likely choose that route.

This&para;<br>admonition has acquired special force in recent years with&para;<br>the enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, “not&para;<br>expansion by court decision,” as the preferred means for&para;<br>determining whether and when prejudgment orders&para;<br>should be immediately appealable. Swint, 514 U. S., at&para;<br>48. Specifically, Congress in 1990 amended the Rules&para;<br>Enabling Act, 28 U. S.

Shortly thereafter, and along similar&para;<br>lines, Congress empowered this Court to “prescribe rules,&para;<br>in accordance with [§2072], to provide for an appeal of an&para;<br>interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Participating as amicus curiae in support of respondent Carpenter,&para;<br>the United States contends that collateral order appeals should be&para;<br>available for rulings involving certain governmental privileges “in light&para;<br>of their structural constitutional grounding under the separation of&para;<br>powers, relatively rare invocation, and unique importance to govern&para;<br>mental functions.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28.

It is for that reason that I do not join the&para;<br>remainder of the Court’s analysis.&para;<br>The scope of federal appellate jurisdiction is a matter&para;<br>the Constitution expressly commits to Congress, see Art.

See ante, at&para;<br>12–13 (citing §§2072–2074).

The Court’s choice of analysis is the&para;<br>more ironic because applying Cohen to the facts of this&para;<br>case requires the Court to reach conclusions on, and thus&para;<br>potentially prejudice, the very matters it says would bene&para;<br>fit from “the collective experience of bench and bar” and&para;<br>the “opportunity for full airing” that rulemaking provides.&para;<br>Ante, at 13.&para;<br>“Finality as a condition of review is an historic charac&para;<br>teristic of federal appellate procedure” that was incorpo&para;<br>rated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself&para;<br>has “departed from only when observance of it would&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945) (holding&para;<br>that §128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U. S. C. §1291)&para;<br>limits review to decisions that “en[d] the litigation on the&para;<br>merits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do but execute&para;<br>the judgment”). Cohen changed all that when it an&para;<br>nounced that a “small class” of collateral orders that do&para;<br>not meet the statutory definition of finality nonetheless&para;<br>may be immediately appealable if they satisfy certain&para;<br>criteria that show they are “too important to be denied&para;<br>review.” 337 U. S., at 546.&para;<br>Cohen and the early decisions applying it allowed §1291&para;<br>appeals of interlocutory orders concerning the posting of a&para;<br>bond, see id., at 545–547, the attachment of a vessel in&para;<br>admiralty, see Swift &amp; Co. Packers v. Compania Colombi&para;<br>ana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U.

As&para;<br>the Court’s opinion notes, later decisions sought to narrow&para;<br>Cohen lest its exception to §1291 “ ‘ swallow’ ” the final&para;<br>judgment rule.

The Court has ad&para;<br>hered to that narrowing approach, principally by raising&para;<br>the bar on what types of interests are “important enough”&para;<br>to justify collateral order appeals. See, e.g., Will, supra, at&para;<br>352–353 (explaining that an interlocutory order typically&para;<br>will be “important” enough to justify Cohen review only&para;<br>where “some particular value of a high order,” such as&para;<br>“honoring the separation of powers, preserving the effi&para;<br>ciency of government . . . , [or] respecting a State’s digni&para;<br>tary interests,” is “marshaled in support of the interest in&para;<br>avoiding trial” and the Court determines that denying&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

As we recognized last Term,&para;<br>however, our attempts to contain the Cohen doctrine have&para;<br>not all been successful or persuasive. See Ashcroft, supra,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 8) (“[A]s a general matter, the collateral&para;<br>order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits&para;<br>dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of&para;<br>the criteria set out in Cohen”). In my view, this case pre&para;<br>sents an opportunity to improve our approach.&para;<br>The privilege interest at issue here is undoubtedly&para;<br>important, both in its own right and when compared to&para;<br>some of the interests (e.g., in bond and notice-cost rulings)&para;<br>we have held to be appealable under Cohen. Accordingly,&para;<br>the Court’s Cohen analysis does not rest on the privilege&para;<br>order’s relative unimportance, but instead on its effective&para;<br>reviewability after final judgment. Ante, at 8–12. Al&para;<br>though I agree with the Court’s ultimate conclusion, I see&para;<br>two difficulties with this approach. First, the Court em&para;<br>phasizes that the alternative avenues of review it dis&para;<br>cusses (which did not prove adequate in this case) would&para;<br>be adequate where the privilege ruling at issue is “particu&para;<br>larly injurious or novel.” Ante, at 9. If that is right, and it&para;<br>seems to me that it is, then the opinion raises the question&para;<br>why such avenues were not also adequate to address the&para;<br>orders whose unusual importance or particularly injurious&para;<br>nature we have held justified immediate appeal under&para;<br>Cohen. See, e.g., Sell, supra, at 177. Second, the facts of&para;<br>this particular case seem in several respects to undercut&para;<br>the Court’s conclusion that the benefits of collateral order&para;<br>review “cannot justify the likely institutional costs.” Ante,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>at 11.* The Court responds that these case-specific argu&para;<br>ments miss the point because the focus of the Cohen&para;<br>analysis is whether the “entire category” or “class of&para;<br>claims” at issue merits appellate review under the collat&para;<br>eral order doctrine. Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). That is exactly right, and illustrates what in&para;<br>creasingly has bothered me about making this kind of&para;<br>appealability determination via case-by-case adjudication.&para;<br>The exercise forces the reviewing court to subordinate the&para;<br>realities of each case before it to generalized conclusions&para;<br>about the “likely” costs and benefits of allowing an excep&para;<br>tion to the final judgment rule in an entire “class of cases.”&para;<br>The Court concedes that Congress, which holds the consti&para;<br>tutional reins in this area, has determined that such value&para;<br>judgments are better left to the “collective experience of&para;<br>bench and bar” and the “opportunity for full airing” that&para;<br>rulemaking provides. Ante, at 13. This determination is&para;<br>entitled to our full respect, in deed as well as in word.&para;<br>Accordingly, I would leave the value judgments the Court&para;<br>makes in its opinion to the rulemaking process, and in so&para;<br>doing take this opportunity to limit—effectively, predicta&para;<br>bly, and in a way we should have done long ago—the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The Court concludes, for example, that in most cases final judgment&para;<br>review of an erroneous privilege ruling will suffice to vindicate the&para;<br>injured party’s rights because the appellate court can vacate the&para;<br>adverse judgment and remand for a new trial in which the protected&para;<br>material is excluded. Ante, at 8. But this case appears to involve one of&para;<br>the (perhaps rare) situations in which final judgment review might not&para;<br>be sufficient because it is a case in which the challenged order already&para;<br>has had “implications beyond the case at hand,” namely, in the sepa&para;<br>rate class action in Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., No. 4:04–CV–&para;<br>0003–HLM (ND Ga.). Ante, at 11. The Court also concludes that the&para;<br>“likely institutional costs” of allowing collateral order review would&para;<br>outweigh its benefits because, inter alia, such review would “needlessly&para;<br>burden the Courts of Appeals.” Ibid. But as the Court concedes, it&para;<br>must speculate on this point because the three Circuits that allow&para;<br>Cohen appeals of privilege rulings have not been overwhelmed.
