REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–138.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 2, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>An investment treaty (Treaty) between the United Kingdom and Argentina authorizes a party to submit a dispute “to the decision of the&para;<br>competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the&para;<br>investment was made,” i.e., a local court, Art. 8(1); and permits arbitration, as relevant here, “where, after a period of eighteen months&para;<br>has elapsed from the moment when the dispute was submitted to&para;<br>[that] tribunal . . . , the said tribunal has not given its final decision,”&para;<br>Art. 8(2)(a)(i).&para;<br>Petitioner BG Group plc, a British firm, belonged to a consortium&para;<br>with a majority interest in MetroGAS, an Argentine entity awarded&para;<br>an exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos Aires. At the&para;<br>time of BG Group’s investment, Argentine law provided that gas “tariffs” would be calculated in U. S. dollars and would be set at levels&para;<br>sufficient to assure gas distribution firms a reasonable return. But&para;<br>Argentina later amended the law, changing (among other things) the&para;<br>calculation basis to pesos. MetroGAS’ profits soon became losses.&para;<br>Invoking Article 8, BG Group sought arbitration, which the parties&para;<br>sited in Washington, D. C. BG Group claimed that Argentina’s new&para;<br>laws and practices violated the Treaty, which forbids the “expropriation” of investments and requires each nation to give “fair and equitable treatment” to investors from the other. Argentina denied those&para;<br>claims, but also argued that the arbitrators lacked “jurisdiction” to&para;<br>hear the dispute because, as relevant here, BG Group had not complied with Article 8’s local litigation requirement. The arbitration&para;<br>panel concluded that it had jurisdiction, finding, among other things,&para;<br>that Argentina’s conduct (such as also enacting new laws that hindered recourse to its judiciary by firms in BG Group’s situation) had&para;<br>excused BG Group’s failure to comply with Article 8’s requirement.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>On the merits, the panel found that Argentina had not expropriated&para;<br>BG Group’s investment but had denied BG Group “fair and equitable&para;<br>treatment.” It awarded damages to BG Group. Both sides sought review in federal district court: BG Group to confirm the award under&para;<br>the New York Convention and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),&para;<br>and Argentina to vacate the award, in part on the ground that the&para;<br>arbitrators lacked jurisdiction under the FAA. The District Court&para;<br>confirmed the award, but the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated. It found that the interpretation and application of Article 8’s requirement were matters for courts to decide de&para;<br>novo, i.e., without deference to the arbitrators’ views; that the circumstances did not excuse BG Group’s failure to comply with the requirement; and that BG Group had to commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s courts and wait 18 months before seeking arbitration. Thus,&para;<br>the court held, the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. A court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award&para;<br>made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply “threshold” provisions concerning arbitration using the framework developed for interpreting similar provisions in ordinary contracts. Under that&para;<br>framework, the local litigation requirement is a matter for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply. Courts should review their interpretation with deference. Pp. 6–17.&para;<br>(a) Were the Treaty an ordinary contract, it would call for arbitrators primarily to interpret and to apply the local litigation provision. In an ordinary contract, the parties determine whether a particular matter is primarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide. See,&para;<br>e.g., Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582. If&para;<br>the contract is silent on the matter of who is to decide a “threshold”&para;<br>question about arbitration, courts determine the parties’ intent using&para;<br>presumptions. That is, courts presume that the parties intended&para;<br>courts to decide disputes about “arbitrability,” e.g., Howsam v. Dean&para;<br>Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 84, and arbitrators to decide disputes about the meaning and application of procedural preconditions&para;<br>for the use of arbitration, see id., at 86, including, e.g., claims of&para;<br>“waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability,” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, and the&para;<br>satisfaction of, e.g., “ ‘time limits, notice, laches, [or] estoppel,’ ” Howsam, 537 U. S., at 85. The provision at issue is of the procedural variety. As its text and structure make clear, it determines when the&para;<br>contractual duty to arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to arbitrate at all. Neither its language nor other language in&para;<br>Article 8 gives substantive weight to the local court’s determinations&para;<br>on the matters at issue between the parties. The litigation provision&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>is thus a claims-processing rule. It is analogous to other procedural&para;<br>provisions found to be for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply, see, e.g., ibid., and there is nothing in Article 8 or the Treaty to&para;<br>overcome the ordinary assumption. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) The fact that the document at issue is a treaty does not make&para;<br>a critical difference to this analysis. A treaty is a contract between&para;<br>nations, and its interpretation normally is a matter of determining&para;<br>the parties’ intent. Air France v. Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 399. Where, as&para;<br>here, a federal court is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a&para;<br>motion to vacate or confirm an award made under the Federal Arbitration Act, it should normally apply the presumptions supplied by&para;<br>American law. The presence of a condition of “consent” to arbitration&para;<br>in a treaty likely does not warrant abandoning, or increasing the&para;<br>complexity of, the ordinary intent-determining framework. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Howsam, supra, at 83–85. But because this Treaty does not state&para;<br>that the local litigation requirement is a condition of consent, the&para;<br>Court need not resolve what the effect of any such language would be.&para;<br>The Court need not go beyond holding that in the absence of language in a treaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different&para;<br>delegation of authority, the ordinary interpretive framework applies.&para;<br>Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(c) The Treaty contains no evidence showing that the parties had&para;<br>an intent contrary to the ordinary presumptions about who should&para;<br>decide threshold arbitration issues. The text and structure of Article&para;<br>8’s litigation requirement make clear that it is a procedural condition&para;<br>precedent to arbitration. Because the ordinary presumption applies&para;<br>and is not overcome, the interpretation and application of the provision are primarily for the arbitrators, and courts must review their&para;<br>decision with considerable deference. Pp. 13–17.&para;<br>2. While Argentina is entitled to court review (under a properly&para;<br>deferential standard) of the arbitrators’ decision to excuse BG&para;<br>Group’s noncompliance with the litigation requirement, that review&para;<br>shows that the arbitrators’ determinations were lawful. Their conclusion that the litigation provision cannot be construed as an absolute impediment to arbitration, in all cases, lies well within their interpretative authority. Their factual findings that Argentina passed&para;<br>laws hindering recourse to the local judiciary by firms similar to BG&para;<br>Group are undisputed by Argentina and are accepted as valid. And&para;<br>their conclusion that Argentina’s actions made it “absurd and unreasonable” to read Article 8 to require an investor in BG Group’s position to bring its grievance in a domestic court, before arbitrating, is&para;<br>not barred by the Treaty. Pp. 17–19.&para;<br>665 F. 3d 1363, reversed.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v.

See Agreement&para;<br>for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2),&para;<br>Dec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T.

Art. 8(2)(b).&para;<br>This case concerns the Treaty’s arbitration clause, and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>specifically the local court litigation requirement set forth&para;<br>in Article 8(2)(a). The question before us is whether a&para;<br>court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration&para;<br>award made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply&para;<br>the local litigation requirement de novo, or with the defer­&para;<br>ence that courts ordinarily owe arbitration decisions. That&para;<br>is to say, who—court or arbitrator—bears primary respon­&para;<br>sibility for interpreting and applying the local litigation&para;<br>requirement to an underlying controversy? In our view,&para;<br>the matter is for the arbitrators, and courts must review&para;<br>their determinations with deference.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In the early 1990’s, the petitioner, BG Group plc, a&para;<br>British firm, belonged to a consortium that bought a ma­&para;<br>jority interest in an Argentine entity called MetroGAS.&para;<br>MetroGAS was a gas distribution company created by&para;<br>Argentine law in 1992, as a result of the government’s&para;<br>privatization of its state-owned gas utility. Argentina&para;<br>distributed the utility’s assets to new, private companies,&para;<br>one of which was MetroGAS. It awarded MetroGAS a 35­&para;<br>year exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos&para;<br>Aires, and it submitted a controlling interest in the com­&para;<br>pany to international public tender. BG Group’s consor­&para;<br>tium was the successful bidder.&para;<br>At about the same time, Argentina enacted statutes&para;<br>providing that its regulators would calculate gas “tariffs”&para;<br>in U. S. dollars, and that those tariffs would be set at&para;<br>levels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms, such as&para;<br>MetroGAS, a reasonable return.&para;<br>In 2001 and 2002, Argentina, faced with an economic&para;<br>crisis, enacted new laws. Those laws changed the basis for&para;<br>calculating gas tariffs from dollars to pesos, at a rate of&para;<br>one peso per dollar. The exchange rate at the time was&para;<br>roughly three pesos to the dollar. The result was that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>MetroGAS’ profits were quickly transformed into losses.&para;<br>BG Group believed that these changes (and several others)&para;<br>violated the Treaty; Argentina believed the contrary.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 2003, BG Group, invoking Article 8 of the Treaty,&para;<br>sought arbitration. The parties appointed arbitrators;&para;<br>they agreed to site the arbitration in Washington, D. C.;&para;<br>and between 2004 and 2006, the arbitrators decided mo­&para;<br>tions, received evidence, and conducted hearings. BG&para;<br>Group essentially claimed that Argentina’s new laws and&para;<br>regulatory practices violated provisions in the Treaty&para;<br>forbidding the “expropriation” of investments and requir­&para;<br>ing that each nation give “fair and equitable treatment” to&para;<br>investors from the other. Argentina denied these claims,&para;<br>while also arguing that the arbitration tribunal lacked&para;<br>“jurisdiction” to hear the dispute. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>143a–144a, 214a–218a, 224a–232a. According to Argen­&para;<br>tina, the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction because: (1) BG&para;<br>Group was not a Treaty-protected “investor”; (2) BG&para;<br>Group’s interest in MetroGAS was not a Treaty-protected&para;<br>“investment”; and (3) BG Group initiated arbitration&para;<br>without first litigating its claims in Argentina’s courts,&para;<br>despite Article 8’s requirement. Id., at 143a–171a. In&para;<br>Argentina’s view, “failure by BG to bring its grievance to&para;<br>Argentine courts for 18 months renders its claims in this&para;<br>arbitration inadmissible.” Id., at 162a.&para;<br>In late December 2007, the arbitration panel reached a&para;<br>final decision. It began by determining that it had “juris­&para;<br>diction” to consider the merits of the dispute. In support&para;<br>of that determination, the tribunal concluded that BG&para;<br>Group was an “investor,” that its interest in MetroGAS&para;<br>amounted to a Treaty-protected “investment,” and that&para;<br>Argentina’s own conduct had waived, or excused, BG&para;<br>Group’s failure to comply with Article 8’s local litigation&para;<br>requirement. Id., at 99a, 145a, 161a, 171a. The panel&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pointed out that in 2002, the President of Argentina had&para;<br>issued a decree staying for 180 days the execution of its&para;<br>courts’ final judgments (and injunctions) in suits claiming&para;<br>harm as a result of the new economic measures. Id., at&para;<br>166a–167a. In addition, Argentina had established a&para;<br>“renegotiation process” for public service contracts, such&para;<br>as its contract with MetroGAS, to alleviate the negative&para;<br>impact of the new economic measures. Id., at 129a, 131a.&para;<br>But Argentina had simultaneously barred from participa­&para;<br>tion in that “process” firms that were litigating against&para;<br>Argentina in court or in arbitration. Id., at 168a–171a.&para;<br>These measures, while not making litigation in Argenti­&para;<br>na’s courts literally impossible, nonetheless “hindered”&para;<br>recourse “to the domestic judiciary” to the point where the&para;<br>Treaty implicitly excused compliance with the local litiga­&para;<br>tion requirement. Id., at 165. Requiring a private party&para;<br>in such circumstances to seek relief in Argentina’s courts&para;<br>for 18 months, the panel concluded, would lead to “absurd&para;<br>and unreasonable result[s].” Id., at 166a.&para;<br>On the merits, the arbitration panel agreed with Argen­&para;<br>tina that it had not “expropriate[d]” BG Group’s invest­&para;<br>ment, but also found that Argentina had denied BG Group&para;<br>“fair and equitable treatment.” Id., at 222a–223a, 240a–&para;<br>242a. It awarded BG Group $185 million in damages. Id.,&para;<br>at 297a.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In March 2008, both sides filed petitions for review in&para;<br>the District Court for the District of Columbia. BG Group&para;<br>sought to confirm the award under the New York Conven­&para;<br>tion and the Federal Arbitration Act. See Convention on&para;<br>the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral&para;<br>Awards, Art. IV, June 10, 1958, 21 U. S. T. 2519, T. I. A. S.&para;<br>No. 6997 (New York Convention) (providing that a party&para;<br>may apply “for recognition and enforcement” of an arbitral&para;<br>award subject to the Convention); 9 U. S.

Argentina sought to&para;<br>vacate the award in part on the ground that the arbitra­&para;<br>tors lacked jurisdiction. See §10(a)(4) (a federal court may&para;<br>vacate an arbitral award “where the arbitrators exceeded&para;<br>their powers”).&para;<br>The District Court denied Argentina’s claims and con­&para;<br>firmed the award. 764 F. Supp. 2d 21 (DC 2011); 715 F.&para;<br>Supp. 2d 108 (DC 2010). But the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>District of Columbia Circuit reversed. 665 F. 3d 1363&para;<br>(2012). In the appeals court’s view, the interpretation and&para;<br>application of Article 8’s local litigation requirement was a&para;<br>matter for courts to decide de novo, i.e., without deference&para;<br>to the views of the arbitrators. The Court of Appeals then&para;<br>went on to hold that the circumstances did not excuse BG&para;<br>Group’s failure to comply with the requirement. Rather,&para;<br>BG Group must “commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s&para;<br>courts and wait eighteen months before filing for arbitra­&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 1373. Because BG Group had not done so,&para;<br>the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.&para;<br>And the appeals court ordered the award vacated. Ibid.&para;<br>BG Group filed a petition for certiorari. Given the&para;<br>importance of the matter for international commercial ar­&para;<br>bitration, we granted the petition. See, e.g., K. Van­&para;<br>develde, Bilateral Investment Treaties: History, Policy&para;<br>&amp; Interpretation 430–432 (2010) (explaining that dispute­&para;<br>resolution mechanisms allowing for arbitration are a&para;<br>“critical element” of modern day bilateral investment&para;<br>treaties); C.

See Howsam, supra, at&para;<br>86 (courts assume parties “normally expect a forum-based&para;<br>decisionmaker to decide forum-specific procedural gateway&para;<br>matters” (emphasis added)).

It determines when the contractual duty to&para;<br>arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to&para;<br>arbitrate at all. Cf. 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts&para;<br>§38:7, pp. 435, 437; §38:4, p. 422 (4th ed. 2013) (a “condi­&para;<br>tion precedent” determines what must happen before “a&para;<br>contractual duty arises” but does not “make the validity of&para;<br>the contract depend on its happening” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

To the con­&para;<br>trary, Article 8 provides that only the “arbitration decision&para;<br>shall be final and binding on both Parties.” Art. 8(4). The&para;<br>litigation provision is consequently a purely procedural&para;<br>requirement—a claims-processing rule that governs when&para;<br>the arbitration may begin, but not whether it may occur or&para;<br>what its substantive outcome will be on the issues in&para;<br>dispute.&para;<br>Moreover, the local litigation requirement is highly&para;<br>analogous to procedural provisions that both this Court&para;<br>and others have found are for arbitrators, not courts,&para;<br>primarily to interpret and to apply.

As a general matter, a treaty is&para;<br>a contract, though between nations. Its interpretation&para;<br>normally is, like a contract’s interpretation, a matter of&para;<br>determining the parties’ intent. Air France v. Saks, 470&para;<br>U.

And,&para;<br>while we respect the Government’s views about the proper&para;<br>interpretation of treaties, e.g., Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U. S.&para;<br>1, 15 (2010), we have been unable to find any other au­&para;<br>thority or precedent suggesting that the use of the “con­&para;<br>sent” label in a treaty should make a critical difference&para;<br>in discerning the parties’ intent about whether courts&para;<br>or arbitrators should interpret and apply the relevant&para;<br>provision.&para;<br>We are willing to assume with the Solicitor General that&para;<br>the appearance of this label in a treaty can show that the&para;<br>parties, or one of them, thought the designated matter&para;<br>quite important. But that is unlikely to be conclusive. For&para;<br>parties often submit important matters to arbitration.&para;<br>And the word “consent” could be attached to a highly&para;<br>procedural precondition to arbitration, such as a waiting&para;<br>period of several months, which the parties are unlikely to&para;<br>have intended that courts apply without saying so.

And we apply our ordinary&para;<br>presumption that the interpretation and application of&para;<br>procedural provisions such as the provision before us are&para;<br>primarily for the arbitrators.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A treaty may contain evidence that shows the parties&para;<br>had an intent contrary to our ordinary presumptions&para;<br>about who should decide threshold issues related to arbi­&para;<br>tration. But the treaty before us does not sho w any such&para;<br>contrary intention. We concede that the local litigation&para;<br>requirement appears in ¶(1) of Article 8, while the Article&para;<br>does not mention arbitration until the subsequent para­&para;<br>graph, ¶(2). Moreover, a requirement that a party ex­&para;<br>haust its remedies in a country’s domestic courts before&para;<br>seeking to arbitrate may seem particularly important to a&para;<br>country offering protections to foreign investors. And the&para;<br>placing of an important matter prior to any mention of&para;<br>arbitration at least arguably suggests an intent by Argen­&para;<br>tina, the United Kingdom, or both, to have courts rather&para;<br>than arbitrators apply the litigation requirement.&para;<br>These considerations, however, are outweighed by oth­&para;<br>ers. As discussed supra, at 8–9, the text and structure of&para;<br>the litigation requirement set forth in Article 8 make clear&para;<br>that it is a procedural condition precedent to arbitration—&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a sequential step that a party must follow before giving&para;<br>notice of arbitration. The Treaty nowhere says that the&para;<br>provision is to operate as a substantive condition on the&para;<br>formation of the arbitration contract, or that it is a matter&para;<br>of such elevated importance that it is to be decided by&para;<br>courts. International arbitrators are likely more familiar&para;<br>than are judges with the expectations of foreign investors&para;<br>and recipient nations regarding the operation of the provi­&para;<br>sion. See Howsam, supra, at 85 (comparative institutional&para;<br>expertise a factor in determining parties’ likely intent).&para;<br>And the Treaty itself authorizes the use of international&para;<br>arbitration associations, the rules of which provide that&para;<br>arbitrators shall have the authority to interpret provisions&para;<br>of this kind. Art. 8(3) (providing that the parties may&para;<br>refer a dispute to the International Centre for the Settle­&para;<br>ment of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or to arbitrators&para;<br>appointed pursuant to the arbitration rules of the United&para;<br>Nations Commission on International Trade Law&para;<br>(UNCITRAL)); accord, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Art.&para;<br>23(1) (rev. 2010 ed.) (“[A]rbitral tribunal shall have the&para;<br>power to rule on its own jurisdiction”); ICSID Convention,&para;<br>Regulations and Rules, Art. 41(1) (2006 ed.) (“Tribunal&para;<br>shall be the judge of its own competence”). Cf. Howsam,&para;<br>supra, at 85 (giving weight to the parties’ incorporation of&para;<br>the National Association of Securities Dealers’ Code of&para;<br>Arbitration into their contract, which provided for similar&para;<br>arbitral authority, as evidence that they intended arbitra­&para;<br>tors to “interpret and apply the NASD time limit rule”).&para;<br>The upshot is that our ordinary presumption applies&para;<br>and it is not overcome. The interpretation and application&para;<br>of the local litigation provision is primarily for the arbi­&para;<br>trators. Reviewing courts cannot review their decision&para;<br>de novo. Rather, they must do so with considerable&para;<br>deference.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The dissent interprets Article 8’s local litigation provi­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion differently. In its view, the provision sets forth not a&para;<br>condition precedent to arbitration in an already-binding&para;<br>arbitration contract (normally a matter for arbitrators to&para;<br>interpret), but a substantive condition on Argentina’s con­&para;<br>sent to arbitration and thus on the contract’s formation&para;<br>in the first place (normally something for courts to inter­&para;<br>pret). It reads the whole of Article 8 as a “unilateral&para;<br>standing offer” to arbitrate that Argentina and the United&para;<br>Kingdom each extends to investors of the other country.&para;<br>Post, at 9 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). And it says that the&para;<br>local litigation requirement is one of the essential “ ‘terms&para;<br>in which the offer was made.’ ” Post, at 6 (quoting Eliason&para;<br>v. Henshaw, 4 Wheat. 225, 228 (1819); emphasis deleted).&para;<br>While it is possible to read the provision in this way,&para;<br>doing so is not consistent with our case law interpreting&para;<br>similar provisions appearing in ordinary arbitration con­&para;<br>tracts. See Part III, supra. Consequently, interpreting&para;<br>the provision in such a manner would require us to treat&para;<br>treaties as warranting a different kind of analysis. And&para;<br>the dissent does so without supplying any different set of&para;<br>general principles that might guide that analysis. That is&para;<br>a matter of some concern in a world where foreign invest­&para;<br>ment and related arbitration treaties increasingly matter.&para;<br>Even were we to ignore our ordinary contract princi­&para;<br>ples, however, we would not take the dissent’s view. As&para;<br>we have explained, the local litigation provision on its face&para;<br>concerns arbitration’s timing, not the Treaty’s effective&para;<br>date; or whom its arbitration clause binds; or whether that&para;<br>arbitration clause covers a certain kind of dispute. Cf.&para;<br>Granite Rock, 561 U. S., at 296–303 (ratification date);&para;<br>First Options, 514 U. S., at 941, 943–947 (parties); AT&amp;T&para;<br>Technologies, 475 U. S., at 651 (kind of dispute). The&para;<br>dissent points out that Article 8(2)(a) “does not simply&para;<br>require the parties to wait for 18 months before proceeding&para;<br>to arbitration,” but instructs them to do something—to&para;<br>“submit their claims for adjudication.” Post, at 8. That is&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>correct. But the something they must do has no direct&para;<br>impact on the resolution of their dispute, for as we previ­&para;<br>ously pointed out, Article 8 provides that only the decision&para;<br>of the arbitrators (who need not give weight to the local&para;<br>court’s decision) will be “final and binding.” Art. 8(4). The&para;<br>provision, at base, is a claims-processing rule. And the&para;<br>dissent’s efforts to imbue it with greater significance fall&para;<br>short.&para;<br>The treatises to which the dissent refers also fail to&para;<br>support its position. Post, at 3, 6. Those authorities pri­&para;<br>marily describe how an offer to arbitrate in an investment&para;<br>treaty can be accepted, such as through an investor’s filing&para;<br>of a notice of arbitration. See J. Salacuse, The Law of&para;<br>Investment Treaties 381 (2010); Schreuer, Consent to&para;<br>Arbitration, in The Oxford Handbook of International&para;<br>Investment Law 830, 836–837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, &amp;&para;<br>C. Schreuer eds. 2008); Dugan, Investor-State Arbitration,&para;<br>at 221–222. They do not endorse the dissent’s reading of&para;<br>the local litigation provision or of provisions like it.&para;<br>To the contrary, the bulk of international authority&para;<br>supports our view that the provision functions as a purely&para;<br>procedural precondition to arbitrate. See 1 G. Born, In­&para;<br>ternational Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009) (“A sub­&para;<br>stantial body of arbitral authority from investor-state&para;<br>disputes concludes that compliance with procedural mecha­&para;<br>nisms in an arbitration agreement (or bilateral investment&para;<br>treaty) is not ordinarily a jurisdictional prerequisite”);&para;<br>Brief for Professors and Practitioners of Arbitration Law&para;<br>as Amici Curiae 12–16 (to assume the parties intended&para;<br>de novo review of the provision by a court “is likely to&para;<br>set United States courts on a collision course with the&para;<br>international regime embodied in thousands of [bilateral&para;<br>investment treaties]”).

But that is not the issue. The&para;<br>question is whether the parties intended to give courts or&para;<br>arbitrators primary authority to interpret and apply a&para;<br>threshold provision in an arbitration contract—when the&para;<br>contract is silent as to the delegation of authority. We&para;<br>have already explained why we believe that where, as&para;<br>here, the provision resembles a claims-processing re­&para;<br>quirement and is not a requirement that affects the arbi­&para;<br>tration contract’s validity or scope, we presume that the&para;<br>parties (even if they are sovereigns) intended to give that&para;<br>authority to the arbitrators. See Parts III, IV–A and&para;<br>IV–B, supra.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Argentina correctly argues that it is nonetheless en­&para;<br>titled to court review of the arbitrators’ decision to excuse&para;<br>BG Group’s noncompliance with the litigation require­&para;<br>ment, and to take jurisdiction over the dispute.

Construing the local litigation&para;<br>provision as an “absolute” requirement would mean Ar­&para;<br>gentina could avoid arbitration by, say, passing a law that&para;<br>closed down its court system indefinitely or that prohibit­&para;<br>ed investors from using its courts.

Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,&para;<br>537 U. S. 79, 84 (2002). And a party plainly cannot be&para;<br>bound by an arbitration clause to which it does not consent. See Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287,&para;<br>299 (2010) (“Arbitration is strictly ‘a matter of consent’ ”&para;<br>(quoting Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479&para;<br>(1989)).&para;<br>Consent is especially salient in the context of a bilateral&para;<br>investment treaty, where the treaty is not an already&para;<br>agreed-upon arbitration provision between known parties,&para;<br>but rather a nation state’s standing offer to arbitrate with&para;<br>an amorphous class of private investors. In this setting, a&para;<br>nation-state might reasonably wish to condition its consent to arbitrate with a previously unspecified investor&para;<br>counterparty on the investor’s compliance with a requirement that might be deemed “purely procedural” in the&para;<br>ordinary commercial context, ante, at 9. Moreover, as THE&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE notes, “[i]t is no trifling matter” for a sovereign nation to “subject itself to international arbitration”&para;<br>proceedings, so we should “not presume that any country&para;<br>. . . takes that step lightly.” Post, at 9 (dissenting opinion).&para;<br>Consider, for example, the United States-Korea Free&para;<br>Trade Agreement, which as the Court recognizes, ante, at&para;<br>12–13, includes a provision explicitly entitled “Conditions&para;<br>and Limitations on Consent of Each Party.” Art. 11.18,&para;<br>Feb. 10, 2011. That provision declares that “[n]o claim&para;<br>may be submitted to arbitration” unless a claimant first&para;<br>waives its “right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court . . . any proceeding with respect&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Ibid. If this waiver condition were to appear without the “consent” label in a&para;<br>binding arbitration agreement between two commercial&para;<br>parties, one might characterize it as the kind of procedural&para;<br>“ ‘condition precedent to arbitrability’ ” that we presume&para;<br>parties intend for arbitrators to decide. Howsam, 537&para;<br>U. S., at 85. But where the waiver requirement is expressly denominated a “condition on consent” in an international investment treaty, the label could well be critical in&para;<br>determining whether the states party to the treaty intended the condition to be reviewed by a court. After all, a&para;<br>dispute as to consent is “the starkest form of the question&para;<br>whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate.” Post, at 13.&para;<br>And we ordinarily presume that parties intend for courts&para;<br>to decide such questions because otherwise arbitrators&para;<br>might “force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they&para;<br>reasonably would have thought a judge . . . would decide.”&para;<br>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,&para;<br>945 (1995).&para;<br>Accordingly, if the local litigation requirement at issue&para;<br>here were labeled a condition on the treaty parties’ “consent” to arbitrate, that would in my view change the analysis as to whether the parties intended the requirement to&para;<br>be interpreted by a court or an arbitrator. As it is, however, all parties agree that the local litigation requirement&para;<br>is not so denominated. See Agreement for the Promotion&para;<br>and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2), Dec. 11, 1990,&para;<br>1765 U. N. T. S. 38. Nor is there compelling reason to&para;<br>suppose the parties silently intended to make it a condition on their consent to arbitrate, given that a local court’s&para;<br>decision is of no legal significance under the treaty, ante,&para;<br>at 8–9, and given that the entire purpose of bilateral&para;<br>investment agreements is to “reliev[e] investors of any&para;<br>concern that the courts of host countries will be unable or&para;<br>unwilling to provide justice in a dispute between a for-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v.

Argentina points to no evidence that its objection was&para;<br>of the consent variety. This omission is notable because Argentina&para;<br>knew how to phrase its arguments before the arbitrators in terms of&para;<br>consent; it argued separately that it had not consented to arbitration&para;<br>with BG Group on the ground that BG was not a party to the license&para;<br>underlying the dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–186a. First&para;<br>Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.

Id.,&para;<br>at 944, 946. The question here, by contrast, is whether that presumption attaches to begin with—that is, whether the local litigation requirement was a condition on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate (which&para;<br>would trigger the presumption) or a procedural condition in an already&para;<br>binding arbitration agreement (which would not). That Argentina apparently took the latter position in arbitration is surely relevant evidence that the condition was, in fact, not one on its consent.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Article&para;<br>8(2)(a) makes clear what that something is: An investor&para;<br>must submit his dispute to the courts of the host country.&para;<br>After 18 months, or an unsatisfactory decision, the inves­&para;<br>tor may then request arbitration.&para;<br>Submitting the dispute to the courts is thus a condition&para;<br>to the formation of an agreement, not simply a matter of&para;<br>performing an existing agreement.

REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>The majority focuses throughout its opinion on what it&para;<br>calls the Treaty’s “arbitration clause,” ante, at 1, but that&para;<br>provision does not stand alone. Rather, it is only part—&para;<br>and a subordinate part at that—of a broader dispute&para;<br>resolution provision. Article 8 is thus entitled “Settlement&para;<br>of Disputes Between an Investor and the Host State,” and&para;<br>it opens without so much as mentioning arbitration. 1765&para;<br>U. N. T. S. 37. Instead it initially directs any disputing&para;<br>investor and signatory country (what the Treaty calls a&para;<br>“Contracting Party”) to court. When “an investor of one&para;<br>Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party” have&para;<br>an investment-related dispute that has “not been amicably&para;<br>settled,” the Treaty commands that the dispute “shall be&para;<br>submitted, at the request of one of the Parties to the dis­&para;<br>pute, to the decision of the competent tribunal of the&para;<br>Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was&para;<br>made.” Art. 8(1), id., at 37–38. (emphasis added). This&para;<br>provision could not be clearer: Before taking any other&para;<br>steps, an aggrieved investor must submit its dispute with&para;<br>a Contracting Party to that Contracting Party’s own&para;<br>courts.&para;<br>There are two routes to arbitration in Article 8(2)(a),&para;<br>and each passes through a Contracting Party’s domestic&para;<br>courts. That is, the Treaty’s arbitration provisions in&para;<br>Article 8(2)(a) presuppose that the parties have complied&para;<br>with the local litigation provision in Article 8(1). Specifi­&para;<br>cally, a party may request arbitration only (1) “after a&para;<br>period of eighteen months has elapsed from the moment&para;<br>when the dispute was submitted to the competent tribunal&para;<br>of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment&para;<br>was made” and “the said tribunal has not given its final&para;<br>decision,” Art. 8(2)(a)(i), id., at 38, or (2) “where the final&para;<br>decision of the aforementioned tribunal has been made but&para;<br>the Parties are still in dispute,” Art. 8(2)(a)(ii), ibid.

In contrast to the two routes in Article&para;<br>8(2)(a), this one does not refer to the local litigation provi­&para;<br>sion. That omission is significant. It makes clear that an&para;<br>investor can bypass local litigation only by obtaining the&para;<br>Contracting Party’s explicit agreement to proceed directly&para;<br>to arbitration. Short of that, an investor has no choice but&para;<br>to litigate in the Contracting Party’s courts for at least&para;<br>some period.&para;<br>The structure of Article 8 confirms that the routes to&para;<br>arbitration in paragraph (2)(a) are just as much about&para;<br>eliciting a Contracting Party’s consent to arbitrate as the&para;<br>route in paragraph 8(2)(b). Under Article 8(2)(b), the&para;<br>requisite consent is demonstrated by a specific agreement.&para;<br>Under Article 8(2)(a), the requisite consent is demonstrated&para;<br>by compliance with the requirement to resort to a coun­&para;<br>try’s local courts.&para;<br>Whereas Article 8(2)(a) is part of a completed agreement&para;<br>between Argentina and the United Kingdom, it constitutes&para;<br>only a unilateral standing offer by Argentina with respect&para;<br>to U. K. investors—an offer to submit to arbitration where&para;<br>certain conditions are met. That is how scholars under­&para;<br>stand arbitration provisions in bilateral investment trea­&para;<br>ties in general. See Dugan 221; Salacuse 381; Brief for&para;<br>Practitioners and Professors of International Arbitration&para;<br>Law as Amici Curiae 4. And it is how BG Group itself&para;<br>describes this investment treaty in particular. See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 43 (the Treaty is a “standing offer” by Ar­&para;<br>gentina “to arbitrate”); Reply Brief 9 (same).&para;<br>An offer must be accepted for a legally binding contract&para;<br>to be formed. And it is an “undeniable principle of the law&para;<br>of contracts, that an offer . . . by one person to another,&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v.

Any qualification of, or departure from, those&para;<br>terms, invalidates the offer.” Eliason v. Henshaw, 4&para;<br>Wheat. 225, 228 (1819) (emphasis added). This principle&para;<br>applies to international arbitration agreements just as it&para;<br>does to domestic commercial contracts. See Dugan 221–&para;<br>222; Salacuse 381; Schreuer, Consent to Arbitration, in&para;<br>The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law&para;<br>830, 836–837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, &amp; C. Schreuer eds.&para;<br>2008).&para;<br>By incorporating the local litigation provision in Article&para;<br>8(1), paragraph 8(2)(a) establishes that provision as a&para;<br>term of Argentina’s unilateral offer to arbitrate. To accept&para;<br>Argentina’s offer, an investor must therefore first litigate&para;<br>its dispute in Argentina’s courts—either to a “final deci­&para;<br>sion” or for 18 months, whichever comes first. Unless the&para;<br>investor does so (or, perhaps, establishes a valid excuse for&para;<br>failing to do so, as discussed below, see infra, at 17), it has&para;<br>not accepted the terms of Argentina’s offer to arbitrate,&para;<br>and thus has not formed an arbitration agreement with&para;<br>Argentina.1&para;<br>Although the majority suggests that the local litigation&para;<br>requirement would not be a “condition of consent” even if&para;<br>the Treaty explicitly called it one, the Court’s holding is&para;<br>limited to treaties that contain no such clear statement.&para;<br>See ante, at 11–13. But there is no reason to think that&para;<br>such a clear statement should be required, for we generally&para;<br>do not require “talismanic words” in treaties. Medellín&para;<br>v. Texas, 552 U.

Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No.&para;<br>ARB/04/14, Award, ¶116 (Dec. 8, 2008).&para;<br>In the face of this authority, the majority quotes a trea­&para;<br>tise for the proposition that “ ‘[a] substantial body of arbi­&para;<br>tral authority from investor-state disputes concludes that&para;<br>compliance with procedural mechanisms in an arbitration&para;<br>agreement (or bilateral investment treaty) is not ordinarily&para;<br>a jurisdictional prerequisite.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting 1 G.&para;<br>Born, International Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009)).&para;<br>But that simply restates the question. The whole issue is&para;<br>whether the local litigation requirement is a mere “proce­&para;<br>dural mechanism” or instead a condition on Argentina’s&para;<br>consent to arbitrate.&para;<br>BG Group concedes that other terms of Article 8(1)&para;<br>constitute conditions on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate,&para;<br>even though they are not expressly labeled as such. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 57 (“You have to be a U. K. investor, you&para;<br>have to have a treaty claim, you have to be suing another&para;<br>party to the treaty. And if those aren’t true, then there is&para;<br>no arbitration agreement” (emphasis added)). The Court&para;<br>does not explain why the only other term—the litigation&para;<br>requirement—should be viewed differently.&para;<br>Nor does the majority’s reading accord with ordinary&para;<br>contract law, which treats language such as the word&para;<br>“after” in Article 8(2)(a)(i) as creating conditions, even&para;<br>though such language may not constitute a “clear state­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ment.” See 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §38:16 (4th&para;<br>ed. 2013). The majority seems to regard the local litiga­&para;<br>tion requirement as a condition precedent to performance&para;<br>of the contract, rather than a condition precedent to for­&para;<br>mation of the contract. Ante, at 8–9; see 13 Lord §§38:4,&para;<br>38:7. But that cannot be. Prior to the fulfillment of&para;<br>the local litigation requirement, there was no contract be­&para;<br>tween Argentina and BG Group to be performed. The&para;<br>Treaty is not such an agreement, since BG Group is of&para;<br>course not a party to the Treaty. Neither the majority nor&para;<br>BG Group contends that the agreement is under Article&para;<br>8(2)(b), the provision that applies “where the Contracting&para;<br>Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party have&para;<br>so agreed.” An arbitration agreement must be formed, and&para;<br>Article 8(2)(a) spells out how an investor may do that: by&para;<br>submitting the dispute to local courts for 18 months or&para;<br>until a decision is rendered.&para;<br>Moreover, the Treaty’s local litigation requirement&para;<br>certainly does not resemble “time limits, notice, laches,&para;<br>estoppel,” or the other kinds of provisions that are typically&para;<br>treated as conditions on the performance of an arbitration agreement, rather than prerequisites to formation.&para;<br>Revised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 §6(c), Comment&para;<br>2, 7 U.

Absent a&para;<br>valid excuse, that means litigating its dispute in the Con­&para;<br>tracting Party’s courts to a “final decision” or, barring&para;<br>that, for at least 18 months.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The nature of the obligations a sovereign incurs in&para;<br>agreeing to arbitrate with a private party confirms that&para;<br>the local litigation requirement is a condition on a signatory&para;<br>country’s consent to arbitrate, and not merely a condition on performance of a pre-existing arbitration agree­&para;<br>ment. There are good reasons for any sovereign to condi­&para;<br>tion its consent to arbitrate disputes on investors’ first&para;<br>litigating their claims in the country’s own courts for a&para;<br>specified period. It is no trifling matter for a sovereign&para;<br>nation to subject itself to suit by private parties; we do not&para;<br>presume that any country—including our own—takes that&para;<br>step lightly. Cf. United States v. Bormes, 568 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (Congress must “unequivocally&para;<br>express[ ]” its intent to waive the sovereign immunity of&para;<br>the United States (quoting United States v. Nordic Village,&para;<br>Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992); internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). But even where a sovereign nation has subjected&para;<br>itself to suit in its own courts, it is quite another thing&para;<br>for it to subject itself to international arbitration. Indeed,&para;<br>“[g]ranting a private party the right to bring an action&para;<br>against a sovereign state in an international tribunal&para;<br>regarding an investment dispute is a revolutionary inno­&para;<br>vation” whose “uniqueness and power should not be over­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>looked.” Salacuse 137. That is so because of both the&para;<br>procedure and substance of investor-state arbitration.&para;<br>Procedurally, paragraph (3) of Article 8 designates the&para;<br>Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on&para;<br>International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) as the default rules&para;<br>governing the arbitration. Those rules authorize the&para;<br>Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration&para;<br>at The Hague to designate an “appointing authority”&para;<br>who—absent agreement by the parties—can select the sole&para;<br>arbitrator (or, in the case of a three-member tribunal, the&para;<br>presiding arbitrator, where the arbitrators nominated by&para;<br>each of the parties cannot agree on a presiding arbitrator).&para;<br>UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Arts. 6, 8–9 (rev. 2010 ed.).&para;<br>The arbitrators, in turn, select the site of the arbitration&para;<br>(again, absent an agreement by the parties) and enjoy&para;<br>broad discretion in conducting the proceedings. Arts. 18,&para;<br>17(1).&para;<br>Substantively, by acquiescing to arbitration, a state&para;<br>permits private adjudicators to review its public policies&para;<br>and effectively annul the authoritative acts of its legisla­&para;<br>ture, executive, and judiciary. See Salacuse 355; G. Van&para;<br>Harten, Investment Treaty Arbitration and Public Law&para;<br>65–67 (2007). Consider the dispute that gave rise to this&para;<br>case: Before the arbitral tribunal, BG Group challenged&para;<br>multiple sovereign acts of the Argentine Government&para;<br>taken after the Argentine economy collapsed in 2001—in&para;<br>particular, Emergency Law 25,561, which converted dollar­&para;<br>denominated tariffs into peso-denominated tariffs at a&para;<br>rate of one Argentine peso to one U. S. dollar; Resolution&para;<br>308/02 and Decree 1090/02, which established a renegotia­&para;<br>tion process for public service contracts; and Decree&para;<br>214/02, which stayed for 180 days injunctions and the&para;<br>execution of final judgments in lawsuits challenging the&para;<br>effects of the Emergency Law. Indeed, in awarding dam­&para;<br>ages to BG Group, the tribunal held that the first three of&para;<br>these enactments violated Article 2 of the Treaty. See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Under&para;<br>Article 8, a Contracting Party grants to private adjudica­&para;<br>tors not necessarily of its own choosing, who can meet&para;<br>literally anywhere in the world, a power it typically re­&para;<br>serves to its own courts, if it grants it at all: the power to&para;<br>sit in judgment on its sovereign acts. Given these stakes,&para;<br>one would expect the United Kingdom and Argentina to&para;<br>have taken particular care in specifying the limited cir­&para;<br>cumstances in which foreign investors can trigger the&para;<br>Treaty’s arbitration process. And that is precisely what&para;<br>they did in Article 8(2)(a), requiring investors to afford a&para;<br>country’s own courts an initial opportunity to review the&para;<br>country’s enactments and assess the country’s compliance&para;<br>with its international obligations. Contrast this with&para;<br>Article 9, which provides for arbitration between the&para;<br>signatory countries of disputes under the Treaty without&para;<br>any preconditions. Argentina and the United Kingdom&para;<br>considered arbitration with particular foreign investors to&para;<br>be different in kind and to require special limitations on&para;<br>its use.&para;<br>The majority regards the local litigation requirement as&para;<br>toothless simply because the Treaty does not require an&para;<br>arbitrator to “give substantive weight to the local court’s&para;<br>determinations on the matters at issue between the par­&para;<br>ties,” ante, at 9; see also ante, at 15–16, but instead pro­&para;<br>vides that “[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and&para;<br>binding on both Parties,” Art. 8(4), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38.&para;<br>While it is true that an arbitrator need not defer to an&para;<br>Argentine court’s judgment in an investor dispute, that&para;<br>does not deprive the litigation requirement of practical&para;<br>import. Most significant, the Treaty provides that an&para;<br>“arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance&para;<br>with . . . the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the&para;<br>dispute.” Art. 8(4), ibid. I doubt that a tribunal would&para;<br>give no weight to an Argentine court’s authoritative con­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>struction of Argentine law, rendered in the same dispute,&para;<br>just because it might not be formally bound to adopt that&para;<br>interpretation.&para;<br>The local litigation requirement can also help to narrow&para;<br>the range of issues that remain in controversy by the time&para;<br>a dispute reaches arbitration. It might even induce the&para;<br>parties to settle along the way. And of course the investor&para;<br>might prevail, which could likewise obviate the need for&para;<br>arbitration. Cf. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185,&para;<br>195 (1969).&para;<br>None of this should be interpreted as defending Argen­&para;<br>tina’s history when it comes to international investment.&para;<br>That history may prompt doubt that requiring an investor&para;<br>to resort to that country’s courts in the first instance will&para;<br>be of any use. But that is not the question. Argentina and&para;<br>the United Kingdom reached agreement on the term at&para;<br>issue. The question can therefore be rephrased as whether&para;<br>it makes sense for either Contracting Party to insist on&para;<br>resort to its courts before being compelled to arbitrate&para;<br>anywhere in the world before arbitrators not of its choos­&para;<br>ing. The foregoing reasons may seem more compelling&para;<br>when viewed apart from the particular episode before us.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Given that the Treaty’s local litigation requirement is a&para;<br>condition on consent to arbitrate, it follows that whether&para;<br>an investor has complied with that requirement is a ques­&para;<br>tion a court must decide de novo, rather than an issue for&para;<br>the arbitrator to decide subject only to the most deferen­&para;<br>tial judicial review. See, e.g., Adams v. Suozzi, 433 F. 3d&para;<br>220, 226–228 (CA2 2005) (holding that compliance with a&para;<br>condition on formation of an arbitration agreement is for a&para;<br>court, rather than an arbitrator, to determine). The logic&para;<br>is simple: Because an arbitrator’s authority depends on&para;<br>the consent of the parties, the arbitrator should not as a&para;<br>rule be able to decide for himself whether the parties have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>in fact consented. Where the consent of the parties is in&para;<br>question, “reference of the gateway dispute to the court&para;<br>avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that&para;<br>they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.” Howsam, 537&para;<br>U. S., at 83–84.&para;<br>This principle is at the core of our arbitration prece­&para;<br>dents. See Granite Rock Co., 561 U. S., at 299 (questions&para;<br>concerning “the formation of the parties’ arbitration&para;<br>agreement” are for a court to decide de novo). The same&para;<br>principle is also embedded in the law of international&para;<br>commercial arbitration. 2 Born 2792 (“[W]here one party&para;<br>denies ever having made an arbitration agreement or&para;<br>challenges the validity of any such agreement, . . . the&para;<br>possibility of de novo judicial review of any jurisdictional&para;<br>award in an annulment action is logically necessary”). See&para;<br>also Restatement (Third) of U. S. Law of International&para;<br>Commercial Arbitration §4–12(d)(1) (Tent. Draft No. 2,&para;<br>Apr. 16, 2012) (“a court determines de novo . . . the exist­&para;<br>ence of the arbitration agreement”).&para;<br>Indeed, the question in this case—whether BG Group&para;<br>accepted the terms of Argentina’s offer to arbitrate—&para;<br>presents an issue of contract formation, which is the&para;<br>starkest form of the question whether the parties have&para;<br>agreed to arbitrate. In Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,&para;<br>Inc., we gave two examples of questions going to consent,&para;<br>which are for courts to decide: “whether the parties are&para;<br>bound by a given arbitration clause” and “whether an&para;<br>arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies&para;<br>to a particular type of controversy.” 537 U. S., at 84. In&para;<br>both examples, there is at least a putative arbitration&para;<br>agreement between the parties to the dispute. The only&para;<br>question is whether the agreement is truly binding or&para;<br>whether it covers the specific dispute. Here, by contrast,&para;<br>the question is whether the arbitration clause in the Treaty&para;<br>between the United Kingdom and Argentina gives rise&para;<br>to an arbitration agreement between Argentina and BG&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Group at all. Cf. ante, at 2 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in&para;<br>part) (“Consent is especially salient in the context of a&para;<br>bilateral investment treaty, where the treaty is not an&para;<br>already agreed-upon arbitration provision between known&para;<br>parties”).&para;<br>The majority never even starts down this path. Instead,&para;<br>it preempts the whole inquiry by concluding that the local&para;<br>litigation requirement is the kind of “procedural precondi­&para;<br>tion” that parties typically expect an arbitrator to enforce.&para;<br>Ante, at 8–9. But as explained, the local litigation re­&para;<br>quirement does not resemble the requirements we have&para;<br>previously deemed presumptively procedural. See supra,&para;<br>at 8. It does not merely regulate the timing of arbitration.&para;<br>Nor does it send the parties to non-judicial forms of dis­&para;<br>pute resolution.&para;<br>More importantly, all of the cases cited by the majority&para;<br>as examples of procedural provisions involve commercial&para;<br>contracts between two private parties. See ante, at 9.&para;<br>None of them—not a single one—involves an agreement&para;<br>between sovereigns or an agreement to which the person&para;<br>seeking to compel arbitration is not even a party. The&para;<br>Treaty, of course, is both of those things.&para;<br>The majority suggests that I am applying “a different&para;<br>kind of analysis” from that governing private commercial&para;<br>contracts, just because what is at issue is a treaty. Ante,&para;<br>at 15. That is not so: The key point, which the majority&para;<br>never addresses, is that there is no completed agreement&para;<br>whatsoever between Argentina and BG Group. An agree­&para;<br>ment must be formed, and whether that has happened&para;<br>is—as it is in the private commercial contract context—an&para;<br>issue for a court to decide. See supra, at 12–13.&para;<br>The distinction between questions concerning consent to&para;<br>arbitrate and mere procedural requirements under an&para;<br>existing arbitration agreement can at times seem elusive.&para;<br>Even the most mundane procedural requirement can be&para;<br>recast as a condition on consent as a matter of technical&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>logic. But it should be clear by now that the Treaty’s local&para;<br>litigation requirement is not a mere formality—not in&para;<br>Buenos Aires, not in London. And while it is true that&para;<br>“parties often submit important matters to arbitration,”&para;<br>ante, at 11, our precedents presume that parties do not&para;<br>submit to arbitration the most important matter of all:&para;<br>whether they are subject to an agreement to arbitrate in&para;<br>the first place.&para;<br>Nor has the majority pointed to evidence that would&para;<br>rebut this presumption by showing that Argentina “ ‘clearly&para;<br>and unmistakably’ ” intended to have an arbitrator en­&para;<br>force the litigation requirement. Howsam, supra, at 83&para;<br>(quoting AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications&para;<br>Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986)). As the majority&para;<br>notes, ante, at 14, the Treaty incorporates certain arbitra­&para;<br>tion rules that, in turn, authorize arbitrators to determine&para;<br>their own jurisdiction over a dispute. See Art. 8(3). But&para;<br>those rules do not operate until a dispute is properly&para;<br>before an arbitral tribunal, and of course the whole ques­&para;<br>tion in this case is whether the dispute between BG Group&para;<br>and Argentina was before the arbitrators, given BG&para;<br>Group’s failure to comply with the 18-month local litiga­&para;<br>tion requirement. As a leading treatise has explained, “[i]f&para;<br>the parties have not validly agreed to any arbitration&para;<br>agreement at all, then they also have necessarily not&para;<br>agreed to institutional arbitration rules.” 1 Born 870. “In&para;<br>these circumstances, provisions in institutional rules&para;<br>cannot confer any [such] authority upon an arbitral tribu­&para;<br>nal.” Ibid.&para;<br>I also see no reason to think that arbitrators enjoy&para;<br>comparative expertise in construing the local litigation&para;<br>requirement. Ante, at 14. It would be one thing if that&para;<br>provision involved the application of the arbitrators’ own&para;<br>rules, cf. Howsam, supra, at 85, or if it were “intertwined”&para;<br>with the merits of the underlying dispute, John Wiley &amp;&para;<br>Sons, 376 U. S., at 557. Neither is true of the litigation&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>requirement. A court can assess compliance with the&para;<br>requirement at least as well as an arbitrator can. Given&para;<br>the structure of Article 8 and the important interests that&para;<br>the litigation requirement protects, it seems clear that the&para;<br>United Kingdom and Argentina thought the same.2&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although the Court of Appeals got there by a slightly&para;<br>different route, it correctly concluded that a court must&para;<br>decide questions concerning the interpretation and appli­&para;<br>cation of the local litigation requirement de novo. 665&para;<br>F. 3d 1363, 1371–1373 (CADC 2012). At the same time,&para;<br>however, the court seems to have simply taken it for&para;<br>granted that, because BG Group did not submit its dispute&para;<br>to the local courts, the arbitral award in BG Group’s favor&para;<br>was invalid. Indeed, the court addressed the issue in a&para;<br>perfunctory paragraph at the end of its opinion and saw&para;<br>“ ‘only one possible outcome’ ”: “that BG Group was re­&para;<br>quired to commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s courts and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “Argentina’s conduct confirms&para;<br>that the local litigation requirement is not a condition on consent, for&para;<br>rather than objecting to arbitration on the ground that there was no&para;<br>binding arbitration agreement to begin with, Argentina actively partic­&para;<br>ipated in the constitution of the arbitral panel and in the proceedings&para;<br>that followed.” Ante, at 4 (opinion concurring in part). But as the&para;<br>arbitral tribunal itself recognized, Argentina did object to the tribunal’s&para;<br>jurisdiction to hear the dispute. App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a, 134a, 143a,&para;<br>161a–163a. And we have held that “merely arguing the arbitrability&para;<br>issue to an arbitrator”—say, by “filing with the arbitrators a written&para;<br>memorandum objecting to the arbitrators’ jurisdiction”—“does not&para;<br>indicate a clear willingness to arbitrate that issue, i.e., a willingness to&para;<br>be effectively bound by the arbitrator’s decision on that point.” First&para;<br>Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 946 (1995). The&para;<br>concurrence contends that Argentina “apparently” argued its jurisdic­&para;<br>tional objection in terms of procedure rather than consent, ante, at 4, n.,&para;<br>but the one piece of evidence cited—a negative inference from the&para;<br>arbitrator’s characterization of Argentina’s argument on a subsidiary&para;<br>issue—hardly suffices to distinguish First Options.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

S. 662, 677 (2010)).&para;<br>That conclusion is not obvious. A leading treatise has&para;<br>indicated that “[i]t is a necessary implication from [a uni­&para;<br>lateral] offer that the offeror, in addition, makes a sub­&para;<br>sidiary offer by which he or she promises to accept a&para;<br>tender of performance.” 1 Lord §5:14, at 1005. On this&para;<br>understanding, an offeree’s failure to comply with an&para;<br>essential condition of the unilateral offer “will not bar an&para;<br>action, if failure to comply with the condition is due to the&para;<br>offeror’s own fault.” Id., at 1005–1006.&para;<br>It would be open to BG Group to argue before the Court&para;<br>of Appeals that this principle was incorporated into Article&para;<br>8(2)(a) as an implicit aspect of Argentina’s unilateral offer&para;<br>to arbitrate. Such an argument would find some support&para;<br>in the background principle of customary international&para;<br>law that a foreign individual injured by a host country&para;<br>must ordinarily exhaust local remedies—unless doing so&para;<br>would be “futile.” See Dugan 347–357. In any event, the&para;<br>issue would be analyzed as one of contract formation, and&para;<br>therefore would be for the court to decide. I would accord­&para;<br>ingly vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and&para;<br>remand the case for such an inquiry.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
