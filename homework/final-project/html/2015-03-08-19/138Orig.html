NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER&para;<br>No. 138, Orig. Argued October 13, 2009—Decided January 20, 2010&para;<br>South Carolina brought this original action seeking an equitable appor&para;<br>tionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River’s (river) waters.&para;<br>The Court referred the matter to a Special Master, together with the&para;<br>motions of three nonstate entities—the Catawba River Water Supply&para;<br>Project (CRWSP), Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy), and&para;<br>the city of Charlotte, N. C.—seeking leave to intervene as parties.&para;<br>South Carolina opposed the motions. After a hearing, the Special&para;<br>Master granted all three motions and, on South Carolina’s request,&para;<br>memorialized her reasoning in a First Interim Report. Among other&para;<br>things, she recognized that New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S. 369,&para;<br>373, sets forth the “appropriate” standard for a nonstate entity’s in&para;<br>tervention in an original action; looked beyond intervention to origi&para;<br>nal actions in which the Court allowed complaining States to name&para;<br>nonstate entities as defendants in order to give that standard con&para;<br>text; “distilled” from the cases a broad rule governing intervention;&para;<br>and applied that rule to each of the proposed intervenors. South&para;<br>Carolina presented exceptions.&para;<br>Held: The CRWSP and Duke Energy have satisfied the appropriate&para;<br>intervention standard, but Charlotte has not. Pp. 6–18.&para;<br>(a) Under New Jersey v. New York, “[a]n intervenor whose state is&para;<br>already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling&para;<br>interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all&para;<br>other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not prop&para;<br>erly represented by the state.” 345 U. S., at 373. That standard ap&para;<br>plies equally well in this case. Although high, the standard is not in&para;<br>surmountable. See, e.g., Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 581. The&para;<br>Court declines to adopt the Special Master’s proposed intervention&para;<br>rule, under which nonstate entities may become parties to original&para;<br>disputes in appropriate and compelling circumstances, such as&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>where, e.g., the nonstate entity is the instrumentality authorized to&para;<br>carry out the wrongful conduct or injury for which the complaining&para;<br>State seeks relief. A compelling reason for allowing citizens to par&para;<br>ticipate in one original action is not necessarily a compelling reason&para;<br>for allowing them to intervene in all original actions. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(b) This Court applies the New Jersey v. New York standard to the&para;<br>proposed intervenors. Pp. 11–18.&para;<br>(1) The CRWSP should be allowed to intervene. It is an unusual&para;<br>bistate entity that is jointly owned and regulated by, and supplies&para;<br>water from the river to, North Carolina’s Union County and South&para;<br>Carolina’s Lancaster County. It has shown a compelling interest in&para;<br>protecting the viability of its operations, which are premised on a fine&para;<br>balance between the joint venture’s two participating counties. The&para;<br>stresses this litigation would place on the CRWSP threaten to upset&para;<br>that balance. Moreover, neither State has sufficient interest in main&para;<br>taining that balance to represent the full scope of the CRWSP’s inter&para;<br>ests. The complaint attributes a portion of the total water transfers&para;<br>alleged to have harmed South Carolina to the CRWSP, but North&para;<br>Carolina cannot represent the joint venture’s interests, since it will&para;<br>likely respond to the complaint’s demand for a greater share of the&para;<br>river’s water by taking the position that downstream users—such as&para;<br>Lancaster County—should receive less water. See, e.g., Colorado v.&para;<br>New Mexico, 459 U. S. 176, 186–187. Any disruption to the CRWSP’s&para;<br>operations would increase—not lessen—the difficulty of achieving a&para;<br>“just and equitable” allocation in this dispute. See Nebraska v. Wyo&para;<br>ming, 325 U. S. 589, 618. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(2) Duke Energy should also be permitted to intervene. It has&para;<br>carried its burden of showing unique and compelling interests: It op&para;<br>erates 11 dams and reservoirs in both States that generate electricity&para;<br>for the region and control the river’s flow; holds a 50-year federal li&para;<br>cense governing its hydroelectric power operations; and is the entity&para;<br>that orchestrated a multistakeholder negotiation process culminating&para;<br>in a Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement (CRA), signed by 70 enti&para;<br>ties from both States, which sets the terms under which Duke Energy&para;<br>has applied to renew its license. These interests will be relevant to&para;<br>the Court’s ultimate decision, since it is likely that any equitable ap&para;<br>portionment of the river will need to take into account the amount of&para;<br>water that Duke Energy needs to sustain its operations. And, there&para;<br>is no other similarly situated entity on the river, setting Duke’s in&para;<br>terests apart from the class of all other citizens of the States. Just as&para;<br>important, Duke Energy has a unique and compelling interest in pro&para;<br>tecting the terms of its license and as the entity that orchestrated the&para;<br>CRA, which represents a consensus regarding the appropriate mini&para;<br>mum continuous flow of river water into South Carolina under a va&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>riety of natural conditions and the conservation measures to be taken&para;<br>during droughts. Moreover, neither State is situated to properly rep&para;<br>resent Duke Energy’s compelling interests. Neither has signed the&para;<br>CRA or expressed an intention to defend its terms, and, in fact, North&para;<br>Carolina intends to seek its modification. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(3) However, because Charlotte’s interest is not sufficiently&para;<br>unique and will be properly represented by North Carolina, the city’s&para;<br>intervention is not required. Charlotte is a North Carolina munici&para;<br>pality, and for purposes of this litigation, its water transfers from the&para;<br>river basin constitute part of that State’s equitable share. While the&para;<br>complaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North Caro&para;<br>lina to carry out a large water transfer from the river basin, the com&para;<br>plaint does not seek relief against Charlotte directly, but, rather,&para;<br>seeks relief against all North Carolina-authorized water transfers in&para;<br>excess of that State’s equitable share. Charlotte, therefore, occupies&para;<br>a class of affected North Carolina water users, and the magnitude of&para;<br>its authorized transfer does not distinguish it in kind from other class&para;<br>members. Nor does Charlotte represent interstate interests that fall&para;<br>on both sides of this dispute, as does the CRWSP. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>Exceptions to Special Master’s First Interim Report overruled in part&para;<br>and sustained in part.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, and BREYER, JJ., joined.

STATE &para;<br>&para;<br>OF NORTH CAROLINA &para;<br>&para;<br>ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER&para;<br>[January 20, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The State of South Carolina brought this original action&para;<br>against the State of North Carolina, seeking an equitable&para;<br>apportionment of the Catawba River. We appointed a&para;<br>Special Master and referred the matter to her, together&para;<br>with the motions of three nonstate entities seeking to&para;<br>intervene in the dispute as parties. South Carolina op­&para;<br>posed the motions. After holding a hearing, the Special&para;<br>Master granted the motions and, upon South Carolina’s&para;<br>request, memorialized the reasons for her decision in a&para;<br>First Interim Report. South Carolina then presented&para;<br>exceptions, and we set the matter for argument.&para;<br>Two of the three proposed intervenors have satisfied the&para;<br>standard for intervention in original actions that we ar­&para;<br>ticulated nearly 60 years ago in New Jersey v. New York,&para;<br>345 U. S. 369 (1953) (per curiam). Accordingly, we over­&para;<br>rule South Carolina’s exceptions with respect to the Ca­&para;<br>tawba River Water Supply Project (hereinafter CRWSP)&para;<br>and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (hereinafter Duke En­&para;<br>ergy), but we sustain South Carolina’s exception with&para;<br>respect to the city of Charlotte, North Carolina (hereinaf­&para;<br>ter Charlotte).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We granted leave for South Carolina to file its complaint&para;<br>in this matter two years ago. South Carolina v. North&para;<br>Carolina, 552 U. S. 804 (2007). The gravamen of the&para;<br>complaint is that North Carolina has authorized upstream&para;<br>transfers of water from the Catawba River basin that&para;<br>exceed North Carolina’s equitable share of the river. It&para;<br>has done so, according to the complaint, pursuant to a&para;<br>North Carolina statute that requires any person seeking&para;<br>to transfer more than 2 million gallons of water per day&para;<br>(mgd) from the Catawba River basin to obtain a permit&para;<br>from the North Carolina Environmental Management&para;<br>Commission.&para;<br>See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §143–&para;<br>215.22L(a)(1) (Lexis 2007); §143–215.22G(1)(h). Through&para;<br>that agency, the complaint alleges, North Carolina has&para;<br>issued at least two such permits, one to Charlotte for the&para;<br>transfer of up to 33 mgd, and one to the North Carolina&para;<br>cities of Concord and Kannapolis for the transfer of 10&para;<br>mgd. In addition, the complaint alleges, North Carolina’s&para;<br>permitting statute “grandfathers” a 5 mgd transfer by the&para;<br>CRWSP, and “implicitly authorize[s]” an unknown number&para;<br>of transfers of less than 2 mgd. Complaint ¶¶18, 21, 22.&para;<br>South Carolina claims that the net effect of these up­&para;<br>stream transfers is to deprive South Carolina of its equi­&para;<br>table share of the Catawba River’s water, particularly&para;<br>during periods of drought or low river flow.&para;<br>South Carolina seeks relief in the form of a decree that&para;<br>equitably apportions the Catawba River between the two&para;<br>States, enjoins North Carolina from authorizing transfers&para;<br>of water from the Catawba River exceeding that State’s&para;<br>equitable share, and declares North Carolina’s permitting&para;<br>statute invalid to the extent it is used to authorize trans­&para;<br>fers of water from the Catawba River that exceed North&para;<br>Carolina’s equitable share. See generally Complaint,&para;<br>Prayer for Relief ¶¶1–3. The complaint does not specify a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>minimum flow of water that would satisfy South Caro­&para;<br>lina’s equitable needs, but it does offer a point of reference.&para;<br>In a recent “multi-stakeholder negotiation process” involv­&para;<br>ing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (hereinaf­&para;<br>ter FERC), Duke Energy, and various groups from both&para;<br>States, it was agreed, according to the complaint, that&para;<br>South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River a&para;<br>continuous flow of water of no less than 1,100 cubic feet&para;<br>per second, or about 711 mgd. Complaint ¶14.&para;<br>This negotiated figure may prove unattainable. Accord­&para;<br>ing to the complaint, natural conditions and periodic&para;<br>fluctuations have caused the Catawba River’s flow to fall&para;<br>below 1,100 cubic feet per second. Duke Energy, which&para;<br>generates hydroelectric power from a series of reservoirs&para;<br>on the Catawba River, developed a model to estimate the&para;<br>river’s flow if the river were not impounded. Id., ¶¶8, 16.&para;<br>The complaint notes that according to Duke Energy’s&para;<br>model, the Catawba River—even in its natural state—&para;<br>often would not deliver into South Carolina a minimum&para;<br>average daily flow of 1,100 cubic feet per second. Id., ¶16;&para;<br>App. to Motion of State of South Carolina for Leave to File&para;<br>Complaint, Complaint, and Brief in Support of its Motion&para;<br>for Leave to File Complaint 18. South Carolina contends&para;<br>that North Carolina’s authorization of large transfers of&para;<br>water from the Catawba River basin has exacerbated&para;<br>these conditions.&para;<br>Shortly after we granted leave to file the complaint, two&para;<br>of the entities named in the complaint—the CRWSP and&para;<br>Duke Energy—filed motions for leave to intervene as&para;<br>parties. The CRWSP sought leave to intervene as a party­&para;<br>defendant, asserting its interest as a “riparian user of the&para;<br>Catawba River” and claiming that this interest was not&para;<br>adequately represented because of the CRWSP’s “inter­&para;<br>state nature.” Motion of Catawba River Water Supply&para;<br>Project for Leave to Intervene and Brief in Support of&para;<br>Motion 8, 9. Specifically, the CRWSP noted that it is a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v.

Id., at 9. Duke En­&para;<br>ergy sought leave to intervene and file an answer, assert­&para;<br>ing an interest as the operator of 11 dams and reservoirs&para;<br>on the Catawba River that control the river’s flow, as the&para;<br>holder of a 50-year license1 governing Duke Energy’s&para;<br>hydroelectric power operations, and as the entity that&para;<br>orchestrated the multistakeholder negotiation process&para;<br>culminating in a Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement&para;<br>(CRA) signed by 70 entities from both States in 2006.&para;<br>Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC’s Motion and Brief in Sup­&para;<br>port of Motion to Intervene and File Answer, and Answer&para;<br>2, 5. This CRA set forth the terms under which Duke&para;<br>Energy has applied to renew its FERC license, id., at 5,&para;<br>and Duke Energy asserted that neither State would repre­&para;<br>sent its “particular amalgam of federal, state and private&para;<br>interests,” id., at 14. South Carolina opposed both mo­&para;<br>tions, and we referred them to the Special Master. 552&para;<br>U. S. 1160 (2008).&para;<br>One month later, a third entity named in the complaint,&para;<br>the city of Charlotte, also sought leave to intervene as a&para;<br>party-defendant. In its brief, Charlotte asserted an inter­&para;<br>est, both as the holder of a permit authorizing the transfer&para;<br>of 33 mgd from the Catawba River basin—the largest&para;<br>single transfer identified in the complaint—and as the&para;<br>potential source of the 10 mgd transfer approved for the&para;<br>cities of Concord and Kannapolis. Motion for Leave to&para;<br>Intervene of City of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Brief&para;<br>in Support of Motion 5, 7.2 Charlotte argued that North&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The license was issued in 1958 to Duke Energy’s predecessor by the&para;<br>Federal Power Commission, a predecessor of the FERC. For conven­&para;<br>ience, we will refer to Duke Energy’s “FERC license” herein.&para;<br>2 Charlotte also asserted an interest in protecting the terms of the&para;<br>CRA, to which Charlotte was a signatory but to which North Carolina,&para;<br>which has conflicting duties under §401 of the Clean Water Act, 86&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Carolina could not represent the city’s interests effectively&para;<br>because the State was duty bound to represent the inter­&para;<br>ests of all North Carolina users of the Catawba River’s&para;<br>water, including users whose interests were not aligned&para;<br>with Charlotte’s. Id., at 17. South Carolina also opposed&para;<br>Charlotte’s motion, and we referred it to the Special Mas­&para;<br>ter. 552 U. S. 1254 (2008).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Special Master held a hearing and issued an order&para;<br>granting all three motions for leave to intervene. At South&para;<br>Carolina’s request, the Special Master set forth her find­&para;<br>ings and decision as a First Interim Report, and it is this&para;<br>Report to which South Carolina now presents exceptions.&para;<br>The Special Master recognized that this Court has&para;<br>exercised jurisdiction over nonstate parties in original&para;<br>actions between two or more States. She also recognized&para;<br>that in New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S. 369, the Court&para;<br>considered the “appropriate standard” for a nonstate&para;<br>entity’s motion to intervene in an original action. First&para;<br>Interim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138,&para;<br>Orig., p. 12 (First Interim Rept.). But in attempting to&para;<br>give context to our standard, she looked beyond interven­&para;<br>tion and considered original actions in which the Court&para;<br>has allowed nonstate entities to be named as defendants&para;<br>by the complaining State. From those examples, the&para;<br>Special Master “distilled the following rule” governing&para;<br>motions to intervene in original actions by nonstate&para;<br>entities:&para;<br>“Although the Court’s original jurisdiction presump­&para;<br>tively is reserved for disputes between sovereign&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Stat. 877, as added, 33 U. S. C. §1341, was not. North Carolina op­&para;<br>posed this argument, and the Special Master did not rely on it in&para;<br>recommending that Charlotte’s motion to intervene should be granted.&para;<br>As Charlotte does not reassert this argument here, we do not consider&para;<br>it.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>states over sovereign matters, nonstate entities may&para;<br>become parties to such original disputes in appropri­&para;<br>ate and compelling circumstances, such as where the&para;<br>nonstate entity is the instrumentality authorized to&para;<br>carry out the wrongful conduct or injury for which the&para;<br>complaining state seeks relief, where the nonstate en­&para;<br>tity has an independent property interest that is di­&para;<br>rectly implicated by the original dispute or is a sub­&para;<br>stantial factor in the dispute, where the nonstate&para;<br>entity otherwise has a ‘direct stake’ in the outcome of&para;<br>the action within the meaning of the Court’s cases&para;<br>discussed above, or where, together with one or more&para;<br>of the above circumstances, the presence of the non­&para;<br>state entity would advance the ‘full exposition’ of the&para;<br>issues.” Id., at 20–21.&para;<br>Applying this broad rule, the Special Master found that&para;<br>each proposed intervenor had a sufficiently compelling&para;<br>interest to justify intervention. The Special Master re­&para;<br>jected South Carolina’s proposal to limit intervention to&para;<br>the remedy phase of this litigation and recommended that&para;<br>this Court grant the motions to intervene.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Participation by nonstate parties in actions arising&para;<br>under our original jurisdiction is not a new development.&para;<br>Article III, §2, of the Constitution expressly contemplates&para;<br>suits “between a State and Citizens of another State” as&para;<br>falling within our original jurisdiction, see, e.g., Georgia v.&para;<br>Brailsford, 2 Dall. 402 (1792), and for more than two&para;<br>centuries the Court has exercised that jurisdiction over&para;<br>nonstate parties in suits between two or more States, see&para;<br>New York v. Connecticut, 4 Dall. 1 (1799); Missouri v.&para;<br>Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 224–225 (1901). Nonstate entities&para;<br>have even participated as parties in disputes between&para;<br>States, such as the one before us now, where the States&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>were seeking equitable apportionment of water resources.&para;<br>See, e.g., Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 608, n. 1&para;<br>(1983); Texas v. New Mexico, 343 U. S. 932 (1952); New&para;<br>Jersey v. City of New York, 279 U. S. 823 (1929) (per cu&para;<br>riam). It is, thus, not a novel proposition to accord party&para;<br>status to a citizen in an original action between States.&para;<br>This Court likewise has granted leave, under appropri­&para;<br>ate circumstances, for nonstate entities to intervene as&para;<br>parties in original actions between States for nearly 90&para;<br>years. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745,&para;<br>n. 21 (1981). In Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 581,&para;<br>598 (1922), a boundary dispute that threatened to erupt in&para;<br>armed hostilities, the Court allowed individual and corpo­&para;<br>rate citizens to intervene to protect their rights in con­&para;<br>tested land. See, e.g., Oklahoma v. Texas, 254 U. S. 609&para;<br>(1920).3 More recently, the Court has allowed a munici­&para;<br>pality to intervene in a sovereign boundary dispute, see&para;<br>Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465, 466 (1976) (per curiam),&para;<br>and has permitted private corporations to intervene in an&para;<br>original action challenging a State’s imposition of a tax&para;<br>that burdened interstate commerce and contravened the&para;<br>Supremacy Clause, see Maryland v. Louisiana, supra, at&para;<br>745, n. 21.&para;<br>In this case, the Special Master crafted a rule of inter­&para;<br>vention that accounts for the full compass of our prece­&para;<br>dents. But a compelling reason for allowing citizens to&para;<br>participate in one original action is not necessarily a com­&para;<br>pelling reason for allowing citizens to intervene in all&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 THE&para;<br>&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE argues against drawing conclusions from the&para;<br>intervention that we allowed in Oklahoma v. Texas, 254 U. S. 609&para;<br>(1920). See post, at 7–8 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part). But the circumstances surrounding that dispute fit&para;<br>the “ ‘model case’ ” for invoking this Court’s original jurisdiction, post, at&para;<br>2, and counsel against inferring from our precedents, as THE CHIEF&para;<br>JUSTICE does with respect to equitable apportionment actions, a rule&para;<br>against nonstate intervention in such “weighty controversies,” ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>original actions. We therefore decline to adopt the Special&para;<br>Master’s proposed rule. As the Special Master acknowl­&para;<br>edged, the Court in New Jersey v. New York, supra, set&para;<br>down the “appropriate standard” for intervention in origi­&para;<br>nal actions by nonstate entities. First Interim Rept. 12.&para;<br>We believe the standard that we applied in that case&para;<br>applies equally well here.4&para;<br>In 1929, the State of New Jersey sued the State of New&para;<br>York and city of New York for their diversion of the Dela­&para;<br>ware River’s headwaters. 345 U. S., at 370. The Court&para;<br>granted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania leave to&para;<br>intervene, and in 1931, entered a decree enjoining certain&para;<br>diversions of water by the State of New York and the city&para;<br>of New York. Id., at 371. In 1952, the city of New York&para;<br>moved to modify the decree, and New Jersey and Pennsyl­&para;<br>vania filed oppositions. After the Court referred the mat­&para;<br>ter to a special master, the city of Philadelphia sought&para;<br>leave to intervene on the basis of its use of the Delaware&para;<br>River’s water. Id., at 371–372.&para;<br>This Court denied Philadelphia leave to intervene.&para;<br>Pennsylvania had intervened pro interesse suo “to protect&para;<br>the rights and interests of Philadelphia and Eastern&para;<br>Pennsylvania in the Delaware River.” Id., at 374; see also&para;<br>New Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S. 336, 342 (1931). In&para;<br>view of Pennsylvania’s participation, the Court wrote that&para;<br>when a State is “a party to a suit involving a matter of&para;<br>sovereign interest,” it is parens patriae and “ ‘must be&para;<br>deemed to represent all [of] its citizens.’ ” 345 U. S., at&para;<br>372–373 (quoting Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U. S. 163, 173–&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Accordingly, we need not decide South Carolina’s first exception to&para;<br>the Special Master’s conclusion that intervention is proper “whenever&para;<br>the movant is the ‘instrumentality’ authorized to engage in conduct&para;<br>alleged to harm the plaintiff State, has an ‘independent property&para;<br>interest’ at issue in the action, or otherwise has a ‘direct stake’ in the&para;<br>outcome of the action.” Exceptions of State of South Carolina to First&para;<br>Interim Report of Special Master and Brief in Support of Exceptions i.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

The Court, thus, set forth the&para;<br>following standard governing intervention in an original&para;<br>action by a nonstate entity:&para;<br>“An intervenor whose state is already a party should&para;<br>have the burden of showing some compelling interest&para;<br>in his own right, apart from his interest in a class&para;<br>with all other citizens and creatures of the state,&para;<br>which interest is not properly represented by the&para;<br>state.” Ibid.&para;<br>On several subsequent occasions the Court has reaffirmed&para;<br>this “general rule.” See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1,&para;<br>21–22 (1995); United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 538&para;<br>(1973) (per curiam); Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 97&para;<br>(1972).&para;<br>We acknowledge that the standard for intervention in&para;<br>original actions by nonstate entities is high—and appro­&para;<br>priately so. Such actions tax the limited resources of this&para;<br>Court by requiring us “awkwardly to play the role of fact­&para;<br>finder” and diverting our attention from our “primary&para;<br>responsibility as an appellate tribunal.” Ohio v. Wyan&para;<br>dotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S. 493, 498 (1971); Mary&para;<br>land v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 762 (1981) (Rehnquist,&para;<br>J., dissenting). In order to ensure that original actions do&para;<br>not assume the “dimensions of ordinary class actions,”&para;<br>New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373, we exercise our&para;<br>original jurisdiction “sparingly” and retain “substantial&para;<br>discretion” to decide whether a particular claim requires&para;<br>“an original forum in this Court,” Mississippi v. Louisiana,&para;<br>506 U. S. 73, 76 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Respect for state sovereignty also calls for a high&para;<br>threshold to intervention by nonstate parties in a sover­&para;<br>eign dispute committed to this Court’s original jurisdic­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion. Under 28 U. S. C. §1251, this Court exercises “origi­&para;<br>nal and exclusive” jurisdiction to resolve controversies&para;<br>between States that, if arising among independent na­&para;<br>tions, “would be settled by treaty or by force.” Kansas v.&para;<br>Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 98 (1907). This Court has de­&para;<br>scribed its original jurisdiction as “delicate and grave,”&para;<br>Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), and has&para;<br>guarded against its use as a forum in which “a state might&para;<br>be judicially impeached on matters of policy by its own&para;<br>subjects,” New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373. In&para;<br>its sovereign capacity, a State represents the interests of&para;<br>its citizens in an original action, the disposition of which&para;<br>binds the citizens. Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at 22;&para;<br>New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 372–373. A respect&para;<br>for sovereign dignity, therefore, counsels in favor of re­&para;<br>straint in allowing nonstate entities to intervene in such&para;<br>disputes. See ibid.; accord, United States v. Texas, 143&para;<br>U. S. 621, 643 (1892) (“[E]xclusive jurisdiction was given&para;<br>to this court, because it best comported with the dignity of&para;<br>a State, that a case in which it was a party should be&para;<br>determined in the highest, rather than in a subordinate&para;<br>judicial tribunal of the nation”).5&para;<br>That the standard for intervention in original actions by&para;<br>nonstate entities is high, however, does not mean that it is&para;<br>insurmountable. Indeed, as the Special Master correctly&para;<br>recognized, our practice long has been to allow such inter­&para;<br>vention in compelling circumstances. See Oklahoma v.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 South Carolina has not invoked the Eleventh Amendment as a basis&para;<br>for opposing intervention. It has noted, however, that the proposed&para;<br>intervenors’ claims are, in effect, against South Carolina, and thus has&para;<br>reserved the right to argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars particu­&para;<br>lar forms of relief sought by the proposed intervenors. As in New Jersey&para;<br>v. New York, 345 U. S. 369, 372 (1953) (per curiam), we express no view&para;<br>whether the Eleventh Amendment is implicated where a nonstate&para;<br>entity seeks to intervene as a defendant in an original action over a&para;<br>State’s objection.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Over the “strong objections” of&para;<br>three States, for example, the Court allowed Indian tribes&para;<br>to intervene in a sovereign dispute concerning the equita­&para;<br>ble apportionment of the Colorado River. Arizona v. Cali&para;<br>fornia, 460 U. S., at 613. The Court did so notwithstand­&para;<br>ing the Tribes’ simultaneous representation by the United&para;<br>States. Id., at 608–609, 612. And in a boundary dispute&para;<br>among Texas, Louisiana, and the United States, the Court&para;<br>allowed the city of Port Arthur, Texas, to intervene for the&para;<br>purpose of protecting its interests in islands in which the&para;<br>United States claimed title. Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S.,&para;<br>at 466; Texas v. Louisiana, 416 U. S. 965 (1974). In both&para;<br>of these examples, the Court found compelling interests&para;<br>that warranted allowing nonstate entities to intervene in&para;<br>original actions in which the intervenors were nominally&para;<br>represented by sovereign parties.&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>Applying the standard of New Jersey v. New York, su&para;<br>pra, here, we conclude that the CRWSP has demonstrated&para;<br>a sufficiently compelling interest that is unlike the inter­&para;<br>ests of other citizens of the States. The CRWSP is an&para;<br>unusual municipal entity, established as a joint venture&para;<br>with the encouragement of regulatory authorities in both&para;<br>States and designed to serve the increasing water needs of&para;<br>Union County, North Carolina, and Lancaster County,&para;<br>South Carolina. It has an advisory board consisting of&para;<br>representatives from both counties, draws its revenues&para;<br>from its bistate sales, and operates infrastructure and&para;<br>assets that are owned by both counties as tenants-in­&para;<br>common. We are told that approximately 100,000 indi­&para;<br>viduals in each State receive their water from the CRWSP&para;<br>and that “roughly half” of the CRWSP’s total withdrawals&para;<br>of water from the Catawba River go to South Carolina&para;<br>consumers.

It is diffi­&para;<br>cult to conceive of a more purely bistate entity.&para;<br>In addition, the CRWSP relies upon authority granted&para;<br>by both States to draw water from the Catawba River and&para;<br>transfer that water from the Catawba River basin. The&para;<br>CRWSP draws all of its water from an intake located&para;<br>below the Lake Wylie dam in South Carolina. South&para;<br>Carolina licensed the CRWSP to withdraw a total of 100&para;<br>mgd from the Catawba River and issued a certificate to&para;<br>the CRWSP in 1989 authorizing up to 20 mgd to be trans­&para;<br>ferred out of the Catawba River basin. Id., at 6–7; Answer&para;<br>to Bill of Complaint ¶21. Lancaster County currently uses&para;<br>approximately 2 mgd of this amount, Union County uses&para;<br>approximately 5 mgd, and the remaining 13 mgd are not&para;<br>used at this time. CRWSP Reply 7. The CRWSP pumps&para;<br>Union County’s allocation across the state border pursu­&para;<br>ant to a parallel certificate issued by North Carolina&para;<br>authorizing a 5 mgd transfer, ibid., and the complaint&para;<br>specifically identifies this transfer as contributing to&para;<br>South Carolina’s harm, Complaint ¶21.&para;<br>Thus, the&para;<br>CRWSP’s activities depend upon authority conferred by&para;<br>both States.&para;<br>On these facts, we think it is clear that the CRWSP has&para;<br>carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in the&para;<br>outcome of this litigation that distinguishes the CRWSP&para;<br>from all other citizens of the party States. See New Jersey&para;<br>v. New York, supra, at 373. Apart from its interest as a&para;<br>user of the Catawba River’s water, the CRWSP has made&para;<br>a $30 million investment in its plant and infrastructure,&para;<br>with each participating county incurring approximately&para;<br>half of this cost as debt. Each county is responsible for&para;<br>one-half of the CRWSP’s cost of operations, and the ven­&para;<br>ture is designed to break even from year to year. Any&para;<br>disruption to the CRWSP’s operations would increase—not&para;<br>lessen—the difficulty of our task in achieving a “just and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>equitable” allocation in this dispute. See Nebraska v.&para;<br>Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 618 (1945). We believe that the&para;<br>CRWSP has shown a compelling interest in protecting the&para;<br>viability of its operations, which are premised on a fine&para;<br>balance between the joint venture’s two participating&para;<br>counties.&para;<br>We are further persuaded that neither State can prop­&para;<br>erly represent the interests of the CRWSP in this litiga­&para;<br>tion. See New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373. The&para;<br>complaint attributes a portion of the total water transfers&para;<br>that have harmed South Carolina to the CRWSP, yet&para;<br>North Carolina expressly states that it “cannot represent&para;<br>the interests of the joint venture.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. A&para;<br>moment’s reflection reveals why this is so. In this dispute,&para;<br>as in all disputes over limited resources, each State maxi­&para;<br>mizes its equitable share of the Catawba River’s water&para;<br>only by arguing that the other State’s equitable share&para;<br>must be reduced. See, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 459&para;<br>U. S. 176, 186–187 (1982). It is thus likely that North&para;<br>Carolina, in response to South Carolina’s demand for a&para;<br>greater share of the Catawba River’s water, will take the&para;<br>position that downstream users—such as Lancaster&para;<br>County6—should receive less water. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>52 (“From North Carolina’s perspective, South Carolina is&para;<br>receiving much more water under this negotiated agree­&para;<br>ment than they could ever hope to achieve in an equitable&para;<br>apportionment action”). The stresses that this litigation&para;<br>would place upon the CRWSP threaten to upset the fine&para;<br>balance on which the joint venture is premised, and nei­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 As a further complication, we are told, Lancaster County has an&para;<br>obligation to provide water service to certain customers in Mecklenburg&para;<br>County, North Carolina. CRWSP Reply 6. Thus, South Carolina may&para;<br>not be interested in protecting all uses of Lancaster County’s share of&para;<br>the CRWSP’s water. This additional intermingling of state interests&para;<br>further supports our conclusion that neither State adequately repre­&para;<br>sents the CRWSP’s inherently bistate interests.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ther State has sufficient interest in maintaining that&para;<br>balance to represent the full scope of the CRWSP’s&para;<br>interests.&para;<br>Accordingly, we believe that the CRWSP should be&para;<br>allowed to intervene to represent its own compelling inter­&para;<br>ests in this litigation. We thus overrule South Carolina’s&para;<br>exception.&para;<br>2&para;<br>We conclude, as well, that Duke Energy has demon­&para;<br>strated powerful interests that likely will shape the out­&para;<br>come of this litigation. To place these interests in context,&para;<br>it is instructive to consider the “flexible” process by which&para;<br>we arrive at a “ ‘just and equitable apportionment’ ” of an&para;<br>interstate stream. Colorado v. New Mexico, supra, at 183.&para;<br>We do not approach the task in formulaic fashion, New&para;<br>Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S., at 343, but we consider “all&para;<br>relevant factors,” including, but not limited to:&para;<br>“ ‘physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive&para;<br>use of water in the several sections of the river, the&para;<br>character and rate of return flows, the extent of estab­&para;<br>lished uses, the availability of storage water, the prac­&para;<br>tical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas,&para;<br>[and] the damage to upstream areas as compared to&para;<br>the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is im­&para;<br>posed on the former.’ ” Colorado v. New Mexico, su&para;<br>pra, at 183 (quoting Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at&para;<br>618).&para;<br>In performing this task, there is no substitute for “ ‘the&para;<br>exercise of an informed judgment,’ ” Colorado v. New&para;<br>Mexico, supra, at 183, and we will not hesitate to seek out&para;<br>the most relevant information from the source best situ­&para;<br>ated to provide it. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S.,&para;<br>at 745, n. 21 (allowing intervention of private pipeline&para;<br>companies “in the interest of a full exposition of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issues”).&para;<br>With these considerations in mind, we turn to Duke&para;<br>Energy’s asserted interests. Duke Energy operates 11&para;<br>dams and reservoirs in both States that generate electric­&para;<br>ity for the region and control the flow of the river. The&para;<br>complaint itself acknowledges the relationship between&para;<br>river flow and Duke Energy’s operations, noting that a&para;<br>severe drought that ended in 2002 forced Duke Energy to&para;<br>“reduce dramatically” its hydroelectric power generation&para;<br>from the Catawba River. Complaint ¶17(c). It is likely&para;<br>that any equitable apportionment of the river will need to&para;<br>take into account the amount of water that Duke Energy&para;<br>needs to sustain its operations and provide electricity to&para;<br>the region, thus giving Duke Energy a strong interest in&para;<br>the outcome of this litigation. See Colorado v. New Mex&para;<br>ico, supra, at 188 (noting the appropriateness of consider­&para;<br>ing “the balance of harm and benefit that might result”&para;<br>from a State’s proposed diversion of a river). There is,&para;<br>moreover, no other similarly situated entity on the Ca­&para;<br>tawba River, setting Duke’s interests apart from the class&para;<br>of all other citizens of the States. See New Jersey v. New&para;<br>York, supra, at 373.&para;<br>Just as important, Duke Energy has a unique and com­&para;<br>pelling interest in protecting the terms of its existing&para;<br>FERC license and the CRA that forms the basis of Duke&para;<br>Energy’s pending renewal application.7 Through its dams,&para;<br>Duke Energy controls the flow of the Catawba River under&para;<br>the terms of its 50-year FERC license, which regulates the&para;<br>very subject matter in dispute: the river’s minimum flow&para;<br>into South Carolina. See Order Issuing License (Major),&para;<br>Duke Power Co., Project No. 2232, 20 F. P. C. 360, 371–372&para;<br>(1958) (Articles 31 and 32). The CRA, likewise, represents&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Duke Energy is operating under a temporary extension of its 50­&para;<br>year FERC license, which expired in 2008, and the CRA represents&para;<br>Duke Energy’s investment in a new 50-year license.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v.

These factors undeniably are&para;<br>relevant to any “just and equitable apportionment” of the&para;<br>Catawba River, see Colorado v. New Mexico, 459 U. S., at&para;<br>183, and we are likely to consider them in reaching our&para;<br>ultimate disposition of this case. Thus, we find that Duke&para;<br>Energy has carried its burden of showing unique and&para;<br>compelling interests.&para;<br>We also have little difficulty in concluding that neither&para;<br>State sufficiently represents these compelling interests.&para;<br>Neither State has signed the CRA or expressed an inten­&para;<br>tion to defend its terms. To the contrary, North Carolina&para;<br>has expressed an intention to seek its modification. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 51–52. Given the importance of Duke Energy’s&para;<br>interests and their relevance to our ultimate decision, we&para;<br>believe these interests should be represented by a party in&para;<br>this action, and we find that neither State is situated to do&para;<br>so properly. We believe that Duke Energy should be&para;<br>permitted to represent its own interests.&para;<br>For these reasons, we agree with the Special Master&para;<br>that Duke Energy should be permitted to intervene, and&para;<br>we overrule South Carolina’s exception in that regard.&para;<br>3&para;<br>We conclude, however, that Charlotte has not carried its&para;<br>burden of showing a sufficient interest for intervention in&para;<br>this action. Charlotte is a municipality of North Carolina,&para;<br>and for purposes of this litigation, its transfers of water&para;<br>from the Catawba River basin constitute part of North&para;<br>Carolina’s equitable share. While it is true that the com­&para;<br>plaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North&para;<br>Carolina to carry out a large transfer of water from the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Catawba River basin, the complaint does not seek relief&para;<br>against Charlotte directly. Rather, the complaint seeks&para;<br>relief against all North Carolina-authorized transfers of&para;<br>water from the Catawba River basin, “past or future,” in&para;<br>excess of North Carolina’s equitable share. Complaint,&para;<br>Prayer for Relief ¶2. Charlotte, therefore, occupies a class&para;<br>of affected North Carolina users of water, and the magni­&para;<br>tude of Charlotte’s authorized transfer does not distin­&para;<br>guish it in kind from other members of the class. See New&para;<br>Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373, and n. (noting that&para;<br>Philadelphia represented half of the Pennsylvania’s citi­&para;<br>zens in the watershed). Nor does Charlotte represent&para;<br>interstate interests that fall on both sides of this dispute,&para;<br>as the CRWSP does, such that the viability of Charlotte’s&para;<br>operations in the face of this litigation is called into ques­&para;<br>tion. Its interest is solely as a user of North Carolina’s&para;<br>share of the Catawba River’s water.&para;<br>Charlotte’s interest falls squarely within the category of&para;<br>interests with respect to which a State must be deemed to&para;<br>represent all of its citizens. As we recognized in New&para;<br>Jersey v. New York, a State’s sovereign interest in ensur­&para;<br>ing an equitable share of an interstate river’s water is&para;<br>precisely the type of interest that the State, as parens&para;<br>patrie, represents on behalf of its citizens. See also United&para;<br>States v. Nevada, 412 U. S., at 539; Nebraska v. Wyoming,&para;<br>325 U. S., at 616. That is why, in New Jersey v. New York,&para;<br>supra, we required that a proposed intervenor show a&para;<br>compelling interest “in his own right,” distinct from the&para;<br>collective interest of “all other citizens and creatures of the&para;<br>state,” whose interest the State presumptively represents&para;<br>in matters of sovereign policy. Id., at 373. We conclude&para;<br>that Charlotte has not carried that burden. Thus, respect&para;<br>for “sovereign dignity” requires us to recognize that North&para;<br>Carolina properly represents Charlotte in this dispute&para;<br>over a matter of uniquely sovereign interest. See ibid.&para;<br>North Carolina’s own statements only reinforce this&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v.

Brief of State of North Carolina in&para;<br>Opposition to Plaintiff’s Exceptions 22. Indeed, in re­&para;<br>sponse to Charlotte’s motion to intervene, North Carolina&para;<br>wrote the following:&para;<br>“[T]he State must represent the interests of every per­&para;<br>son that uses water from the North Carolina portion&para;<br>of the Catawba River basin.

The&para;<br>State has every reason to defend the [transfers] that it&para;<br>has authorized for the benefit of its citizens. The&para;<br>State cannot agree with any implication that because&para;<br>it represents all of the users of water in North Caro­&para;<br>lina it cannot, or will not represent the interests of&para;<br>Charlotte in this litigation initiated by South Caro­&para;<br>lina.” Brief for State of North Carolina in Response to&para;<br>City of Charlotte’s Motion for Leave to Intervene and&para;<br>File Answer 1–2.&para;<br>These statements are consistent with North Carolina’s&para;<br>role as parens patriae, and we see no reason that North&para;<br>Carolina cannot represent Charlotte’s interest in this&para;<br>sovereign dispute.

In&para;<br>determining whether to exercise original jurisdiction, we&para;<br>accordingly focus on “the nature of the interest of the&para;<br>complaining State,” and in particular the “seriousness and&para;<br>dignity” of the claim asserted. Mississippi v. Louisiana,&para;<br>506 U. S. 73, 77 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Original jurisdiction is for the resolution of state claims,&para;<br>not private claims. To invoke that jurisdiction, a State&para;<br>“must, of course, represent an interest of her own and not&para;<br>merely that of her citizens or corporations.” Arkansas v.&para;<br>Texas, 346 U. S. 368, 370 (1953); see Kansas v. Colorado,&para;<br>533 U. S. 1, 8–9 (2001); Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426&para;<br>U. S. 660, 665 (1976) (per curiam) (It is “settled doctrine&para;<br>that a State has standing to sue only when its sovereign or&para;<br>quasi-sovereign interests are implicated and it is not&para;<br>merely litigating as a volunteer the personal claims of its&para;<br>citizens”). And in deciding whether a State meets that&para;<br>requirement, this Court considers whether the State is “in&para;<br>full control of [the] litigation.” Kansas v. Colorado, supra,&para;<br>at 8.&para;<br>The second guiding principle is a practical one: We are&para;<br>not well suited to assume the role of a trial judge. See&para;<br>Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S. 493, 498&para;<br>(1971). We have attempted to address that reality by&para;<br>relying on the services of able special masters, who have&para;<br>become vitally important in allowing us to manage our&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>original docket. But the responsibility for the exercise of&para;<br>this Court’s original jurisdiction remains ours alone under&para;<br>the Constitution.&para;<br>These two considerations—that our original jurisdiction&para;<br>is limited to high claims affecting state sovereignty, and&para;<br>that practical realities limit our ability to act as a trial&para;<br>court—converge in our standard for intervention in origi&para;<br>nal actions. We articulated that standard in New Jersey v.&para;<br>New York, 345 U. S. 369, 373 (1953) (per curiam). There,&para;<br>we denied the city of Philadelphia’s motion for leave to&para;<br>intervene in an action, to which the Commonwealth of&para;<br>Pennsylvania was already a party, involving the appor&para;<br>tionment of the Delaware River. Id., at 373–374. We set&para;<br>out the following test for intervention in an original action:&para;<br>“An intervenor whose state is already a party should have&para;<br>the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own&para;<br>right, apart from his interest in a class with all other&para;<br>citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not&para;<br>properly represented by the state.” Id., at 373.&para;<br>This exacting standard is grounded on a “necessary&para;<br>recognition of sovereign dignity,” id., at 373, under which&para;<br>“the state, when a party to a suit involving a matter of&para;<br>sovereign interest, ‘must be deemed to represent all its&para;<br>citizens,’ ” id., at 372 (quoting Kentucky v. Indiana, 281&para;<br>U. S. 163, 173–174 (1930)). In applying that doctrine to&para;<br>motions to intervene, the New Jersey v. New York test&para;<br>precludes a State from being “judicially impeached on&para;<br>matters of policy by its own subjects,” and prevents the&para;<br>use of the Court’s original jurisdiction to air “intramural&para;<br>dispute[s]” that should be settled in a different forum—&para;<br>namely, within the States. 345 U. S., at 373.&para;<br>The New Jersey v. New York test is also “a working rule&para;<br>for good judicial administration.” Ibid. Without it, “there&para;<br>would be no practical limitation on the number of citizens,&para;<br>as such, who would be entitled to be made parties.” Ibid.&para;<br>Indeed, the Court observed that allowing Philadelphia to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>intervene would have made it difficult to refuse attempts&para;<br>to intervene by other users of water from the Delaware&para;<br>River, including other cities, and even “[l]arge industrial&para;<br>plants.” Ibid. The New Jersey v. New York test, properly&para;<br>applied, provides a much-needed limiting principle that&para;<br>prevents the expansion of our original proceedings “to the&para;<br>dimensions of ordinary class actions,” ibid., or “town&para;<br>meeting lawsuits,” id., at 376 (Jackson, J., dissenting).&para;<br>See also Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., supra, at&para;<br>504; Utah v. United States, 394 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1969) (per&para;<br>curiam).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Applying these principles, this Court has never granted&para;<br>a nonsovereign entity’s motion to intervene in an equitable&para;<br>apportionment action. The reason is straightforward: An&para;<br>interest in water is an interest shared with other citizens,&para;<br>and is properly pressed or defended by the State. And a&para;<br>private entity’s interest in its particular share of the&para;<br>State’s water, once the water is allocated between the&para;<br>States, is an “intramural dispute” to be decided by each&para;<br>State on its own. New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373.&para;<br>The interests of a State’s citizens in the use of water&para;<br>derive entirely from the State’s sovereign interest in the&para;<br>waterway. If the State has no claim to the waters of an&para;<br>interstate river, then its citizens have none either. See&para;<br>Hinderlider v. La Plata River &amp; Cherry Creek Ditch Co.,&para;<br>304 U. S. 92, 102 (1938). We have long recognized, there&para;<br>fore, that the State must be deemed to represent its citi&para;<br>zens’ interests in an equitable apportionment action. See&para;<br>United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 539 (1973) (per&para;<br>curiam) (“For the purposes of dividing the waters of an&para;<br>interstate stream with another State, [a State] has the&para;<br>right, parens patriae, to represent all the nonfederal users&para;<br>in its own State insofar as the share allocated to the other&para;<br>State is concerned”). Precisely because the State repre&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>sents all its citizens in an equitable apportionment action,&para;<br>these citizens have no claim themselves against the other&para;<br>State. They are instead “bound by the result reached&para;<br>through representation by their respective States,” regard&para;<br>less of whether those citizens are parties to the suit.&para;<br>Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1, 22 (1995).&para;<br>This basic principle applies without regard to whether&para;<br>the State agrees with and will advance the particular&para;<br>interest asserted by a specific private entity. The State&para;<br>“ ‘must be deemed to represent all its citizens,’ ” New Jer&para;<br>sey v. New York, supra, at 372 (quoting Kentucky v. Indi&para;<br>ana, supra, at 173–174; emphasis added), not just those&para;<br>who subscribe to the State’s position before this Court.&para;<br>The directive that a State cannot be “judicially impeached&para;<br>on matters of policy by its own subjects,” New Jersey v.&para;<br>New York, supra, at 373, obviously applies to the case in&para;<br>which a subject disagrees with the position of the State.&para;<br>A State’s citizens also need not be made parties to an&para;<br>equitable apportionment action because the Court’s judg&para;<br>ment in such an action does not determine the water&para;<br>rights of any individual citizen. We made that clear long&para;<br>ago in two decisions arising from the same dispute, Wyo&para;<br>ming v. Colorado, 298 U. S. 573 (1936), and Wyoming v.&para;<br>Colorado, 309 U. S. 572 (1940). In those cases, Wyoming&para;<br>sought to enforce this Court’s earlier decree apportioning&para;<br>the Laramie River. See Wyoming v. Colorado, 260 U. S. 1&para;<br>(1922). We held that the decree controlled the allocation&para;<br>of water between Wyoming and Colorado, not within&para;<br>them. As we recognized, our decision apportioning the&para;<br>river did not “withdraw water claims dealt with therein&para;<br>from the operation of local laws relating to their transfer&para;<br>or . . . restrict their utilization in ways not affecting the&para;<br>rights of one State and her claimants as against the other&para;<br>State and her claimants.” 298 U. S., at 584. Thus, al&para;<br>though the decree referred to particular uses of water in&para;<br>Colorado, we held that those individual uses could vary&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>from the terms set out in the decree, so long as the total&para;<br>diversion of water in Colorado was no greater than the&para;<br>decree allowed. See id., at 584–585; 309 U. S., at 579–581.&para;<br>We reiterated the point in Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S.&para;<br>589, 627 (1945), observing that the apportionment of a&para;<br>waterway between the States has only an “indirect effect”&para;<br>on the rights of individuals within the States.&para;<br>All this explains our long history of rejecting attempts&para;<br>by nonsovereign entities to intervene in equitable appor&para;<br>tionment actions. New Jersey v. New York was itself an&para;<br>equitable apportionment suit, and we denied intervention&para;<br>in that case. We have also summarily denied motions to&para;<br>intervene in other water disputes between the States. See&para;<br>Arizona v. California, 514 U. S. 1081 (1995); Arizona v.&para;<br>California, 345 U. S. 914 (1953); Nebraska v. Wyoming,&para;<br>296 U. S. 548 (1935); Wisconsin v. Illinois, 279 U. S. 821&para;<br>(1929). And we have strongly intimated in other decisions&para;<br>(albeit in dictum) that private entities can rarely, if ever,&para;<br>intervene in original actions involving the apportionment&para;<br>of interstate waterways. See United States v. Nevada,&para;<br>supra, at 538 (“[I]ndividual users of water . . . ordinarily&para;<br>would have no right to intervene in an original action in&para;<br>this Court”); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S., at 22 (“We&para;<br>have said on many occasions that water disputes among&para;<br>States may be resolved by compact or decree without the&para;<br>participation of individual claimants”).1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority contends that this dissent reads our precedents to&para;<br>establish “a rule against nonstate intervention” in equitable appor&para;<br>tionment actions. Ante, at 7, n. 3. The number of nonsovereigns that&para;<br>the Court should permit to intervene in water disputes is small—&para;<br>indeed, it was zero until today. But that does not mean that a private&para;<br>entity could not satisfy the New Jersey v. New York test by, for exam&para;<br>ple, asserting water-use rights that are not dependent upon the rights&para;<br>of state parties. A private party (or perhaps a Compact Clause entity)&para;<br>with a federal statutory right to a certain quantity of water might have&para;<br>a compelling interest in an equitable apportionment action that is not&para;<br>fairly represented by the States. The putative intervenors in this case,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The majority contends that the result in this case is not&para;<br>a “new development,” and that its holding is supported by&para;<br>“nearly 90 years” of precedent. Ante, at 6–7. But in sup&para;<br>port of those statements, the majority cites only four&para;<br>decisions in which the Court has granted a motion to&para;<br>intervene in an original suit—and of course none in which&para;<br>this Court granted the motion of a nonsovereign entity to&para;<br>intervene in an equitable apportionment action. The cases&para;<br>the majority cites demonstrate what constitutes a “compel&para;<br>ling interest in [the intervenor’s] own right, apart from his&para;<br>interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of&para;<br>the state.” New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373. But&para;<br>the intervenor interests in those cases were quite different&para;<br>from the general shared interest in water at issue here.&para;<br>Take Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983). There&para;<br>we allowed several Indian Tribes to intervene in a water&para;<br>dispute. Id., at 615. As the Court in that case made clear,&para;<br>however, the Indian Tribes were allowed to intervene&para;<br>because they were sovereign entities. Ibid. The Court&para;<br>distinguished New Jersey v. New York on that very&para;<br>ground. See 460 U. S., at 615, n. 5.&para;<br>The other cases relied upon by the majority are even&para;<br>farther afield. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725&para;<br>(1981); Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465 (1976) (per cu&para;<br>riam); Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574 (1922). None was&para;<br>an equitable apportionment action. Two involved bound&para;<br>ary disputes in which the Court allowed nonsovereign&para;<br>intervenors to claim title to certain parcels of property.&para;<br>See Texas v. Louisiana, supra, at 466 (permitting inter&para;<br>vention by the city of Port Arthur, Texas); Oklahoma v.&para;<br>Texas, supra, at 580–581 (same for private parties). A&para;<br>claim to title in a particular piece of property is quite&para;<br>different from a general interest shared by all citizens in&para;<br>the State’s waters. And it would be particularly inapt to&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>however, do not hold rights of this sort. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>draw general conclusions about intervention from Okla&para;<br>homa v. Texas, in which the Court took the southern half&para;<br>of the Red River into receivership. See 258 U. S., at 580.&para;<br>In subsequently allowing persons to intervene to assert&para;<br>claims to the subject property, the Court relied explicitly&para;<br>on the fact that the receiver had possession and control of&para;<br>the claimed parcels, and “no other court lawfully [could]&para;<br>interfere with or disturb that possession or control.” Id.,&para;<br>at 581.&para;<br>The majority’s reliance on Maryland v. Louisiana is&para;<br>equally unavailing. There, several States challenged the&para;<br>constitutionality of Louisiana’s application of a tax on&para;<br>natural gas that was brought into that State. 451 U. S., at&para;<br>728. In two sentences within a long footnote, the Court&para;<br>mentioned that it was permitting a group of pipeline&para;<br>companies to intervene and challenge the tax. Id., at 745,&para;<br>n. 21. The Court made clear that the pipeline companies&para;<br>were able to intervene in light of the particular circum&para;<br>stances in that case—namely, Louisiana’s tax was “di&para;<br>rectly imposed on the owner of imported gas,” and “the&para;<br>pipelines most often own[ed] the gas.” Ibid. Again, an&para;<br>interest in a tax imposed only on discrete parties is obvi&para;<br>ously different from a general interest shared by all citi&para;<br>zens of the State.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Charlotte, Duke Energy, and CRWSP claim a variety of&para;<br>specific needs for water to justify their intervention. But&para;<br>all those particular needs derive from an interest in the&para;<br>water of the Catawba River. That interest is not exclu&para;<br>sive, but is instead shared “with all other citizens and&para;<br>creatures of the state.” New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S.,&para;<br>at 373. The State’s “citizens and creatures” certainly put&para;<br>the Catawba’s water and flow to different uses—many for&para;<br>drinking water, some for farming or recreation, others for&para;<br>generating power. That does not, however, make their&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>interest in the water itself unique. And it is the respective&para;<br>interests of the States in the water itself that are being&para;<br>litigated in this original action—not the claims of particu&para;<br>lar citizens that they be allowed to put the water to speci&para;<br>fied uses. The latter subject is “an intramural dispute&para;<br>over the distribution of water within the [State],” ibid.,&para;<br>and is not the subject of this original proceeding.&para;<br>The majority recognizes as much with respect to Char&para;<br>lotte, ante, at 16–18, but departs from these principles in&para;<br>granting intervention to Duke Energy and CRWSP. The&para;<br>majority’s reasons for doing so do not withstand scrutiny.&para;<br>The majority initially contends that Duke Energy&para;<br>should be allowed to intervene because it possesses “rele&para;<br>vant information” that we are “likely to consider.” Ante, at&para;<br>14, 16. Nonparties often do, but that is not a “compelling&para;<br>interest” justifying intervention. I have little doubt that&para;<br>Philadelphia possessed pertinent information in New&para;<br>Jersey v. New York, but we did not permit Philadelphia to&para;<br>intervene on that ground. Parties to litigation have ready&para;<br>means of access to relevant information held by nonpar&para;<br>ties, and those nonparties can certainly furnish such&para;<br>information on their own if they consider it in their best&para;<br>interests (through, for example, participation as amici&para;<br>curiae).&para;<br>The majority also states that Duke Energy has compel&para;<br>ling interests in its hydroelectric operations along the&para;<br>river, and in “the amount of water that Duke Energy&para;<br>needs to sustain its operations and provide electricity to&para;<br>the region.” Ante, at 15. These are simply interests in a&para;<br>particular use of water or its flow. Even if Duke Energy&para;<br>uses water for particularly important purposes, its inter&para;<br>ests are no different in kind from the interests of any other&para;<br>entity that relies on water for its commercial operations.&para;<br>Finally, the majority asserts that Duke Energy “has a&para;<br>unique and compelling interest in protecting the terms of&para;<br>its existing [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>(FERC)] license and the [Comprehensive Licensing Agree&para;<br>ment (CRA)] that forms the basis of Duke Energy’s pend&para;<br>ing renewal application.” Ibid. And the majority contends&para;<br>that neither State represents these interests because&para;<br>“[n]either State has signed the CRA or expressed an inten&para;<br>tion to defend its terms,” and because North Carolina has&para;<br>even expressed its intent to challenge the terms of the&para;<br>CRA in this action. Ante, at 16.&para;<br>Again, all this amounts to is an articulation of the rea&para;<br>son Duke Energy asserts a particular interest in the wa&para;<br>ters of the Catawba. Other citizens of North Carolina&para;<br>doubtless have reasons of their own, ones they find as&para;<br>important as Duke Energy believes its to be. Weighing&para;<br>those interests is an “intramural” matter for the State.&para;<br>New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373. In addition, the&para;<br>Federal Government is doubtless familiar with the pend&para;<br>ing FERC proceedings, and it sees no corresponding need&para;<br>for us to grant Duke Energy’s motion to intervene. See&para;<br>Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20, n. 3.&para;<br>As for CRWSP, the Special Master concluded that it&para;<br>should be allowed to intervene, but only because its posi&para;<br>tion was “similar analytically to Charlotte’s.” First In&para;<br>terim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138, Orig.,&para;<br>p. 25. The Court rejects Charlotte’s motion, but nonethe&para;<br>less allows CRWSP to intervene on a ground not relied&para;<br>upon by the Special Master. According to the majority,&para;<br>CRWSP should be allowed to intervene because, as a&para;<br>bistate entity, its full range of interests cannot be repre&para;<br>sented entirely by either North or South Carolina. See&para;<br>ante, at 11–14.&para;<br>CRWSP’s motion arguably presents a different case&para;<br>from that of Duke Energy, one not definitively resolved by&para;<br>this Court in New Jersey v. New York. At the end of the&para;<br>day, however, I agree with the Special Master’s premise—&para;<br>CRWSP’s position is really no different from Charlotte’s. I&para;<br>disagree with her conclusion, of course, because I agree&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>with the Court that Charlotte should not be allowed to&para;<br>intervene.&para;<br>A bistate entity cannot be allowed to intervene merely&para;<br>because it embodies an “intermingling of state interests.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13, n. 6. The same would be true of any bistate&para;<br>entity, or indeed any corporation or individual conducting&para;<br>business in both States. An exception for such cases&para;<br>would certainly swallow the New Jersey v. New York rule.&para;<br>Entities with interests in both States must seek to vindi&para;<br>cate those interests within each State. Bistate entities are&para;<br>not States entitled to invoke our original jurisdiction, and&para;<br>should not be effectively accorded an automatic right to&para;<br>intervene as parties in cases within that jurisdiction.&para;<br>With respect to both Duke Energy and CRWSP, the&para;<br>majority further relies on its conclusion that the States&para;<br>will not “properly represent” the interests of those entities.&para;<br>Ante, at 13; see ante, at 16. If by that the Court means&para;<br>that the States may adopt positions adverse to Duke&para;<br>Energy and CRWSP, that surely cannot be enough. The&para;<br>guiding principle articulated in New Jersey v. New York is&para;<br>“that the state, when a party to a suit involving a matter&para;<br>of sovereign interest, ‘must be deemed to represent all its&para;<br>citizens,’ ” and may not be “judicially impeached on mat&para;<br>ters of policy by its own subjects.” 345 U. S., at 372–373&para;<br>(quoting Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U. S., at 173–174). This&para;<br>case involves a “matter of sovereign interest”—the equita&para;<br>ble apportionment of water—and the States therefore&para;<br>“properly represen[t]” the shared interests in water of “all”&para;<br>their citizens, including Duke Energy and CRWSP. 345&para;<br>U. S., at 372–373. An interest is “not properly repre&para;<br>sented” by a State, id., at 373, when it is not a sovereign&para;<br>interest but instead a parochial one, such as the interests&para;<br>held to justify intervention in the cases on which the&para;<br>majority relies. See supra, at 7–8.&para;<br>The majority also pays little heed to the practical con&para;<br>straints on this Court’s original jurisdiction. It is hard to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>see how the arguments the Court accepts today could not&para;<br>also be pressed by countless other water users in either&para;<br>North or South Carolina. Under the Court’s analysis, I&para;<br>see “no practical limitation on the number of citizens, as&para;<br>such, who would be entitled to be made parties.” New&para;<br>Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373. To the extent interven&para;<br>tion is allowed for some private entities with interests in&para;<br>the water, others who also have an interest will feel com&para;<br>pelled to intervene as well—and we will be hard put to&para;<br>refuse them. See Utah v. United States, 394 U. S., at 95–&para;<br>96 (denying intervention to a corporation that sought to&para;<br>quiet its title to land because, “[i]f [it were] admitted,&para;<br>fairness would require the admission of any of the other&para;<br>120 private landowners who wish to quiet their title . . . ,&para;<br>greatly increasing the complexity of this litigation”). An&para;<br>equitable apportionment action will take on the character&para;<br>istics of an interpleader case, with all those asserting&para;<br>interests in the limited supply of water jostling for their&para;<br>share like animals at a water hole. And we will find our&para;<br>selves in a “quandary whereby we must opt either to pick&para;<br>and choose arbitrarily among similarly situated litigants&para;<br>or to devote truly enormous portions of our energies to&para;<br>[original] matters.” Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.,&para;<br>401 U. S., at 504.&para;<br>Allowing nonsovereign entities to intervene as parties&para;<br>will inevitably prolong the resolution of this and other&para;<br>equitable apportionment actions, which already take&para;<br>considerable time. Intervenors do not come alone—they&para;<br>bring along more issues to decide, more discovery re&para;<br>quests, more exceptions to the recommendations of the&para;<br>Special Master. In particular, intervention makes settling&para;<br>a case more difficult, as a private intervenor has the right&para;<br>to object to a settlement agreement between the States, if&para;<br>not the power to block a settlement altogether. Cf. Fire&para;<br>fighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 529 (1986).&para;<br>And all this for what? The Special Master, and through&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>her the Court, can have the benefit of the views of those&para;<br>seeking to intervene by according them the status of amici&para;<br>curiae. “Where he presents no new questions, a third&para;<br>party can contribute usually most effectively and always&para;<br>most expeditiously by a brief amicus curiae and not by&para;<br>intervention.” Bush v. Viterna, 740 F. 2d 350, 359 (CA5&para;<br>1984) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative&para;<br>to intervention. See 7C C.

And this Court often denies&para;<br>motions to intervene while granting leave to participate as&para;<br>an amicus in original actions generally, see, e.g., Kentucky&para;<br>v. Indiana, 445 U. S. 941 (1980); United States v. Califor&para;<br>nia, 377 U. S. 926 (1964); cf. New Hampshire v. Maine,&para;<br>426 U. S. 363, 365, n. 2 (1976), and in equitable appor&para;<br>tionment actions specifically, see, e.g., Arizona v. Califor&para;<br>nia, 530 U. S. 392, 419, n. 6 (2000); Nebraska v. Wyoming,&para;<br>507 U. S. 584, 589–590 (1993).&para;<br>Nebraska v. Wyoming is particularly instructive on this&para;<br>point. The Court there adopted the recommendation of&para;<br>the Special Master to deny intervention to certain entities.&para;<br>See id., at 589–590; Second Interim Report of Special&para;<br>Master, O. T. 1991, No. 108, Orig., pp. 108–109. The&para;<br>interests of those entities in the water dispute were quite&para;<br>similar to the interests of the entities seeking to intervene&para;<br>here: One operated a powerplant and a reservoir on the&para;<br>Laramie River, and another was a power district seeking&para;<br>to protect its FERC license. See First Interim Report of&para;<br>Special Master, O. T. 1988, No. 108, Orig., pp. 11–14, 9a.&para;<br>While it adopted the Special Master’s recommendation to&para;<br>deny intervention, the Court nonetheless permitted those&para;<br>entities to participate as amici. See 507 U. S., at 589–590;&para;<br>Nebraska v. Wyoming, 502 U. S. 1055 (1992).2 The major&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 No&para;<br>&para;<br>party filed exceptions to the Special Master’s recommendation to&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ity does not explain why that familiar and customary&para;<br>approach might be inadequate in this case.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Our original jurisdiction over actions between States is&para;<br>concerned with disputes so serious that they would be&para;<br>grounds for war if the States were truly sovereign. Texas&para;<br>v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 571, n. 18. A dispute between&para;<br>States over rights to water fits that bill; a squabble among&para;<br>private entities within a State over how to divvy up that&para;<br>State’s share does not. A judgment in an equitable appor&para;<br>tionment action binds the States; it is not binding with&para;<br>respect to particular uses asserted by private entities.&para;<br>Allowing intervention by such entities would vastly com&para;<br>plicate and delay already complicated and lengthy actions.&para;<br>And the benefits private entities might bring can be read&para;<br>ily secured, as has typically been done, by their participa&para;<br>tion as amici curiae.&para;<br>In light of all this, it is difficult to understand why the&para;<br>Court grants nonsovereign entities leave to intervene in&para;<br>this equitable apportionment action, and easy to under&para;<br>stand why the Court has never before done so in such a&para;<br>case.&para;<br>I would grant South Carolina’s exceptions, and deny the&para;<br>motions to intervene.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>deny intervention in Nebraska v. Wyoming. The Special Master later&para;<br>allowed one of the entities, Basin Electric Power Cooperative, to inter&para;<br>vene as a party based on changed circumstances. See Addendum to&para;<br>Reply Brief for Duke Energy 2–5. That decision was never reviewed by&para;<br>the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
