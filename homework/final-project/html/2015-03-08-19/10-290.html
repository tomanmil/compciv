I4I LIMITED PARTNERSHIP &para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–290.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 18, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>In asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action, an&para;<br>alleged infringer must contend with §282 of the Patent Act of 1952&para;<br>(Act), under which “[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and “[t]he&para;<br>burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the party asserting”&para;<br>it. Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read §282 to require a defen&para;<br>dant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder&para;<br>of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.&para;<br>Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which&para;<br>claims an improved method for editing computer documents. After&para;<br>i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that&para;<br>patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the&para;<br>patent was invalid under §102(b)’s on-sale bar, which precludes pat&para;<br>ent protection for any “invention” that was “on sale in this country”&para;<br>more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. The&para;<br>parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent applica&para;<br>tion, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United&para;<br>States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the&para;<br>invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Relying on the undisputed fact that&para;<br>the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark&para;<br>Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Micro&para;<br>soft objected to i4i’s proposed jury instruction that the invalidity de&para;<br>fense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The District&para;<br>Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsoft’s alter&para;<br>native instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence stan&para;<br>dard. The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent&para;<br>and had failed to prove the patent’s invalidity. The Federal Circuit&para;<br>affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of §282.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear&para;<br>and convincing evidence. Pp. 5–20.&para;<br>(a) The Court rejects Microsoft’s contention that a defendant need&para;<br>only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponder&para;<br>ance of the evidence. Where Congress has prescribed the governing&para;<br>standard of proof, its choice generally controls. Steadman v. SEC,&para;<br>450 U. S. 91, 95. Congress has made such a choice here. While §282&para;<br>includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Con&para;<br>gress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the&para;<br>“term . . . comes with a common law meaning.” Safeco Ins. Co. of&para;<br>America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58. Here, by stating that a patent is&para;<br>“presumed valid,” §282, Congress used a term with a settled common&para;<br>law meaning. Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Labora&para;<br>tories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (RCA), is authoritative. There, tracing nearly&para;<br>a century of case law, the Court stated, inter alia, that “there is a&para;<br>presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except&para;<br>by clear and cogent evidence,” id., at 2. Microsoft’s contention that&para;<br>the Court’s pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing stan&para;<br>dard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the ab&para;<br>sence of those qualifications from the Court’s cases. Also unpersua&para;<br>sive is Microsoft’s argument that the Federal Circuit’s interpretation&para;<br>must fail because it renders superfluous §282’s additional statement&para;<br>that “[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the&para;<br>party asserting” it. The canon against superfluity assists only where&para;<br>a competing interpretation gives effect “ ‘to every clause and word of&para;<br>a statute.’ ” Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174. Here, no inter&para;<br>pretation of §282 avoids excess language because, under either of Mi&para;<br>crosoft’s alternative theories—that the presumption only allocates&para;<br>the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of produc&para;<br>tion and persuasion—the presumption itself would be unnecessary in&para;<br>light of §282’s additional statement as to the challenger’s burden.&para;<br>Pp. 5–13.&para;<br>(b) Also rejected is Microsoft’s argument that a preponderance&para;<br>standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder&para;<br>was not before the PTO during the examination process. It is true&para;<br>enough that, in these circumstances, “the rationale underlying the&para;<br>presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the&para;<br>claim—seems much diminished,” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550&para;<br>U. S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the pre&para;<br>sumption. But the question remains whether Congress has specified&para;<br>the applicable standard of proof. As established here today, Congress&para;<br>did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent va&para;<br>lidity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.&para;<br>The Court’s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft’s fluc&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tuating standard of proof. And they do not indicate, even in dicta,&para;<br>that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever&para;<br>apply to an invalidity defense. In fact, the Court indicated to the con&para;<br>trary. See RCA, 293 U. S., at 8. Finally, the Court often applied the&para;<br>heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the rele&para;<br>vant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in cir&para;<br>cumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g., Smith v. Hall,&para;<br>301 U. S. 216, 227, 233. Nothing in §282’s text suggests that Con&para;<br>gress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of&para;<br>proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case. Indeed, had&para;<br>Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where&para;<br>the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it pre&para;<br>sumably would have said so expressly. Those pre-Act cases where&para;<br>various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weak&para;<br>ened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the&para;<br>PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the&para;<br>PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment&para;<br>may lose significant force. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. Consistent&para;<br>with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the&para;<br>evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact&para;<br>when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by&para;<br>clear and convincing evidence. Pp. 14–18.&para;<br>(c) This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the&para;<br>parties’ policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and&para;<br>convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.&para;<br>Congress&para;<br>specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the&para;<br>common-law presumption of patent validity. During the nearly 30&para;<br>years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as the Court does&para;<br>today, Congress has often amended §282 and other patent laws, but&para;<br>apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard&para;<br>of proof. Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit’s interpreta&para;<br>tion in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal&para;<br>Government and without. Accordingly, any recalibration of the stan&para;<br>dard of proof remains in Congress’ hands.

We hold that it&para;<br>does.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S.&para;<br>Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has charged the United&para;<br>States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task&para;<br>of examining patent applications, 35 U. S. C. §2(a)(1), and&para;<br>issuing patents if “it appears that the applicant is entitled&para;<br>to a patent under the law,” §131. Congress has set forth&para;<br>the prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO&para;<br>must evaluate in the examination process. To receive&para;<br>patent protection a claimed invention must, among other&para;<br>things, fall within one of the express categories of pat&para;<br>entable subject matter, §101, and be novel, §102, and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nonobvious, §103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of&para;<br>§102(b) precludes patent protection for any “invention”&para;<br>that was “on sale in this country” more than one year prior&para;<br>to the filing of a patent application. See generally Pfaff v.&para;<br>Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 67–68 (1998). In&para;<br>evaluating whether these and other statutory conditions&para;<br>have been met, PTO examiners must make various factual&para;<br>determinations—for instance, the state of the prior art in&para;<br>the field and the nature of the advancement embodied in&para;<br>the invention. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 153&para;<br>(1999).&para;<br>Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to&para;<br>its holder, including the exclusive right to use the inven&para;<br>tion during the patent’s duration. To enforce that right, a&para;<br>patentee can bring a civil action for infringement if an&para;<br>other person “without authority makes, uses, offers to sell,&para;<br>or sells any patented invention, within the United States.”&para;<br>§271(a); see also §281.&para;<br>Among other defenses under §282 of the Patent Act of&para;<br>1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the inva&para;<br>lidity of the patent—that is, he may attempt to prove that&para;<br>the patent never should have issued in the first place. See&para;<br>§§282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that&para;<br>the claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus&para;<br>that one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.&para;<br>See §282(2); see also §103. “While the ultimate question of&para;<br>patent validity is one of law,” Graham v. John Deere Co.&para;<br>of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 17 (1966) (citing Great Atlantic&para;<br>&amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340&para;<br>U. S. 147, 155 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see post,&para;<br>at 1 (BREYER, J., concurring), the same factual questions&para;<br>underlying the PTO’s original examination of a patent ap&para;<br>plication will also bear on an invalidity defense in an in&para;<br>fringement action. See, e.g., 383 U. S., at 17 (describing&para;<br>the “basic factual inquiries” that form the “background”&para;<br>for evaluating obviousness); Pfaff, 525 U.

Judge&para;<br>Rich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this&para;<br>view for the court in American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co. v.&para;<br>Sowa &amp; Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There,&para;<br>the Federal Circuit held that §282 codified “the existing&para;<br>presumption of validity of patents,” id., at 1359 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)—what, until that point, had&para;<br>been a common-law presumption based on “the basic&para;<br>proposition that a government agency such as the [PTO]&para;<br>was presumed to do its job,” ibid. Relying on this Court’s&para;<br>pre-1952 precedent as to the “force of the presumption,”&para;<br>ibid. (citing Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering&para;<br>Laboratories, Inc., 293 U.

The i4i patent claims an improved&para;<br>method for editing computer documents, which stores a&para;<br>document’s content separately from the metacodes asso&para;<br>ciated with the document’s structure. In 2007, i4i sued&para;<br>petitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement,&para;<br>claiming that Microsoft’s manufacture and sale of certain&para;<br>Microsoft Word products infringed i4i’s patent. In addi&para;<br>tion to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed&para;<br>and sought a declaration that i4i’s patent was invalid and&para;<br>unenforceable.&para;<br>Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that&para;<br>the on-sale bar of §102(b) rendered the patent invalid,&para;<br>pointing to i4i’s prior sale of a software program known as&para;<br>S4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to&para;<br>the filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4&para;<br>in the United States. They presented opposing arguments&para;<br>to the jury, however, as to whether that software embod&para;<br>ied the invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Because the&para;<br>software’s source code had been destroyed years before the&para;<br>commencement of this litigation, the factual dispute&para;<br>turned largely on trial testimony by S4’s two inventors—&para;<br>also the named inventors on the i4i patent—both of whom&para;<br>testified that S4 did not practice the key invention dis&para;<br>closed in the patent.&para;<br>Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was&para;<br>never presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected&para;<br>to i4i’s proposed instruction that it was required to prove&para;<br>its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The question, then, is whether Congress has made&para;<br>such a choice here.&para;<br>As stated, the first paragraph of §282 provides that&para;<br>“[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and “[t]he burden of&para;<br>establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof&para;<br>shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.” Thus, by&para;<br>its express terms, §282 establishes a presumption of pat&para;<br>ent validity, and it provides that a challenger must over&para;<br>come that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense.&para;<br>But, while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of&para;<br>proof, it includes no express articulation of the standard of&para;<br>proof.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 i4i contends that Microsoft forfeited the first argument by failing to&para;<br>raise it until its merits brief in this Court. The argument, however, is&para;<br>within the scope of the question presented, and because we reject it on&para;<br>its merits, we need not decide whether it has been preserved.&para;<br>4 A preliminary word on terminology is in order. As we have said,&para;<br>“[t]he term ‘burden of proof’ is one of the ‘the slipperiest members of&para;<br>the family of legal terms.’ ” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005)&para;<br>(quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed.&para;<br>1999) (alteration omitted)). Historically, the term has encompassed two&para;<br>separate burdens: the “burden of persuasion” (specifying which party&para;<br>loses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the “burden of production”&para;<br>(specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various&para;<br>stages in the litigation). Ibid. Adding more confusion, the term “bur&para;<br>den of proof” has occasionally been used as a synonym for “standard of&para;<br>proof.” E.g., Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991).&para;<br>Here we use “burden of proof” interchangeably with “burden of per&para;<br>suasion” to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to&para;<br>prevail.

Although the “force” of the presumption found&para;<br>“varying expression” in this Court and elsewhere, id., at 7,&para;<br>Justice Cardozo explained, one “common core of thought&para;<br>and truth” unified the decisions:&para;<br>“[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity&para;<br>of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of&para;<br>persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more&para;<br>than a dubious preponderance.

In particular, it relies on KSR&para;<br>Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.

To&para;<br>the contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in&para;<br>RCA, stating that because the heightened standard of&para;<br>proof applied where the evidence before the court was&para;<br>“different” from that considered by the PTO, it applied&para;<br>even more clearly where the evidence was identical. 293&para;<br>U.

Likewise, the Court’s statement that a “dubi&para;<br>ous preponderance” will never suffice to sustain an inva&para;<br>lidity defense, ibid., admitted of no apparent exceptions.&para;<br>Finally, this Court often applied the heightened standard&para;<br>of proof without any mention of whether the relevant&para;<br>prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in&para;<br>circumstances strongly suggesting it had not.

As Judge Rich explained:&para;<br>“When new evidence touching validity of the patent&para;<br>not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal&para;<br>considering it is not faced with having to disagree&para;<br>with the PTO or with deferring to its judgment or&para;<br>with taking its expertise into account.

When it is disputed whether&para;<br>the evidence presented to the jury differs from that evalu&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ated by the PTO, the jury may be instructed to consider&para;<br>that question. In either case, the jury may be instructed&para;<br>to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially&para;<br>new, and if so, to consider that fact when determining&para;<br>whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear&para;<br>and convincing evidence. Cf., e.g., Mendenhall v. Cedarap&para;<br>ids, Inc., 5 F. 3d 1557, 1563–1564 (CA Fed. 1993); see&para;<br>also Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 31–37. Although Microsoft emphasized in&para;<br>its argument to the jury that S4 was never considered by&para;<br>the PTO, it failed to request an instruction along these&para;<br>lines from the District Court. Now, in its reply brief in&para;<br>this Court, Microsoft insists that an instruction of this&para;<br>kind was warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22–23.&para;<br>That argument, however, comes far too late, and we there&para;<br>fore refuse to consider it. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.&para;<br>Jackson, 561 U.

Microsoft and&para;<br>its amici contend that the heightened standard of proof&para;<br>dampens innovation by unduly insulating “bad” patents&para;<br>from invalidity challenges. They point to the high invali&para;<br>dation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protec&para;<br>tion to too many undeserving “inventions.” They claim&para;<br>that inter partes reexamination proceedings before the&para;<br>PTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalida&para;<br>tion (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in&para;<br>such proceedings. They question the deference that the&para;<br>PTO’s expert determinations warrant, in light of the&para;<br>agency’s resources and procedures, which they deem in&para;<br>adequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard&para;<br>of proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.&para;<br>For their part, i4i and its amici, including the United&para;<br>States, contend that the heightened standard of proof&para;<br>properly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury&para;<br>overturns the considered judgment of an expert agency.&para;<br>They claim that the heightened standard of proof is an&para;<br>essential component of the patent “bargain,” see Bonito&para;<br>Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141,&para;<br>150–151 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to dis&para;<br>close their innovations to the public in exchange for patent&para;<br>protection. They disagree with the notion that the patent&para;<br>issuance rate is above the optimal level. They explain that&para;<br>limits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by&para;<br>Congress as to the appropriate degree of interference with&para;<br>patentees’ reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that&para;<br>juries that are properly instructed as to the application of&para;<br>the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often&para;<br>do, find an invalidity defense established.&para;<br>We find ourselves in no position to judge the compara&para;<br>tive force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years,&para;<br>the Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as we do today.&para;<br>During this period, Congress has often amended §282, see,&para;<br>e.g., Pub. L. 104–141, §2, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98–417,&para;<br>§203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft)&para;<br>are aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the&para;<br>standard of proof, see Tr. Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Con&para;<br>gress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns&para;<br>about “bad” patents, including by expanding the reexami&para;<br>nation process to provide for inter partes proceedings. See&para;<br>Optional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of&para;<br>1999, 113 Stat. 1501A–567, codified at 35 U. S. C. §311 et&para;<br>seq. Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in&para;<br>§282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the&para;<br>Federal Circuit’s interpretation of §282 in place despite&para;<br>ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Govern&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment and without.11&para;<br>Congress specified the applicable standard of proof&para;<br>in 1952 when it codified the common-law presumption of&para;<br>patent validity. Since then, it has allowed the Federal&para;<br>Circuit’s correct interpretation of §282 to stand. Any re&para;<br>calibration of the standard of proof remains in its hands.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Federal Circuit is&para;<br>Affirmed.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or&para;<br>decision of this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Com&para;<br>petition and Patent Law and Policy 28 (Oct. 2003), http://www.ftc.gov/&para;<br>os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf (recommending that “legislation be&para;<br>enacted specifying that challenges to the validity of a patent be deter&para;<br>mined based on a preponderance of the evidence”); Alsup, Memo to&para;<br>Congress: A District Judge’s Proposal for Patent Reform, 24 Berkeley&para;<br>Tech.

I write separately be&para;<br>cause, given the technical but important nature of the&para;<br>invalidity question, I believe it worth emphasizing that in&para;<br>this area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of&para;<br>proof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of&para;<br>law. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423&para;<br>(1979). Thus a factfinder must use the “clear and convinc&para;<br>ing” standard where there are disputes about, say, when a&para;<br>product was first sold or whether a prior art reference had&para;<br>been published.&para;<br>Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon fac&para;<br>tual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as&para;<br>given. Do the given facts show that the product was pre&para;<br>viously “in public use”? 35 U. S. C. §102(b). Do they show&para;<br>that the invention was “nove[l]” and that it was “non&para;<br>obvious”? §§102, 103. Do they show that the patent ap&para;<br>plicant described his claims properly? §112. Where the&para;<br>ultimate question of patent validity turns on the correct&para;<br>answer to legal questions—what these subsidiary legal&para;<br>standards mean or how they apply to the facts as given—&para;<br>today’s strict standard of proof has no application. See,&para;<br>e.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1,&para;<br>17 (1966); Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v.

See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating&para;<br>the facts (determined with help of the “clear and convinc&para;<br>ing” standard), courts can thereby assure the proper in&para;<br>terpretation or application of the correct legal standard&para;<br>(without use of the “clear and convincing” standard). By&para;<br>preventing the “clear and convincing” standard from roam&para;<br>ing outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase&para;<br>the likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not re&para;<br>ceive legal protection where none is due.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.
