UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–11328.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 21, 2011—Decided June 16, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>While conducting a routine vehicle stop, police arrested petitioner Wil&para;<br>lie Davis, a passenger, for giving a false name. After handcuffing&para;<br>Davis and securing the scene, the police searched the vehicle and&para;<br>found Davis’s revolver. Davis was then indicted on charges of being a&para;<br>felon in possession of a firearm. In a suppression motion, Davis ac&para;<br>knowledged that the search of the vehicle complied with existing&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting New York v. Belton, 453&para;<br>U. S. 454, but Davis raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to pre&para;<br>serve the issue on appeal. The District Court denied the motion, and&para;<br>Davis was convicted. While his appeal was pending, this Court an&para;<br>nounced, in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___, a new rule governing&para;<br>automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants. The&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit held, under Gant, that the vehicle search at issue&para;<br>violated Davis’s Fourth Amendment rights, but the court declined to&para;<br>suppress the revolver and affirmed Davis’s conviction.&para;<br>Held: Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding&para;<br>appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule. Pp. 6–&para;<br>20.&para;<br>(a) The exclusionary rule’s sole purpose is to deter future Fourth&para;<br>Amendment violations, e.g., Herring v. United States, 555 U. S. 135,&para;<br>141, and its operation is limited to situations in which this purpose is&para;<br>“thought most efficaciously served,” United States v. Calandra, 414&para;<br>U. S. 338, 348. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence bene&para;<br>fits of suppression must outweigh the rule’s heavy costs. Under a&para;<br>line of cases beginning with United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, the&para;<br>result of this cost-benefit analysis turns on the “flagrancy of the po&para;<br>lice misconduct” at issue. Id., at 909, 911. When the police exhibit&para;<br>“deliberate,” “reckless,” or “grossly negligent” disregard for Fourth&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Amendment rights, the benefits of exclusion tend to outweigh the&para;<br>costs. Herring, supra, at 144. But when the police act with an objec&para;<br>tively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful, or&para;<br>when their conduct involves only simple, isolated negligence, the de&para;<br>terrent value of suppression is diminished, and exclusion cannot “pay&para;<br>its way.” See Leon, supra, at 909, 919, 908, n. 6; Herring, supra, at&para;<br>137. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) Although the search in this case turned out to be unconstitu&para;<br>tional under Gant, Davis concedes that the officers’ conduct was in&para;<br>strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable&para;<br>in any way. Under this Court’s exclusionary-rule precedents, the ac&para;<br>knowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis’s claim. Pp. 9–&para;<br>11.&para;<br>(c) The Court is not persuaded by arguments that other considera&para;<br>tions should prevent the good-faith exception from applying in this&para;<br>case. Pp. 11–19.&para;<br>(1) The argument that the availability of the exclusionary rule to&para;<br>enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue,&para;<br>not a good-faith issue, is unpersuasive. This argument erroneously&para;<br>conflates retroactivity with remedy. Because Davis’s conviction had&para;<br>not become final when Gant was announced, Gant applies retroac&para;<br>tively in this case, and Davis may invoke its newly announced rule as&para;<br>a basis for seeking relief. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314,&para;<br>326, 328. But retroactive application of a new rule does not deter&para;<br>mine the question of what remedy the defendant should obtain. See&para;<br>Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S. 79, 83, 84. The remedy of exclusion does&para;<br>not automatically follow from a Fourth Amendment violation, see&para;<br>Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13, and applies only where its “purpose&para;<br>is effectively advanced,” Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 347. The ap&para;<br>plication of the good-faith exception here neither contravenes Griffith&para;<br>nor denies retroactive effect to Gant. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(2) Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument that applying&para;<br>the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding&para;<br>precedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment law by&para;<br>discouraging criminal defendants from attacking precedent. Facili&para;<br>tating the overruling of precedent has never been a relevant consid&para;<br>eration in this Court’s exclusionary-rule cases. In any event, apply&para;<br>ing the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent this&para;<br>Court’s review of Fourth Amendment precedents. If precedent from a&para;<br>federal court of appeals or state court of last resort upholds a particu&para;<br>lar type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions where the&para;<br>question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to&para;<br>litigate the issue, and this Court can grant certiorari in one of those&para;<br>cases. Davis’s claim that this Court’s Fourth Amendment precedents&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>will be effectively insulated from challenge is overstated. In many&para;<br>cases, defendants will test this Court’s Fourth Amendment prece&para;<br>dents by arguing that they are distinguishable. And at most, this ar&para;<br>gument might suggest that, in a future case, the Court could allow a&para;<br>petitioner who secures a decision overruling one of this Court’s prece&para;<br>dents to obtain suppression of evidence in that one case.

UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 16, 2011] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment protects the right to be free&para;<br>from “unreasonable searches and seizures,” but it is silent&para;<br>about how this right is to be enforced. To supplement&para;<br>the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a&para;<br>deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from intro&para;<br>ducing evidence obtained by way of a Fourth Amendment&para;<br>violation. The question here is whether to apply this&para;<br>sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance&para;<br>with binding precedent that is later overruled. Because&para;<br>suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct&para;<br>in these circumstances, and because it would come at a&para;<br>high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold&para;<br>that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance&para;<br>on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the&para;<br>exclusionary rule.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The question presented arises in this case as a result&para;<br>of a shift in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on&para;<br>searches of automobiles incident to arrests of recent&para;<br>occupants.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>Under this Court’s decision in Chimel v. California, 395&para;<br>U. S. 752 (1969), a police officer who makes a lawful arrest&para;<br>may conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee’s person&para;<br>and the area “within his immediate control.” Id., at 763&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). This rule “may be&para;<br>stated clearly enough,” but in the early going after Chimel&para;<br>it proved difficult to apply, particularly in cases that in&para;<br>volved searches “inside [of] automobile[s] after the arrest&para;<br>ees [we]re no longer in [them].” See New York v. Belton,&para;<br>453 U. S. 454, 458–459 (1981). A number of courts up&para;<br>held the constitutionality of vehicle searches that were&para;<br>“substantially contemporaneous” with occupants’ arrests.1&para;<br>Other courts disapproved of automobile searches incident&para;<br>to arrests, at least absent some continuing threat that the&para;<br>arrestee might gain access to the vehicle and “destroy&para;<br>evidence or grab a weapon.”2 In New York v. Belton, this&para;<br>Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. See id., at&para;<br>459–460.&para;<br>In Belton, a police officer conducting a traffic stop law&para;<br>fully arrested four occupants of a vehicle and ordered the&para;<br>arrestees to line up, un-handcuffed, along the side of the&para;<br>thruway. Id., at 456; see Brief for Petitioner in New York&para;<br>v. Belton, O. T. 1980, No. 80–328, p. 3. The officer then&para;<br>searched the vehicle’s passenger compartment and found&para;<br>cocaine inside a jacket that lay on the backseat. Belton,&para;<br>453 U. S., at 456. This Court upheld the search as rea&para;<br>sonable incident to the occupants’ arrests. In an opinion&para;<br>that repeatedly stressed the need for a “straightforward,”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 See e.g., United States v. Sanders, 631 F. 2d 1309, 1313–1314 (CA8&para;<br>1980); United States v. Dixon, 558 F. 2d 919, 922 (CA9 1977); United&para;<br>States v. Frick, 490 F. 2d 666, 668–669 (CA5 1973); Hinkel v. Anchor&para;<br>age, 618 P. 2d 1069, 1069–1071 (Alaska 1980).&para;<br>2 See e.g., United States v. Benson, 631 F. 2d 1336, 1340 (CA8 1980);&para;<br>see also United States v. Rigales, 630 F. 2d 364, 366–367 (CA5 1980);&para;<br>Ulesky v. State, 379 So. 2d 121, 125–126 (Fla. App. 1979).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“workable rule” to guide police conduct, the Court an&para;<br>nounced “that when a policeman has made a lawful custo&para;<br>dial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a&para;<br>contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the pas&para;<br>senger compartment of that automobile.” Id., at 459–460&para;<br>(footnote omitted).&para;<br>For years, Belton was widely understood to have set&para;<br>down a simple, bright-line rule. Numerous courts read&para;<br>the decision to authorize automobile searches incident to&para;<br>arrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the&para;<br>arrestee in any particular case was within reaching dis&para;<br>tance of the vehicle at the time of the search. See Thorn&para;<br>ton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 628 (2004) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Even after the&para;<br>arrestee had stepped out of the vehicle and had been&para;<br>subdued by police, the prevailing understanding was that&para;<br>Belton still authorized a substantially contemporaneous&para;<br>search of the automobile’s passenger compartment.3&para;<br>Not every court, however, agreed with this reading of&para;<br>Belton. In State v. Gant, 216 Ariz. 1, 162 P. 3d 640 (2007),&para;<br>the Arizona Supreme Court considered an automobile&para;<br>search conducted after the vehicle’s occupant had been&para;<br>arrested, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car. The court&para;<br>distinguished Belton as a case in which “four unsecured”&para;<br>arrestees “presented an immediate risk of loss of evidence&para;<br>and an obvious threat to [a] lone officer’s safety.” 216&para;<br>Ariz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643. The court held that where no&para;<br>such “exigencies exis[t]”—where the arrestee has been&para;<br>subdued and the scene secured—the rule of Belton does&para;<br>not apply. 216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643.&para;<br>This Court granted certiorari in Gant, see 552 U. S.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Dorsey, 418 F. 3d 1038, 1041, 1043–1044&para;<br>(CA9 2005) (upholding automobile search conducted after the officer&para;<br>had “handcuffed [the arrestee] and put him in the back of [the] patrol&para;<br>car”); United States v. Barnes, 374 F. 3d 601, 604 (CA8 2004) (same).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1230 (2008), and affirmed in a 5-to-4 decision. Arizona v.&para;<br>Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009). Four of the Justices in the&para;<br>majority agreed with the Arizona Supreme Court that&para;<br>Belton’s holding applies only where “the arrestee is unse&para;<br>cured and within reaching distance of the passenger com&para;<br>partment at the time of the search.” 556 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 10). The four dissenting Justices, by contrast,&para;<br>understood Belton to have explicitly adopted the simple,&para;<br>bright-line rule stated in the Belton Court’s opinion. 556&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 3); see Bel&para;<br>ton, 453 U. S., at 460 (“[W]e hold that when a policeman&para;<br>has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an&para;<br>automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that&para;<br>arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automo&para;<br>bile” (footnote omitted)). To limit Belton to cases involving&para;<br>unsecured arrestees, the dissenters thought, was to over&para;<br>rule the decision’s clear holding. Gant, supra, at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 2–3). JUSTICE SCALIA, who provided the fifth vote&para;<br>to affirm in Gant, agreed with the dissenters’ understand&para;<br>ing of Belton’s holding. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2)&para;<br>(concurring opinion). JUSTICE SCALIA favored a more ex&para;<br>plicit and complete overruling of Belton, but he joined&para;<br>what became the majority opinion to avoid “a 4-to-1-to-4”&para;<br>disposition. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2–4). As a result,&para;<br>the Court adopted a new, two-part rule under which an&para;<br>automobile search incident to a recent occupant’s arrest is&para;<br>constitutional (1) if the arrestee is within reaching dis&para;<br>tance of the vehicle during the search, or (2) if the police&para;<br>have reason to believe that the vehicle contains “evidence&para;<br>relevant to the crime of arrest.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9–&para;<br>10) (citing Thornton, supra, at 632 (SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>in judgment); internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The search at issue in this case took place a full two&para;<br>years before this Court announced its new rule in Gant.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville,&para;<br>Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually&para;<br>resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving&para;<br>while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a&para;<br>false name to police). The police handcuffed both Owens&para;<br>and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of&para;<br>separate patrol cars. The police then searched the pas&para;<br>senger compartment of Owens’s vehicle and found a re&para;<br>volver inside Davis’s jacket pocket.&para;<br>Davis was indicted in the Middle District of Alabama on&para;<br>one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.&para;<br>See 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). In his motion to suppress&para;<br>the revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers’ search&para;<br>fully complied with “existing Eleventh Circuit precedent.”&para;<br>App. 13–15. Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had&para;<br>long read Belton to establish a bright-line rule authorizing&para;<br>substantially contemporaneous vehicle searches incident&para;<br>to arrests of recent occupants. See United States v. Gon&para;<br>zalez, 71 F. 3d 819, 822, 824–827 (CA11 1996) (upholding&para;<br>automobile search conducted after the defendant had been&para;<br>“pulled from the vehicle, handcuffed, laid on the ground,&para;<br>and placed under arrest”). Davis recognized that the Dis&para;<br>trict Court was obligated to follow this precedent, but&para;<br>he raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve “the&para;<br>issue for review” on appeal. App. 15. The District Court&para;<br>denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the fire&para;<br>arms charge.&para;<br>While Davis’s appeal was pending, this Court decided&para;<br>Gant. The Eleventh Circuit, in the opinion below, applied&para;<br>Gant’s new rule and held that the vehicle search incident&para;<br>to Davis’s arrest “violated [his] Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights.” 598 F. 3d 1259, 1263 (CA11 2010). As for&para;<br>whether this constitutional violation warranted suppres&para;<br>sion, the Eleventh Circuit viewed that as a separate issue&para;<br>that turned on “the potential of exclusion to deter wrong&para;<br>ful police conduct.” Id., at 1265 (quoting Herring v. United&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States, 555 U. S. 135, 137 (2009); internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The court concluded that “penalizing the [ar&para;<br>resting] officer” for following binding appellate precedent&para;<br>would do nothing to “dete[r] . . . Fourth Amendment viola&para;<br>tions.” 598 F. 3d, at 1265–1266 (bracketing and internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). It therefore declined to apply&para;<br>the exclusionary rule and affirmed Davis’s conviction. We&para;<br>granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the peo&para;<br>ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and ef&para;<br>fects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The&para;<br>Amendment says nothing about suppressing evidence ob&para;<br>tained in violation of this command. That rule—the&para;<br>exclusionary rule—is a “prudential” doctrine, Pennsyl&para;<br>vania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357,&para;<br>363 (1998), created by this Court to “compel respect for the&para;<br>constitutional guaranty.” Elkins v. United States, 364&para;<br>U. S. 206, 217 (1960); see Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S.&para;<br>383 (1914); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). Exclusion&para;<br>is “not a personal constitutional right,” nor is it designed&para;<br>to “redress the injury” occasioned by an unconstitutional&para;<br>search. Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 486 (1976); see&para;<br>United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454, n. 29 (1976)&para;<br>(exclusionary rule “unsupportable as reparation or com&para;<br>pensatory dispensation to the injured criminal” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)). The rule’s sole purpose, we&para;<br>have repeatedly held, is to deter future Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment violations. E.g., Herring, supra, at 141, and n. 2;&para;<br>United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 909, 921, n. 22&para;<br>(1984); Elkins, supra, at 217 (“calculated to prevent, not to&para;<br>repair”). Our cases have thus limited the rule’s operation&para;<br>to situations in which this purpose is “thought most effica&para;<br>ciously served.” United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338,&para;<br>348 (1974). Where suppression fails to yield “appreciable&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>deterrence,” exclusion is “clearly . . . unwarranted.” Janis,&para;<br>supra, at 454.&para;<br>Real deterrent value is a “necessary condition for exclu&para;<br>sion,” but it is not “a sufficient” one. Hudson v. Michigan,&para;<br>547 U. S. 586, 596 (2006). The analysis must also account&para;<br>for the “substantial social costs” generated by the rule.&para;<br>Leon, supra, at 907. Exclusion exacts a heavy toll on both&para;<br>the judicial system and society at large. Stone, 428 U. S.,&para;<br>at 490–491. It almost always requires courts to ignore&para;<br>reliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or inno&para;<br>cence. Ibid. And its bottom-line effect, in many cases, is&para;<br>to suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the&para;<br>community without punishment. See Herring, supra, at&para;<br>141. Our cases hold that society must swallow this bitter&para;<br>pill when necessary, but only as a “last resort.” Hudson,&para;<br>supra, at 591. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deter&para;<br>rence benefits of suppression must outweigh its heavy&para;<br>costs. See Herring, supra, at 141; Leon, supra, at 910.&para;<br>Admittedly, there was a time when our exclusionary&para;<br>rule cases were not nearly so discriminating in their&para;<br>approach to the doctrine. “Expansive dicta” in several deci&para;<br>sions, see Hudson, supra, at 591, suggested that the rule&para;<br>was a self-executing mandate implicit in the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment itself. See Olmstead v. United States, 277&para;<br>U. S. 438, 462 (1928) (remarking on the “striking outcome&para;<br>of the Weeks case” that “the Fourth Amendment, although&para;<br>not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts,&para;<br>really forbade its introduction”); Mapp, supra, at 655&para;<br>(“[A]ll evidence obtained by searches and seizures in viola&para;<br>tion of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inad&para;<br>missible in a state court”). As late as our 1971 decision in&para;<br>Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U. S.&para;<br>560, 568–569, the Court “treated identification of a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment violation as synonymous with application of&para;<br>the exclusionary rule.” Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13&para;<br>(1995). In time, however, we came to acknowledge the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exclusionary rule for what it undoubtedly is—a “judicially&para;<br>created remedy” of this Court’s own making. Calandra,&para;<br>supra, at 348. We abandoned the old, “reflexive” applica&para;<br>tion of the doctrine, and imposed a more rigorous weighing&para;<br>of its costs and deterrence benefits. Evans, supra, at 13;&para;<br>see, e.g., Calandra, supra; Janis, supra; Stone, supra; INS&para;<br>v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 (1984); United States v.&para;<br>Havens, 446 U. S. 620 (1980). In a line of cases beginning&para;<br>with United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, we also recali&para;<br>brated our cost-benefit analysis in exclusion cases to focus&para;<br>the inquiry on the “flagrancy of the police misconduct” at&para;<br>issue. Id., at 909, 911.&para;<br>The basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the&para;<br>deterrence benefits of exclusion “var[y] with the culpabil&para;<br>ity of the law enforcement conduct” at issue. Herring, 555&para;<br>U. S., at 143. When the police exhibit “deliberate,” “reck&para;<br>less,” or “grossly negligent” disregard for Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment rights, the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and&para;<br>tends to outweigh the resulting costs. Id., at 144. But&para;<br>when the police act with an objectively “reasonable good&para;<br>faith belief” that their conduct is lawful, Leon, supra, at&para;<br>909 (internal quotation marks omitted), or when their&para;<br>conduct involves only simple, “isolated” negligence, Her&para;<br>ring, supra, at 137, the “ ‘deterrence rationale loses much&para;<br>of its force,’ ” and exclusion cannot “pay its way.” See&para;<br>Leon, supra, at 919, 908, n. 6 (quoting United States v.&para;<br>Peltier, 422 U. S. 531, 539 (1975)).&para;<br>The Court has over time applied this “good-faith” excep&para;<br>tion across a range of cases.

The error in&para;<br>such a case rests with the issuing magistrate, not the&para;<br>police officer, and “punish[ing] the errors of judges” is not&para;<br>the office of the exclusionary rule.

Id., at 349–&para;<br>350 (“legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of&para;<br>the rule”). In Arizona v.

Id., at 14. Most recently, in Herring v. United&para;<br>States, 555 U. S. 135, we extended Evans in a case where&para;<br>police employees erred in maintaining records in a war&para;<br>rant database. “[I]solated,” “nonrecurring” police negli&para;<br>gence, we determined, lacks the culpability required to&para;<br>justify the harsh sanction of exclusion. 555 U. S., at 137,&para;<br>144.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The question in this case is whether to apply the exclu&para;<br>sionary rule when the police conduct a search in objec&para;<br>tively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.&para;<br>At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet&para;<br>decided Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit had interpreted our decision in New York v. Belton,&para;<br>453 U. S. 454, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing&para;<br>the search of a vehicle’s passenger compartment incident&para;<br>to a recent occupant’s arrest. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d, at 825.&para;<br>The search incident to Davis’s arrest in this case followed&para;<br>the Eleventh Circuit’s Gonzalez precedent to the letter.&para;<br>Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional&para;<br>under Gant, all agree that the officers’ conduct was in&para;<br>strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was&para;<br>not culpable in any way. See Brief for Petitioner 49 (“sup&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pression” in this case would “impl[y] no assignment of&para;<br>blame”).&para;<br>Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowl&para;<br>edged absence of police culpability dooms Davis’s claim.&para;<br>Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion&para;<br>only when they are deliberate enough to yield “mean&para;<br>ingfu[l]” deterrence, and culpable enough to be “worth the&para;<br>price paid by the justice system.” Herring, 555 U. S., at&para;<br>144. The conduct of the officers here was neither of these&para;<br>things. The officers who conducted the search did not&para;<br>violate Davis’s Fourth Amendment rights deliberately,&para;<br>recklessly, or with gross negligence. See ibid. Nor does&para;<br>this case involve any “recurring or systemic negligence” on&para;<br>the part of law enforcement. Ibid. The police acted in&para;<br>strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behav&para;<br>ior was not wrongful. Unless the exclusionary rule is to&para;<br>become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application&para;<br>in this case.&para;<br>Indeed, in 27 years of practice under Leon’s good-faith&para;<br>exception, we have “never applied” the exclusionary rule to&para;<br>suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable,&para;<br>innocent police conduct. Herring, supra, at 144. If the&para;<br>police in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in&para;<br>conducting their search, see Leon, supra, or on an errone&para;<br>ous warrant record in a government database, Herring,&para;<br>supra, the exclusionary rule would not apply. And if&para;<br>Congress or the Alabama Legislature had enacted a stat&para;<br>ute codifying the precise holding of the Eleventh Circuit’s&para;<br>decision in Gonzalez,4 we would swiftly conclude that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Cf.

We are not persuaded.&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>The principal argument of both the dissent and Davis is&para;<br>that the exclusionary rule’s availability to enforce new&para;<br>Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, see&para;<br>Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), not a good-faith&para;<br>issue. They contend that applying the good-faith excep&para;<br>tion where police have relied on overruled precedent effec&para;<br>tively revives the discarded retroactivity regime of Linklet&para;<br>ter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). See post, at 2–5.&para;<br>In Linkletter, we held that the retroactive effect of a new&para;<br>constitutional rule of criminal procedure should be deter&para;<br>mined on a case-by-case weighing of interests. For each&para;<br>new rule, Linkletter required courts to consider a three&para;<br>factor balancing test that looked to the “purpose” of the&para;<br>new rule, “reliance” on the old rule by law enforcement&para;<br>and others, and the effect retroactivity would have “on&para;<br>the administration of justice.” 381 U. S., at 636. After&para;<br>“weigh[ing] the merits and demerits in each case,” courts&para;<br>decided whether and to what extent a new rule should be&para;<br>given retroactive effect. Id., at 629. In Linkletter itself,&para;<br>the balance of interests prompted this Court to conclude&para;<br>that Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643—which incorporated the&para;<br>exclusionary rule against the States—should not apply&para;<br>retroactively to cases already final on direct review. 381&para;<br>U. S., at 639–640. The next year, we extended Linkletter&para;<br>to retroactivity determinations in cases on direct review.&para;<br>See Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sistent, coherent way. Individual applications of the&para;<br>standard “produced strikingly divergent results,” see Dan&para;<br>forth v. Minnesota, 552 U.

Justice Harlan in particular, who had endorsed&para;<br>the Linkletter standard early on, offered a strong critique&para;<br>in which he argued that “basic judicial” norms required&para;<br>full retroactive application of new rules to all cases still&para;<br>subject to direct review. 394 U.

See post, at 2;&para;<br>Reply Brief for Petitioner 3–7. We think this argument&para;<br>conflates what are two distinct doctrines.&para;<br>Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with&para;<br>whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available&para;<br>on direct review as a potential ground for relief. Retroac&para;<br>tive application under Griffith lifts what would otherwise&para;<br>be a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the govern&para;<br>ment’s violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.&para;<br>See Danforth, supra, at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may&para;<br>“make more sense to speak in terms of the ‘redressability’&para;<br>of violations of new rules, rather than the ‘retroactivity’ of&para;<br>such new rules”). Retroactive application does not, how&para;<br>ever, determine what “appropriate remedy” (if any) the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>defendant should obtain. See Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S.&para;<br>79, 84 (1994) (noting that it “does not necessarily follow”&para;<br>from retroactive application of a new rule that the defen&para;<br>dant will “gain . . . relief”). Remedy is a separate, analyti&para;<br>cally distinct issue. Cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.&para;<br>Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 189 (1990) (plurality opinion) (“[T]he&para;<br>Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with&para;<br>remedial principles”). As a result, the retroactive applica&para;<br>tion of a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law&para;<br>raises the question whether a suppression remedy applies;&para;<br>it does not answer that question. See Leon, 468 U. S., at&para;<br>906 (“Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately&para;<br>imposed in a particular case . . . is ‘an issue separate from&para;<br>the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the&para;<br>party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police&para;<br>conduct’ ”).&para;<br>When this Court announced its decision in Gant, Davis’s&para;<br>conviction had not yet become final on direct review. Gant&para;<br>therefore applies retroactively to this case. Davis may&para;<br>invoke its newly announced rule of substantive Fourth&para;<br>Amendment law as a basis for seeking relief. See Griffith,&para;<br>supra, at 326, 328. The question, then, becomes one of&para;<br>remedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the&para;<br>exclusionary rule. But exclusion of evidence does not&para;<br>automatically follow from the fact that a Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment violation occurred. See Evans, 514 U. S., at 13–14.&para;<br>The remedy is subject to exceptions and applies only&para;<br>where its “purpose is effectively advanced.” Krull, 480&para;<br>U. S., at 347.&para;<br>The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of&para;<br>the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit&para;<br>its availability in cases involving new Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rules. Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the&para;<br>dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery&para;<br>exception were applicable in this case. See post, at 3;&para;<br>Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (“Doctrines such as inevitable&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The good-faith exception, however, is no less an&para;<br>established limit on the remedy of exclusion than is inevi&para;<br>table discovery. Its application here neither contravenes&para;<br>Griffith nor denies retroactive effect to Gant.5&para;<br>It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of&para;<br>Linkletter, the Court’s decisions on the “retroactivity prob&para;<br>lem in the context of the exclusionary rule” did take&para;<br>into account whether “law enforcement officers reasonably&para;<br>believed in good faith” that their conduct was in compli&para;<br>ance with governing law. Peltier, 422 U. S., at 535–537.&para;<br>As a matter of retroactivity analysis, that approach is no&para;<br>longer applicable. See Griffith, 479 U. S. 314. It does not&para;<br>follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is&para;<br>irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the&para;<br>exclusionary rule. When this Court adopted the good-faith&para;<br>exception in Leon, the Court’s opinion explicitly relied on&para;<br>Peltier and imported its reasoning into the good-faith&para;<br>inquiry. See 468 U. S., at 918–919. That reasonable&para;<br>reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity&para;<br>cases does not make it any less relevant under our Leon&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent argues that the good-faith exception is “unlike . . . inevi&para;<br>table discovery” because the former applies in all cases where the police&para;<br>reasonably rely on binding precedent, while the latter “applies only&para;<br>upon occasion.” Post, at 3. We fail to see how this distinction makes&para;<br>any difference. The same could be said—indeed, the same was said—of&para;<br>searches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes. See Krull, 480&para;<br>U. S., at 368–369 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (arguing that result in&para;<br>Krull was inconsistent with Griffith). When this Court strikes down a&para;<br>statute on Fourth Amendment grounds, the good-faith exception may&para;<br>prevent the exclusionary rule from applying “in every case pending&para;<br>when [the statute] is overturned.” Post, at 3. This result does not&para;<br>make the Court’s newly announced rule of Fourth Amendment law any&para;<br>less retroactive. It simply limits the applicability of a suppression&para;<br>remedy. See Krull, supra, at 354–355, n. 11.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>line of cases.6&para;<br>B&para;<br>Davis also contends that applying the good-faith ex&para;<br>ception to searches conducted in reliance on binding pre&para;<br>cedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment&para;<br>law. With no possibility of suppression, criminal defen&para;<br>dants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request&para;<br>that courts overrule precedent.7&para;<br>1&para;<br>This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern&para;<br>understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule. We&para;<br>have never held that facilitating the overruling of prece&para;<br>dent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule&para;<br>case. Rather, we have said time and again that the sole&para;<br>purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by&para;<br>law enforcement. See, e.g., Sheppard, 468 U. S., at 990&para;<br>(“ ‘adopted to deter unlawful searches by police’ ”); Evans,&para;<br>supra, at 14 (“historically designed as a means of deterring&para;<br>police misconduct”).&para;<br>We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the&para;<br>focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpa&para;<br>ble police conduct. In Leon, for example, we made clear&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Nor&para;<br>&para;<br>does United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537 (1982), foreclose&para;<br>application of the good-faith exception in cases involving changing law.&para;<br>Johnson distinguished Peltier and held that all Fourth Amendment&para;<br>cases should be retroactive on direct review so long as the new decision&para;<br>is not a “clear break” from prior precedent. 457 U. S., at 562. Johnson&para;<br>had no occasion to opine on the good-faith exception to the exclusionary&para;<br>rule, which we adopted two years later in Leon.&para;<br>7 Davis also asserts that a good-faith rule would permit “new Fourth&para;<br>Amendment decisions to be applied only prospectively,” thus amounting&para;<br>to “a regime of rule-creation by advisory opinion.” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>23, 25. For reasons discussed in connection with Davis’s argument that&para;<br>application of the good-faith exception here would revive the Linkletter&para;<br>regime, this argument conflates the question of retroactivity with the&para;<br>question of remedy.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that “the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police&para;<br>misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.”&para;<br>468 U. S., at 916; see id., at 918 (“If exclusion of evidence&para;<br>obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant&para;<br>is to have any deterrent effect . . . it must alter the behav&para;<br>ior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of&para;<br>their departments”). Krull too noted that “legislators, like&para;<br>judicial officers, are not the focus” of the exclusionary rule.&para;<br>480 U. S., at 350. And in Evans, we said that the exclu&para;<br>sionary rule was aimed at deterring “police misconduct,&para;<br>not mistakes by court employees.” 514 U. S., at 14. These&para;<br>cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be&para;<br>modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of cul&para;<br>pable law-enforcement conduct.&para;<br>2&para;<br>And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in&para;<br>this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of&para;<br>prior Fourth Amendment precedents. In most instances,&para;<br>as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will&para;<br>be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Su&para;<br>preme Court. But a good-faith exception for objectively&para;<br>reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent&para;<br>review and correction of such decisions. This Court re&para;<br>views criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of&para;<br>Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of&para;<br>Columbia Court of Appeals. If one or even many of these&para;<br>courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defen&para;<br>dants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open&para;<br>will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the&para;<br>issue. This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de&para;<br>velopment of Fourth Amendment law will in no way be&para;<br>stunted.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The dissent does not dispute this point, but it claims that the good&para;<br>faith exception will prevent us from “rely[ing] upon lower courts to&para;<br>work out Fourth Amendment differences among themselves.” Post, at&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Davis argues that Fourth Amendment precedents of this&para;<br>Court will be effectively insulated from challenge under a&para;<br>good-faith exception for reliance on appellate precedent.&para;<br>But this argument is overblown. For one thing, it is im&para;<br>portant to keep in mind that this argument applies to an&para;<br>exceedingly small set of cases. Decisions overruling this&para;<br>Court’s Fourth Amendment precedents are rare. Indeed,&para;<br>it has been more than 40 years since the Court last&para;<br>handed down a decision of the type to which Davis refers.&para;<br>Chimel v. California, 395 U.

And even in those&para;<br>cases, Davis points out that no fewer than eight separate&para;<br>doctrines may preclude a defendant who successfully&para;<br>challenges an existing precedent from getting any relief.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 50. Moreover, as a practical matter,&para;<br>defense counsel in many cases will test this Court’s Fourth&para;<br>Amendment precedents in the same way that Belton was&para;<br>tested in Gant—by arguing that the precedent is distin&para;<br>guishable. See Brief for Respondent in Arizona v. Gant,&para;<br>O. T. 2008, No. 07–542, pp. 22–29.9&para;<br>At most, Davis’s argument might suggest that—to&para;<br>prevent Fourth Amendment law from becoming ossified—&para;<br>the petitioner in a case that results in the overruling of&para;<br>one of this Court’s Fourth Amendment precedents should&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5. If that is correct, then today’s holding may well lead to more circuit&para;<br>splits in Fourth Amendment cases and a fuller docket of Fourth&para;<br>Amendment cases in this Court. See this Court’s Rule 10. Such a state&para;<br>of affairs is unlikely to result in ossification of Fourth Amendment&para;<br>doctrine.&para;<br>9 Where the search at issue is conducted in accordance with a munici&para;<br>pal “policy” or “custom,” Fourth Amendment precedents may also be&para;<br>challenged, without the obstacle of the good-faith exception or qualified&para;<br>immunity, in civil suits against municipalities.

It is a “judicially created”&para;<br>sanction, Calandra, 414 U. S., at 348, specifically designed&para;<br>as a “windfall” remedy to deter future Fourth Amendment&para;<br>violations. See Stone, supra, at 490. The good-faith excep&para;<br>tion is a judicially created exception to this judicially&para;<br>created rule. Therefore, in a future case, we could, if&para;<br>necessary, recognize a limited exception to the good-faith&para;<br>exception for a defendant who obtains a judgment over&para;<br>ruling one of our Fourth Amendment precedents.

Rev. 929, 952–953 (1965)&para;<br>(“[T]he same authority that empowered the Court to sup&para;<br>plement the amendment by the exclusionary rule a hun&para;<br>dred and twenty-five years after its adoption, likewise&para;<br>allows it to modify that rule as the lessons of experience&para;<br>may teach” (internal quotation marks and footnotes&para;<br>omitted)).10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III&para;<br>standing to challenge an existing Fourth Amendment precedent if the&para;<br>good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant&para;<br>from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that&para;<br>precedent. This argument confuses weakness on the merits with&para;<br>absence of Article III standing. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S.&para;<br>605, 624 (1989) (standing does not “ ‘depen[d] on the merits of [a&para;<br>claim]’ ”). And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.&para;<br>In many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8),&para;<br>defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to&para;<br>the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not&para;<br>fall within the scope of the precedent.&para;<br>In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to&para;<br>challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that&para;<br>provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.&para;<br>As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428&para;<br>U.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>But this is not such a case. Davis did not secure a deci&para;<br>sion overturning a Supreme Court precedent; the police in&para;<br>his case reasonably relied on binding Circuit precedent.&para;<br>See United States v. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d 819. That sort of&para;<br>blameless police conduct, we hold, comes within the good&para;<br>faith exception and is not properly subject to the exclu&para;<br>sionary rule.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>It is one thing for the criminal “to go free because the&para;<br>constable has blundered.” People v.

It is quite&para;<br>another to set the criminal free because the constable has&para;<br>scrupulously adhered to governing law.

The&para;<br>Court does not address this issue. In my view, whether an&para;<br>officer’s conduct can be characterized as “culpable” is not&para;<br>itself dispositive.

Rather, an officer’s culpability is relevant because&para;<br>it may inform the overarching inquiry whether exclusion&para;<br>would result in appreciable deterrence. See ante, at 8&para;<br>(“The basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the&para;<br>deterrence benefits of exclusion var[y] with the culpability&para;<br>of the law enforcement conduct at issue” (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted; alteration in original)); see also, e.g.,&para;<br>Herring, 555 U.

Gant, 556 U. S. ___, this Court&para;<br>held that a police search of an automobile without a war&para;<br>rant violates the Fourth Amendment if the police have pre&para;<br>viously removed the automobile’s occupants and placed&para;<br>them securely in a squad car. The present case involves&para;<br>these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal&para;<br>when this Court decided Gant. Because Gant represents a&para;<br>“shift” in the Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,&para;<br>ante, at 1, we must decide whether and how Gant’s new&para;<br>rule applies here.&para;<br>I&para;<br>I agree with the Court about whether Gant’s new rule&para;<br>applies. It does apply. Between 1965, when the Court&para;<br>decided Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, and 1987,&para;<br>when it decided Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, that&para;<br>conclusion would have been more difficult to reach. Under&para;<br>Linkletter, the Court determined a new rule’s retroactivity&para;<br>by looking to several different factors, including whether&para;<br>the new rule represented a “clear break” with the past and&para;<br>the degree of “reliance by law enforcement authorities on&para;<br>the old standards.” Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244,&para;<br>248–249 (1969) (internal quotation marks omitted) (also&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>citing “the purpose to be served by the new standards”&para;<br>and “the effect on the administration of justice” as factors&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)). And the Court would&para;<br>often not apply the new rule to identical cases still pend&para;<br>ing on appeal. See ibid.&para;<br>After 22 years of struggling with its Linkletter approach,&para;<br>however, the Court decided in Griffith that Linkletter&para;<br>had proved unfair and unworkable. It then substituted a&para;<br>clearer approach, stating that “a new rule for the conduct&para;<br>of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all&para;<br>cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet&para;<br>final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule&para;<br>constitutes a ‘clear break’ with the past.” 479 U. S., at&para;<br>328. The Court today, following Griffith, concludes that&para;<br>Gant’s new rule applies here. And to that extent I agree&para;<br>with its decision.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court goes on, however, to decide how Gant’s new&para;<br>rule will apply. And here it adds a fatal twist. While&para;<br>conceding that, like the search in Gant, this search vio&para;<br>lated the Fourth Amendment, it holds that, unlike Gant,&para;<br>this defendant is not entitled to a remedy. That is be&para;<br>cause the Court finds a new “good faith” exception which&para;<br>prevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally&para;<br>seized evidence. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383&para;<br>(1914); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). Leaving Davis&para;<br>with a right but not a remedy, the Court “keep[s] the word&para;<br>of promise to our ear” but “break[s] it to our hope.”&para;<br>A&para;<br>At this point I can no longer agree with the Court. A&para;<br>new “good faith” exception and this Court’s retroactivity&para;<br>decisions are incompatible. For one thing, the Court’s&para;<br>distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and&para;<br>runs counter to precedent. To determine that a new rule&para;<br>is retroactive is to determine that, at least in the normal&para;<br>case, there is a remedy. As we have previously said, the&para;<br>“source of a ‘new rule’ is the Constitution itself, not any&para;<br>judicial power to create new rules of law”; hence, “[w]hat&para;<br>we are actually determining when we assess the ‘retroac&para;<br>tivity’ of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly&para;<br>announced right, but whether a violation of the right that&para;<br>occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will&para;<br>entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.” Dan&para;<br>forth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 271 (2008). The Court’s&para;<br>“good faith” exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a&para;<br>remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates&para;<br>“a categorical bar to obtaining redress” in every case pend&para;<br>ing when a precedent is overturned. Ante, at 13–14.&para;<br>For another thing, the Court’s holding re-creates the&para;<br>very problems that led the Court to abandon Linkletter’s&para;<br>approach to retroactivity in favor of Griffith’s. One such&para;<br>problem concerns workability. The Court says that its&para;<br>exception applies where there is “objectively reasonable”&para;<br>police “reliance on binding appellate precedent.” Ante, at&para;<br>1, 19. But to apply the term “binding appellate precedent”&para;<br>often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.&para;<br>Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-Gant precedent&para;<br>in the Eleventh Circuit. But future litigants will be less&para;<br>forthcoming. Ante, at 18. Indeed, those litigants will now&para;<br>have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit&para;<br>precedent was not “binding” lest they find relief foreclosed&para;<br>even if they win their constitutional claim.&para;<br>At the same time, Fourth Amendment precedents fre&para;<br>quently require courts to “slosh” their “way through the&para;<br>factbound morass of ‘reasonableness.’ ” Scott v. Harris,&para;<br>550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007). Suppose an officer’s conduct is&para;<br>consistent with the language of a Fourth Amendment rule&para;<br>that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>distinguishable facts? Suppose the case creating the rele&para;<br>vant precedent did not directly announce any general&para;<br>rule but involved highly analogous facts? What about a&para;<br>rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendant’s&para;<br>jurisdiction, had previously accepted? What rules can be&para;<br>developed for determining when, where, and how these&para;<br>different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as rele&para;<br>vant “binding precedent”? The Linkletter-like result is&para;<br>likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.&para;<br>See Williams v. United States, 401 U. S. 646, 676 (1971)&para;<br>(opinion of Harlan, J.) (describing trying to follow Linklet&para;<br>ter decisions as “almost as difficult” as trying to follow “the&para;<br>tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended&para;<br>victim”).&para;<br>Another such problem concerns fairness. Today’s hold&para;<br>ing, like that in Linkletter, “violates basic norms of con&para;<br>stitutional adjudication.” Griffith, supra, at 322. It treats&para;<br>the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way&para;<br>while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases&para;<br>are pending on appeal in a different way. See ante, at 18–&para;<br>19. Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong&para;<br>when he said:&para;<br>“We cannot release criminals from jail merely because&para;<br>we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to&para;<br>announce a constitutional doctrine] . . . . Simply fish&para;<br>ing one case from the stream of appellate review, us&para;<br>ing it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional&para;<br>standards, and then permitting a stream of similar&para;<br>cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new&para;<br>rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our&para;<br>ordinary] model of judicial review.” Williams, supra,&para;<br>at 679.&para;<br>And in Griffith, the Court “embraced to a significant ex&para;<br>tent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice&para;<br>Harlan.” 479 U. S., at 322.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un&para;<br>fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even&para;<br>to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a&para;<br>“new rule.” But that approach would make matters worse.&para;<br>What would then happen in the lower courts? How would&para;<br>courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their&para;<br>prior decisions when other circuits’ cases lead them to&para;<br>believe those decisions may be wrong? Why would a de&para;<br>fendant seek to overturn any such decision? After all, if&para;<br>the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if&para;<br>the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he&para;<br>loses (on relief). See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 301&para;<br>(1967). To what extent then could this Court rely upon&para;<br>lower courts to work out Fourth Amendment differences&para;<br>among themselves—through circuit reconsideration of a&para;<br>precedent that other circuits have criticized? See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 23, n. 1 (1995) (GINSBURG, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Perhaps more important, the Court’s rationale for creat&para;<br>ing its new “good faith” exception threatens to undermine&para;<br>well-settled Fourth Amendment law. The Court correctly&para;<br>says that pre-Gant Eleventh Circuit precedent had held&para;<br>that a Gant-type search was constitutional; hence the&para;<br>police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent,&para;<br>was “innocent.” Ante, at 10. But the Court then finds this&para;<br>fact sufficient to create a new “good faith” exception to the&para;<br>exclusionary rule. It reasons that the “sole purpose” of the&para;<br>exclusionary rule “is to deter future Fourth Amendment&para;<br>violations,” ante, at 6. The “deterrence benefits of exclu&para;<br>sion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement&para;<br>conduct at issue,” ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>brackets omitted). Those benefits are sufficient to jus&para;<br>tify exclusion where “police exhibit deliberate, reckless,&para;<br>or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rights,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But&para;<br>those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the&para;<br>police act with “simple, isolated negligence” or an “objec&para;<br>tively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is&para;<br>lawful,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>If the Court means what it says, what will happen to the&para;<br>exclusionary rule, a rule that the Court adopted nearly a&para;<br>century ago for federal courts, Weeks v. United States, 232&para;<br>U. S. 383, and made applicable to state courts a half cen&para;<br>tury ago through the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v.&para;<br>Ohio, 367 U. S. 643? The Court has thought of that rule&para;<br>not as punishment for the individual officer or as repara&para;<br>tion for the individual defendant but more generally as&para;<br>an effective way to secure enforcement of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment’s commands. Weeks, supra, at 393 (without&para;<br>the exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment would be “of&para;<br>no value,” and “might as well be stricken from the Consti&para;<br>tution”). This Court has deviated from the “suppression”&para;<br>norm in the name of “good faith” only a handful of times&para;<br>and in limited, atypical circumstances: where a magistrate&para;<br>has erroneously issued a warrant, United States v. Leon,&para;<br>468 U. S. 897 (1984); where a database has erroneously&para;<br>informed police that they have a warrant, Arizona v.&para;<br>Evans, 514 U. S. 1 (1995), Herring v. United States, 555&para;<br>U. S. 135 (2009); and where an unconstitutional statute&para;<br>purported to authorize the search, Illinois v. Krull, 480&para;<br>U. S. 340 (1987). See Herring, supra, at 142 (“good faith”&para;<br>exception inaptly named).&para;<br>The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is&para;<br>understandable. Defendants frequently move to suppress&para;<br>evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. In many, per&para;<br>haps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment applied to the particular factual&para;<br>circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good&para;<br>faith. Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances,&para;<br>courts will find that the police were wrong. And, unless&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previ&para;<br>ously noted, courts have required the suppression of the&para;<br>evidence seized. 1 W.

See Valdes, Frequency and Success: An Em&para;<br>pirical Study of Criminal Law Defenses, Federal Constitu&para;<br>tional Evidentiary Claims, and Plea Negotiations, 153&para;<br>U. Pa. L. Rev. 1709, 1728 (2005) (suppression motions are&para;<br>filed in approximately 7% of criminal cases; approximately&para;<br>12% of suppression motions are successful); LaFave, su&para;<br>pra, at 64 (“Surely many more Fourth Amendment viola&para;<br>tions result from carelessness than from intentional con&para;<br>stitutional violations”); Stewart, The Road to Mapp v.&para;<br>Ohio and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future&para;<br>of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83&para;<br>Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1389 (1983) (“[T]he vast majority of&para;<br>fourth amendment violations . . . [are] motivated by com&para;<br>mendable zeal, not condemnable malice”).&para;<br>But an officer who conducts a search that he believes&para;<br>complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately&para;<br>turns out, falls just outside the Fourth Amendment’s&para;<br>bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows&para;<br>erroneous “binding precedent.” Nor is an officer more&para;<br>culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive&para;<br>rather than “binding,” where it only describes how to treat&para;<br>roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not&para;<br>exist. Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it&para;<br>would place determinative weight upon the culpability of&para;<br>an individual officer’s conduct, and if it would apply the&para;<br>exclusionary rule only where a Fourth Amendment viola&para;<br>tion was “deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,” then&para;<br>the “good faith” exception will swallow the exclusionary&para;<br>rule. Indeed, our broad dicta in Herring—dicta the Court&para;<br>repeats and expands upon today—may already be leading&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DAVIS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lower courts in this direction. See United States v.

And&para;<br>since the exclusionary rule is often the only sanction avail&para;<br>able for a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment would no longer protect ordinary Americans&para;<br>from “unreasonable searches and seizures.” See Wolf v.&para;<br>Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 41 (1949) (Murphy, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)) (In&para;<br>many circumstances, “there is but one alternative to the&para;<br>rule of exclusion. That is no sanction at all”); Herring,&para;<br>supra, at 152 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (the exclusionary&para;<br>rule is “an essential auxiliary” to the Fourth Amendment).&para;<br>It would become a watered-down Fourth Amendment,&para;<br>offering its protection against only those searches and sei&para;<br>zures that are egregiously unreasonable.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In sum, I fear that the Court’s opinion will undermine&para;<br>the exclusionary rule. And I believe that the Court&para;<br>wrongly departs from Griffith regardless. Instead I would&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>follow Griffith, apply Gant’s rule retroactively to this&para;<br>case, and require suppression of the evidence. Such an ap&para;<br>proach is consistent with our precedent, and it would&para;<br>indeed affect no more than “an exceedingly small set of&para;<br>cases.” Ante, at 18.&para;<br>For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
