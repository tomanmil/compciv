S. C. §2254(d), unless the claim’s adjudication resulted in a decision that was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by&para;<br>[this] Court,” §2254(d)(1), or “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court&para;<br>proceeding,” §2254(d)(2).&para;<br>A California jury convicted respondent Williams of first-degree&para;<br>murder. On direct appeal to the California Court of Appeal, she&para;<br>claimed that the trial court’s questioning and dismissal of a juror&para;<br>during deliberations violated both the Sixth Amendment and California law. In holding that the juror had been properly dismissed for&para;<br>bias, the California Court of Appeal quoted the definition of “impartiality” from United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 145–146, but it did&para;<br>not expressly acknowledge that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment&para;<br>issue. The State Supreme Court remanded for further consideration&para;<br>in light of its intervening Cleveland decision, which held that a trial&para;<br>court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a juror who appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the evidence. Reaffirming its prior decision on remand, the State Court of&para;<br>Appeal discussed Cleveland, again quoted Wood, and failed to expressly acknowledge that Williams had raised a federal claim.&para;<br>When Williams later sought federal habeas relief, the District&para;<br>Court applied §2254’s deferential standard of review for claims adjudicated on the merits and denied relief. But the Ninth Circuit concluded that the State Court of Appeal had not considered Williams’&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Sixth Amendment claim. The court then reviewed that claim de novo&para;<br>and held that the questioning and dismissal of the juror violated the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. For purposes of §2254(d), when a state court rules against a defendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendant’s claims but&para;<br>does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court&para;<br>must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(a) This conclusion follows logically from Harrington v. Richter,&para;<br>562 U. S. ___. There, the Court held that when a state court issues&para;<br>an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims&para;<br>raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant&para;<br>subsequently presses in federal habeas, the federal habeas court&para;<br>must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.&para;<br>Though Richter concerned a state-court order that did not address&para;<br>any of the defendant’s claims, there is no sound reason not to apply&para;<br>its presumption when a state-court opinion addresses some but not&para;<br>all of those claims. Federal habeas courts should not assume that&para;<br>any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked because state&para;<br>courts do not uniformly discuss separately every claim referenced by&para;<br>a defendant. In fact, they frequently take a different course. They&para;<br>may view a line of state precedent as fully incorporating a related&para;<br>federal constitutional right, may not regard a fleeting reference to a&para;<br>provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as sufficient to raise a federal claim, or may simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion. Pp. 7−10.&para;<br>(b) Petitioner’s argument for an irrebuttable presumption goes&para;<br>too far. Certainly, if a state standard subsumes the federal standard,&para;<br>the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the&para;<br>merits. See Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8. But where, e.g., the state&para;<br>standard is less protective or the federal precedent was mentioned in&para;<br>passing, the presumption may be rebutted—either by a habeas petitioner (to show that the federal court should consider the claim de&para;<br>novo) or by the State (to show that the federal claim should be regarded as procedurally defaulted). See Coleman v. Thompson, 501&para;<br>U. S. 722, 739. An irrebuttable presumption that state courts never&para;<br>overlook federal claims would sometimes be wrong. It would also improperly excise §2254(d)’s on-the-merits requirement, for a claim that&para;<br>is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence has not been evaluated&para;<br>on the merits. The experience of the lower federal courts shows that&para;<br>allowing federal habeas petitioners to rebut the presumption will not&para;<br>prompt an unduly burdensome flood of litigation. Pp. 10−13.&para;<br>2. Applying the rebuttable presumption of merits adjudication&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>here, the Ninth Circuit erred by finding that the State Court of Appeal overlooked Williams’ Sixth Amendment claim. Several facts&para;<br>lead to that conclusion. Most important is that the court discussed&para;<br>Cleveland, a State Supreme Court case that in turn examined three&para;<br>Federal Court of Appeals cases concerning the Sixth Amendment implications of discharging holdout jurors. Though Cleveland refused to&para;<br>follow those cases, the views of the federal courts of appeals do not&para;<br>bind a State Supreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional&para;<br>question. Regardless of whether a California court would consider&para;<br>Williams’ state-law and Sixth Amendment claims to be coextensive,&para;<br>their similarity makes it unlikely that the State Court of Appeal decided one while overlooking the other. The State Court of Appeal’s&para;<br>quotation of Wood, supra, at 145−146, further confirms that it was&para;<br>well aware that the juror’s questioning and dismissal implicated federal law. Williams’ litigation strategy also supports this result. She&para;<br>treated her state and federal claims as interchangeable, so it is not&para;<br>surprising that the state courts did as well. Notably, Williams neither petitioned the State Court of Appeal for rehearing nor argued in&para;<br>subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had&para;<br>failed to adjudicate her Sixth Amendment claim on the merits.&para;<br>Pp. 13−16.&para;<br>646 F. 3d 626, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §2254(d). Specifically, if a&para;<br>claim has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court,”&para;<br>a federal habeas court may not grant relief unless “the&para;<br>adjudication of the claim—&para;<br>“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States; or&para;<br>“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Because the requirements of §2254(d) are difficult to&para;<br>meet, it is important whether a federal claim was “adjudicated on the merits in State court,” and this case requires&para;<br>us to ascertain the meaning of the adjudication-on-the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>merits requirement. This issue arises when a defendant&para;<br>convicted in state court attempts to raise a federal claim,&para;<br>either on direct appeal or in a collateral state proceeding,&para;<br>and a state court rules against the defendant and issues&para;<br>an opinion that addresses some issues but does not expressly address the federal claim in question. If this&para;<br>defendant then raises the same claim in a federal habeas&para;<br>proceeding, should the federal court regard the claim as&para;<br>having been adjudicated on the merits by the state court&para;<br>and apply deference under §2254(d)? Or may the federal&para;<br>court assume that the state court simply overlooked the&para;<br>federal claim and proceed to adjudicate the claim de novo,&para;<br>the course taken by the Court of Appeals in the case at&para;<br>hand?&para;<br>We believe that the answer to this question follows&para;<br>logically from our decision in Harrington v. Richter, 562&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2011). In that case, we held that, when a state&para;<br>court issues an order that summarily rejects without&para;<br>discussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including&para;<br>a federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in&para;<br>a federal habeas proceeding, the federal habeas court must&para;<br>presume (subject to rebuttal) that the federal claim was&para;<br>adjudicated on the merits. We see no reason why this&para;<br>same rule should not apply when the state court addresses&para;<br>some of the claims raised by a defendant but not a claim&para;<br>that is later raised in a federal habeas proceeding.&para;<br>Applying this rule in the present case, we hold that the&para;<br>federal claim at issue here (a Sixth Amendment jury trial&para;<br>claim) must be presumed to have been adjudicated on the&para;<br>merits by the California courts, that this presumption was&para;<br>not adequately rebutted, that the restrictive standard of&para;<br>review set out in §2254(d)(2) consequently applies, and&para;<br>that under that standard respondent is not entitled to&para;<br>habeas relief. We therefore reverse the judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In October 1993, respondent Tara Williams took two&para;<br>of her friends for a drive in southern California with&para;<br>the objective of committing a robbery. They stopped at a&para;<br>liquor store in Long Beach, and while Williams waited in&para;<br>the getaway car, her friends stole money from the cash&para;<br>register and fatally shot the store’s owner. Williams then&para;<br>drove one of her friends away, and the other fled on foot.&para;<br>Williams avoided capture for five years but was ultimately&para;<br>apprehended and charged with first-degree murder.&para;<br>At trial, Williams admitted that she had served as the&para;<br>getaway driver but claimed that she did not know that her&para;<br>friends were going to rob the liquor store at the particular&para;<br>time in question. Instead, she contended that the three&para;<br>friends had agreed only that they would “case” the store&para;<br>and would possibly return later that evening to rob it. The&para;<br>State countered that, regardless of whether Williams&para;<br>knew precisely when and where the robbery was to take&para;<br>place, she had agreed to help commit a robbery and that&para;<br>this was sufficient to provide the predicate for felony&para;<br>murder under California law.&para;<br>After deliberating for about three hours, the jury foreman sent the judge two notes. The first note asked the&para;<br>following question:&para;<br>“ ‘Is it legally permissible for a juror to interpret . . .&para;<br>the jury instructions to mean that the conspiracy&para;<br>should involve a plan to commit a specific robbery rather than a general plan to commit robberies in the&para;<br>future?’ ” Tr. 1247.&para;<br>The second note stated:&para;<br>“I wish to inform you that we have one juror who . . .&para;<br>has expressed an intention to disregard the law . . .&para;<br>and . . . has expressed concern relative to the severity&para;<br>of the charge (first degree murder).” Id., at 1246.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The judge told the jury that the answer to the question in&para;<br>the first note was “no.” Id., at 1249. Then, over Williams’&para;<br>objection, the judge briefly questioned the foreman outside&para;<br>the presence of the rest of the jury about the second note.&para;<br>The foreman said that he thought the judge’s answer to&para;<br>the first note might resolve the problem, and the judge&para;<br>instructed the jury to resume its deliberations.&para;<br>The next morning, once again over Williams’ objection,&para;<br>the judge decided to inquire further about the foreman’s&para;<br>second note. On questioning by the judge and lawyers for&para;<br>both parties, the foreman testified that Juror 6 had&para;<br>brought up past instances of jury nullification. The foreman also expressed doubt about whether Juror 6 was&para;<br>willing to apply the felony-murder rule. The trial judge&para;<br>then ordered questioning of Juror 6, who first denied and&para;<br>then admitted bringing up instances of nullification.&para;<br>Juror 6 also testified that this was a serious case and that&para;<br>he would vote to convict only if he was “very convinced . . .&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 1280. He later clarified that in his view “convinced beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt” and “very convinced beyond a reasonable doubt”&para;<br>meant the same thing. Id., at 1281. After taking testimony from the remaining jurors, who corroborated the&para;<br>foreman’s testimony to varying degrees, the trial judge dismissed Juror 6 for bias. With an alternate juror in place,&para;<br>the jury convicted Williams of first-degree murder.&para;<br>B&para;<br>On appeal to the California Court of Appeal, Williams&para;<br>argued, among other things, that the discharge of Juror 6&para;<br>violated both the Sixth Amendment and the California&para;<br>Penal Code, which allows a California trial judge to dismiss a juror who “upon . . . good cause shown to the court&para;<br>is found to be unable to perform his or her duty.” Cal.&para;<br>Penal Code Ann. §1089 (West 2004). Although Williams’&para;<br>brief challenged the questioning and dismissal of Juror 6&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on both state and federal grounds, it did not clearly distinguish between these two lines of authority.&para;<br>In a written opinion affirming Williams’ conviction,&para;<br>the California Court of Appeal devoted several pages to&para;<br>discussing the propriety of the trial judge’s decision to dismiss the juror. People v. Taylor, No. B137365 (Mar. 27,&para;<br>2001). The court held that Juror 6 had been properly&para;<br>dismissed for bias and quoted this Court’s definition of&para;<br>“impartiality” in United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123,&para;<br>145–146 (1936). But despite its extended discussion of&para;<br>Juror 6’s dismissal and the questioning that preceded it,&para;<br>the California Court of Appeal never expressly acknowledged that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment issue.&para;<br>Williams petitioned the California Supreme Court for&para;<br>review, and while her petition was pending, that court&para;<br>decided People v. Cleveland, 25 Cal. 4th 466, 21 P. 3d 1225&para;<br>(2001), which held that a trial court had abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a juror who&para;<br>appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the&para;<br>evidence. The California Supreme Court granted Williams’ petition for review and remanded her case for further consideration in light of this intervening authority.&para;<br>People v. Taylor, No. S097387 (July 11, 2001).&para;<br>On remand, the California Court of Appeal issued a&para;<br>revised opinion holding that the trial court had not abused&para;<br>its discretion by questioning the jury and dismissing Juror&para;<br>6. Williams argued that Juror 6—like the holdout juror in&para;<br>Cleveland—was dismissed because he was uncooperative&para;<br>with other jurors who did not share his view of the evidence. But the California Court of Appeal disagreed,&para;<br>explaining that Williams’ argument “not only misstate[d]&para;<br>the evidence,” but also “ignore[d] the trial court’s explanation that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had&para;<br>shown himself to be biased, not because he was failing to&para;<br>deliberate or engaging in juror nullification.” People v.&para;<br>Taylor, No. B137365 (Jan. 18, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>105a. As in its earlier opinion, the California Court of&para;<br>Appeal quoted our definition of juror bias in Wood, but the&para;<br>court did not expressly acknowledge that Williams had&para;<br>invoked a federal basis for her argument. Despite that&para;<br>omission, however, Williams did not seek rehearing or otherwise suggest that the court had overlooked her federal&para;<br>claim. Instead, she filed another petition for review in&para;<br>the California Supreme Court, but this time that court&para;<br>denied relief in a one-sentence order. People v. Taylor, No.&para;<br>S104661 (Apr. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a.&para;<br>Williams sought but failed to obtain relief through state&para;<br>habeas proceedings, and she then filed a federal habeas&para;<br>petition under 28 U. S. C. §2254. The District Court applied AEDPA’s deferential standard of review for claims&para;<br>previously adjudicated on the merits and denied relief.&para;<br>Williams v. Mitchell, No. 03–2691 (CD Cal., May 30,&para;<br>2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a. In so holding, the District Court adopted a Magistrate Judge’s finding that the&para;<br>evidence “amply support[ed] the trial judge’s determination that good cause existed for the discharge of Juror 6.”&para;<br>Williams v. Mitchell, No. 03–2691 (CD Cal., Mar. 19,&para;<br>2007), id., at 70a.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit reversed. Unlike the District Court,&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit declined to apply the deferential standard of review contained in §2254(d). The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>took this approach because it thought it “obvious” that the&para;<br>State Court of Appeal had “overlooked or disregarded”&para;<br>Williams’ Sixth Amendment claim.1 Williams v. Cavazos,&para;<br>646 F. 3d 626, 639 (2011). The Ninth Circuit reasoned&para;<br>that Cleveland, the State Supreme Court decision on&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Consistent with our decision in Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797,&para;<br>806 (1991), the Ninth Circuit “look[ed] through” the California Supreme&para;<br>Court’s summary denial of Williams’ petition for review and examined&para;<br>the California Court of Appeal’s opinion, the last reasoned state-court&para;<br>decision to address Juror 6’s dismissal. Williams v. Cavazos, 646 F. 3d&para;<br>626, 635 (2011).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>which the State Court of Appeal had relied, “was not a&para;<br>constitutional decision,” 646 F. 3d, at 640, and the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit attributed no significance to the state court’s citation of our decision in Wood. Reviewing Williams’ Sixth&para;<br>Amendment claim de novo, the Ninth Circuit applied its&para;<br>own precedent and held that the questioning and dismissal of Juror 6 violated the Sixth Amendment. 646 F. 3d, at&para;<br>646–647. We granted the warden’s petition for a writ of&para;<br>certiorari, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), in order to decide whether&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit erred by refusing to afford AEDPA&para;<br>deference to the California Court of Appeal’s decision.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>As noted above, AEDPA sharply limits the circumstances in which a federal court may issue a writ of habeas&para;<br>corpus to a state prisoner whose claim was “adjudicated&para;<br>on the merits in State court proceedings.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d). In Richter, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), we&para;<br>held that §2254(d) “does not require a state court to give&para;<br>reasons before its decision can be deemed to have been&para;<br>‘adjudicated on the merits.’ ”&para;<br>Rather, we explained,&para;<br>“[w]hen a federal claim has been presented to a state court&para;<br>and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed&para;<br>that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in&para;<br>the absence of any indication or state-law procedural&para;<br>principles to the contrary.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>Our reasoning in Richter points clearly to the answer to&para;<br>the question presented in the case at hand. Although&para;<br>Richter itself concerned a state-court order that did not&para;<br>address any of the defendant’s claims, we see no reason&para;<br>why the Richter presumption should not also apply when a&para;<br>state-court opinion addresses some but not all of a defendant’s claims. There would be a reason for drawing a distinction between these two situations if opinions issued by&para;<br>state appellate courts always separately addressed every&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>single claim that is mentioned in a defendant’s papers. If&para;<br>there were such a uniform practice, then federal habeas&para;<br>courts could assume that any unaddressed federal claim&para;<br>was simply overlooked.&para;<br>No such assumption is warranted, however, because it is&para;<br>not the uniform practice of busy state courts to discuss&para;<br>separately every single claim to which a defendant makes&para;<br>even a passing reference. On the contrary, there are&para;<br>several situations in which state courts frequently take a&para;<br>different course.&para;<br>First, there are circumstances in which a line of state&para;<br>precedent is viewed as fully incorporating a related federal&para;<br>constitutional right. In California, for example, the state&para;<br>constitutional right to be present at trial “ ‘is generally&para;<br>coextensive with’ ” the protections of the Federal Constitution. People v. Butler, 46 Cal. 4th 847, 861, 209 P. 3d 596,&para;<br>606 (2009); see also, e.g., Commonwealth v. Prunty, 462&para;<br>Mass. 295, 305, n. 14, 968 N. E. 2d 361, 371, n. 14 (2012)&para;<br>(standard for racial discrimination in juror selection “ ‘is&para;<br>the same under the Federal Constitution and the [Massachusetts] Declaration of Rights’ ”); State v. Krause, 817&para;<br>N. W. 2d 136, 144 (Minn. 2012) (“ ‘The due process protection provided under the Minnesota Constitution is identical to the due proces[s] guaranteed under the Constitution&para;<br>of the United States’ ”); State v. Engelhardt, 280 Kan. 113,&para;<br>122, 119 P. 3d 1148, 1158 (2005) (observing that a Kansas&para;<br>statute is “analytically and functionally identical to the&para;<br>requirements under the Confrontation Clause and the Due&para;<br>Process Clause of the federal Constitution”). In this situation, a state appellate court may regard its discussion of&para;<br>the state precedent as sufficient to cover a claim based on&para;<br>the related federal right.&para;<br>Second, a state court may not regard a fleeting reference&para;<br>to a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as sufficient to raise a separate federal claim. Federal&para;<br>courts of appeals refuse to take cognizance of arguments&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that are made in passing without proper development.&para;<br>See, e.g., United States v. Cloud, 680 F. 3d 396, 409, n. 7&para;<br>(CA4 2012); United States v. Mitchell, 502 F. 3d 931, 953,&para;<br>n. 2 (CA9 2007); United States v.

State appellate courts are entitled to follow the&para;<br>same practice.&para;<br>Third, there are instances in which a state court may&para;<br>simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion. Indeed, the California Court of Appeal has expressly&para;<br>stated that it has no obligation to address claims that lack&para;<br>arguable merit. See People v. Rojas, 118 Cal. App. 3d 278,&para;<br>290, 173 Cal. Rptr. 91, 93 (1981). That court has explained: “In an era in which there is concern that the&para;<br>quality of justice is being diminished by appellate backlog&para;<br>with its attendant delay, which in turn contributes to a&para;<br>lack of finality of judgment, it behooves us as an appellate&para;<br>court to ‘get to the heart’ of cases presented and dispose of&para;<br>them expeditiously.” Ibid. See also People v. Burke, 18&para;<br>Cal. App. 72, 79, 122 P. 435, 439 (1912) (“The author of an&para;<br>opinion . . . must follow his own judgment as to the degree&para;<br>of elaboration to be accorded to the treatment of any proposition and as to the questions which are worthy of notice&para;<br>at all” (emphasis added)). While it is preferable for an&para;<br>appellate court in a criminal case to list all of the arguments that the court recognizes as having been properly&para;<br>presented, see R.

To be sure, if the state-law&para;<br>rule subsumes the federal standard—that is, if it is&para;<br>at least as protective as the federal standard—then the&para;<br>federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated&para;<br>on the merits. See Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002)&para;<br>(per curiam). But what if, for example, in at least some&para;<br>circumstances the state standard is less protective? Or&para;<br>what if the state standard is quite different from the&para;<br>federal standard, and the defendant’s papers made no&para;<br>effort to develop the basis for the federal claim? What if a&para;<br>provision of the Federal Constitution or a federal precedent was simply mentioned in passing in a footnote or was&para;<br>buried in a string cite? In such circumstances, the presumption that the federal claim was adjudicated on the&para;<br>merits may be rebutted—either by the habeas petitioner&para;<br>(for the purpose of showing that the claim should be considered by the federal court de novo) or by the State (for&para;<br>the purpose of showing that the federal claim should be&para;<br>regarded as procedurally defaulted). See Coleman, supra,&para;<br>at 739 (rebuttable presumption of no independent and&para;<br>adequate state ground applies so long as “it fairly appears&para;<br>that a state court judgment rested primarily on federal&para;<br>law or was interwoven with federal law”). Thus, while the&para;<br>Richter presumption is a strong one that may be rebutted&para;<br>only in unusual circumstances, it is not irrebuttable.3 “Per&para;<br>se rules should not be applied . . . in situations where the&para;<br>generalization is incorrect as an empirical matter,” Coleman, 501 U.

And as used in this context, the word “merits” is&para;<br>defined as “[t]he intrinsic rights and wrongs of a case as&para;<br>determined by matters of substance, in distinction from&para;<br>matters of form.” Webster’s New International Dictionary&para;<br>1540 (2d ed. 1954) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., 9 Oxford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed. 1989) (“the intrinsic&para;<br>‘rights and wrongs’ of the matter, in contradistinction to&para;<br>extraneous points such as the competence of the tribunal&para;<br>or the like” (emphasis added)); Random House Dictionary&para;<br>of the English Language 897 (1967) (“the intrinsic right&para;<br>and wrong of a matter, as a law case, unobscured by procedural details, technicalities, personal feelings, etc.”&para;<br>(emphasis added)). If a federal claim is rejected as a&para;<br>result of sheer inadvertence, it has not been evaluated&para;<br>based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA is surely correct that such claims have&para;<br>been adjudicated and present federal questions we may&para;<br>review, post, at 3–4, but it does not follow that they have&para;<br>been adjudicated “on the merits.” By having us nevertheless apply AEDPA’s deferential standard of review in such&para;<br>cases, petitioner’s argument would improperly excise&para;<br>§2254(d)’s on-the-merits requirement.&para;<br>Nor does petitioner’s preferred approach follow inexorably from AEDPA’s deferential architecture.

Only after conducting its&para;<br>own detective work does the Court conclude that the federal claim was not overlooked in this case.&para;<br>This complex exercise is unnecessary. A judgment that&para;<br>denies relief necessarily denies—and thus adjudicates—all&para;<br>the claims a petitioner has raised. See 1 H. Black, Law of&para;<br>Judgments §1, p. 2 (2d ed. 1902) (“[T]he judgment necessarily affirms, or else denies, that [an alleged] duty or . . .&para;<br>liability rests upon the person against whom the aid of the&para;<br>law is invoked”); id., §24, at 37. The judgment itself&para;<br>gives conclusive expression that the claims have been considered and rejected—whatever the individual judge&para;<br>might have been pondering (or not pondering). At common&para;<br>law the formal language traditionally preceding the announcement of a court’s judgment was “consideratum est&para;<br>per curiam” (“It is considered by the court”).

Perhaps not, but it nonetheless may have&para;<br>been rejected “on the merits.” That phrase does not suggest a line between a considered rejection of a claim and&para;<br>an unconsidered, inadequately considered, or inadvertent&para;<br>rejection. Rather, it refers to a “determination that there&para;<br>exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner” to relief&para;<br>under his claim, as contrasted with a “denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statuteof-limitations bar.” Gonzalez v.

By&para;<br>contrast, no statement is ever even required that the state&para;<br>court relied upon the theory of federal law that the habeas&para;<br>court finds validating.&para;<br>I doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by its novel&para;<br>interpretation of “on the merits” for purposes of §2254(d).&para;<br>Imagine that the state court formulated its judgment as&para;<br>follows: “All claims raised by the defendant have been&para;<br>considered and denied.” I cannot believe that the Court&para;<br>would require federal courts to test the veracity of that&para;<br>statement. Yet, as we have described, that is precisely&para;<br>what an (unadorned) judgment denying relief already&para;<br>conveys. Although the Court acknowledges that “ ‘[w]e&para;<br>have no power to tell state courts how they must write&para;<br>their opinions,’ ” ante, at 9, its analysis would turn solely&para;<br>on how the order of judgment is styled.&para;<br>Resolution of this case is direct: Respondent’s claim was&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>“adjudicated on the merits,” because the state court rendered a judgment rejecting all her claims, and the judgment gave no indication (such as a statement that it was&para;<br>“without prejudice”) that it was based on a procedural or&para;<br>other nonmerits ground.&para;<br>The Court’s novel resolution of the “on the merits” question produces a clear enough answer in this case. The&para;<br>weight of the evidence demonstrated that it was “exceedingly unlikely” that the state court overlooked the federal&para;<br>claim. Ante, at 16. But such ready resolution will not be&para;<br>commonplace. Consider another case, where the federal&para;<br>and state claims are not related, where there is no relevant state precedent referring to federal law, where state&para;<br>law might be interpreted as less defendant-friendly than&para;<br>the federal standard, or where a confluence of such factors&para;<br>exists. The answer to whether the federal claim has been&para;<br>“evaluated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the&para;<br>matter” is anybody’s guess. One thing, however, is certain: The Court’s case-by-case approach will guarantee&para;<br>protracted litigation over whether a state-court judge was&para;<br>aware of a claim on the day he rejected it.&para;<br>The Court tells us not to worry about a flood of litigation, because the Courts of Appeals have previously allowed arguments from petitioners that the state courts&para;<br>overlooked their federal claims. Ante, at 13, and n. 4&para;<br>(citing cases). But many of those cases applied a much&para;<br>simpler (and even less justifiable) test than the one&para;<br>adopted today: if the federal claim was not addressed in&para;<br>the opinion, then it was not adjudicated on the merits. See,&para;<br>e.g., Lyell v. Renico, 470 F. 3d 1177, 1181–1182 (CA6&para;<br>2006); Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F. 3d 39, 47 (CA1 2001).&para;<br>And even those courts that attempted to “divin[e] the&para;<br>thought processes of” the judge limited their inquiry to&para;<br>“what a state court has said.” Brown v. Luebbers, 371 F.&para;<br>3d 458, 461 (CA8 2004) (emphasis added); see also, e.g.,&para;<br>Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 606 (CA3 2002). By&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Are federal habeas courts now to consider evidence&para;<br>relevant to the internal deliberations of the state judiciary? Can a petitioner introduce testimony showing that&para;<br>state-court judges—because of time constraints, heavy&para;<br>caseloads, or other reasons—fail to read the briefs but&para;<br>leave that to their assistants, whose recommendations&para;<br>they rarely reject? Or testimony showing that, typically,&para;<br>only one judge on the state-court appellate panel reads the&para;<br>briefs and considers all the claims, and the others simply&para;<br>join the drafted order? Has there been an “adjudication&para;<br>on the merits” then?
