CITY OF RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–626.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 1, 2012—Decided January 15, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Lozman’s floating home was a house-like plywood structure&para;<br>with empty bilge space underneath the main floor to keep it afloat.&para;<br>He had it towed several times before deciding on a marina owned by&para;<br>the city of Riviera Beach (City). After various disputes with Lozman&para;<br>and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina, the City&para;<br>brought a federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home,&para;<br>seeking a lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass. Lozman&para;<br>moved to dismiss the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction. The District Court found the floating home to be a “vessel” under the Rules of&para;<br>Construction Act, which defines a “vessel” as including “every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable&para;<br>of being used, as a means of transportation on water,” 1 U. S. C. §3,&para;<br>concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper, and awarded the&para;<br>City dockage fees and nominal damages. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the home was a “vessel” since it was “capable”&para;<br>of movement over water despite petitioner’s subjective intent to remain moored indefinitely.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. This case is not moot. The District Court ordered the floating&para;<br>home sold, and the City purchased the home at auction and had it&para;<br>destroyed. Before the sale, the court ordered the City to post a bond&para;<br>to ensure Lozman could obtain monetary relief if he prevailed. P. 3.&para;<br>2. Lozman’s floating home is not a §3 “vessel.” Pp. 3–15.&para;<br>(a) The Eleventh Circuit found the home “capable of being used&para;<br>. . . as a means of transportation on water” because it could float and&para;<br>proceed under tow and its shore connections did not render it incapable of transportation. This interpretation is too broad. The definition&para;<br>of “transportation,” the conveyance of persons or things from one&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>place to another, must be applied in a practical way. Stewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 496. Consequently, a structure does&para;<br>not fall within the scope of the statutory phrase unless a reasonable&para;<br>observer, looking to the home’s physical characteristics and activities,&para;<br>would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or&para;<br>things over water. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>(b) But for the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman’s home&para;<br>suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport&para;<br>persons or things over water. It had no steering mechanism, had an&para;<br>unraked hull and rectangular bottom 10 inches below the water, and&para;<br>had no capacity to generate or store electricity. It also lacked selfpropulsion, differing significantly from an ordinary houseboat.&para;<br>Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(c) This view of the statute is consistent with its text, precedent,&para;<br>and relevant purposes. The statute’s language, read naturally, lends&para;<br>itself to that interpretation: The term “contrivance” refers to something “employed in contriving to effect a purpose”; “craft” explains&para;<br>that purpose as “water carriage and transport”; the addition of “water” to “craft” emphasizes the point; and the words, “used, or capable&para;<br>of being used, as a means of transportation on water,” drive the point&para;<br>home. Both Evansville &amp; Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola&para;<br>Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19, and Stewart, supra, support this conclusion. Evansville involved a wharfboat floated next to a dock, used to&para;<br>transfer cargo, and towed to harbor each winter; and Stewart involved a dredge used to remove silt from the ocean floor, which carried a captain and crew and could be navigated only by manipulating&para;<br>anchors and cables or by being towed. Water transportation was not&para;<br>the primary purpose of either structure; neither was in motion at relevant times; and both were sometimes attached to the ocean bottom&para;<br>or to land. However, Stewart’s dredge, which was regularly, but not&para;<br>primarily, used to transport workers and equipment over water, fell&para;<br>within the statutory definition while Evansville’s wharfboat, which&para;<br>was not designed to, and did not, serve a transportation function, did&para;<br>not. Lower court cases, on balance, also tend to support this conclusion. Further, the purposes of major federal maritime statutes—e.g.,&para;<br>admiralty provisions provide special attachment procedures lest a&para;<br>vessel avoid liability by sailing away, recognize that sailors face special perils at sea, and encourage shipowners to engage in port-related&para;<br>commerce—reveal little reason to classify floating homes as “vessels.”&para;<br>Finally, this conclusion is consistent with state laws in States where&para;<br>floating home owners have congregated in communities. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(d) Several important arguments made by the City and its amici&para;<br>are unavailing. They argue that a purpose-based test may introduce&para;<br>a subjective element into “vessel” determinations. But the Court has&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>considered only objective evidence, looking to the views of a reasonable observer and the physical attributes and behavior of the structure. They also argue against using criteria that are too abstract,&para;<br>complex, or open-ended. While this Court’s approach is neither perfectly precise nor always determinative, it is workable and consistent&para;<br>and should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases.&para;<br>And contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, the Court sees nothing to be&para;<br>gained by a remand. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(e) The City’s additional argument that Lozman’s floating home&para;<br>was actually used for transportation over water is similarly unpersuasive.

And we consequently conclude that the floating home is not a “vessel.”&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 2002 Fane Lozman, petitioner, bought a 60-foot by&para;<br>12-foot floating home. App. 37, 71. The home consisted of&para;<br>a house-like plywood structure with French doors on three&para;<br>sides. Id., at 38, 44. It contained a sitting room, bedroom,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>closet, bathroom, and kitchen, along with a stairway&para;<br>leading to a second level with office space. Id., at 45–66.&para;<br>An empty bilge space underneath the main floor kept it&para;<br>afloat. Id., at 38. (See Appendix, infra, for a photograph.)&para;<br>After buying the floating home, Lozman had it towed&para;<br>about 200 miles to North Bay Village, Florida, where he&para;<br>moored it and then twice more had it towed between&para;<br>nearby marinas. In 2006 Lozman had the home towed a&para;<br>further 70 miles to a marina owned by the city of Riviera&para;<br>Beach (City), respondent, where he kept it docked. Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 5.&para;<br>After various disputes with Lozman and unsuccessful&para;<br>efforts to evict him from the marina, the City brought&para;<br>this federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating&para;<br>home. It sought a maritime lien for dockage fees and&para;<br>damages for trespass. See Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46&para;<br>U. S. C. §31342 (authorizing federal maritime lien against&para;<br>vessel to collect debts owed for the provision of “necessaries to a vessel”); 28 U. S.

Galceran, 11 Wall. 185&para;<br>(1871); The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 215 (1867).&para;<br>Lozman, acting pro se, asked the District Court to dismiss the suit on the ground that the court lacked admiralty jurisdiction. See 2 Record, Doc. 64. After summary&para;<br>judgment proceedings, the court found that the floating&para;<br>home was a “vessel” and concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was consequently proper. Pet. for Cert. 42a. The&para;<br>judge then conducted a bench trial on the merits and&para;<br>awarded the City $3,039.88 for dockage along with $1 in&para;<br>nominal damages for trespass. Id., at 49a.&para;<br>On appeal the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Riviera Beach&para;<br>v. That Certain Unnamed Gray, Two-Story Vessel Approximately Fifty-Seven Feet in Length, 649 F. 3d 1259 (2011).&para;<br>It agreed with the District Court that the home was a&para;<br>“vessel.” In its view, the home was “capable” of movement&para;<br>over water and the owner’s subjective intent to remain&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>moored “indefinitely” at a dock could not show the contrary. Id., at 1267–1269.&para;<br>Lozman sought certiorari. In light of uncertainty among&para;<br>the Circuits about application of the term “capable” we&para;<br>granted his petition. Compare De La Rosa v. St. Charles&para;<br>Gaming Co., 474 F. 3d 185, 187 (CA5 2006) (structure is&para;<br>not a “vessel” where “physically,” but only “theoretical[ly],”&para;<br>“capable of sailing,” and owner intends to moor it indefinitely as floating casino), with Board of Comm’rs of Orleans Levee Dist. v. M/V Belle of Orleans, 535 F. 3d 1299,&para;<br>1311–1312 (CA11 2008) (structure is a “vessel” where&para;<br>capable of moving over water under tow, “albeit to her&para;<br>detriment,” despite intent to moor indefinitely). See also&para;<br>649 F. 3d, at 1267 (rejecting views of Circuits that “ ‘focus&para;<br>on the intent of the shipowner’ ”).&para;<br>II&para;<br>At the outset we consider one threshold matter. The&para;<br>District Court ordered the floating home sold to satisfy&para;<br>the City’s judgment. The City bought the home at public&para;<br>auction and subsequently had it destroyed. And, after the&para;<br>parties filed their merits briefs, we ordered further briefing on the question of mootness in light of the home’s&para;<br>destruction. 567 U. S. ___ (2012). The parties now have&para;<br>pointed out that, prior to the home’s sale, the District&para;<br>Court ordered the City to post a $25,000 bond “to secure&para;<br>Mr. Lozman’s value in the vessel.” 1 Record, Doc. 20, p. 2.&para;<br>The bond ensures that Lozman can obtain monetary relief&para;<br>if he ultimately prevails. We consequently agree with the&para;<br>parties that the case is not moot.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We focus primarily upon the statutory phrase “capable&para;<br>of being used . . . as a means of transportation on water.”&para;<br>1 U. S. C. §3. The Court of Appeals found that the home&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was “capable” of transportation because it could float, it&para;<br>could proceed under tow, and its shore connections (power&para;<br>cable, water hose, rope lines) did not “ ‘rende[r]’ ” it “ ‘practically incapable of transportation or movement.’ ” 649&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1266 (quoting Belle of Orleans, supra, at 1312,&para;<br>in turn quoting Stewart, 543 U. S., at 494). At least for&para;<br>argument’s sake we agree with the Court of Appeals about&para;<br>the last-mentioned point, namely that Lozman’s shore&para;<br>connections did not “ ‘render’ ” the home “ ‘practically incapable of transportation.’ ” But unlike the Eleventh Circuit,&para;<br>we do not find these considerations (even when combined&para;<br>with the home’s other characteristics) sufficient to show&para;<br>that Lozman’s home was a “vessel.”&para;<br>The Court of Appeals recognized that it had applied&para;<br>the term “capable” broadly. 649 F. 3d, at 1266. Indeed,&para;<br>it pointed with approval to language in an earlier case,&para;<br>Burks v. American River Transp. Co., 679 F. 2d 69 (1982),&para;<br>in which the Fifth Circuit said:&para;<br>“ ‘No doubt the three men in a tub would also fit within our definition, and one probably could make a convincing case for Jonah inside the whale.’ ” 649 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1269 (brackets omitted) (quoting Burks, supra, at&para;<br>75).&para;<br>But the Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation is too broad. Not&para;<br>every floating structure is a “vessel.” To state the obvious,&para;<br>a wooden washtub, a plastic dishpan, a swimming platform on pontoons, a large fishing net, a door taken off&para;<br>its hinges, or Pinocchio (when inside the whale) are not&para;<br>“vessels,” even if they are “artificial contrivance[s]” capable&para;<br>of floating, moving under tow, and incidentally carrying&para;<br>even a fair-sized item or two when they do so. Rather, the&para;<br>statute applies to an “artificial contrivance . . . capable of&para;<br>being used . . . as a means of transportation on water.” 1&para;<br>U. S. C. §3 (emphasis added). “[T]ransportation” involves&para;<br>the “conveyance (of things or persons) from one place to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>another.” 18 Oxford English Dictionary 424 (2d ed. 1989)&para;<br>(OED). Accord, N. Webster, An American Dictionary of&para;<br>the English Language 1406 (C. Goodrich &amp; N. Porter&para;<br>eds. 1873) (“[t]he act of transporting, carrying, or conveying&para;<br>from one place to another”). And we must apply this&para;<br>definition in a “practical,” not a “theoretical,” way. Stewart, supra, at 496. Consequently, in our view a structure&para;<br>does not fall within the scope of this statutory phrase&para;<br>unless a reasonable observer, looking to the home’s physical characteristics and activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things&para;<br>over water.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Though our criterion is general, the facts of this case&para;<br>illustrate more specifically what we have in mind. But&para;<br>for the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman’s home&para;<br>suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to&para;<br>transport persons or things over water. It had no rudder&para;<br>or other steering mechanism. 649 F. 3d, at 1269. Its hull&para;<br>was unraked, ibid., and it had a rectangular bottom 10&para;<br>inches below the water. Brief for Petitioner 27; App. 37.&para;<br>It had no special capacity to generate or store electricity&para;<br>but could obtain that utility only through ongoing connections with the land. Id., at 40. Its small rooms looked like&para;<br>ordinary nonmaritime living quarters. And those inside&para;<br>those rooms looked out upon the world, not through watertight portholes, but through French doors or ordinary&para;<br>windows. Id., at 44–66.&para;<br>Although lack of self-propulsion is not dispositive, e.g.,&para;<br>The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 31 (1903), it may be&para;<br>a relevant physical characteristic. And Lozman’s home&para;<br>differs significantly from an ordinary houseboat in that it&para;<br>has no ability to propel itself. Cf. 33 CFR §173.3 (2012)&para;<br>(“Houseboat means a motorized vessel . . . designed primarily for multi-purpose accommodation spaces with low&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>freeboard and little or no foredeck or cockpit” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). Lozman’s home was able to travel over water&para;<br>only by being towed. Prior to its arrest, that home’s travel&para;<br>by tow over water took place on only four occasions over a&para;<br>period of seven years. Supra, at 2. And when the home&para;<br>was towed a significant distance in 2006, the towing company had a second boat follow behind to prevent the home&para;<br>from swinging dangerously from side to side. App. 104.&para;<br>The home has no other feature that might suggest a&para;<br>design to transport over water anything other than its&para;<br>own furnishings and related personal effects. In a word,&para;<br>we can find nothing about the home that could lead a&para;<br>reasonable observer to consider it designed to a practical&para;<br>degree for “transportation on water.”&para;<br>C&para;<br>Our view of the statute is consistent with its text, precedent, and relevant purposes. For one thing, the statute’s&para;<br>language, read naturally, lends itself to that interpretation. We concede that the statute uses the word “every,”&para;<br>referring to “every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance.” 1 U. S. C. §3 (emphasis added). But&para;<br>the term “contrivance” refers to “something contrived for,&para;<br>or employed in contriving to effect a purpose.” 3 OED 850&para;<br>(def. 7). The term “craft” explains that purpose as “water&para;<br>carriage and transport.” Id., at 1104 (def. V(9)(b)) (defining “craft” as a “vesse[l] . . . for” that purpose). The addition of the word “water” to “craft,” yielding the term&para;<br>“watercraft,” emphasizes the point. And the next few words,&para;<br>“used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water,” drive the point home.&para;<br>For another thing, the bulk of precedent supports our&para;<br>conclusion. In Evansville &amp; Bowling Green Packet Co. v.&para;<br>Chero Cola Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19 (1926), the Court&para;<br>held that a wharfboat was not a “vessel.” The wharfboat&para;<br>floated next to a dock; it was used to transfer cargo from&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ship to dock and ship to ship; and it was connected to the&para;<br>dock with cables, utility lines, and a ramp. Id., at 21. At&para;<br>the same time, it was capable of being towed. And it&para;<br>was towed each winter to a harbor to avoid river ice. Id.,&para;<br>at 20–21. The Court reasoned that, despite the annual&para;<br>movement under tow, the wharfboat “was not used to&para;<br>carry freight from one place to another,” nor did it “encounter perils of navigation to which craft used for transportation are exposed.” Id., at 22. (See Appendix, infra,&para;<br>for photograph of a period wharfboat).&para;<br>The Court’s reasoning in Stewart also supports our&para;<br>conclusion. We there considered the application of the&para;<br>statutory definition to a dredge. 543 U. S., at 494. The&para;<br>dredge was “a massive floating platform” from which a&para;<br>suspended clamshell bucket would “remov[e] silt from the&para;<br>ocean floor,” depositing it “onto one of two scows” floating&para;<br>alongside the dredge. Id., at 484. Like more traditional&para;<br>“seagoing vessels,” the dredge had, e.g., “a captain and&para;<br>crew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining&para;<br>area.” Ibid. Unlike more ordinary vessels, it could navigate only by “manipulating its anchors and cables” or by&para;<br>being towed. Ibid. Nonetheless it did move. In fact it&para;<br>moved over water “every couple of hours.” Id., at 485.&para;<br>We held that the dredge was a “vessel.” We wrote that&para;<br>§3’s definition “merely codified the meaning that the term&para;<br>‘vessel’ had acquired in general maritime law.” Id., at 490.&para;<br>We added that the question of the “watercraft’s use ‘as a&para;<br>means of transportation on water’ is . . . practical,” and not&para;<br>“merely . . . theoretical.” Id., at 496. And we pointed to&para;<br>cases holding that dredges ordinarily “served a waterborne&para;<br>transportation function,” namely that “in performing their&para;<br>work they carried machinery, equipment, and crew over&para;<br>water.” Id., at 491–492 (citing, e.g., Butler v. Ellis, 45&para;<br>F. 2d 951, 955 (CA4 1930)).&para;<br>As the Court of Appeals pointed out, in Stewart we also&para;<br>wrote that §3 “does not require that a watercraft be used&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>primarily for that [transportation] purpose,” 543 U. S.,&para;<br>at 495; that a “watercraft need not be in motion to qualify&para;<br>as a vessel,” ibid.; and that a structure may qualify as a&para;<br>vessel even if attached—but not “permanently” attached—&para;<br>to the land or ocean floor. Id., at 493–494. We did not&para;<br>take these statements, however, as implying a universal&para;<br>set of sufficient conditions for application of the definition.&para;<br>Rather, they say, and they mean, that the statutory definition may (or may not) apply—not that it automatically&para;<br>must apply—where a structure has some other primary&para;<br>purpose, where it is stationary at relevant times, and&para;<br>where it is attached—but not permanently attached—to&para;<br>land.&para;<br>After all, a washtub is normally not a “vessel” though it&para;<br>does not have water transportation as its primary purpose, it may be stationary much of the time, and it might&para;<br>be attached—but not permanently attached—to land.&para;<br>More to the point, water transportation was not the primary purpose of either Stewart’s dredge or Evansville’s&para;<br>wharfboat; neither structure was “in motion” at relevant&para;<br>times; and both were sometimes attached (though not&para;<br>permanently attached) to the ocean bottom or to land.&para;<br>Nonetheless Stewart’s dredge fell within the statute’s&para;<br>definition while Evansville’s wharfboat did not.&para;<br>The basic difference, we believe, is that the dredge was&para;<br>regularly, but not primarily, used (and designed in part to&para;<br>be used) to transport workers and equipment over water&para;<br>while the wharfboat was not designed (to any practical&para;<br>degree) to serve a transportation function and did not do&para;<br>so. Compare Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 119 U. S. 625&para;<br>(1887) (floating drydock not a “vessel” because permanently&para;<br>fixed to wharf), with Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great&para;<br>Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 535 (1995) (barge&para;<br>sometimes attached to river bottom to use as a work platform remains a “vessel” when “at other times it was used&para;<br>for transportation”). See also ibid.

Consistency of&para;<br>interpretation of related state and federal laws is a virtue&para;<br>in that it helps to create simplicity making the law easier&para;<br>to understand and to follow for lawyers and for nonlawyers alike. And that consideration here supports our&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The City and supporting amici make several important&para;<br>arguments that warrant our response. First, they argue against use of any purpose-based test lest we introduce into “vessel” determinations a subjective element—&para;<br>namely, the owner’s intent. That element, they say, is&para;<br>often “unverifiable” and too easily manipulated. Its introduction would “foment unpredictability and invite gamesmanship.” Brief for Respondent 33.&para;<br>We agree with the City about the need to eliminate the&para;<br>consideration of evidence of subjective intent. But we&para;<br>cannot agree that the need requires abandonment of all&para;<br>criteria based on “purpose.” Cf. Stewart, 543 U. S., at 495&para;<br>(discussing transportation purpose). Indeed, it is difficult,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>if not impossible, to determine the use of a human “contrivance” without some consideration of human purposes.&para;<br>At the same time, we have sought to avoid subjective&para;<br>elements, such as owner’s intent, by permitting consideration only of objective evidence of a waterborne transportation purpose. That is why we have referred to the views of&para;<br>a reasonable observer. Supra, at 1. And it is why we have&para;<br>looked to the physical attributes and behavior of the structure, as objective manifestations of any relevant purpose,&para;<br>and not to the subjective intent of the owner. Supra, at&para;<br>5–6. We note that various admiralty treatises refer to&para;<br>the use of purpose-based tests without any suggestion that&para;<br>administration of those tests has introduced too much&para;<br>subjectivity into the vessel-determination process.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Benedict on Admiralty §164; 1 Admiralty and Maritime&para;<br>Law §3–6.&para;<br>Second, the City, with support of amici, argues against&para;<br>the use of criteria that are too abstract, complex, or openended. Brief for Respondent 28–29. A court’s jurisdiction,&para;<br>e.g., admiralty jurisdiction, may turn on application of&para;<br>the term “vessel.” And jurisdictional tests, often applied&para;<br>at the outset of a case, should be “as simple as possible.”&para;<br>Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 1).&para;<br>We agree with the last-mentioned sentiment. And we&para;<br>also understand that our approach is neither perfectly precise nor always determinative. Satisfaction of a designbased or purpose-related criterion, for example, is not&para;<br>always sufficient for application of the statutory word&para;<br>“vessel.” A craft whose physical characteristics and activities objectively evidence a waterborne transportation&para;<br>purpose or function may still be rendered a nonvessel by&para;<br>later physical alterations. For example, an owner might&para;<br>take a structure that is otherwise a vessel (even the Queen&para;<br>Mary) and connect it permanently to the land for use, say,&para;<br>as a hotel. See Stewart, supra, at 493–494. Further,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

See Kathriner v. Unisea, Inc., 975&para;<br>F. 2d 657, 660 (CA9 1992) (floating processing plant was&para;<br>no longer a vessel where a “large opening [had been] cut&para;<br>into her hull”).&para;<br>Nor is satisfaction of the criterion always a necessary&para;<br>condition, see Part IV, infra. It is conceivable that an&para;<br>owner might actually use a floating structure not designed&para;<br>to any practical degree for transportation as, say, a ferry&para;<br>boat, regularly transporting goods and persons over water.&para;<br>Nonetheless, we believe the criterion we have used,&para;<br>taken together with our example of its application here,&para;<br>should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline&para;<br>cases where “capacity” to transport over water is in doubt.&para;<br>Moreover, borderline cases will always exist; they require&para;<br>a method for resolution; we believe the method we have&para;<br>used is workable; and, unlike, say, an “anything that&para;<br>floats” test, it is consistent with statutory text, purpose,&para;<br>and precedent. Nor do we believe that the dissent’s approach would prove any more workable. For example,&para;<br>the dissent suggests a relevant distinction between an owner’s “clothes and personal effects” and “large appliances&para;<br>(like an oven or a refrigerator).” Post, at 8 (opinion of&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J.). But a transportation function need not&para;<br>turn on the size of the items in question, and we believe&para;<br>the line between items being transported from place to&para;<br>place (e.g., cargo) and items that are mere appurtenances&para;<br>is the one more likely to be relevant. Cf. Benedict, American Admiralty §222, at 121 (“A ship is usually described as&para;<br>consisting of the ship, her tackle, apparel, and furniture&para;<br>. . .”).&para;<br>Finally, the dissent and the Solicitor General (as amicus&para;<br>for Lozman) argue that a remand is warranted for further&para;<br>factfinding. See post, at 10–12; Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 29–31. But neither the City nor Lozman&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>makes such a request. Brief for Respondent 18, 49, 52.&para;<br>And the only potentially relevant factual dispute the dissent points to is that the home suffered serious damage&para;<br>during a tow. Post, at 10–11. But this would add support&para;<br>to our ultimate conclusion that this floating home was not&para;<br>a vessel. We consequently see nothing to be gained by a&para;<br>remand.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Although we have focused on the phrase “capable of being used” for transportation over water, the statute also&para;<br>includes as a “vessel” a structure that is actually “used”&para;<br>for that transportation. 1 U. S. C. §3 (emphasis added).&para;<br>And the City argues that, irrespective of its design, Lozman’s floating home was actually so used. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 32. We are not persuaded by its argument.&para;<br>We are willing to assume for argument’s sake that&para;<br>sometimes it is possible actually to use for water transportation a structure that is in no practical way designed for&para;<br>that purpose. See supra, at 12–13. But even so, the City&para;<br>cannot show the actual use for which it argues. Lozman’s&para;<br>floating home moved only under tow. Before its arrest, it&para;<br>moved significant distances only twice in seven years.&para;<br>And when it moved, it carried, not passengers or cargo,&para;<br>but at the very most (giving the benefit of any factual&para;<br>ambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its owner’s&para;<br>personal effects, and personnel present to assure the&para;<br>home’s safety. 649 F. 3d, at 1268; Brief for Respondent 32;&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38.

It&para;<br>provides that “[t]he word ‘vessel’ includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or&para;<br>capable of being used, as a means of transportation on&para;<br>water.” This broad phrasing flows from admiralty law’s&para;<br>long recognition that vessels come in many shapes and&para;<br>sizes.

But over time, several important principles&para;<br>have guided both this Court and the lower courts in determining what kinds of watercraft fall properly within&para;<br>the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.&para;<br>Consider the most basic of requirements.

Stopping here, as the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>essentially did, results in an overinclusive test. Section 3,&para;<br>after all, does not drag every bit of floating and towable&para;<br>flotsam and jetsam into admiralty jurisdiction. Rather,&para;<br>the terms “capable of being used” and “practical” have real&para;<br>significance in our maritime jurisprudence.&para;<br>“[A] water craft is not ‘capable of being used’ for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been&para;<br>permanently moored.” Stewart, 543 U. S., at 494. So, to&para;<br>take an obvious example, a floating bridge over water does&para;<br>not constitute a vessel; such mooring is clearly permanent.&para;<br>Cf. The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 216 (1867). Less&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

See, e.g., Evansville, 271 U. S., at&para;<br>22 (“[The wharfboat] served at Evansville as an office,&para;<br>warehouse and wharf, and was not taken from place to&para;<br>place.

Put&para;<br>plainly, structures “permanently affixed to shore or resting on the ocean floor,” Stewart, 543 U. S., at 493–494,&para;<br>have never been treated as vessels for the purposes of §3.&para;<br>Our precedents have also excluded from vessel status&para;<br>those watercraft “rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.” Id., at 494. Take the easiest&para;<br>case, a vessel whose physical characteristics have been so&para;<br>altered as to make waterborne transportation a practical&para;<br>impossibility. Ibid.

The longstanding admiralty&para;<br>exception for “dead ships,” those watercraft that “require&para;<br>a major overhaul” for their “reactivation,” also falls into&para;<br>this category.

She was undergoing major repairs and&para;<br>complete renovation . . . ”).&para;<br>Finally, our maritime jurisprudence excludes from vessel status those floating structures that, based on their&para;<br>physical characteristics, do not “transport people, freight,&para;<br>or cargo from place to place” as one of their purposes.&para;<br>Stewart, 543 U. S., at 493. “Purpose,” in this context,&para;<br>is determined solely by an objective inquiry into a craft’s&para;<br>function. “[N]either size, form, equipment nor means of&para;<br>propulsion are determinative factors upon the question of&para;<br>[vessel status],” though all may be considered. The Robert&para;<br>W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 30 (1903). Moreover, in assessing a particular structure’s function, we have consistently examined its past and present activities. Stewart,&para;<br>543 U. S., at 495; Cope, 119 U. S., at 627. Of course, a&para;<br>seaborne craft is not excluded from vessel status simply&para;<br>because its “primary purpose” is not maritime transport.&para;<br>Stewart, 543 U. S., at 497. We held as much in Stewart&para;<br>when we concluded that a dredge was a vessel notwithstanding that its “primary purpose” was “dredging rather&para;<br>than transportation.” Id., at 486, 495.

So, for example, when we were confronted in Stewart with the question whether a dredge is a §3 vessel, we&para;<br>did not commence with a clean slate; we instead sought&para;<br>guidance from previous cases that had confronted similar&para;<br>structures. See id., at 490, and n. 5; see also Norton v.&para;<br>Warner Co., 321 U.

First, the capacity to float and carry&para;<br>things or people is an obvious prerequisite to vessel status.&para;<br>Second, structures or ships that are permanently moored&para;<br>or fixed in place are not §3 vessels.

This phrasing has never appeared in any of&para;<br>our cases and the majority’s use of it, despite its seemingly&para;<br>objective gloss, effectively (and erroneously) introduces a&para;<br>subjective component into the vessel-status inquiry.&para;<br>For one thing, in applying this test the majority points&para;<br>to some characteristics of Lozman’s craft that have no&para;<br>relationship to maritime transport, such as the style of the&para;<br>craft’s rooms or that “those inside those rooms looked out&para;<br>upon the world, not through water-tight portholes, but&para;<br>——————&para;<br>definition.&para;<br>3 Presumably, this encompasses those kinds of ships “otherwise rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.” Stewart,&para;<br>543 U.

In fact, they are not. Section 3 is focused on&para;<br>whether a structure is “used, or capable of being used, as&para;<br>a means of transportation on water.” By importing windows, doors, room style, and other esthetic criteria into the&para;<br>§3 analysis, the majority gives our vessel test an “I know it&para;<br>when I see it” flavor. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197&para;<br>(1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). But that has never been&para;<br>nor should it be the test: A badly designed and unattractive vessel is different from a structure that lacks any&para;<br>“practical capacity” for maritime transport. In the majority’s eyes, the two appear to be one and the same.&para;<br>The majority’s treatment of the craft’s past voyages is&para;<br>also strange. The majority notes that Lozman’s craft could&para;<br>be and was, in fact, towed over long distances, including&para;<br>over 200 miles at one point. Ante, at 2–6. But the majority determines that, given the design of Lozman’s craft,&para;<br>this is “far too little actual ‘use’ to bring the floating home&para;<br>within the terms of the statute.” Ante, at 14. This is&para;<br>because “when it moved, it carried, not passengers or&para;<br>cargo, but at the very most (giving the benefit of any&para;<br>factual ambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its&para;<br>owner’s personal effects, and personnel present to assure&para;<br>the home’s safety.” Ante, at 13–14.&para;<br>I find this analysis confusing. The majority accepts that&para;<br>the record indicates that Lozman’s craft traveled hundreds&para;<br>of miles while “carrying people or things.” Ante, at 1. But&para;<br>then, in the same breath, the majority concludes that a&para;<br>“reasonable observer” would nonetheless conclude that the&para;<br>craft was not “designed to any practical degree for carrying people or things on water.” Ibid. The majority fails to&para;<br>explain how a craft that apparently did carry people and&para;<br>things over water for long distances was not “practically&para;<br>capable” of maritime transport.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>This is not to say that a structure capable of such feats&para;<br>is necessarily a vessel. A craft like Lozman’s might not&para;<br>be a vessel, for example, if it could only carry its owner’s&para;<br>clothes and personal effects, or if it is only capable of&para;<br>transporting itself and its appurtenances. Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., 513 U. S.&para;<br>527, 535 (1995) (“[M]aritime law . . . ordinarily treats an&para;<br>‘appurtenance’ attached to a vessel in navigable waters as&para;<br>part of the vessel itself ”). But if such a craft can carry&para;<br>large appliances (like an oven or a refrigerator) and all of&para;<br>the other things we might find in a normal home in addition to the occupants of that home, as the existing record&para;<br>suggests Lozman’s craft may have done, then it would&para;<br>seem to be much more like a mobile home (and therefore a&para;<br>vessel) than a firmly rooted residence. The simple truth is&para;<br>that we know very little about the craft’s capabilities and&para;<br>what did or did not happen on its various trips. By focusing on the little we do know for certain about this craft&para;<br>(i.e., its windows, doors, and the style of its rooms) in&para;<br>determining whether it is a vessel, the majority renders&para;<br>the §3 inquiry opaque and unpredictable.&para;<br>Indeed, the little we do know about Lozman’s craft&para;<br>suggests only that it was an unusual structure. A surveyor was unable to find any comparable craft for sale in the&para;<br>State of Florida. App. 43. Lozman’s home was neither&para;<br>obviously a houseboat, as the majority describes such&para;<br>ships, ante, at 5–6, nor clearly a floating home, ante, at&para;<br>10–11. See App. 13, 31, 79 (sale, lease, and surveying&para;<br>documents describing Lozman’s craft as a “houseboat”).&para;<br>The only clear difference that the majority identifies between these two kinds of structures is that the former are&para;<br>self-propelled, while the latter are not. Ante, at 5–6. But&para;<br>even the majority recognizes that self-propulsion has&para;<br>never been a prerequisite for vessel status. Ante, at 5&para;<br>(citing The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.

If&para;<br>windows, doors, and other esthetic attributes are what&para;<br>take Lozman’s craft out of vessel status, then the majority’s test is completely malleable. If it is the craft’s lack of&para;<br>self-propulsion, then the majority’s test is unfaithful to our&para;<br>longstanding precedents. See The Robert W. Parsons, 191&para;<br>U. S., at 30–31. If it is something else, then that something is not apparent from the majority’s opinion.&para;<br>Worse still, in straining to find that Lozman’s craft&para;<br>was a floating home and therefore not a vessel, the majority calls into question the conclusions of numerous lower&para;<br>courts that have found houseboats that lacked selfpropulsion to be §3 vessels.

For example, if Lozman’s craft’s&para;<br>previous voyages caused it serious damage, then that&para;<br>would strongly suggest that it lacked a maritime transportation purpose or function. There is no harm in remanding the case for further factfinding along the lines&para;<br>described above, cautioning the lower courts to be aware&para;<br>that features of Lozman’s “incomparable” craft, see App. 43,&para;<br>may distinguish it from previous precedents. At most,&para;<br>such a remand would introduce a relatively short delay&para;<br>before finally ending the years-long battle between Lozman and the city of Riviera Beach.&para;<br>On the other hand, there is great harm in stretching the&para;<br>facts below and overriding settled and likely correct lower&para;<br>court precedents to reach the unnecessary conclusion that&para;<br>Lozman’s craft was not a vessel. Without an objective&para;<br>application of the §3 standard, one that relies in a predictable fashion only on those physical characteristics of a&para;<br>craft that are related to maritime transport and use,&para;<br>parties will have no ex ante notion whether a particular&para;<br>ship is a vessel. As a wide range of amici have cautioned&para;<br>us, numerous maritime industries rely heavily on clear&para;<br>and predictable legal rules for determining which ships&para;<br>are vessels.6 The majority’s distorted application of our&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 For example, without knowing whether a particular ship is a §3&para;<br>vessel, it is impossible for lenders to know how properly to characterize&para;<br>it as collateral for a financing agreement because they do not know&para;<br>what remedies they will have recourse to in the event of a default.&para;<br>Brief for National Marine Bankers Assn. as Amicus Curiae 14–15.&para;<br>Similarly, cities like Riviera Beach provide docking for crafts like&para;<br>Lozman’s on the assumption that such crafts actually are “vessels,”&para;<br>App. 13–21 (Riviera Beach’s wet-slip agreement referring to Lozman’s&para;<br>craft as a “vessel,” “boat,” or “houseboat”), that can be “remove[d]” upon&para;<br>short notice, id., at 17 (requiring removal of the craft on three days’&para;<br>notice). The majority makes it impossible for these marinas to know&para;<br>whether the “houseboats” that fill their slips are actually vessels and&para;<br>what remedies they can exercise in the event of a dispute. See id., at&para;<br>15 (“In addition to any other remedies provided for in this Agreement,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZMAN v.

It is&para;<br>clear, however, that we are not in a good position to make&para;<br>such a determination based on the limited record we possess.

See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29–31.&para;<br>The Court resists this move and in its haste to christen&para;<br>Lozman’s craft a nonvessel delivers an analysis that will&para;<br>confuse the lower courts and upset our longstanding admiralty precedent.
