MCNEELY&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI&para;<br>No. 11–1425. Argued January 9, 2013—Decided April 17, 2013&para;<br>Respondent McNeely was stopped by a Missouri police officer for speeding and crossing the centerline. After declining to take a breath test&para;<br>to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC), he was arrested&para;<br>and taken to a nearby hospital for blood testing. The officer never attempted to secure a search warrant. McNeely refused to consent to&para;<br>the blood test, but the officer directed a lab technician to take a sample. McNeely’s BAC tested well above the legal limit, and he was&para;<br>charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He moved to suppress&para;<br>the blood test result, arguing that taking his blood without a warrant&para;<br>violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The trial court agreed, concluding that the exigency exception to the warrant requirement did&para;<br>not apply because, apart from the fact that McNeely’s blood alcohol&para;<br>was dissipating, no circumstances suggested that the officer faced an&para;<br>emergency.&para;<br>The State Supreme Court affirmed, relying on&para;<br>Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, in which this Court upheld a&para;<br>DWI suspect’s warrantless blood test where the officer “might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in&para;<br>which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened ‘the destruction of evidence,’ ” id., at 770. This&para;<br>case, the state court found, involved a routine DWI investigation&para;<br>where no factors other than the natural dissipation of blood alcohol&para;<br>suggested that there was an emergency, and, thus, the nonconsensual warrantless test violated McNeely’s right to be free from unreasonable searches of his person.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>358 S. W. 3d 65, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect&para;<br>to Parts I, II–A, II–B, and IV, concluding that in drunk-driving investigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MISSOURI v. MCNEELY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant. Pp. 4–13, 20–23.&para;<br>(a) The principle that a warrantless search of the person is reasonable only if it falls within a recognized exception, see, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224, applies here, where the search&para;<br>involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath McNeely’s skin and&para;<br>into his veins to obtain a blood sample to use as evidence in a criminal investigation. One recognized exception “applies when ‘ “the exigencies of the situation” make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable.’ ”&para;<br>Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. This Court looks to the totality&para;<br>of circumstances in determining whether an exigency exits. See&para;<br>Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 406. Applying this approach&para;<br>in Schmerber, the Court found a warrantless blood test reasonable after considering all of the facts and circumstances of that case and&para;<br>carefully basing its holding on those specific facts, including that alcohol levels decline after drinking stops and that testing was delayed&para;<br>while officers transported the injured suspect to the hospital and investigated the accident scene. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(b) The State nonetheless seeks a per se rule, contending that exigent circumstances necessarily exist when an officer has probable&para;<br>cause to believe a person has been driving under the influence of alcohol because BAC evidence is inherently evanescent. Though a person’s blood alcohol level declines until the alcohol is eliminated, it&para;<br>does not follow that the Court should depart from careful case-bycase assessment of exigency. When officers in drunk-driving investigations can reasonably obtain a warrant before having a blood sample drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the&para;<br>search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so. See&para;<br>McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 456. Circumstances may&para;<br>make obtaining a warrant impractical such that the alcohol’s dissipation will support an exigency, but that is a reason to decide each case&para;<br>on its facts, as in Schmerber, not to accept the “considerable overgeneralization” that a per se rule would reflect, Richards v. Wisconsin,&para;<br>520 U. S. 385, 393. Blood testing is different in critical respects from&para;<br>other destruction-of-evidence cases. Unlike a situation where, e.g., a&para;<br>suspect has control over easily disposable evidence, see Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U. S. 291, 296, BAC evidence naturally dissipates in a gradual and relatively predictable manner. Moreover, because an officer&para;<br>must typically take a DWI suspect to a medical facility and obtain a&para;<br>trained medical professional’s assistance before having a blood test&para;<br>conducted, some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and&para;<br>time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether a warrant is obtained. The State’s rule also fails to account for advances in the 47&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>years since Schmerber was decided that allow for the more expeditious processing of warrant applications, particularly in contexts like&para;<br>drunk-driving investigations where the evidence supporting probable&para;<br>cause is simple. The natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may&para;<br>support an exigency finding in a specific case, as it did in Schmerber,&para;<br>but it does not do so categorically. Pp. 8–13.&para;<br>(c) Because the State sought a per se rule here, it did not argue that&para;<br>there were exigent circumstances in this particular case. The arguments and the record thus do not provide the Court with an adequate&para;<br>framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that&para;<br>can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of acting without a warrant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of&para;<br>alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are&para;<br>among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a&para;<br>warrant is required. Pp. 20–23.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE GINSBURG,&para;<br>and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part III that other arguments advanced by the State and amici in support of a per se rule are unpersuasive. Their concern that a case-by-case approach to exigency will&para;<br>not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers may make&para;<br>the desire for a bright-line rule understandable, but the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical&para;<br>approach in this context. A fact-intensive, totality of the circumstances, approach is hardly unique within this Court’s Fourth&para;<br>Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S.&para;<br>119, 123–125. They also contend that the privacy interest implicated&para;<br>here is minimal. But motorists’ diminished expectation of privacy&para;<br>does not diminish their privacy interest in preventing a government&para;<br>agent from piercing their skin. And though a blood test conducted in&para;<br>a medical setting by trained personnel is less intrusive than other&para;<br>bodily invasions, this Court has never retreated from its recognition&para;<br>that any compelled intrusion into the human body implicates significant, constitutionally protected privacy interests. Finally, the government’s general interest in combating drunk driving does not justify departing from the warrant requirement without showing exigent&para;<br>circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a particular case.

California, 384 U.

The question presented here&para;<br>is whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the&para;<br>bloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an&para;<br>exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant require­&para;<br>ment for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving&para;<br>cases. We conclude that it does not, and we hold, con­&para;<br>sistent with general Fourth Amendment principles, that&para;<br>exigency in this context must be determined case by case&para;<br>based on the totality of the circumstances.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MISSOURI v. MCNEELY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>While on highway patrol at approximately 2:08 a.m., a&para;<br>Missouri police officer stopped Tyler McNeely’s truck after&para;<br>observing it exceed the posted speed limit and repeatedly&para;<br>cross the centerline. The officer noticed several signs&para;<br>that McNeely was intoxicated, including McNeely’s blood­&para;<br>shot eyes, his slurred speech, and the smell of alcohol on his&para;<br>breath. McNeely acknowledged to the officer that he had&para;<br>consumed “a couple of beers” at a bar, App. 20, and he&para;<br>appeared unsteady on his feet when he exited the truck.&para;<br>After McNeely performed poorly on a battery of field­&para;<br>sobriety tests and declined to use a portable breath-test&para;<br>device to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC),&para;<br>the officer placed him under arrest.&para;<br>The officer began to transport McNeely to the station&para;<br>house. But when McNeely indicated that he would again&para;<br>refuse to provide a breath sample, the officer changed&para;<br>course and took McNeely to a nearby hospital for blood&para;<br>testing. The officer did not attempt to secure a warrant.&para;<br>Upon arrival at the hospital, the officer asked McNeely&para;<br>whether he would consent to a blood test. Reading from&para;<br>a standard implied consent form, the officer explained to&para;<br>McNeely that under state law refusal to submit voluntarily to the test would lead to the immediate revocation of his&para;<br>driver’s license for one year and could be used against him&para;<br>in a future prosecution. See Mo. Ann. Stat. §§577.020.1,&para;<br>577.041 (West 2011). McNeely nonetheless refused. The&para;<br>officer then directed a hospital lab technician to take a&para;<br>blood sample, and the sample was secured at approxi­&para;<br>mately 2:35 a.m. Subsequent laboratory testing measured&para;<br>McNeely’s BAC at 0.154 percent, which was well above the&para;<br>legal limit of 0.08 percent.

The trial&para;<br>court agreed. It concluded that the exigency exception to&para;<br>the warrant requirement did not apply because, apart from&para;<br>the fact that “[a]s in all cases involving intoxication,&para;<br>[McNeely’s] blood alcohol was being metabolized by his&para;<br>liver,” there were no circumstances suggesting the officer&para;<br>faced an emergency in which he could not practicably&para;<br>obtain a warrant.

No. ED 96402&para;<br>(June 21, 2011), id., at 24a.&para;<br>The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed. 358 S. W. 3d 65&para;<br>(2012) (per curiam). Recognizing that this Court’s decision&para;<br>in Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, “provide[d] the&para;<br>backdrop” to its analysis, the Missouri Supreme Court&para;<br>held that “Schmerber directs lower courts to engage in&para;<br>a totality of the circumstances analysis when determin­&para;<br>ing whether exigency permits a nonconsensual, warrantless&para;<br>blood draw.” 358 S. W. 3d, at 69, 74. The court further&para;<br>concluded that Schmerber “requires more than the mere&para;<br>dissipation of blood-alcohol evidence to support a warrant­&para;<br>less blood draw in an alcohol-related case.” 358 S. W. 3d,&para;<br>at 70. According to the court, exigency depends heavily on&para;<br>the existence of additional “ ‘special facts,’ ” such as whether&para;<br>an officer was delayed by the need to investigate an accident and transport an injured suspect to the hospital,&para;<br>as had been the case in Schmerber. 358 S.

MCNEELY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>74. Finding that this was “unquestionably a routine DWI&para;<br>case” in which no factors other than the natural dissi­&para;<br>pation of blood-alcohol suggested that there was an emer­&para;<br>gency, the court held that the nonconsensual warrantless&para;<br>blood draw violated McNeely’s Fourth Amendment right&para;<br>to be free from unreasonable searches of his person. Id.,&para;<br>at 74–75.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on&para;<br>the question whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in&para;<br>the bloodstream establishes a per se exigency that suffices&para;<br>on its own to justify an exception to the warrant require­&para;<br>ment for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving&para;<br>investigations.2 See 567 U. S. ___ (2012). We now affirm.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that&para;<br>“[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,&para;<br>houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches&para;<br>and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall&para;<br>issue, but upon probable cause.” Our cases have held that&para;<br>a warrantless search of the person is reasonable only if&para;<br>it falls within a recognized exception. See, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224 (1973). That prin­&para;<br>ciple applies to the type of search at issue in this case,&para;<br>which involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath&para;<br>McNeely’s skin and into his veins to obtain a sample of his&para;<br>blood for use as evidence in a criminal investigation.

Noting that “[s]earch warrants are ordinarily re­&para;<br>quired for searches of dwellings,” we reasoned that “absent&para;<br>an emergency, no less could be required where intrusions&para;<br>into the human body are concerned,” even when the search&para;<br>was conducted following a lawful arrest. Id., at 770. We&para;<br>explained that the importance of requiring authorization&para;<br>by a “ ‘neutral and detached magistrate’ ” before allowing a&para;<br>law enforcement officer to “invade another’s body in search&para;<br>of evidence of guilt is indisputable and great.” Ibid. (quot­&para;<br>ing Johnson v. United States, 333 U.

King, 563 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>brackets omitted). A variety of circumstances may give&para;<br>rise to an exigency sufficient to justify a warrantless&para;<br>search, including law enforcement’s need to provide emer­&para;<br>gency assistance to an occupant of a home, Michigan v.&para;<br>Fisher, 558 U.

S., at 296 (holding that a limited&para;<br>warrantless search of a suspect’s fingernails to preserve&para;<br>evidence that the suspect was trying to rub off was justi­&para;<br>fied “[o]n the facts of this case”); see also Richards v.&para;<br>Wisconsin, 520 U.

In that case, the petitioner had&para;<br>suffered injuries in an automobile accident and was taken&para;<br>to the hospital. 384 U. S., at 758. While he was there&para;<br>receiving treatment, a police officer arrested the petitioner&para;<br>for driving while under the influence of alcohol and or­&para;<br>dered a blood test over his objection. Id., at 758–759.&para;<br>After explaining that the warrant requirement applied&para;<br>generally to searches that intrude into the human body,&para;<br>we concluded that the warrantless blood test “in the pre­&para;<br>sent case” was nonetheless permissible because the officer&para;<br>“might reasonably have believed that he was confronted&para;<br>with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain&para;<br>a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened ‘the de­&para;<br>struction of evidence.’ ” Id., at 770 (quoting Preston v.&para;<br>United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)).&para;<br>In support of that conclusion, we observed that evidence&para;<br>could have been lost because “the percentage of alcohol in&para;<br>the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops,&para;<br>as the body functions to eliminate it from the system.”&para;<br>384 U. S., at 770. We added that “[p]articularly in a case&para;<br>such as this, where time had to be taken to bring the&para;<br>accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the&para;<br>accident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and&para;<br>secure a warrant.” Id., at 770–771. “Given these special&para;<br>facts,” we found that it was appropriate for the police to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 We have recognized a limited class of traditional exceptions to the&para;<br>warrant requirement that apply categorically and thus do not require&para;<br>an assessment of whether the policy justifications underlying the exception, which may include exigency-based considerations, are im­&para;<br>plicated in a particular case. See, e.g., California v. Acevedo, 500&para;<br>U. S. 565, 569–570 (1991) (automobile exception); United States v.&para;<br>Robinson, 414 U.

MCNEELY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>act without a warrant. Id., at 771. We further held that&para;<br>the blood test at issue was a reasonable way to recover the&para;<br>evidence because it was highly effective, “involve[d] vir­&para;<br>tually no risk, trauma, or pain,” and was conducted in a&para;<br>reasonable fashion “by a physician in a hospital environ­&para;<br>ment according to accepted medical practices.” Ibid.

In finding the warrantless blood test reasonable in&para;<br>Schmerber, we considered all of the facts and circumstances&para;<br>of the particular case and carefully based our holding on&para;<br>those specific facts.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The State properly recognizes that the reasonableness&para;<br>of a warrantless search under the exigency exception to&para;<br>the warrant requirement must be evaluated based on the&para;<br>totality of the circumstances. Brief for Petitioner 28–29.&para;<br>But the State nevertheless seeks a per se rule for blood&para;<br>testing in drunk-driving cases. The State contends that&para;<br>whenever an officer has probable cause to believe an&para;<br>individual has been driving under the influence of alcohol,&para;<br>exigent circumstances will necessarily exist because BAC&para;<br>evidence is inherently evanescent. As a result, the State&para;<br>claims that so long as the officer has probable cause and&para;<br>the blood test is conducted in a reasonable manner, it is&para;<br>categorically reasonable for law enforcement to obtain the&para;<br>blood sample without a warrant.&para;<br>It is true that as a result of the human body’s natural&para;<br>metabolic processes, the alcohol level in a person’s blood&para;<br>begins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed and&para;<br>continues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated.

More precise calculations of the rate at which&para;<br>alcohol dissipates depend on various individual character­&para;<br>istics (such as weight, gender, and alcohol tolerance) and&para;<br>the circumstances in which the alcohol was consumed.&para;<br>See Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol Analy­&para;<br>sis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 437–441 (L. Kobilin­&para;<br>sky ed. 2012). Regardless of the exact elimination rate, it&para;<br>is sufficient for our purposes to note that because an indi­&para;<br>vidual’s alcohol level gradually declines soon after he stops&para;<br>drinking, a significant delay in testing will negatively&para;<br>affect the probative value of the results. This fact was&para;<br>essential to our holding in Schmerber, as we recognized&para;<br>that, under the circumstances, further delay in order to&para;<br>secure a warrant after the time spent investigating the&para;<br>scene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect&para;<br>to the hospital to receive treatment would have threatened&para;<br>the destruction of evidence. 384 U.

In those&para;<br>drunk-driving investigations where police officers can&para;<br>reasonably obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be&para;<br>drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of&para;<br>the search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they&para;<br>do so.

The rule&para;<br>would also distort law enforcement incentives. As with&para;<br>the State’s per se rule, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s rule might&para;<br>discourage efforts to expedite the warrant process because&para;<br>it categorically authorizes warrantless blood draws so long&para;<br>as it takes more time to secure a warrant than to obtain&para;<br>medical assistance. On the flip side, making the require­&para;<br>ment of independent judicial oversight turn exclusively on&para;<br>the amount of time that elapses between an arrest and&para;<br>BAC testing could induce police departments and individ­&para;<br>ual officers to minimize testing delay to the detriment of&para;<br>other values.

That is so, they&para;<br>claim, both because motorists have a diminished expecta­&para;<br>tion of privacy and because our cases have repeatedly&para;<br>indicated that blood testing is commonplace in society and&para;<br>typically involves “virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.”&para;<br>Schmerber, 384 U.

See&para;<br>NHTSA Review 173; supra, at 2 (describing Missouri’s&para;<br>implied consent law). Such laws impose significant conse­&para;<br>quences when a motorist withdraws consent; typically the&para;<br>motorist’s driver’s license is immediately suspended or&para;<br>revoked, and most States allow the motorist’s refusal to&para;<br>take a BAC test to be used as evidence against him in a&para;<br>subsequent criminal prosecution.

Based on this testimony, the trial court&para;<br>concluded that there was no exigency and specifically&para;<br>found that, although the arrest took place in the middle of&para;<br>the night, “a prosecutor was readily available to apply for&para;<br>a search warrant and a judge was readily available to&para;<br>issue a warrant.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.11&para;<br>The Missouri Supreme Court in turn affirmed that&para;<br>judgment, holding first that the dissipation of alcohol did&para;<br>not establish a per se exigency, and second that the State&para;<br>could not otherwise satisfy its burden of establishing&para;<br>exigent circumstances. 358 S.

See Pet. for Cert. i.&para;<br>Here and in its own courts the State based its case on&para;<br>an insistence that a driver who declines to submit to test­&para;<br>ing after being arrested for driving under the influence of&para;<br>alcohol is always subject to a nonconsensual blood test&para;<br>without any precondition for a warrant. That is incorrect.&para;<br>Although the Missouri Supreme Court referred to this&para;<br>case as “unquestionably a routine DWI case,” 358 S. W.&para;<br>3d, at 74, the fact that a particular drunk-driving stop is&para;<br>“routine” in the sense that it does not involve “ ‘special&para;<br>facts,’ ” ibid., such as the need for the police to attend to a&para;<br>car accident, does not mean a warrant is required. Other&para;<br>factors present in an ordinary traffic stop, such as the&para;<br>procedures in place for obtaining a warrant or the avail­&para;<br>ability of a magistrate judge, may affect whether the police&para;<br>can obtain a warrant in an expeditious way and therefore&para;<br>may establish an exigency that permits a warrantless&para;<br>search. The relevant factors in determining whether a&para;<br>warrantless search is reasonable, including the practical&para;<br>problems of obtaining a warrant within a timeframe that&para;<br>still preserves the opportunity to obtain reliable evidence,&para;<br>will no doubt vary depending upon the circumstances in&para;<br>the case.&para;<br>Because this case was argued on the broad proposition&para;<br>that drunk-driving cases present a per se exigency, the&para;<br>arguments and the record do not provide the Court with&para;<br>an adequate analytic framework for a detailed discussion&para;<br>of all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in&para;<br>determining the reasonableness of acting without a war­&para;<br>rant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol&para;<br>in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are&para;<br>among the factors that must be considered in deciding&para;<br>whether a warrant is required.

I have no quarrel with the Court’s “totality of the&para;<br>circumstances” approach as a general matter; that is what&para;<br>our cases require. But the circumstances in drunk driving&para;<br>cases are often typical, and the Court should be able to&para;<br>offer guidance on how police should handle cases like the&para;<br>one before us.&para;<br>In my view, the proper rule is straightforward. Our&para;<br>cases establish that there is an exigent circumstances&para;<br>exception to the warrant requirement. That exception&para;<br>applies when there is a compelling need to prevent the&para;<br>imminent destruction of important evidence, and there is&para;<br>no time to obtain a warrant. The natural dissipation of&para;<br>alcohol in the bloodstream constitutes not only the imminent but ongoing destruction of critical evidence. That&para;<br>would qualify as an exigent circumstance, except that&para;<br>there may be time to secure a warrant before blood can be&para;<br>drawn. If there is, an officer must seek a warrant. If an&para;<br>officer could reasonably conclude that there is not, the&para;<br>exigent circumstances exception applies by its terms, and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MISSOURI v. MCNEELY&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the blood may be drawn without a warrant.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment provides:&para;<br>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons,&para;<br>houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable&para;<br>searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no&para;<br>Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or&para;<br>things to be seized.”&para;<br>That language does not state that warrants are required&para;<br>prior to searches, but this Court has long held that warrants must generally be obtained. See Kentucky v. King,&para;<br>563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). We have also held&para;<br>that bodily intrusions like blood draws constitute searches&para;<br>and are subject to the warrant requirement.&para;<br>See&para;<br>Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 767, 770 (1966).&para;<br>However, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart,&para;<br>547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006), and thus “the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions,” King,&para;<br>563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). One of those exceptions is&para;<br>known as the “exigent circumstances exception,” which&para;<br>“applies when the exigencies of the situation make the&para;<br>needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless&para;<br>search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).&para;<br>Within the exigent circumstances exception, we have&para;<br>identified several sets of exigent circumstances excusing&para;<br>the need for a warrant. For example, there is an emergency&para;<br>aid exception to the warrant requirement. In Brigham&para;<br>City, supra, at 403, we held that “law enforcement officers&para;<br>may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant&para;<br>from imminent injury.” There is also a fire exception to&para;<br>the warrant requirement. In Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S.&para;<br>499, 509 (1978), we held that “[a] burning building clearly&para;<br>presents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render&para;<br>a warrantless entry ‘reasonable.’ ” And there is a hot pursuit exception to the warrant requirement as well. In&para;<br>United States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38 (1976), and Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 (1967), we&para;<br>recognized “the right of police, who had probable cause to&para;<br>believe that an armed robber had entered a house a few&para;<br>minutes before, to make a warrantless entry to arrest the&para;<br>robber and to search for weapons.” Santana, supra, at 42.&para;<br>In each of these cases, the requirement that we base our&para;<br>decision on the “totality of the circumstances” has not&para;<br>prevented us from spelling out a general rule for the police&para;<br>to follow.&para;<br>The exigency exception most on point here is the one for&para;<br>imminent destruction of evidence. We have affirmed on&para;<br>several occasions that “law enforcement officers may make&para;<br>a warrantless entry onto private property . . . to prevent&para;<br>the imminent destruction of evidence.” Brigham City,&para;<br>supra, at 403 (citing Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40&para;<br>(1963) (plurality opinion)); see also, e.g., King, supra, at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 6). For example, in Ker, the police had&para;<br>reason to believe that the defendant was in possession of&para;<br>marijuana and was expecting police pursuit. We upheld&para;<br>the officers’ warrantless entry into the defendant’s home,&para;<br>with the plurality explaining that the drugs “could be&para;<br>quickly and easily destroyed” or “distributed or hidden&para;<br>before a warrant could be obtained at that time of night.”&para;<br>374 U.

The question here is whether&para;<br>and how this principle applies in the typical case of a&para;<br>police officer stopping a driver on suspicion of drunk&para;<br>driving.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The reasonable belief that critical evidence is being&para;<br>destroyed gives rise to a compelling need for blood draws&para;<br>in cases like this one. Here, in fact, there is not simply&para;<br>a belief that any alcohol in the bloodstream will be destroyed; it is a biological certainty. Alcohol dissipates from&para;<br>the bloodstream at a rate of 0.01 percent to 0.025 percent&para;<br>per hour. Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol&para;<br>Analysis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 440 (L. Kobilinsky ed. 2012). Evidence is literally disappearing by the&para;<br>minute. That certainty makes this case an even stronger&para;<br>one than usual for application of the exigent circumstances&para;<br>exception.&para;<br>And that evidence is important. A serious and deadly&para;<br>crime is at issue. According to the Department of Transportation, in 2011, one person died every 53 minutes due&para;<br>to drinking and driving. National Highway Traffic Safety&para;<br>Admin. (NHTSA), Traffic Safety Facts, 2011 Data 1 (No.&para;<br>811700, Dec. 2012). No surprise then that drinking and&para;<br>driving is punished severely, including with jail time. See&para;<br>generally Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, L.&para;<br>Maruschak, Special Report, DWI Offenders under Correctional Supervision (1999).

All 50&para;<br>States and the District of Columbia have laws providing&para;<br>that it is per se illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08 percent&para;<br>or higher.

NHTSA, Digest&para;<br>of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws,&para;<br>pp. vii, x–xviii (No. 811673, Oct. 2012). BAC evidence&para;<br>clearly matters. And when drivers refuse breathalyzers,&para;<br>as McNeely did here, a blood draw becomes necessary to&para;<br>obtain that evidence.&para;<br>The need to prevent the imminent destruction of BAC&para;<br>evidence is no less compelling because the incriminating&para;<br>alcohol dissipates over a limited period of time, rather&para;<br>than all at once. As noted, the concentration of alcohol&para;<br>can make a difference not only between guilt and innocence, but between different crimes and different degrees&para;<br>of punishment. The officer is unlikely to know precisely&para;<br>when the suspect consumed alcohol or how much; all he&para;<br>knows is that critical evidence is being steadily lost. Fire&para;<br>can spread gradually, but that does not lessen the need&para;<br>and right of the officers to respond immediately. See&para;<br>Tyler, supra.&para;<br>McNeely contends that there is no compelling need for a&para;<br>warrantless blood draw, because if there is some alcohol&para;<br>left in the blood by the time a warrant is obtained, the&para;<br>State can use math and science to work backwards and&para;<br>identify a defendant’s BAC at the time he was driving.&para;<br>See Brief for Respondent 44–46. But that’s not good&para;<br>enough. We have indicated that exigent circumstances&para;<br>justify warrantless entry when drugs are about to be&para;<br>flushed down the toilet. See, e.g., King, 563 U. S., at ___–&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 7–8). We have not said that, because there&para;<br>could well be drug paraphernalia elsewhere in the home,&para;<br>or because a defendant’s co-conspirator might testify to&para;<br>the amount of drugs involved, the drugs themselves are&para;<br>not crucial and there is no compelling need for warrantless&para;<br>entry.&para;<br>The same approach should govern here. There is a&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MISSOURI v. MCNEELY&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>compelling need to search because alcohol—the nearly&para;<br>conclusive evidence of a serious crime—is dissipating from&para;<br>the bloodstream. The need is no less compelling because&para;<br>the police might be able to acquire second-best evidence&para;<br>some other way.1&para;<br>B&para;<br>For exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless&para;<br>search, however, there must also be “no time to secure a&para;<br>warrant.” Tyler, 436 U. S., at 509; see Schmerber, 384&para;<br>U. S., at 771 (warrantless search legal when “there was no&para;<br>time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant”). In&para;<br>this respect, obtaining a blood sample from a suspected&para;<br>drunk driver differs from other exigent circumstances&para;<br>cases.&para;<br>Importantly, there is typically delay between the moment a drunk driver is stopped and the time his blood can&para;<br>be drawn. Drunk drivers often end up in an emergency&para;<br>room, but they are not usually pulled over in front of one.&para;<br>In most exigent circumstances situations, police are just&para;<br>outside the door to a home. Inside, evidence is about to be&para;<br>destroyed, a person is about to be injured, or a fire has&para;<br>broken out. Police can enter promptly and must do so to&para;<br>respond effectively to the emergency. But when police pull&para;<br>a person over on suspicion of drinking and driving, they&para;<br>cannot test his blood right away.2 There is a time——————&para;<br>1 And&para;<br>&para;<br>that second-best evidence may prove useless. When experts&para;<br>have worked backwards to identify a defendant’s BAC at the time he&para;<br>was driving, defense attorneys have objected to that evidence, courts&para;<br>have at times rejected it, and juries may be suspicious of it. See, e.g., 1&para;<br>D. Nichols &amp; F. Whited, Drinking/Driving Litigation §2:9, pp. 2–130 to&para;<br>2–137 (2d ed. 2006) (noting counsel objections to such evidence); State&para;<br>v.

In this case, for example, approximately 25&para;<br>minutes elapsed between the time the police stopped&para;<br>McNeely and the time his blood was drawn. App. 36, 38.&para;<br>As noted, the fact that alcohol dissipates gradually from&para;<br>the bloodstream does not diminish the compelling need for&para;<br>a search—critical evidence is still disappearing. But the&para;<br>fact that the dissipation persists for some time means that&para;<br>the police—although they may not be able to do anything&para;<br>about it right away—may still be able to respond to the&para;<br>ongoing destruction of evidence later on.&para;<br>There might, therefore, be time to obtain a warrant in&para;<br>many cases. As the Court explains, police can often request warrants rather quickly these days. At least 30&para;<br>States provide for electronic warrant applications. See&para;<br>ante, at 10–12, and n. 4.

We have already held that forced blood draws&para;<br>can be constitutional—that such searches can be reasonable—&para;<br>but that does not change the fact that they are significant&para;<br>bodily intrusions. See Schmerber, 384 U.

Requiring a warrant whenever practicable helps&para;<br>ensure that when blood draws occur, they are indeed&para;<br>justified.&para;<br>At the same time, permitting the police to act without a&para;<br>warrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence&para;<br>is well established in Fourth Amendment law. There is no&para;<br>reason to preclude application of that exception in drunk&para;<br>driving cases simply because it may take the police some&para;<br>time to be able to respond to the undoubted destruction of&para;<br>evidence, or because the destruction occurs continuously&para;<br>over an uncertain period.&para;<br>And that is so even in situations where police have&para;<br>requested a warrant but do not receive a timely response.&para;<br>An officer who reasonably concluded there was no time to&para;<br>secure a warrant may have blood drawn from a suspect&para;<br>upon arrival at a medical facility.

The difference is that the majority offers no additional guidance, merely instructing courts and police&para;<br>officers to consider the totality of the circumstances.

See ante, at 14. That is&para;<br>not plausible: Police and prosecutors need warrants in a&para;<br>wide variety of situations, and often need them quickly.&para;<br>They certainly would not prefer a slower process, just&para;<br>because that might obviate the need to ask for a warrant&para;<br>in the occasional drunk driving case in which a blood draw&para;<br>is necessary. The plurality’s suggestion also overlooks the&para;<br>interest of law enforcement in the protection a warrant&para;<br>provides.&para;<br>The Court is correct when it says that every case must&para;<br>be considered on its particular facts. But the pertinent&para;<br>facts in drunk driving cases are often the same, and the&para;<br>police should know how to act in recurring factual situations. Simply put, when a drunk driving suspect fails field&para;<br>sobriety tests and refuses a breathalyzer, whether a warrant is required for a blood draw should come down to&para;<br>whether there is time to secure one.&para;<br>Schmerber itself provides support for such an analysis.&para;<br>The Court there made much of the fact that “there was no&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

In that case, the Court recognized&para;<br>that destruction of evidence is inherent in drunk-driving&para;<br>cases and held that an officer investigating a drunk­&para;<br>driving crime “might reasonably [believe] that he [is]&para;<br>confronted with an emergency, in which the delay neces­&para;<br>sary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threat­&para;<br>en[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Ibid.

Id., at 296. Following a Fourth Amendment&para;<br>challenge to this search, the Court held that the “ready&para;<br>destructibility of the evidence” and the suspect’s observed&para;<br>efforts to destroy it “justified the police in subjecting him&para;<br>to the very limited search necessary to preserve the highly&para;<br>evanescent evidence they found under his fingernails.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>In this case, a similar exigency is present. Just as the&para;<br>suspect’s efforts to destroy “highly evanescent evidence”&para;<br>gave rise to the exigency in Cupp, the natural metaboliza­&para;<br>tion of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) creates an exi­&para;<br>gency once police have probable cause to believe the driver&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Neither&para;<br>&para;<br>party has challenged this determination, which this Court&para;<br>has reaffirmed several times.

It naturally follows that police may conduct a&para;<br>search in these circumstances.&para;<br>A hypothetical involving classic exigent circumstances&para;<br>further illustrates the point. Officers are watching a&para;<br>warehouse and observe a worker carrying bundles from&para;<br>the warehouse to a large bonfire and throwing them into&para;<br>the blaze. The officers have probable cause to believe&para;<br>the bundles contain marijuana. Because there is only one&para;<br>person carrying the bundles, the officers believe it will&para;<br>take hours to completely destroy the drugs. During that&para;<br>time the officers likely could obtain a warrant. But it is&para;<br>clear that the officers need not sit idly by and watch the&para;<br>destruction of evidence while they wait for a warrant. The&para;<br>fact that it will take time for the evidence to be destroyed&para;<br>and that some evidence may remain by the time the offi­&para;<br>cers secure a warrant are not relevant to the exigency.&para;<br>However, the ever-diminishing quantity of drugs may&para;<br>have an impact on the severity of the crime and the&para;<br>length of the sentence. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(D)&para;<br>(lower penalties for less than 50 kilograms of marijuana);&para;<br>United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual&para;<br>§2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2012) (drug quantity table tying base&para;<br>offense level to drug amounts). Conducting a warrantless&para;<br>search of the warehouse in this situation would be entirely&para;<br>reasonable.&para;<br>The same obtains in the drunk-driving context. Just&para;<br>because it will take time for the evidence to be completely&para;<br>destroyed does not mean there is no exigency. Congress&para;<br>has conditioned federal highway grants on states’ adoption&para;<br>of laws penalizing the operation of a motor vehicle “with a&para;<br>blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or greater.” 23&para;<br>U.

That inquiry is&para;<br>inconsistent with the actual exigency at issue: the un­&para;<br>contested destruction of evidence due to metabolization of&para;<br>alcohol. See Part I, supra. Moreover, the Court’s facts­&para;<br>and-circumstances analysis will be difficult to administer,&para;<br>a particularly important concern in the Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment context.&para;<br>The Court’s judgment reflects nothing more than a&para;<br>vague notion that everything will come out right most of&para;<br>the time so long as the delay is not too lengthy.

This belief must rest&para;<br>on the assumption that whatever evidence remains once a&para;<br>warrant is obtained will be sufficient to prosecute the&para;<br>suspect.

Even a slight delay may significantly affect pro­&para;<br>bative value in borderline cases of suspects who are mod­&para;<br>erately intoxicated or suspects whose BAC is near a statu­&para;<br>tory threshold that triggers a more serious offense. See&para;<br>supra, at 4–5 (discussing laws penalizing heightened BAC&para;<br>levels). Similarly, the time to obtain a warrant can be ex­&para;<br>pected to vary, and there is no reason to believe it will&para;<br>do so in a predictable fashion.&para;<br>Further, the Court nowhere explains how an officer in&para;<br>the field is to apply the facts-and-circumstances test it&para;<br>adopts. First, officers do not have the facts needed to&para;<br>assess how much time can pass before too little evidence&para;<br>remains. They will never know how intoxicated a suspect&para;<br>is at the time of arrest. Otherwise, there would be no need&para;<br>for testing. Second, they will not know how long it will&para;<br>take to roust a magistrate from his bed, reach the hospital,&para;<br>or obtain a blood sample once there. As the Minnesota&para;<br>Supreme Court recognized in rejecting arguments like&para;<br>those adopted by the Court today:&para;<br>“[T]he officer has no control over how long it would&para;<br>take to travel to a judge or the judge’s availability.&para;<br>The officer also may not know the time of the sus­&para;<br>pect’s last drink, the amount of alcohol consumed, or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the rate at which the suspect will metabolize alcohol.&para;<br>Finally, an officer cannot know how long it will take to&para;<br>obtain the blood sample once the suspect is brought&para;<br>to the hospital. Under a totality of the circumstances&para;<br>test, an officer would be called upon to speculate on&para;<br>each of these considerations and predict how long the&para;<br>most probative evidence of the defendant’s blood­&para;<br>alcohol level would continue to exist before a blood&para;<br>sample was no longer reliable.” State v. Shriner, 751&para;<br>N. W. 2d 538, 549 (2008) (footnote omitted).&para;<br>The Court should not adopt a rule that requires police to&para;<br>guess whether they will be able to obtain a warrant before&para;<br>“too much” evidence is destroyed, for the police lack reliable information concerning the relevant variables.2&para;<br>This case demonstrates the uncertainty officers face&para;<br>with regard to the delay caused by obtaining a warrant.&para;<br>The arresting officer clearly had probable cause to believe&para;<br>respondent was drunk, but there was no way for the of­&para;<br>ficer to quantify the level of intoxication to determine how&para;<br>quickly he needed to act in order to obtain probative evi­&para;<br>dence. Another officer testified at respondent’s trial that&para;<br>it typically took 1 ½ to 2 hours to obtain a drunk-driving&para;<br>warrant at night in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri.&para;<br>See App. 53–54. Respondent submitted an exhibit sum­&para;<br>marizing six late afternoon and nighttime drunk-driving&para;<br>search warrants that suggests the time may be shorter.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Because the Court’s position is likely to result in delay in obtaining&para;<br>BAC evidence, it also increases the likelihood that prosecutors will be&para;<br>forced to estimate the amount of alcohol in a defendant’s bloodstream&para;<br>using BAC numbers obtained hours later. In practice, this backwards&para;<br>extrapolation is likely to devolve into a battle of the experts, as each&para;<br>side seeks to show that stale evidence supports its position. There is no&para;<br>need for this outcome. Police facing inevitable destruction situations&para;<br>need not forgo collecting the most accurate available evidence simply&para;<br>because they might be able to use an expert witness and less persuasive&para;<br>evidence to approximate what they lost.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MISSOURI v. MCNEELY&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 56; App. 70. Ultimately this factual&para;<br>tiff is beside the point; the spotty evidence regarding&para;<br>timing itself illustrates the fact that delays in obtaining&para;<br>warrants are unpredictable and potentially lengthy. A&para;<br>rule that requires officers (and ultimately courts) to bal­&para;<br>ance transportation delays, hospital availability, and access to magistrates is not a workable rule for cases where&para;<br>natural processes inevitably destroy the evidence with&para;<br>every passing minute.&para;<br>The availability of telephonic warrant applications is&para;<br>not an answer to this conundrum. See ante, at 10–12,&para;<br>and n. 4. For one thing, Missouri still requires written&para;<br>warrant applications and affidavits, Mo. Ann. Stat.&para;<br>§§542.276.2(1), 542.276.2.3 (West Supp. 2012), rendering&para;<br>the Court’s 50-State survey irrelevant to the actual dispo­&para;<br>sition of this case. Ante, at 11, n. 4. But even if telephonic&para;<br>applications were available in Missouri, the same difficul­&para;<br>ties would arise. As the majority correctly recognizes,&para;<br>“[w]arrants inevitably take some time for police officers&para;<br>or prosecutors to complete and for magistrate judges to&para;<br>review.” Ante, at 12. During that time, evidence is de­&para;<br>stroyed, and police who have probable cause to believe a&para;<br>crime has been committed should not have to guess how&para;<br>long it will take to secure a warrant.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>* &para;<br>&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
