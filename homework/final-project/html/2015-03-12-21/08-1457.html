NATIONAL LABOR &para;<br>&para;<br>RELATIONS BOARD &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1457. Argued March 23, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010&para;<br>The Taft-Hartley Act increased the size of the National Labor Relations&para;<br>Board (Board) from three members to five, see 29 U. S. C. §153(a),&para;<br>and amended §3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act to increase&para;<br>the Board’s quorum requirement from two members to three and to&para;<br>allow the Board to delegate its authority to groups of at least three&para;<br>members, see §153(b). In December 2007, the Board—finding itself&para;<br>with only four members and expecting two more vacancies—&para;<br>delegated, inter alia, its powers to a group of three members. On De&para;<br>cember 31, one group member’s appointment expired, but the others&para;<br>proceeded to issue Board decisions for the next 27 months as a two&para;<br>member quorum of a three-member group. Two of those decisions&para;<br>sustained unfair labor practice complaints against petitioner, which&para;<br>sought review, challenging the two-member Board’s authority to is&para;<br>sue orders. The Seventh Circuit ruled for the Government, conclud&para;<br>ing that the two members constituted a valid quorum of a three&para;<br>member group to which the Board had legitimately delegated its&para;<br>powers.&para;<br>Held: Section 3(b) requires that a delegee group maintain a member&para;<br>ship of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the Board.&para;<br>Pp. 4–14.&para;<br>(a) The first sentence of §3(b), the so-called delegation clause, au&para;<br>thorizes the Board to delegate its powers only to a “group of three or&para;<br>more members.” This clause is best read to require that the delegee&para;<br>group maintain a membership of three in order for the delegation to&para;<br>remain valid. First, that is the only way to harmonize and give&para;<br>meaningful effect to all of §3(b)’s provisions: (1) the delegation clause;&para;<br>(2) the vacancy clause, which provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of&para;<br>the powers of the Board”; (3) the Board quorum requirement, which&para;<br>mandates that “three members of the Board shall, at all times, con&para;<br>stitute a quorum of the Board”; and (4) the group quorum provision,&para;<br>which provides that “two members shall constitute a quorum” of any&para;<br>delegee group. This reading is consonant with the Board quorum re&para;<br>quirement of three participating members “at all times,” and it gives&para;<br>material effect to the delegation clause’s three-member rule. It also&para;<br>permits the vacancy clause to operate to provide that vacancies do&para;<br>not impair the Board’s ability to take action, so long as the quorum is&para;<br>satisfied. And it does not render inoperative the group quorum pro&para;<br>vision, which continues to authorize a properly constituted three&para;<br>member delegee group to issue a decision with only two members&para;<br>participating when one is disqualified from a case. The Govern&para;<br>ment’s contrary reading allows two members to act as the Board ad&para;<br>infinitum, dramatically undercutting the Board quorum require&para;<br>ment’s significance by allowing its permanent circumvention. It also&para;<br>diminishes the delegation clause’s three-member requirement by&para;<br>permitting a de facto two-member delegation. By allowing the Board&para;<br>to include a third member in the group for only one minute before her&para;<br>term expires, this approach also gives no meaningful effect to the&para;<br>command implicit in both the delegation clause and the Board quo&para;<br>rum requirement that the Board’s full power be vested in no fewer&para;<br>than three members. Second, had Congress intended to authorize&para;<br>two members to act on an ongoing basis, it could have used straight&para;<br>forward language. The Court’s interpretation is consistent with the&para;<br>Board’s longstanding practice of reconstituting a delegee group when&para;<br>one group member’s term expired. Pp. 4–9.&para;<br>(b) The Government’s several arguments against the Court’s inter&para;<br>pretation—that the group quorum requirement and vacancy clause&para;<br>together permit two members of a three-member group to constitute&para;<br>a quorum even when there is no third member; that the vacancy&para;<br>clause establishes that a vacancy in the group has no effect; and that&para;<br>reading the statute to authorize the Board to act with only two mem&para;<br>bers advances the congressional objective of Board efficiency—are&para;<br>unconvincing.

See 29 U. S. C. §153(a). Concur&para;<br>rent with that change, the Taft-Hartley Act amended §3(b)&para;<br>of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to increase&para;<br>the quorum requirement for the Board from two members&para;<br>to three, and to allow the Board to delegate its authority to&para;<br>groups of at least three members. See §153(b). The ques&para;<br>tion in this case is whether, following a delegation of the&para;<br>Board’s powers to a three-member group, two members&para;<br>may continue to exercise that delegated authority once the&para;<br>group’s (and the Board’s) membership falls to two. We&para;<br>hold that two remaining Board members cannot exercise&para;<br>such authority.&para;<br>I&para;<br>As 2007 came to a close, the Board found itself with four&para;<br>members and one vacancy. It anticipated two more vacan&para;<br>cies at the end of the year, when the recess appointments&para;<br>of Members Kirsanow and Walsh were set to expire, which&para;<br>would leave the Board with only two members—too few to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>meet the Board’s quorum requirement, §153(b). The four&para;<br>sitting members decided to take action in an effort to&para;<br>preserve the Board’s authority to function. On December&para;<br>20, 2007, the Board made two delegations of its authority,&para;<br>effective as of midnight December 28, 2007. First, the&para;<br>Board delegated to the general counsel continuing author&para;<br>ity to initiate and conduct litigation that would normally&para;<br>require case-by-case approval of the Board. See Minute of&para;<br>Board Action (Dec. 20, 2007), App. to Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>4a–5a (hereinafter Board Minutes). Second, the Board&para;<br>delegated “to Members Liebman, Schaumber and Kir&para;<br>sanow, as a three-member group, all of the Board’s pow&para;<br>ers, in anticipation of the adjournment of the 1st Session&para;<br>of the 110th Congress.” Id., at 5a. The Board expressed&para;<br>the opinion that its action would permit the remaining two&para;<br>members to exercise the powers of the Board “after [the]&para;<br>departure of Members Kirsanow and Walsh, because the&para;<br>remaining Members will constitute a quorum of the three&para;<br>member group.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Board’s minutes explain that it relied on “the statu&para;<br>tory language” of §3(b), as well as an opinion issued by the&para;<br>Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), for the proposition that the&para;<br>Board may use this delegation procedure to “issue deci&para;<br>sions during periods when three or more of the five seats&para;<br>on the Board are vacant.” Id., at 6a. The OLC had con&para;<br>cluded in 2003 that “if the Board delegated all of its pow&para;<br>ers to a group of three members, that group could continue&para;<br>to issue decisions and orders as long as a quorum of two&para;<br>members remained.” Dept. of Justice, OLC, Quorum&para;<br>Requirements, App. to Brief for Respondent 3a. In seek&para;<br>ing the OLC’s advice, the Board agreed to accept the&para;<br>OLC’s answer regarding its ability to operate with only&para;<br>two members, id., at 1a, n. 1, and the Board in its minutes&para;<br>therefore “acknowledged that it is bound” by the OLC&para;<br>opinion. Board Minutes 6a. The Board noted, however,&para;<br>that it was not bound to make this delegation; rather, it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>had “decided to exercise its discretion” to do so. Ibid.&para;<br>On December 28, 2007, the Board’s delegation to the&para;<br>three-member group of Members Liebman, Schaumber,&para;<br>and Kirsanow became effective. On December 31, 2007,&para;<br>Member Kirsanow’s recess appointment expired. Thus,&para;<br>starting on January 1, 2008, Members Liebman and&para;<br>Schaumber became the only members of the Board. They&para;<br>proceeded to issue decisions for the Board as a two&para;<br>member quorum of a three-member group. The delegation&para;<br>automatically terminated on March 27, 2010, when the&para;<br>President made two recess appointments to the Board,&para;<br>because the terms of the delegation specified that it would&para;<br>be revoked when the Board’s membership returned to at&para;<br>least three members, id., at 7a.&para;<br>During the 27-month period in which the Board had&para;<br>only two members, it decided almost 600 cases. See Letter&para;<br>from Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter,&para;<br>Clerk of Court (Apr. 26, 2010). One of those cases involved&para;<br>petitioner New Process Steel. In September 2008, the two&para;<br>member Board issued decisions sustaining two unfair&para;<br>labor practice complaints against petitioner. See New&para;<br>Process Steel, LP, 353 N. L. R. B. No. 25 (2008); New Proc&para;<br>ess Steel, LP, 353 N. L. R. B. No. 13 (2008). Petitioner&para;<br>sought review of both orders in the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit, and challenged the authority of the&para;<br>two-member Board to issue the orders.&para;<br>The court ruled in favor of the Government. After a&para;<br>review of the text and legislative history of §3(b) and the&para;<br>sequence of events surrounding the delegation of authority&para;<br>in December 2007, the court concluded that the then&para;<br>sitting two members constituted a valid quorum of a&para;<br>three-member group to which the Board had legitimately&para;<br>delegated all its powers. 564 F. 3d 840, 845–847 (CA7&para;<br>2009). On the same day that the Seventh Circuit issued&para;<br>its decision in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Dis&para;<br>trict of Columbia announced a decision coming to the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L.

We granted&para;<br>certiorari to resolve the conflict.1 558 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Board’s quorum requirements and delegation pro&para;<br>cedure are set forth in §3(b) of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 451, as&para;<br>amended by 61 Stat. 139, which provides:&para;<br>“The Board is authorized to delegate to any group of&para;<br>three or more members any or all of the powers which&para;<br>it may itself exercise. . . . A vacancy in the Board&para;<br>shall not impair the right of the remaining members&para;<br>to exercise all of the powers of the Board, and three&para;<br>members of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a&para;<br>quorum of the Board, except that two members shall&para;<br>constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant&para;<br>to the first sentence hereof.” 29 U. S. C. §153(b).&para;<br>It is undisputed that the first sentence of this provision&para;<br>authorized the Board to delegate its powers to the three&para;<br>member group effective on December 28, 2007, and the&para;<br>last sentence authorized two members of that group to act&para;<br>as a quorum of the group during the next three days if, for&para;<br>example, the third member had to recuse himself from a&para;<br>particular matter. The question we face is whether those&para;<br>two members could continue to act for the Board as a&para;<br>quorum of the delegee group after December 31, 2007,&para;<br>when the Board’s membership fell to two and the desig&para;<br>nated three-member group of “Members Liebman,&para;<br>Schaumber, and Kirsanow” ceased to exist due to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Several other Courts of Appeals reached the same conclusion as the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit, although not always following the same reasoning.&para;<br>See Northeastern Land Servs., Ltd. v.

Construing §3(b)&para;<br>as a whole and in light of the Board’s longstanding prac&para;<br>tice, we are persuaded that they could not.&para;<br>The first sentence of §3(b), which we will call the delega&para;<br>tion clause, provides that the Board may delegate its&para;<br>powers only to a “group of three or more members.” 61&para;<br>Stat. 139. There are two different ways to interpret that&para;<br>language. One interpretation, put forward by the Gov&para;<br>ernment, would read the clause to require only that a&para;<br>delegee group contain three members at the precise time&para;<br>the Board delegates its powers, and to have no continuing&para;<br>relevance after the moment of the initial delegation.&para;<br>Under that reading, two members alone may exercise the&para;<br>full power of the Board so long as they were part of a&para;<br>delegee group that, at the time of its creation, included&para;<br>three members. The other interpretation, by contrast,&para;<br>would read the clause as requiring that the delegee group&para;<br>maintain a membership of three in order for the delega&para;<br>tion to remain valid. Three main reasons support the&para;<br>latter reading.&para;<br>First, and most fundamentally, reading the delegation&para;<br>clause to require that the Board’s delegated power be&para;<br>vested continuously in a group of three members is the&para;<br>only way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of&para;<br>the provisions in §3(b). See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.&para;<br>167, 174 (2001) (declining to adopt a “construction of the&para;<br>statute, [that] would render [a term] insignificant”); Mar&para;<br>ket Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U. S. 112, 115–116 (1879) (“[A]&para;<br>statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it&para;<br>can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be . . .&para;<br>insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those&para;<br>provisions are: (1) the delegation clause; (2) the vacancy&para;<br>clause, which provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall&para;<br>not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise&para;<br>all of the powers of the Board”; (3) the Board quorum&para;<br>requirement, which mandates that “three members of the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Board shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the&para;<br>Board”; and (4) the group quorum provision, which pro&para;<br>vides that “two members shall constitute a quorum” of any&para;<br>delegee group. See §153(b).&para;<br>Interpreting the statute to require the Board’s powers to&para;<br>be vested at all times in a group of at least three members&para;<br>is consonant with the Board quorum requirement, which&para;<br>requires three participating members “at all times” for the&para;<br>Board to act. The interpretation likewise gives material&para;<br>effect to the three-member requirement in the delegation&para;<br>clause. The vacancy clause still operates to provide that&para;<br>vacancies do not impair the ability of the Board to take&para;<br>action, so long as the quorum is satisfied. And the inter&para;<br>pretation does not render inoperative the group quorum&para;<br>provision, which still operates to authorize a three&para;<br>member delegee group to issue a decision with only two&para;<br>members participating, so long as the delegee group was&para;<br>properly constituted. Reading §3(b) in this manner, the&para;<br>statute’s various pieces hang together—a critical clue that&para;<br>this reading is a sound one.&para;<br>The contrary reading, on the other hand, allows two&para;<br>members to act as the Board ad infinitum, which dramati&para;<br>cally undercuts the significance of the Board quorum&para;<br>requirement by allowing its permanent circumvention.&para;<br>That reading also makes the three-member requirement&para;<br>in the delegation clause of vanishing significance, because&para;<br>it allows a de facto delegation to a two-member group, as&para;<br>happened in this case. Under the Government’s approach,&para;<br>it would satisfy the statute for the Board to include a third&para;<br>member in the group for only one minute before her term&para;<br>expires; the approach gives no meaningful effect to the&para;<br>command implicit in both the delegation clause and in the&para;<br>Board quorum requirement that the Board’s full power be&para;<br>vested in no fewer than three members. Hence, while the&para;<br>Government’s reading of the delegation clause is textually&para;<br>permissible in a narrow sense, it is structurally implausi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ble, as it would render two of §3(b)’s provisions function&para;<br>ally void.&para;<br>Second, and relatedly, if Congress had intended to&para;<br>authorize two members alone to act for the Board on an&para;<br>ongoing basis, it could have said so in straightforward&para;<br>language. Congress instead imposed the requirement that&para;<br>the Board delegate authority to no fewer than three mem&para;<br>bers, and that it have three participating members to&para;<br>constitute a quorum. Those provisions are at best an&para;<br>unlikely way of conveying congressional approval of a two&para;<br>member Board. Indeed, had Congress wanted to provide&para;<br>for two members alone to act as the Board, it could have&para;<br>maintained the NLRA’s original two-member Board quo&para;<br>rum provision, see 29 U. S. C. §153(b) (1946 ed.), or pro&para;<br>vided for a delegation of the Board’s authority to groups of&para;<br>two. The Rube Goldberg-style delegation mechanism&para;<br>employed by the Board in 2007—delegating to a group of&para;<br>three, allowing a term to expire, and then continuing with&para;<br>a two-member quorum of a phantom delegee group—is&para;<br>surely a bizarre way for the Board to achieve the authority&para;<br>to decide cases with only two members. To conclude that&para;<br>Congress intended to authorize such a procedure to con&para;<br>travene the three-member Board quorum, we would need&para;<br>some evidence of that intent.&para;<br>The Government has not adduced any convincing evi&para;<br>dence on this front, and to the contrary, our interpretation&para;<br>is consistent with the longstanding practice of the Board.&para;<br>This is the third factor driving our decision. Although the&para;<br>Board has throughout its history allowed two members of&para;<br>a three-member group to issue decisions when one mem&para;<br>ber of a group was disqualified from a case, see Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 20; Board Minutes 6a, the Board has not&para;<br>(until recently) allowed two members to act as a quorum of&para;<br>a defunct three-member group.2 Instead, the Board con&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 When&para;<br>&para;<br>one member of a group is disqualified, only two members&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cedes that its practice was to reconstitute a delegee group&para;<br>when one group member’s term expired. Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 39, n. 27.3 That our interpretation of the delegation&para;<br>provision is consistent with the Board’s longstanding&para;<br>practice is persuasive evidence that it is the correct one,&para;<br>notwithstanding the Board’s more recent view. See Bowen&para;<br>v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 214 (1988).&para;<br>In sum, a straightforward understanding of the text,&para;<br>which requires that no fewer than three members be&para;<br>vested with the Board’s full authority, coupled with the&para;<br>Board’s longstanding practice, points us toward an inter&para;<br>pretation of the delegation clause that requires a delegee&para;<br>group to maintain a membership of three.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Against these points, the Government makes several&para;<br>arguments that we find unconvincing. It first argues that&para;<br>§3(b) authorizes the Board’s action by its plain terms,&para;<br>notwithstanding the somewhat fictional nature of the&para;<br>delegation to a three-member group with the expectation&para;<br>that within days it would become a two-member group. In&para;<br>——————&para;<br>actually participate in the decision. That circumstance thus also&para;<br>presents the problem of the possible inferiority of two-member deci&para;<br>sionmaking. That the Board found it necessary to reconstitute groups&para;<br>only when there was a vacancy, and not when there was a disqualifica&para;<br>tion, suggests that its practice was driven by more than its belief in&para;<br>the “superiority of three-member groups,” post, at 10 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>3 It also has not been the Board’s practice to issue decisions when the&para;<br>Board’s membership has fallen to two. For about a 2-month period in&para;<br>1993–1994, and a 1-month period in 2001–2002, the Board had only&para;<br>two members and did not issue decisions. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 4.&para;<br>In 2005, the Board did delegate its authority to a three-member group,&para;<br>of which two members issued a few orders as a quorum during a 3-day&para;<br>period in which the Board’s (and the group’s) membership fell below&para;<br>three. Ibid. But the two-member Board at issue in this case, extending&para;<br>over two years, is unprecedented in the history of the post-Taft-Hartley&para;<br>Board.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>particular, the Government contends the group quorum&para;<br>requirement and the vacancy clause together make clear&para;<br>that when the Board has delegated its power to a three&para;<br>member group, “any two members of that group constitute&para;<br>a quorum that may continue to exercise the delegated&para;<br>powers, regardless whether the third group member . . .&para;<br>continues to sit on the Board” and regardless “whether a&para;<br>quorum remains in the full Board.” Brief for Respondent&para;<br>17; see also id., at 20–23.&para;<br>Although the group quorum provision clearly authorizes&para;<br>two members to act as a quorum of a “group designated&para;<br>pursuant to the first sentence”—i.e., a group of at least&para;<br>three members—it does not, by its plain terms, authorize&para;<br>two members to constitute a valid delegee group. A quo&para;<br>rum is the number of members of a larger body that must&para;<br>participate for the valid transaction of business. See&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 1370 (9th ed. 2009) (defining&para;<br>“quorum” as the “minimum number of members . . . who&para;<br>must be present for a deliberative assembly to legally&para;<br>transact business”); 13 Oxford English Dictionary 51 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1989) (“A fixed number of members of any body . . .&para;<br>whose presence is necessary for the proper or valid trans&para;<br>action of business”); Webster’s New International Diction&para;<br>ary 2046 (2d ed. 1954) (“Such a number of the officers or&para;<br>members of any body as is, when duly assembled, legally&para;<br>competent to transact business”). But the fact that there&para;<br>are sufficient members participating to constitute a quo&para;<br>rum does not necessarily establish that the larger body is&para;<br>properly constituted or can validly exercise authority.4 In&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Nor does failure to meet a quorum requirement necessarily establish&para;<br>that an entity’s power is suspended so that it can be exercised by no&para;<br>delegee. The requisite membership of an organization, and the number&para;<br>of members who must participate for it to take an action, are two&para;<br>separate (albeit related) characteristics.

It is true that any vacancy in the&para;<br>group is necessarily also a vacancy in the Board (although&para;<br>the converse is not true), and that a group exercises the&para;<br>(delegated) “powers of the Board.” But §3(b) explicitly&para;<br>distinguishes between a group and the Board throughout,&para;<br>and in light of that distinction we do not think “Board”&para;<br>should be read to include “group” when doing so would&para;<br>negate for all practical purposes the command that&para;<br>a delegation must be made to a group of at least three&para;<br>members.&para;<br>Some courts have nonetheless interpreted the quorum&para;<br>and vacancy provisions of §3(b) by analogizing to an appel&para;<br>late panel, which may decide a case even though only two&para;<br>of the three initially assigned judges remain on the panel.&para;<br>See Photo-Sonics, Inc. v.

Moreover, our reading&para;<br>of the court of appeals quorum provision was informed by&para;<br>the longstanding practice of allowing two judges from the&para;<br>initial panel to proceed to judgment in the case of a va&para;<br>cancy, see ibid., and as we have already explained, the&para;<br>Board’s practice has been precisely the opposite.&para;<br>Finally, we are not persuaded by the Government’s&para;<br>argument that we should read the statute to authorize the&para;<br>Board to act with only two members in order to advance&para;<br>the congressional objective of Board efficiency.

Our reading of the statute gives effect to those pro&para;<br>visions without rendering any other provision of the stat&para;<br>ute superfluous: The delegation clause still operates to&para;<br>allow the Board to act in panels of three, and the group&para;<br>quorum provision still operates to allow any panel to issue&para;<br>a decision by only two members if one member is disquali&para;<br>fied. Our construction is also consistent with the Board’s&para;<br>longstanding practice with respect to delegee groups. We&para;<br>thus hold that the delegation clause requires that a&para;<br>delegee group maintain a membership of three in order to&para;<br>exercise the delegated authority of the Board.&para;<br>We are not insensitive to the Board’s understandable&para;<br>desire to keep its doors open despite vacancies.7 Nor are&para;<br>——————&para;<br>erly constituted delegee group issues a decision for the Board in a&para;<br>particular case.

These reasons, and those to be&para;<br>further discussed, inform this respectful dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Board, by statute, consists of five members. 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §153(a). Section 153(b) provides a mechanism in&para;<br>which the Board can delegate all of its powers to a three&para;<br>member group. As relevant here, the statute consists of&para;<br>three parts. First, a delegation clause:&para;<br>“The Board is authorized to delegate to any group of&para;<br>three or more members any or all of the powers which&para;<br>it may itself exercise.”&para;<br>Then, a vacancy clause:&para;<br>“A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the right of&para;<br>the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of&para;<br>the Board . . . .”&para;<br>And finally, immediately following the vacancy clause, are&para;<br>the Board and group quorum provisions:&para;<br>“[A]nd three members of the Board shall, at all times,&para;<br>constitute a quorum of the Board, except that two&para;<br>members shall constitute a quorum of any group des&para;<br>ignated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.”&para;<br>As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 4, the three&para;<br>member group of Members Liebman, Schaumber, and&para;<br>Kirsanow were a “group designated pursuant to the first&para;<br>sentence” of §153(b). As such, a two-member quorum of&para;<br>that group had statutory authorization to issue orders;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and that is precisely what Members Liebman and&para;<br>Schaumber did. Because the group was properly desig&para;<br>nated under §153(b) and a two-member quorum of the&para;<br>group was authorized to act under the statute’s plain&para;<br>terms, its actions were lawful. See Connecticut Nat. Bank&para;<br>v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254 (1992) (“[I]n interpret&para;<br>ing a statute a court should always turn first to one, car&para;<br>dinal canon before all others. . . . [C]ourts must presume&para;<br>that a legislature says in a statute what it means and&para;<br>means in a statute what it says”).&para;<br>Nothing in the statute suggests that a delegation to a&para;<br>three-member group expires when one member’s seat&para;<br>becomes vacant, as the Court holds today. In other con&para;<br>texts, it is settled law that a vacancy in a delegee group&para;<br>does not void the initial delegation. See Nguyen v. United&para;<br>States, 539 U. S. 69, 82 (2003) (concerning vacancies in&para;<br>three-member panels of the courts of appeals). Any doubt&para;<br>on that point should be resolved by this specific statutory&para;<br>instruction: “A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the&para;<br>right of the remaining members to exercise all of the&para;<br>powers of the Board.” Members Liebman and Schaumber&para;<br>were exercising the powers of the Board as its remaining&para;<br>members; yet the Court today holds that the vacancy&para;<br>impaired their right to exercise those powers in hundreds&para;<br>of cases. That conclusion is contrary to the statutory&para;<br>mandate.&para;<br>By its holding, the Court rejects a straightforward read&para;<br>ing that it acknowledges is “textually permissible.” Ante,&para;<br>at 6. It does so because, in its view, it is “structurally&para;<br>implausible.” Ante, at 6−7. But the only textually permis&para;<br>sible reading of §153(b) authorizes a two-member quorum&para;<br>of a delegee group to issue orders, as was done here; and&para;<br>in any event there is no structural implausibility in read&para;<br>ing the statute according to its plain terms.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L.

Unable to find this require&para;<br>ment in the statute’s text, the Court gives three reasons&para;<br>for its interpretation. Those reasons do not withstand&para;<br>scrutiny.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The first reason the Court gives for its interpretation is&para;<br>that reading the statute to require a delegee group to&para;<br>maintain three members “is the only way to harmonize&para;<br>and give meaningful effect to all of the provisions in”&para;<br>§153(b).

Instead, the Court surmises that&para;<br>certain provisions would not have “meaningful,” “mate&para;<br>rial,” or “practical” effect, ante, at 5, 6, 14. But that is just&para;<br>to say that the Court has determined, in its own judgment,&para;<br>that some provisions should have a greater role than&para;<br>provided by the text of the statute.&para;<br>The Government’s reading of the statute does not render&para;<br>any clause meaningless. The full Board must have three&para;<br>or more members in order to conduct any business, includ&para;<br>ing delegating its authority to a three-member group, as&para;<br>required under the Board quorum provision. This provi&para;<br>sion applies “at all times” to the Board acting as a whole.&para;<br>Two members of the Board could not conduct any business&para;<br>unless they were previously designated by the full Board&para;<br>as members of a delegee group with such authority. Any&para;<br>delegation of the Board’s authority must be to at least&para;<br>three members, as required by the delegation clause.

The Court would hold that two members of a group&para;<br>can act as a quorum so long as the third’s absence is not&para;<br>due to a vacancy; yet the vacancy clause makes it clear&para;<br>that the authority of Board “members” to act shall not be&para;<br>impaired by vacancies. The clause includes all members,&para;<br>including those acting as part of three-member groups.&para;<br>The Court in effect would rewrite the group quorum&para;<br>provision to say, “two members shall constitute a quorum&para;<br>of any group [unless the third member’s absence is due to&para;<br>a vacancy].” Even if the statute said nothing about vacan&para;<br>cies, this would be a misreading of the quorum provision.&para;<br>A “quorum” is the “minimum number of members . . . who&para;<br>must be present for a deliberative assembly to legally&para;<br>transact business.” See Black’s Law Dictionary 1370 (9th&para;<br>ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s). As the Court has made&para;<br>clear in the past, quorum requirements are generally&para;<br>indifferent to the reasons underlying any particular mem&para;<br>ber’s absence. See Nguyen, 539 U. S., at 82.&para;<br>For instance, the Court has previously discussed a&para;<br>statute governing the delegation of power to three-member&para;<br>panels of the federal courts of appeals. Ibid. That statute&para;<br>provides: “A majority of the number of judges authorized&para;<br>to constitute a court or panel thereof . . . shall constitute a&para;<br>quorum.” 28 U. S. C. §46(d). While the statute makes no&para;<br>mention of vacancies, the Court had little trouble conclud&para;<br>ing that the statute “permits a quorum to proceed to&para;<br>judgment when one member of the panel dies or is dis&para;<br>qualified.” Nguyen, supra, at 82. The Court today offers&para;<br>to distinguish Nguyen as being “informed by the long&para;<br>standing practice of allowing two judges from the initial&para;<br>panel to proceed to judgment in the case of a vacancy.”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Ante, at 12. But there was little if any reliance on any&para;<br>such practice in Nguyen. In noting that its conclusion was&para;<br>a matter of “settled law,” the Court relied on the text of&para;<br>the statute and a single case that itself looked directly to&para;<br>the statutory text of §46(d). Nguyen, supra, at 82 (citing&para;<br>United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F. 2d 925,&para;<br>927 (CA2 1957) (L. Hand, J.)).&para;<br>If the group quorum provision leaves any room for doubt&para;<br>that it applies in cases of vacancy, its application is made&para;<br>clearer by the vacancy clause itself. That clause states in&para;<br>unequivocal terms that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall not&para;<br>impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all&para;<br>of the powers of the Board.” §153(b). The Court makes&para;<br>much of the fact that the statute refers to a vacancy in the&para;<br>“Board” rather than in a “group.” But the former category&para;<br>subsumes the latter. That is, the phrase “[a] vacancy in&para;<br>the Board” covers the entire universe of instances in which&para;<br>there may be a vacancy in a group, because all group&para;<br>members are Board members.&para;<br>The Court counters that the vacancy clause “speaks to&para;<br>the effect of a vacancy in the Board on the authority to&para;<br>exercise the powers of the Board,” ante, at 11, as opposed&para;<br>to a vacancy in a group. But the Court’s abridged re&para;<br>statement of the vacancy clause suffers from a critical&para;<br>imprecision. The Court’s point would be well taken if the&para;<br>vacancy clause stated that “a vacancy in the Board shall&para;<br>not affect the power of the Board to operate.” But the&para;<br>clause instead states that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall&para;<br>not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise&para;<br>all of the powers of the Board.” Delegee groups consist of&para;<br>members exercising the powers of the Board. This clause&para;<br>thus instructs that a vacancy in the Board shall not im&para;<br>pair the right of members to exercise the Board’s powers,&para;<br>an authority that members of delegee groups possess. But&para;<br>under the Court’s reading, vacancies in the Board will&para;<br>often impair the right of the remaining members to exer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>cise the powers of the Board, notwithstanding the explicit&para;<br>statutory command to the contrary.&para;<br>In an effort to avoid the mandates of the group quorum&para;<br>provision, as buttressed by the vacancy clause, the Court&para;<br>relies on the delegation clause. The Court reads the&para;<br>clause as requiring a delegee group to maintain three&para;<br>members in order for its authority to remain intact. In my&para;<br>respectful submission, this reading of the statute, in which&para;<br>any vacancy in a delegee group somehow invalidates the&para;<br>delegation itself, has no textual basis. Contrary to the&para;<br>Court’s and petitioner’s assertions, the delegation clause is&para;<br>not rendered unimportant under the Government’s inter&para;<br>pretation. The delegation clause establishes what is re&para;<br>quired for delegation in the first instance, while the va&para;<br>cancy clause and the group quorum provision allow the&para;<br>delegee group to proceed in the event that a member’s&para;<br>term expires or a member resigns.&para;<br>Congress could have required a delegee group to main&para;<br>tain three members, but it did not do so; instead, it in&para;<br>cluded a vacancy clause that is an explicit rejection of such&para;<br>a requirement. That is no doubt why the Court’s reading&para;<br>has not been adopted by the five Courts of Appeals to have&para;<br>rejected its result.

NLRB&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>quirement into the statutory text bring me to its second&para;<br>point.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court’s textual arguments in the end reduce to a&para;<br>single objection: The Government’s reading of §153(b)&para;<br>allows two Board members to act as the full Board,&para;<br>thereby eviscerating the requirement that the Board only&para;<br>operate with a three-member quorum (or as three-member&para;<br>panels). This animates the Court’s second reason for&para;<br>departing from the statutory text, as the Court suggests&para;<br>that had Congress “intended to authorize two members&para;<br>alone to act for the Board on an ongoing basis, it could&para;<br>have said so in straightforward language.” Ante, at 7. But&para;<br>Congress undoubtedly permitted two members to act for&para;<br>the Board: Even under the Court’s interpretation, two&para;<br>members are authorized to exercise the full powers of the&para;<br>Board so long as they are part of a delegee group that has&para;<br>fallen to two members due to any reason other than va&para;<br>cancy. Ante, at 13 (“[T]he group quorum provision still&para;<br>operates to allow any panel to issue a decision by only two&para;<br>members if one member is disqualified”).&para;<br>The Court’s complaint, then, cannot be that Congress&para;<br>did not intend two members to exercise the powers of the&para;<br>Board; it must be that Congress did not intend to allow&para;<br>two members to do so for protracted periods of time. The&para;<br>Court is likely correct that Congress did not expect a two&para;<br>member quorum to operate as the Board for extended&para;<br>periods, but unintended consequences are typically the&para;<br>result of unforeseen circumstances. And it should be even&para;<br>more evident that Congress did not intend the Board to&para;<br>cease operating entirely for an extended period of time, as&para;<br>the Court’s interpretation of §153(b) now ordains. Mem&para;<br>bers Liebman and Schaumber issued more than 500 opin&para;<br>ions when they operated as a two-member quorum of a&para;<br>properly designated group:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“Those decisions resolved a wide variety of disputes&para;<br>over union representation and allegations of unfair&para;<br>labor practices, including cases involving employers’&para;<br>discharges of employees for exercising their statutory&para;<br>rights; disputes over secret ballot elections in which&para;<br>employees voted to select a union representative; pro&para;<br>tests over employers’ withdrawal of recognition from&para;<br>union representatives designated by employees; re&para;<br>fusals by employers or unions to honor their obliga&para;<br>tion to bargain in good faith; and challenges to the re&para;<br>quirement that employees pay union dues as a&para;<br>condition of employment.” Brief for Respondent 6−7&para;<br>(footnotes omitted).&para;<br>The Court’s objection, that Congress could have been&para;<br>more explicit if it wanted two members to operate as the&para;<br>Board, is misplaced. There is nothing inconsistent about&para;<br>Congress preferring Board decisions to be made by three&para;<br>members and advancing that preference through statutory&para;<br>requirements, while at the same time providing exceptions&para;<br>for suboptimal circumstances, such as those presented&para;<br>here. Quorum provisions do not express the legislature’s&para;<br>judgment about the optimal number of members that&para;<br>should be present to transact business; they set a floor&para;<br>that, while less than ideal, provides a minimum number of&para;<br>participants necessary to protect “against totally unrepre&para;<br>sentative action.” Robert’s Rules of Order §3, p. 16 (rev.&para;<br>ed. 1970).&para;<br>One likely reason Congress did not permit the Board to&para;<br>delegate its authority to two-member groups in the first&para;<br>instance is that Congress wanted to avoid two-member&para;<br>groups in the mine run of cases. Congress’ statutory&para;<br>scheme achieved that goal, as the Court’s review of the&para;<br>Board’s historical practices aptly demonstrates. Ante, at&para;<br>7−8. Congress nonetheless provided for two-member&para;<br>quorums to operate in extraordinary circumstances, where&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Board has exercised its discretion to delegate its au&para;<br>thority to a particular three-member group, and one mem&para;<br>ber of such a group is unavailable for whatever reason.&para;<br>The Board’s delegation to a three-member group that&para;<br>ultimately dwindled to two was a thoughtful and consid&para;<br>erate exercise of its reasonable discretion when it was&para;<br>confronted with two imperfect alternatives.&para;<br>During the past two years, events have turned what&para;<br>Congress had undoubtedly thought would be an extraordi&para;<br>nary circumstance into an ordinary one, through no fault&para;<br>of the Board. That is no reason to dispense with the statu&para;<br>tory regime that is prescribed when these circumstances&para;<br>arise, even when they unexpectedly persist.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Court’s final reason for its interpretation is the&para;<br>Board’s longstanding practice of reconstituting panels&para;<br>whenever they drop below three members due to a va&para;<br>cancy. But see Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. NLRB, 678 F. 2d 121,&para;<br>122−123 (CA9 1982) (upholding decision from a two&para;<br>member delegee group after third member retired). The&para;<br>commonsense conclusion from this practice, however, is&para;<br>that the Board respects the superiority of three-member&para;<br>groups to two-member quorums of those groups. That the&para;<br>Board reconstitutes its panels to include three members&para;<br>does not demonstrate that a two-member group lacks the&para;<br>authority to act when recomposition is not an option.&para;<br>The Court is mistaken, then, when it suggests that, if&para;<br>two-member quorums were permissible, the Board would&para;<br>have a practice of allowing two-member quorums to per&para;<br>sist without reconstituting panels. Persuasive authority&para;<br>shows the contrary to be true. In 2003, the Office of Legal&para;<br>Counsel advised that two members can operate as a quo&para;<br>rum of a properly designated group, even if the other seats&para;<br>on the Board are vacant. The Board agreed to be bound by&para;<br>that opinion. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Six months later, Board Member Acosta resigned.&para;<br>See NLRB Bulletin, Ronald Meisburg Receives Recess&para;<br>Appointment From President Bush to be NLRB Member&para;<br>(Dec. 29, 2003). Despite OLC’s opinion and the Board’s&para;<br>position that two-member quorums could exercise the full&para;<br>powers of the Board, the Board prudently reconstituted&para;<br>each three-member panel on which Member Acosta served&para;<br>before his departure because there were enough members&para;<br>of the Board to do so. Its own prudent actions should not&para;<br>be used as a reason to strip the Board of a statutory&para;<br>power.&para;<br>And a further instructive history comes from the prac&para;<br>tices of the original Board, before the 1947 Taft-Hartley&para;<br>Act. The Wagner Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 451, provided for a&para;<br>three-member Board and contained a vacancy provision&para;<br>similar to the one found in §153(b): “A vacancy in the&para;<br>Board shall not impair the right of the remaining mem&para;<br>bers to exercise all the powers of the Board, and two mem&para;<br>bers of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a quorum.”&para;<br>§3(b), 49 Stat. 451. Under this statutory grant of author&para;<br>ity, from 1935 to 1947 a two-member quorum of the Board&para;<br>operated during three separate periods when the third&para;<br>seat was vacant, issuing nearly 500 two-member decisions&para;<br>during such times. Those two-member Boards issued 3&para;<br>published decisions in 1936 (reported at 2 N. L. R. B.&para;<br>198−240); 237 published decisions in 1940 (reported at 27&para;<br>N. L. R. B. 1−1395 and 28 N. L. R. B. 1−115); and 225&para;<br>published decisions in 1941 (reported at 35 N. L. R. B.&para;<br>24−1360 and 36 N. L. R. B. 1−45); see also Brief for Re&para;<br>spondent 3, n. 1.&para;<br>Congress intended to preserve this practice when it&para;<br>enacted the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. The purpose of the&para;<br>Taft-Hartley amendment was to increase the Board’s&para;<br>efficiency by permitting multiple three-member groups to&para;<br>exercise the full powers of the Board. See S. Rep. No. 105,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>80th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1947) (“The expansion of the&para;<br>Board . . . would permit it to operate in panels of three,&para;<br>thereby increasing by 100 percent its ability to dispose of&para;<br>cases expeditiously”). In furtherance of that objective, the&para;<br>new statutory language in §153(b) complements the con&para;<br>gressional intent to preserve the ability of two members of&para;<br>the Board to exercise the Board’s full powers, in limited&para;<br>circumstances, by permitting the Board to delegate “any or&para;<br>all” of its powers “to any group of three or more members,”&para;<br>two members of which would constitute a quorum.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The petitioner, but not the Court, advances an alterna&para;<br>tive interpretation of §153(b) adopted by the United States&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 16−27; Laurel Baye, 564 F. 3d 469. In&para;<br>the petitioner’s view, §153(b) requires the Board to have a&para;<br>quorum of three members “at all times,” and when the&para;<br>Board’s quorum fell to two members any powers that it&para;<br>had delegated automatically ceased.&para;<br>This is a misreading of the statute that the Court&para;<br>rightly declines to adopt. Ante, at 9−10, n. 4. As ex&para;<br>plained above, that the Board must meet a three-member&para;<br>quorum requirement at all times when it wishes to oper&para;<br>ate as the full Board does not mean it must maintain three&para;<br>members in order for delegee groups to act. It just means&para;<br>that the quorum requirement for the full Board, operating&para;<br>independently of any delegee group, is fixed at three, as&para;<br>opposed to the various dynamic quorum requirements&para;<br>found elsewhere in the United States Code. See, e.g., 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §46(d) (setting the quorum requirements for&para;<br>courts of appeals at “[a] majority of the number of judges&para;<br>authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof”); see also&para;<br>Black’s 1370 (defining “proportional quorum” as: “A quo&para;<br>rum calculated with reference to some defined or assumed&para;<br>set, usu. either the number of seats (including vacancies)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>or the number of sitting members (excluding vacancies)”).&para;<br>Petitioner’s reading ignores the operation of the word&para;<br>“except” in the statute: “[T]hree members of the Board&para;<br>shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the Board, ex&para;<br>cept that two members shall constitute a quorum of any&para;<br>group.” §153(b).&para;<br>While the Court does not adopt petitioner’s flawed&para;<br>reading, it should be noted that its failure to decisively&para;<br>reject it calls into question various delegations of authority&para;<br>the Board has made beyond three-member groups. For&para;<br>instance, §153(d) permits the Board to delegate various&para;<br>powers to its general counsel, but under petitioner’s view&para;<br>the general counsel would have lost all authority the&para;<br>moment the Board fell to two members. See also §153(b)&para;<br>(permitting Board to delegate certain powers to its re&para;<br>gional directors). The Court’s assurances that its opinion&para;<br>“does not cast doubt on the prior delegations of authority&para;<br>to non-group members,” ante, at 10, n. 4, are cold comfort&para;<br>when it fails to reject petitioner’s view outright.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>It is not optimal for a two-member quorum to exercise&para;<br>the full powers of the Board for an extended period of&para;<br>time. But the desire to avoid that situation cannot justify&para;<br>the Court’s significant revisions to §153(b): (1) It writes&para;<br>language into the delegation clause, requiring delegee&para;<br>groups to maintain a membership of three, despite the&para;<br>conspicuous absence of this requirement and the statutory&para;<br>rejection of it in the group quorum provision; (2) it excises&para;<br>the word “not” from the vacancy clause, so that a Board&para;<br>vacancy does “impair the right of the remaining members&para;<br>to exercise all of the powers of the Board” in hundreds of&para;<br>cases; (3) it renders the group quorum provision unintelli&para;<br>gible, so that its application depends entirely on the rea&para;<br>son for the third member’s absence, and applies in all&para;<br>instances except when the absence is due to a vacancy&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW PROCESS STEEL, L.
