Readers are requested to&para;<br>notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.

STATE OF &para;<br>&para;<br>NEBRASKA, ET AL., DEFENDANTS &para;<br>&para;<br>ON BILL OF COMPLAINT&para;<br>[March 9, 2015]&para;<br>&para;<br>DECREE&para;<br>The Court having exercised original jurisdiction over&para;<br>this controversy between three sovereign States; the issues having been tried before the Special Master appointed by the Court; the Court having received briefs and&para;<br>heard oral argument on the parties’ exceptions to the&para;<br>Report of the Special Master; and the Court having issued&para;<br>its opinion on all issues announced in Kansas v. Nebraska, 574 U. S. ___ (2015), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,&para;<br>ADJUDGED,&para;<br>DECLARED&para;<br>AND&para;<br>DECREED&para;<br>AS&para;<br>FOLLOWS:&para;<br>1. The RRCA Accounting Procedures are hereby reformed as shown on the attached Appendix to be effective&para;<br>for the accounting of Compact Year 2007 and thereafter.&para;<br>2. Nebraska is not liable for evaporative losses from&para;<br>Harlan County Lake during 2006.&para;<br>3. Evaporation from the Non-Federal Reservoirs located&para;<br>in Nebraska is a Beneficial Consumptive Use under the&para;<br>Compact and must be accounted for as such.&para;<br>4. Nebraska’s consumption in 2005 and 2006 exceeded&para;<br>its Compact allocation by 70,869 acre feet, said amount&para;<br>equaling the combined rather than average exceedences&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KANSAS v. NEBRASKA&para;<br>Decree&para;<br>&para;<br>for those two years.&para;<br>5. Nebraska must pay Kansas within sixty (60) days of&para;<br>the date of this Order, Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000.00).&para;<br>6. Except as herein provided, the claims of all parties in&para;<br>this action are denied and their prayers for relief dismissed with prejudice.&para;<br>7. The parties’ respective responsibilities for the fees&para;<br>and costs awarded to the Special Master are as follows:&para;<br>Kansas (40%); Nebraska (40%); and Colorado (20%).&para;<br>8. The parties’ previous payments made to the Special&para;<br>Master and the printer of the Report of the Special Master&para;<br>discharge in full their respective obligations to pay for or&para;<br>share among themselves fees and costs awarded to the&para;<br>Special Master together with any costs that might have&para;<br>otherwise been assessed in this action.&para;<br>9. The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such&para;<br>further proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such&para;<br>writs as it may from time to time deem necessary or desirable to give proper force and effect to this Decree.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Imported Water Supply Credit Calculation:&para;<br>The amount of Imported Water Supply Credit shall be&para;<br>determined by the RRCA Groundwater Model. The Imported Water Supply Credit of a State shall not be included in the Virgin Water Supply and shall be counted as a&para;<br>credit/offset against the Computed Beneficial Consumptive Use of water allocated to that State. Currently, the&para;<br>Imported Water Supply Credits shall be determined using&para;<br>two runs of the RRCA Groundwater Model:&para;<br>a. The “base” run shall be the run with all groundwater&para;<br>pumping, groundwater pumping recharge, and surface&para;<br>water recharge within the model study boundary for the&para;<br>current accounting year turned “on.” This will be the&para;<br>same “base” run used to determine groundwater Computed Beneficial Consumptive Uses.&para;<br>b. The “no NE import” run shall be the run with the same&para;<br>model inputs as the base run with the exception that&para;<br>surface water recharge associated with Nebraska’s Imported Water Supply shall be turned “off.” This will be the&para;<br>same “no NE import” run used to determine groundwater&para;<br>Computed Beneficial Consumptive Uses.&para;<br>The Imported Water Supply Credit shall be the difference&para;<br>in stream flows between these two model runs. Differences in stream flows shall be determined at the same&para;<br>locations as identified in Subsection III.D.1 for the “no&para;<br>pumping” runs.&para;<br>Should another State import water into the Basin in the&para;<br>future, the RRCA will develop a similar procedure to&para;<br>determine Imported Water Supply Credits.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KANSAS v. NEBRASKA&para;<br>Decree&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to Decree&para;<br>&para;<br>III D. Calculation of Annual Computed Beneficial&para;<br>Consumptive Use&para;<br>1. Groundwater&para;<br>Computed Beneficial Consumptive Use of groundwater&para;<br>shall be determined by use of the RRCA Groundwater&para;<br>Model. The Computed Beneficial Consumptive Use of&para;<br>groundwater for each State shall be determined as the&para;<br>difference in streamflows using two runs of the model:&para;<br>The “base no NE import” run shall be the run with all&para;<br>groundwater pumping, groundwater pumping recharge,&para;<br>and surface water recharge within the model study&para;<br>boundary for the current accounting year “on”, with the&para;<br>exception that surface water recharge associated with&para;<br>Nebraska’s Imported Water Supply shall be turned “off.”&para;<br>The “no State pumping” run shall be the run with the&para;<br>same model inputs as the “base no NE import” run with&para;<br>the exception that all groundwater pumping and pumping&para;<br>recharge of that State shall be turned “off.”&para;<br>An output of the model is baseflows at selected stream&para;<br>cells. Changes in the baseflows predicted by the model&para;<br>between the “base no NE import” run and the “no-Statepumping” model run is assumed to be the depletions to&para;<br>streamflows. i.e., groundwater computed beneficial consumptive use, due to State groundwater pumping at that&para;<br>location. The values for each Sub-basin will include all&para;<br>depletions and accretions upstream of the confluence with&para;<br>the Main Stem. The values for the Main Stem will include&para;<br>all depletions and accretions in stream reaches not otherwise accounted for in a Sub-basin. The values for the&para;<br>Main Stem will be computed separately for the reach&para;<br>above Guide Rock, and the reach below Guide Rock.&para;<br>*Taken from the August 12, 2010, Accounting Procedures.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
