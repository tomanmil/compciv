CITY OF NEW YORK, &para;<br>&para;<br>NEW YORK&para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–969.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 3, 2009—Decided January 25, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent New York City taxes the possession of cigarettes. Peti&para;<br>tioner Hemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online to&para;<br>residents of the City. Neither state nor city law requires out-of-state&para;<br>sellers such as Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the City’s tax; in&para;<br>stead, the City must recover its tax on out-of-state sales directly from&para;<br>the purchasers. But the Jenkins Act, 15 U. S. C. §§375–378, requires&para;<br>out-of-state sellers to submit customer information to the States into&para;<br>which they ship cigarettes, and New York State has agreed to for&para;<br>ward that information to the City. That information helps the City&para;<br>track down cigarette purchasers who do not pay their taxes. Against&para;<br>that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under the Racketeer Influ&para;<br>enced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), alleging that Hemi’s&para;<br>failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the State constituted mail&para;<br>and wire fraud, which are defined as “racketeering activit[ies],” 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1961(1), subject to enforcement under civil RICO, §1964(c).&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the claims, but the Second Circuit va&para;<br>cated the judgment and remanded. Among other things, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals held that the City’s asserted injury—lost tax revenue—came&para;<br>about “by reason of” the predicate mail and wire frauds. It accord&para;<br>ingly determined that the City had stated a valid RICO claim.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>541 F. 3d 425, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court in part,&para;<br>concluding that because the City cannot show that it lost tax revenue&para;<br>“by reason of” the alleged RICO violation, it cannot state a RICO&para;<br>claim. Pp. 5–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) To establish that an injury came about “by reason of” a RICO&para;<br>violation, a plaintiff must show that a predicate offense “not only was&para;<br>a ‘but for’ cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.”&para;<br>Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258,&para;<br>268. Proximate cause for RICO purposes should be evaluated in light&para;<br>of its common-law foundations; it thus requires “some direct relation&para;<br>between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Ibid.&para;<br>A link that is “too remote,” “purely contingent,” or “indirec[t]” is in&para;<br>sufficient. Id., at 271, 274.&para;<br>The City’s causal theory cannot satisfy RICO’s direct relationship&para;<br>requirement. Indeed, the causal link here is far more attenuated&para;<br>than the one the Court rejected as “purely contingent” and “too re&para;<br>mote” in Holmes. Id., at 271. According to the City, Hemi committed&para;<br>fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the&para;<br>required customer information to the State. Without the reports&para;<br>from Hemi, the State could not pass on the information to the City,&para;<br>even if it had been so inclined. Some of the customers legally obli&para;<br>gated to pay the cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the&para;<br>City did not receive the customer information, it could not determine&para;<br>which customers had failed to pay the tax. The City thus could not&para;<br>pursue those customers for payment. The City thereby was injured&para;<br>in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.&para;<br>As the Court reiterated in Holmes, “[t]he general tendency of the law,&para;<br>in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step,” id.,&para;<br>at 271–272, and that “general tendency” applies with full force to&para;<br>proximate cause inquiries under RICO, e.g., ibid. Because the City’s&para;<br>causation theory requires the Court to move well beyond the first&para;<br>step, that theory cannot satisfy RICO’s direct relationship require&para;<br>ment.&para;<br>The City’s claim suffers from the same defect as the RICO claim re&para;<br>jected in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 458–461,&para;<br>where the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the&para;<br>conduct giving rise to the fraud, see id., at 458. Indeed, the discon&para;<br>nect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is&para;<br>even sharper. In Anza, the same party had both engaged in the&para;<br>harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. Here, the City’s&para;<br>theory of liability rests not just on separate actions, but separate ac&para;<br>tions carried out by separate parties. The City’s theory thus requires&para;<br>that the Court extend RICO liability to situations where the defen&para;<br>dant’s fraud on the third party (the State) has made it easier for a&para;<br>fourth party (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the City).&para;<br>Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused harm to the City&para;<br>in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally ob&para;<br>ligated to pay. Put simply, Hemi’s obligation was to file Jenkins Act&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>reports with the State, not the City, and the City’s harm was directly&para;<br>caused by the customers, not Hemi. The Court has never before&para;<br>stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and declines to&para;<br>do so today. See, e.g., id., at 460–461. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(b) The City attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the&para;<br>violation not merely as Hemi’s failure to file Jenkins Act reports with&para;<br>the State, but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the&para;<br>City of tax revenue. But if the City could escape the proximate-cause&para;<br>requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced&para;<br>all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct, the Court’s RICO&para;<br>proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule. That&para;<br>precedent makes clear that “the compensable injury flowing from a&para;<br>[RICO] violation . . . ‘necessarily is the harm caused by [the] predi&para;<br>cate acts.’ ” Anza, supra, at 457. Because the only fraudulent con&para;<br>duct alleged here is a violation of the Jenkins Act, the City must, but&para;<br>cannot, show that Hemi’s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports led&para;<br>directly to its injuries.&para;<br>The City also errs in relying on Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indem&para;<br>nity Co., 553 U. S. ___. There, the plaintiffs’ causation theory was&para;<br>“straightforward”: The causal link in Bridge involved a direct and&para;<br>easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the&para;<br>plaintiffs’ injury, id., at ___; the plaintiffs there “were the only parties&para;<br>injured by petitioners’ misrepresentations,” id., at ___; and there&para;<br>were “no independent factors that account[ed] for [the] injury,” id., at&para;<br>___. The City’s theory in this case is anything but straightfor&para;<br>ward: Multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted in&para;<br>jury. And in contrast to Bridge, where there were “no independent&para;<br>factors that account[ed] for [the plaintiffs’] injury,” id., at ___, here&para;<br>there certainly were: The City’s theory of liability rests on the inde&para;<br>pendent actions of third and even fourth parties.

CITY OF NEW YORK, &para;<br>&para;<br>NEW YORK&para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 25, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the&para;<br>Court in part.&para;<br>The City of New York taxes the possession of cigarettes.&para;<br>Hemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online&para;<br>to residents of the City. Neither state nor city law re­&para;<br>quires Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the tax, and the&para;<br>purchasers seldom pay it on their own. Federal law,&para;<br>however, requires out-of-state vendors such as Hemi to&para;<br>submit customer information to the States into which they&para;<br>ship the cigarettes.&para;<br>Against that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under&para;<br>the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act&para;<br>(RICO), alleging that Hemi failed to file the required&para;<br>customer information with the State. That failure, the&para;<br>City argues, constitutes mail and wire fraud, which caused&para;<br>it to lose tens of millions of dollars in unrecovered ciga­&para;<br>rette taxes. Because the City cannot show that it lost the&para;<br>tax revenue “by reason of” the alleged RICO violation, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1964(c), we hold that the City cannot state a&para;<br>claim under RICO. We therefore reverse the Court of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Appeals’ decision to the contrary.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>This case arises from a motion to dismiss, and so we&para;<br>accept as true the factual allegations in the City’s second&para;<br>amended complaint. See Leatherman v. Tarrant County&para;<br>Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S.&para;<br>163, 164 (1993).&para;<br>New York State authorizes the City of New York to&para;<br>impose its own taxes on cigarettes. N. Y. Unconsol. Law&para;<br>Ann. §9436(1) (West Supp. 2009). Under that authority,&para;<br>the City has levied a $1.50 per pack tax on each standard&para;<br>pack of cigarettes possessed within the City for sale or use.&para;<br>N. Y. C. Admin. Code §11–1302(a) (2008); see also Record&para;<br>A1016. When purchasers buy cigarettes from in-state&para;<br>vendors, the seller is responsible for charging, collecting,&para;<br>and remitting the tax. N. Y. Tax Law Ann. §471(2) (West&para;<br>Supp. 2009). Out-of-state vendors, however, are not.&para;<br>Ibid.; see City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc.,&para;<br>541 F. 3d 425, 432–433 (CA2 2008). Instead, the City is&para;<br>responsible for recovering, directly from the customers,&para;<br>use taxes on cigarettes sold outside New York. That can&para;<br>be difficult, as those customers are often reluctant to pay&para;<br>and tough to track down. One way the City can gather&para;<br>information that would assist it in collecting the back&para;<br>taxes is through the Jenkins Act, 63 Stat. 884, as amended&para;<br>by 69 Stat. 627. That Act requires out-of-state cigarette&para;<br>sellers to register and to file a report with state tobacco&para;<br>tax administrators listing the name, address, and quantity&para;<br>of cigarettes purchased by state residents. 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§375–378.&para;<br>New York State and the City have executed an agree­&para;<br>ment under which both parties undertake to “cooperate&para;<br>fully with each other and keep each other fully and&para;<br>promptly informed with reference to any person or trans­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The&para;<br>City asserts that under that agreement, the State for­&para;<br>wards Jenkins Act information to the City. Id., at A998;&para;<br>Second Amended Compl. ¶54. That information helps the&para;<br>City track down purchasers who do not pay their taxes.&para;<br>Id., ¶¶58–59.&para;<br>Hemi Group is a New Mexico company that sells ciga­&para;<br>rettes online. Hemi, however, does not file Jenkins Act&para;<br>information with the State. The City alleges that this&para;<br>failure has cost it “tens if not hundreds of millions of&para;<br>dollars a year in cigarette excise tax revenue.” Record&para;<br>A996. Based on Hemi’s failure to file the information with&para;<br>the State, the City filed this federal RICO claim.&para;<br>B&para;<br>RICO provides a private cause of action for “[a]ny per­&para;<br>son injured in his business or property by reason of a&para;<br>violation of section 1962 of this chapter.” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1964(c). Section 1962, in turn, contains RICO’s criminal&para;<br>provisions. Specifically, §1962(c), which the City invokes&para;<br>here, makes it “unlawful for any person employed by or&para;<br>associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities&para;<br>of which affect, interstate . . . commerce, to conduct or&para;<br>participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such&para;<br>enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering&para;<br>activity.” “[R]acketeering activity” is defined to include a&para;<br>number of so-called predicate acts, including the two at&para;<br>issue in this case—mail and wire fraud. See §1961(1).&para;<br>The City alleges that Hemi’s “interstate sale of ciga­&para;<br>rettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports identify­&para;<br>ing those sales” constitute the RICO predicate offenses of&para;<br>mail and wire fraud in violation of §1962(c), for which&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§1964(c) provides a private cause of action. Record A980.&para;<br>Invoking that private cause of action, the City asserts that&para;<br>it has suffered injury in the form of lost tax revenue—its&para;<br>“business or property” in RICO terms—“by reason of”&para;<br>Hemi’s fraud.&para;<br>Hemi does not contest the City’s characterization of the&para;<br>Jenkins Act violations as predicate offenses actionable&para;<br>under §1964(c). (We therefore assume, without deciding,&para;<br>that failure to file Jenkins Act material can serve as a&para;<br>RICO predicate offense.) Instead, Hemi argues that the&para;<br>City’s asserted injury—lost tax revenue—is not “business&para;<br>or property” under RICO, and that the City cannot show&para;<br>that it suffered any injury “by reason of” the failure to file&para;<br>Jenkins Act reports.&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the City’s RICO claims,&para;<br>determining that Hemi owner and officer Kai Gachupin&para;<br>did not have an individual duty to file Jenkins Act reports,&para;<br>and thus could not have committed the alleged predicate&para;<br>acts. City of New York v. Nexicon, Inc., No. 03 CV 383&para;<br>(DAB), 2006 WL 647716, *7–*8 (SDNY, Mar. 15, 2006).&para;<br>The District Court therefore held that the City could not&para;<br>establish that Hemi and Gachupin formed an “enterprise”&para;<br>as required to establish RICO liability. Id., at *7–*10.&para;<br>Because it dismissed on that ground, the District Court&para;<br>did not address whether the City’s loss of tax revenue&para;<br>constitutes an injury to its “business or property” under&para;<br>§1964, or whether that injury was caused “by reason of”&para;<br>Hemi’s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports.&para;<br>The Second Circuit vacated the District Court’s judg­&para;<br>ment and remanded for further proceedings. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals held that the City had established that Gachupin&para;<br>and Hemi operated as an “enterprise” and that the enter­&para;<br>prise committed the predicate RICO acts of mail and wire&para;<br>fraud, based on the failure to file the Jenkins Act material&para;<br>with the State. 541 F. 3d, at 447–448. The court also&para;<br>determined that the City’s asserted injury, lost tax reve­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nue, was “business or property” under RICO. Id., at 444–&para;<br>445. And that injury, the court concluded, came about “by&para;<br>reason of” the predicate mail and wire frauds. Id., at 440–&para;<br>444. The City thus had stated a viable RICO claim.&para;<br>Judge Winter dissented on the ground that the alleged&para;<br>RICO violation was not the proximate cause of the City’s&para;<br>injury. Id., at 458–461.&para;<br>Hemi filed a petition for certiorari, asking this Court to&para;<br>determine whether the City had been “directly injured in&para;<br>its ‘business or property’ ” by reason of the alleged mail&para;<br>and wire frauds. Pet. for Cert. i. We granted that peti­&para;<br>tion. 556 U. S. __ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Though framed as a single question, Hemi’s petition for&para;<br>certiorari raises two distinct issues: First, whether a loss&para;<br>in tax revenue is “business or property” under 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1964(c); and second, whether the City’s asserted injury&para;<br>came about “by reason of” the allegedly fraudulent con­&para;<br>duct, as required by §1964(c). We determine that the City&para;<br>cannot satisfy the causation requirement—that any injury&para;<br>the City suffered must be “by reason of” the alleged&para;<br>frauds—and therefore do not decide whether the City’s&para;<br>allegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its&para;<br>“business or property.”&para;<br>A&para;<br>In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,&para;<br>503 U. S. 258 (1992), we set forth the standard of causa­&para;<br>tion that applies to civil RICO claims. In that case, we&para;<br>addressed a RICO claim brought by Securities Investor&para;<br>Protection Corporation (SIPC) against defendants whom&para;<br>SIPC alleged had manipulated stock prices. Id., at 262–&para;<br>263. SIPC had a duty to reimburse customers of certain&para;<br>registered broker-dealers in the event the broker-dealers&para;<br>were unable to meet their financial obligations. Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>261. When the conspiracy by the stock manipulators was&para;<br>detected, stock prices collapsed, and two broker-dealers&para;<br>were unable to meet their obligations to their customers.&para;<br>SIPC, as insurer against that loss, ultimately was on the&para;<br>hook for nearly $13 million to cover the customers’ claims.&para;<br>The Court held that SIPC could not recover against the&para;<br>conspirators because it could not establish that it was&para;<br>injured “by reason of” the alleged fraud, as that phrase is&para;<br>used in RICO.&para;<br>We explained that, to state a claim under civil RICO,&para;<br>the plaintiff is required to show that a RICO predicate&para;<br>offense “not only was a ‘but for’ cause of his injury, but&para;<br>was the proximate cause as well.” Id., at 268. Proximate&para;<br>cause for RICO purposes, we made clear, should be evalu­&para;<br>ated in light of its common-law foundations; proximate&para;<br>cause thus requires “some direct relation between the&para;<br>injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Ibid.&para;<br>A link that is “too remote,” “purely contingent,” or “indi­&para;<br>rec[t]” is insufficient. Id., at 271, 274.&para;<br>Applying that standard, we rejected SIPC’s RICO claim.&para;<br>The alleged conspiracy, we held, directly harmed only the&para;<br>broker-dealers; SIPC’s injury, on the other hand, was&para;<br>“purely contingent” on that harm. Id., at 271. The con­&para;<br>nection between the alleged conspiracy and SIPC’s injury&para;<br>was therefore “too remote” to satisfy RICO’s direct rela­&para;<br>tionship requirement. Ibid.&para;<br>The City’s causal theory is far more attenuated than the&para;<br>one we rejected in Holmes. According to the City, Hemi&para;<br>committed fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and&para;<br>failing to submit the required customer information to the&para;<br>State. Without the reports from Hemi, the State could not&para;<br>pass on the information to the City, even if it had been so&para;<br>inclined. Some of the customers legally obligated to pay&para;<br>the cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the&para;<br>City did not receive the customer information, the City&para;<br>could not determine which customers had failed to pay the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tax. The City thus could not pursue those customers for&para;<br>payment. The City thereby was injured in the amount of&para;<br>the portion of back taxes that were never collected. See&para;<br>Record A996.&para;<br>But as we reiterated in Holmes, “[t]he general tendency&para;<br>of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go be­&para;<br>yond the first step.” 503 U. S., at 271–272 (quoting Asso&para;<br>ciated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459&para;<br>U. S. 519, 534 (1983), in turn quoting Southern Pacific Co.&para;<br>v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U. S. 531, 533 (1918),&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted). Our cases confirm&para;<br>that the “general tendency” applies with full force to&para;<br>proximate cause inquiries under RICO. Holmes, supra, at&para;<br>271–272; see also Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity&para;<br>Co., 553 U. S. __, __ (2008) (slip op., at 18–19); Anza v.&para;<br>Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 460–461 (2006).&para;<br>Because the City’s theory of causation requires us to move&para;<br>well beyond the first step, that theory cannot meet RICO’s&para;<br>direct relationship requirement.&para;<br>Our decision in Anza, supra, confirms that the City’s&para;<br>theory of causation is far too indirect. There we consid­&para;<br>ered a RICO claim brought by Ideal Steel Supply against&para;<br>its competitor, National Steel Supply. Ideal alleged that&para;<br>National had defrauded New York State by failing to&para;<br>charge and remit sales taxes, and that National was thus&para;<br>able to undercut Ideal’s prices. The lower prices offered by&para;<br>National, Ideal contended, allowed National to attract&para;<br>customers at Ideal’s expense. Id., at 458.&para;<br>Finding the link between the fraud alleged and injury&para;<br>suffered to be “attenuated,” we rejected Ideal’s claim. Id.,&para;<br>at 459. “The direct victim of this conduct,” we held, was&para;<br>“the State of New York, not Ideal.” Id., at 458. “It was the&para;<br>State that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax&para;<br>revenue as a result.” Ibid. We recognized that Ideal had&para;<br>asserted “its own harms when [National] failed to charge&para;<br>customers for the applicable sales tax.” Ibid. But the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cause of Ideal’s harm was “a set of actions (offering lower&para;<br>prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation&para;<br>(defrauding the State).” Ibid. The alleged violation there­&para;<br>fore had not “led directly to the plaintiff’s injuries,” and&para;<br>Ideal accordingly had failed to meet RICO’s “requirement&para;<br>of a direct causal connection” between the predicate of­&para;<br>fense and the alleged harm. Id., at 460–461.&para;<br>The City’s claim suffers from the same defect as the&para;<br>claim in Anza. Here, the conduct directly responsible for&para;<br>the City’s harm was the customers’ failure to pay their&para;<br>taxes. And the conduct constituting the alleged fraud was&para;<br>Hemi’s failure to file Jenkins Act reports. Thus, as in&para;<br>Anza, the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct&para;<br>from the conduct giving rise to the fraud. See id., at 458.&para;<br>Indeed, the disconnect between the asserted injury and&para;<br>the alleged fraud in this case is even sharper than in&para;<br>Anza. There, we viewed the point as important because&para;<br>the same party—National Steel—had both engaged in the&para;<br>harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. We&para;<br>nevertheless found the distinction between the relevant&para;<br>acts sufficient to defeat Ideal’s RICO claim. Here, the&para;<br>City’s theory of liability rests not just on separate actions,&para;<br>but separate actions carried out by separate parties.&para;<br>The City’s theory thus requires that we extend RICO&para;<br>liability to situations where the defendant’s fraud on the&para;<br>third party (the State) has made it easier for a fourth&para;<br>party (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the&para;<br>City). Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused&para;<br>harm to the City in the first place if they decided not to&para;<br>pay taxes they were legally obligated to pay. Put simply,&para;<br>Hemi’s obligation was to file the Jenkins Act reports with&para;<br>the State, not the City, and the City’s harm was directly&para;<br>caused by the customers, not Hemi. We have never before&para;<br>stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and&para;<br>we decline to do so today. See id., at 460–461; cf. Associ&para;<br>ated Gen.

The State certainly is&para;<br>better situated than the City to seek recovery from Hemi.&para;<br>And the State has an incentive to sue—the State imposes&para;<br>its own $2.75 per pack tax on cigarettes possessed within&para;<br>the State, nearly double what the City charges. N. Y. Tax&para;<br>Law Ann. §471(1) (West Supp. 2009). We do not opine on&para;<br>whether the State could bring a RICO action for any lost&para;<br>tax revenue. Suffice it to say that the State would have&para;<br>concrete incentives to try. See Anza, supra, at 460 (“Ideal&para;<br>accuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out&para;<br>of a substantial amount of money. If the allegations are&para;<br>true, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate&para;<br>remedies”).&para;<br>The dissent would have RICO’s proximate cause re­&para;<br>quirement turn on foreseeability, rather than on the exis­&para;<br>tence of a sufficiently “direct relationship” between the&para;<br>fraud and the harm. It would find that the City has satis­&para;<br>fied that requirement because “the harm is foreseeable; it&para;<br>is a consequence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and&para;<br>it falls well within the set of risks that Congress sought to&para;<br>prevent.” Post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). If this line of&para;<br>reasoning sounds familiar, it should. It is precisely the&para;<br>argument lodged against the majority opinion in Anza.&para;<br>There, the dissent criticized the majority’s view for “per­&para;<br>mit[ting] a defendant to evade liability for harms that are&para;<br>not only foreseeable, but the intended consequences of&para;<br>the defendant’s unlawful behavior.” 547 U. S., at 470&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>But the dissent there did not carry the day, and no one&para;<br>has asked us to revisit Anza.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The concepts of direct relationship and foreseeability are&para;<br>of course two of the “many shapes [proximate cause] took&para;<br>at common law,” Holmes, supra, at 268. Our precedents&para;<br>make clear that in the RICO context, the focus is on the&para;<br>directness of the relationship between the conduct and the&para;<br>harm. Indeed, Anza and Holmes never even mention the&para;<br>concept of foreseeability.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The City offers a number of responses. It first chal­&para;<br>lenges our characterization of the violation at issue. In&para;<br>the City’s view, the violation is not merely Hemi’s failure&para;<br>to file Jenkins Act information with the State, but a more&para;<br>general “systematic scheme to defraud the City of tax&para;<br>revenue.” Brief for Respondent 42. Having broadly de­&para;<br>fined the violation, the City contends that it has been&para;<br>directly harmed by reason of that systematic scheme.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>But the City cannot escape the proximate cause re­&para;<br>quirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme&para;<br>embraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged con­&para;<br>duct. Otherwise our RICO proximate cause precedent&para;<br>would become a mere pleading rule. In Anza, for example,&para;<br>Ideal alleged that National’s scheme “was to give National&para;<br>a competitive advantage over Ideal.” 547 U. S., at 454–&para;<br>455. But that allegation did not prevent the Court from&para;<br>concluding that National’s fraud directly harmed only the&para;<br>State, not Ideal. As the Court explained, Ideal could not&para;<br>“circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by&para;<br>claiming that the defendant’s aim was to increase market&para;<br>share at a competitor’s expense.” Id., at 460.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Even if we were willing to look to Hemi’s intent, as the dissent sug­&para;<br>gests we should, the City would fare no better. Hemi’s aim was not to&para;<br>defraud the City (or the State, for that matter) of tax revenue, but to&para;<br>sell more cigarettes. Hemi itself neither owed taxes nor was obliged to&para;<br>collect and remit them. This all suggests that Hemi’s alleged fraud was&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.&para;<br>479, 497 (1985)). In its RICO statement, the City alleged&para;<br>that Hemi’s failure to file Jenkins Act reports constituted&para;<br>the predicate act of mail and wire fraud.

The only fraudulent conduct alleged&para;<br>here is a violation of the Jenkins Act. See 541 F. 3d, at&para;<br>459 (Winter, J., dissenting). Thus, the City must show&para;<br>that Hemi’s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the&para;<br>State led directly to its injuries. This it cannot do.&para;<br>The City also relies on Bridge, 553 U. S. ___. Bridge&para;<br>reaffirmed the requirement that there must be “a suffi­&para;<br>ciently direct relationship between the defendant’s wrong­&para;<br>ful conduct and the plaintiff’s injury.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 18). The case involved competing bidders at a county&para;<br>tax-lien auction. Because the liens were profitable even at&para;<br>the lowest possible bid, multiple bidders offered that low&para;<br>bid. (The bidding took the form of the percentage tax&para;<br>penalty the bidder would require the property owner to&para;<br>pay, so the lowest possible bid was 0%.) To decide which&para;<br>bidder would be awarded the lien, the county devised a&para;<br>plan to allocate the liens “on a rotational basis.” Id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). But&para;<br>as we noted in that case, this created a “perverse incen­&para;<br>tive”: “Bidders who, in addition to bidding themselves,&para;<br>sen[t] agents to bid on their behalf [would] obtain a dis­&para;<br>proportionate share of liens.” Ibid. The county therefore&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>aimed at Hemi’s competitors, not the City. But Anza teaches that the&para;<br>&para;<br>competitors’ injuries in such a case are too attenuated to state a RICO&para;<br>&para;<br>claim.&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v.

Ibid.&para;<br>A losing bidder alleged that a competitor had defrauded&para;<br>the county by employing shadow bidders to secure a&para;<br>greater proportion of liens than it was due. We held that&para;<br>the bidder-plaintiff had met RICO’s causation require­&para;<br>ment. Distinguishing that claim from the one at issue in&para;<br>Anza, we noted that the plaintiff’s theory of causation in&para;<br>Bridge was “straightforward”: Because of the zero-sum&para;<br>nature of the auction, and because the county awarded&para;<br>bids on a rotational basis, each time a fraud-induced bid&para;<br>was awarded, a particular legitimate bidder was necessar­&para;<br>ily passed over. 553 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The&para;<br>losing bidders, moreover, “were the only parties injured by&para;<br>petitioners’ misrepresentations.” Ibid. The county was&para;<br>not; it received the same revenue regardless of which&para;<br>bidder prevailed.&para;<br>The City’s theory in this case is anything but straight­&para;<br>forward: Multiple steps, as we have detailed, separate the&para;<br>alleged fraud from the asserted injury. And in contrast to&para;<br>Bridge, where there were “no independent factors that&para;<br>account[ed] for [the plaintiff’s] injury,” ibid., here there&para;<br>certainly were: The City’s theory of liability rests on the&para;<br>independent actions of third and even fourth parties.&para;<br>The City at various points during the proceedings below&para;<br>described its injury as the lost “opportunity to tax” rather&para;<br>than “lost tax revenue.” It is not clear that there is a&para;<br>substantive distinction between the two descriptions. In&para;<br>any event, before this Court, the City’s argument turned&para;<br>on lost revenue, not a lost opportunity to collect it. See,&para;<br>e.g., Brief for Respondent i (“Counter-Question Pre­&para;<br>sented[:] Does the City of New York have standing under&para;<br>RICO because lost tax revenue constitutes a direct injury&para;<br>to the City’s ‘business or property’ in accord with the&para;<br>statute, 18 U.

It is contractually obliged to&para;<br>pass the information on to New York City (and I as­&para;<br>sume it normally does so). Id., ¶¶8–9, 11, 54–57.&para;<br>5. When it receives Jenkins-Act-type information, New&para;<br>York City writes letters to resident customers asking&para;<br>them to pay the tobacco tax they owe. As a result,&para;<br>New York City collects about 40% of the tax due. (By&para;<br>doing so, in 2005 the City obtained $400,000 out of $1&para;<br>million owed.) Id., ¶¶58–59.&para;<br>6. Hemi has consistently and intentionally failed to file&para;<br>Jenkins Act reports in order to prevent both State and&para;<br>City from collecting the tobacco taxes that Hemi’s in­&para;<br>state customers owe and which otherwise many of&para;<br>those customers would pay. Id., ¶¶13, 24, 58.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The majority asks whether New York City stated a valid&para;<br>cause of action in alleging that it lost tobacco tax revenue&para;<br>“by reason of” Hemi’s unlawful misrepresentations. The&para;<br>facts just set forth make clear that we must answer that&para;<br>question affirmatively. For one thing, no one denies that&para;<br>Hemi’s misrepresentation was a “but-for” condition of New&para;<br>York City’s loss. In the absence of the misrepresentation,&para;<br>i.e., had Hemi told New York State the truth about its&para;<br>New York City customers, New York City would have&para;<br>written letters to the purchasers and obtained a signifi­&para;<br>cant share of the tobacco taxes buyers owed.&para;<br>For another thing, New York City’s losses are “reasona­&para;<br>bly foreseeable” results of the misrepresentation. It is&para;<br>foreseeable that, without the name/address/purchase&para;<br>information, New York City would not be able to write&para;<br>successful dunning letters, and it is foreseeable that, with&para;<br>that information, it would be able to write successful&para;<br>dunning letters. Indeed, that is a natural inference from,&para;<br>among other things, the complaint’s assertion that Hemi&para;<br>advertised that it did not “report” sales information to&para;<br>“State taxing authorit[ies].” See, e.g., Smith v. Bolles, 132&para;<br>U. S. 125, 130 (1889) (for causation purposes, “ ‘those&para;<br>results are proximate which the wrong-doer from his&para;<br>position must have contemplated as the probable conse­&para;<br>quence of his fraud or breach of contract’ ” (quoting Crater&para;<br>v. Binninger, 33 N. J. L. 513, 518 (Ct. Errors and Appeals&para;<br>1869)); see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.

But cf. ante, at 9&para;<br>(“The dissent would have RICO’s proximate cause re­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

It&para;<br>knew the loss would occur; it intended the loss to occur;&para;<br>one might even say it desired the loss to occur. It is diffi­&para;<br>cult to find common-law cases denying liability for a&para;<br>wrongdoer’s intended consequences, particularly where&para;<br>those consequences are also foreseeable. Cf. Bridge, su&para;<br>pra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10) (“[S]uppose an enterprise&para;<br>that wants to get rid of rival businesses mails representa­&para;<br>tions about them to their customers and suppliers, but not&para;<br>to the rivals themselves.

[but] the&para;<br>harm would not be an accident because the shooter in­&para;<br>tended the harm, even though the likelihood of success&para;<br>was improbable”); 1 F. Harper &amp; F. James, The Law&para;<br>of Torts, §7.13, p. 584 (1956) (explaining that, ordinarily,&para;<br>“all intended consequences” of an intentional act “are&para;<br>proximate”).&para;<br>In addition, New York City’s revenue loss falls squarely&para;<br>within the bounds of the kinds of harms that the Jenkins&para;<br>Act (essentially the predicate statute) seeks to prevent.&para;<br>The statute is entitled “An Act To assist States in collect­&para;<br>ing sales and use taxes on cigarettes.” 63 Stat. 884. I&para;<br>have no reason to believe the Act intends any different&para;<br>result with respect to collection of a city’s tobacco tax&para;<br>assessed under the authority of state law. See N. Y.

CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>own cigarette taxes). The Restatement (Second) of Torts&para;<br>explains that where&para;<br>“a statute requires information to be furnished . . . for&para;<br>the protection of a particular class of persons, one who&para;<br>makes a fraudulent misrepresentation . . . is subject to&para;<br>liability to the persons for pecuniary loss . . . in a&para;<br>transaction of the kind in which the statute is in­&para;<br>tended to protect them.” §536, at 77 (1976).&para;<br>See also §536, Appendix (citing supporting cases in the&para;<br>Reporter’s Note).&para;<br>Finally, we have acknowledged that “Congress modeled&para;<br>§1964(c) on the civil-action provision of the federal anti­&para;<br>trust laws,” and we have therefore looked to those laws as&para;<br>an interpretive aid in RICO cases. Holmes v. Securities&para;<br>Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 267, 268&para;<br>(1992). I can find no antitrust analogy that suggests any&para;<br>lack of causation here, nor has the majority referred to&para;<br>any such analogical antitrust circumstance.&para;<br>The upshot is that the harm is foreseeable; it is a conse­&para;<br>quence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and it falls&para;<br>well within the set of risks that Congress sought to pre­&para;<br>vent. Neither antitrust analogy nor any statutory policy of&para;<br>which I am aware precludes a finding of “proximate&para;<br>cause.” I recognize that some of our opinions may be read&para;<br>to suggest that the words “by reason of” in RICO do not&para;<br>perfectly track common-law notions of proximate cause.&para;<br>See, e.g., Bridge, 553 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–16).&para;<br>But where so much basic common law argues in favor of&para;<br>such a finding, how can the Court avoid that conclusion&para;<br>here?&para;<br>B&para;<br>The majority bases its contrary conclusion upon three&para;<br>special circumstances and its reading of two of this Court’s&para;<br>prior cases. In my view, none of the three circumstances&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>precludes finding causation (indeed two are not even&para;<br>relevant to the causation issue). Nor can I find the two&para;<br>prior cases controlling.&para;<br>The three circumstances are the following: First, the&para;<br>majority seems to argue that the intervening voluntary&para;<br>acts of third parties, namely, the customers’ own inde­&para;<br>pendent failures to pay the tax, cuts the causal chain.&para;<br>Ante, at 8 (“[T]he City’s harm was directly caused by the&para;<br>customers, not Hemi”); see Saugerties Bank v. Delaware &amp;&para;<br>Hudson Co., 236 N. Y. 425, 430, 141 N. E. 904, 905 (1923)&para;<br>(third party’s forgery of a bill of lading an intervening&para;<br>cause); Prosser and Keeton §44, at 313–314 (collecting&para;<br>cases on intervening intentional or criminal acts). But an&para;<br>intervening third-party act, even if criminal, does not cut a&para;<br>causal chain where the intervening act is foreseeable and&para;<br>the defendant’s conduct increases the risk of its occur­&para;<br>rence. See Lillie v. Thompson, 332 U. S. 459, 462 (1947)&para;<br>(per curiam); Horan v. Watertown, 217 Mass. 185, 186, 104&para;<br>N. E. 464, 465 (1914); see also Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Torts §435A, at 454 (1963–1964) (intentional tortfeasor&para;<br>liable for intended harm “except where the harm results&para;<br>from an outside force the risk of which is not increased by&para;<br>the defendant’s act”). Hemi’s act here did increase the&para;<br>risk that New York City would not be paid; and not only&para;<br>was the risk foreseeable, but Hemi’s advertising strongly&para;<br>suggests that Hemi actually knew nonreporting would&para;<br>likely bring about this very harm.&para;<br>The majority claims that “directness,” rather than fore­&para;<br>seeability, should be our guide in assessing proximate&para;<br>cause, and that the lack of a “direct” relationship in this&para;<br>case precludes a finding of proximate causation. Ante, at&para;<br>9–10. But courts used this concept of directness in tort&para;<br>law to expand liability (for direct consequences) beyond&para;<br>what was foreseeable, not to eliminate liability for what&para;<br>was foreseeable. Thus, under the “directness” theory of&para;<br>proximate causation, there is liability for both “all ‘direct’&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(or ‘directly traceable’) consequences and those indirect&para;<br>consequences that are foreseeable.” Prosser and Keeton&para;<br>§42, at 273 (emphasis added); see also id., §43, at 294, and&para;<br>n. 17 (citing Nunan v. Bennett, 184 Ky. 591, 212 S. W.&para;<br>570 (1919)). I do not read this Court’s opinions in&para;<br>Holmes or Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451&para;<br>(2006), to invoke anything other than this traditional&para;<br>understanding.&para;<br>Second, the majority correctly points out that Hemi&para;<br>misrepresented the situation to the State, not to the&para;<br>City—a circumstance which, the majority believes, signifi­&para;<br>cantly separates misrepresentation from harm. Ante, at 8.&para;<br>But how could that be so? New York State signed a con­&para;<br>tract promising to relay relevant information to the City.&para;<br>In respect to that relevant information, the State is a&para;<br>conduit, indeed roughly analogous to a postal employee.&para;<br>This Court has recognized specifically that “under the&para;<br>common law a fraud may be established when the defen­&para;<br>dant has made use of a third party to reach the target of&para;<br>the fraud.” Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 129&para;<br>(1987). The treatises say the same. See, e.g., Prosser and&para;<br>Keeton §107, at 743–745; 26 C. J. S., Fraud §47, p. 1121&para;<br>(1921) (collecting cases); see also Prosser, Misrepresenta­&para;<br>tion and Third Parties, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 231, 240–241,&para;<br>and nn. 56–59, 62–64 (1966) (collecting cases). This Court&para;<br>has never suggested the contrary, namely, that a defen­&para;<br>dant is not liable for (foreseeable) harm (intentionally)&para;<br>caused to the target of a scheme to defraud simply because&para;<br>the misrepresentation was transmitted via a third (or even&para;<br>a fourth or fifth) party. Cf. Terry, Intent to Defraud, 25&para;<br>Yale L. J. 87, 93 (1915) (“When a representation is com­&para;<br>municated through one person to another in such circum­&para;<br>stances that it can be deemed to be directed to the latter,&para;<br>it makes no difference through how many persons or by&para;<br>how circuitous a route it reaches the latter . . .”).&para;<br>Third, the majority places great weight upon its view&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that Hemi tried to defraud the State, not the City. Ante,&para;<br>at 8–9. Hemi, however, sought to defraud both. Third&para;<br>Amended RICO Statement ¶d (explaining that “[e]very&para;<br>other State or local government that imposes a use tax on&para;<br>cigarettes and whose residents purchase cigarettes” from&para;<br>Hemi is a victim of its scheme to defraud). Hemi sought to&para;<br>prevent the State from collecting state taxes; and it sought&para;<br>to prevent the City from collecting city taxes. Here we are&para;<br>concerned only with the latter. In respect to the latter, the&para;<br>State was an information conduit. The fact that state&para;<br>taxes were also involved is beside the point.&para;<br>The two Supreme Court cases to which the majority&para;<br>refers involve significantly different causal circumstances.&para;<br>Ante, at 5–8. The predicate acts in Holmes—the defen­&para;<br>dant’s acts that led to the plaintiff’s harm—consisted of&para;<br>securities frauds. The defendant misrepresented the&para;<br>prospects of one company and misled the investing public&para;<br>into falsely believing that it could readily buy and sell the&para;<br>stock of another. When the truth came out, stock prices&para;<br>fell, investors (specifically, stockbrokers) lost money, and&para;<br>since the stockbrokers could not pay certain creditors,&para;<br>those creditors also lost money. 503 U. S., at 262–263.&para;<br>Claiming subrogation to stand in the shoes of the credi­&para;<br>tors, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation sued.&para;<br>Id., at 270–271.&para;<br>Since the creditors had not bought the securities, there&para;<br>was little reason to believe the defendant intended their&para;<br>harm. And the securities statutes seek, first and foremost,&para;<br>to protect investors, not creditors of those who sell stock to&para;<br>those investors. The latter harm (a broker’s creditor’s&para;<br>loss) differs in kind from the harm that the “predicate act”&para;<br>statute primarily seeks to avoid and that its violation&para;<br>would ordinarily cause (namely, investors’ stock-related&para;<br>monetary losses). As Part II–A, supra, points out, neither&para;<br>of these circumstances is present here.&para;<br>In Anza, the plaintiff was a business competitor of the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>defendants. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants&para;<br>falsely told state officials that they did not owe sales tax.&para;<br>The plaintiff added that, had the defendants paid the tax&para;<br>they owed, the defendants would have had less money&para;<br>available to run their business, and the plaintiff conse­&para;<br>quently would have been able to compete against them&para;<br>more effectively. 547 U. S., at 454, 457–458.&para;<br>Again, in Anza the kind of harm that the plaintiff al­&para;<br>leged is not the kind of harm that the tax statutes primar­&para;<br>ily seek to prevent. Rather, it alleged a kind of harm&para;<br>(competitive injury) that tax violations do not ordinarily&para;<br>cause and which ordinarily flows from the regular opera­&para;<br>tion of a competitive marketplace. Thus, in both Holmes&para;<br>and Anza, unlike the present case, plaintiffs alleged spe­&para;<br>cial harm, neither squarely within the class of harms at&para;<br>which the relevant statutes were directed, nor of a kind&para;<br>that typical violators would intend or even foresee.&para;<br>Bridge, which the majority seeks to distinguish, ante, at&para;<br>11–12, is a more closely analogous case. The defendants&para;<br>in that case directed agents to misrepresent to a county&para;<br>that they qualified as independent bidders at a county-run&para;<br>property auction. They consequently participated in the&para;<br>auction. And the plaintiffs, facing additional bidders, lost&para;<br>some of the property that they otherwise would have&para;<br>won—all to their financial disadvantage. 553 U. S., at&para;<br>___–___ (slip op., at 3–4). The harm was foreseeable; it&para;<br>was intended; and it was precisely the kind of harm that&para;<br>the county’s bidding rules sought to prevent. Thus this&para;<br>Court held that the harm was “a foreseeable and natural&para;<br>consequence of [the defendants’] scheme.” Id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 18).&para;<br>In sum, the majority recognizes that “[p]roximate cause&para;<br>for RICO purposes . . . should be evaluated in light of its&para;<br>common law foundations,” ante, at 6, but those founda­&para;<br>tions do not support the majority’s view. Moreover, the&para;<br>majority’s rationale would free from RICO liability defen­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dants who would appear to fall within its intended scope.&para;<br>Consider, for example, a group of defendants who use a&para;<br>marketing firm (in RICO terms, an “enterprise”) to perpe­&para;<br>trate a variation on a “pump and dump” scheme. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Salmonese, 352 F. 3d 608, 612 (CA2&para;<br>2003). They deliberately and repeatedly make egregiously&para;<br>fraudulent misrepresentations to inflate the price of secu­&para;<br>rities that, unbeknownst to investors, they own. After the&para;<br>stock price rises, the defendants sell at an artificial profit.&para;<br>When the fraud is revealed, the price crashes, to the inves­&para;<br>tors’ detriment. Suppose the defendants have intention­&para;<br>ally spoken directly only to intermediaries who simply&para;<br>repeated the information to potential investors, and have&para;<br>not had any contact with the investors themselves. Under&para;<br>the majority’s reasoning, these defendants apparently did&para;<br>not proximately cause the investors’ losses and are not&para;<br>liable under RICO.&para;<br>III&para;<br>If there is causation, we must decide whether, for RICO&para;<br>purposes, the City’s loss of tax revenue is “ ‘business or&para;<br>property’ under 18 U. S. C. §1964(c).” Ante, at 5 (acknowl­&para;<br>edging, but not reaching, this second issue). The question&para;<br>has led to concern among the lower courts. Some fear that&para;<br>an affirmative answer would turn RICO into a tax collec­&para;<br>tion statute, permitting States to bring RICO actions and&para;<br>recover treble damages for behavior that amounts to no&para;<br>more than a failure to pay taxes due. See, e.g., Michigan,&para;<br>Dept. of Treasury, Revenue Div. v. Fawaz, No. 86–1809,&para;<br>1988 WL 44736, *2 (CA6 1988) (holding that tax revenue&para;<br>is not RICO “property” lest district courts become “collec­&para;<br>tion agencies for unpaid state taxes”); Illinois Dept. of&para;<br>Revenue v. Phillips, 771 F. 2d 312, 316, 312 (CA7 1985)&para;<br>(holding, “reluctantly,” that “a state’s Department of&para;<br>Revenue may file suit in federal court for treble damages&para;<br>under [RICO] against a retailer who files fraudulent state&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sales tax returns”).&para;<br>In a related context, however, the Department of Justice&para;<br>has taken steps to avoid the “tax collection agency” prob­&para;<br>lem without reading all tax-related frauds out of similar&para;<br>federal criminal statutes. The Department’s prosecution&para;<br>guidelines require prosecutors considering a tax-related&para;<br>mail fraud or wire fraud or bank fraud prosecution (or a&para;<br>related RICO prosecution) to obtain approval from high­&para;<br>level Department officials. And those guidelines specify&para;<br>that the Department will grant that approval only where&para;<br>there is at issue “a large fraud loss or a substantial&para;<br>pattern of conduct” and will not do so, absent “unusual&para;<br>circumstances,” in cases involving simply “one person’s&para;<br>tax liability.” Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys’&para;<br>Manual §6–4.210(A) (2007), online at http://www.justice.&para;<br>gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title6/4mtax.htm&para;<br>(as visited Jan. 20, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s&para;<br>case file); see also §6–4.210(B) (explaining that the De­&para;<br>partment “will not authorize the use of mail, wire or bank&para;<br>fraud charges to convert routine tax prosecutions into&para;<br>RICO . . . cases”).&para;<br>This case involves an extensive pattern of fraudulent&para;<br>conduct, large revenue losses, and many different unre­&para;<br>lated potential taxpayers. The Department’s guidelines&para;<br>would appear to authorize prosecution in these circum­&para;<br>stances. And limiting my consideration to these circum­&para;<br>stances, I would find that this RICO complaint asserts a&para;<br>valid harm to “business or property.” I need not and do&para;<br>not express a view as to how or whether RICO’s civil&para;<br>action provisions apply to simpler instances of individual&para;<br>tax liability.&para;<br>This conclusion is virtually compelled by Pasquantino v.&para;<br>United States, 544 U. S. 349 (2005), a case that we decided&para;<br>only five years ago. We there pointed out that the right to&para;<br>uncollected taxes is an “entitlement to collect money . . . ,&para;<br>the possession of which is ‘something of value.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>355 (quoting McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358&para;<br>(1987)). Such an entitlement “has long been thought to be&para;<br>a species of property.” 544 U. S., at 356 (citing 3 W. Black­&para;<br>stone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 153–155&para;<br>(1768)). And “fraud at common law included a scheme to&para;<br>deprive a victim of his entitlement to money.” 544 U. S.,&para;<br>at 356. We observed that tax evasion “inflict[s] an eco­&para;<br>nomic injury no less than” the “embezzle[ment] [of] funds&para;<br>from the . . . treasury.” Ibid. And we consequently held&para;<br>that “Canada’s right to uncollected excise taxes on the&para;<br>liquor petitioners imported into Canada” is “ ‘property’ ”&para;<br>within the terms of the mail fraud statute. Id., at 355.&para;<br>Hemi points in reply to our decision in Hawaii v. Stan&para;<br>dard Oil Co. of Cal., 405 U. S. 251 (1972). But that case&para;<br>involved not a loss of tax revenues, but “injury to the&para;<br>general economy of a State”—insofar as it was threatened&para;<br>by violations of antitrust law. Id., at 260. Hawaii’s inter­&para;<br>est, both more general and derivative of harm to individ­&para;<br>ual businesses, differs significantly from the particular tax&para;<br>loss at issue in Pasquantino and directly at issue here.&para;<br>We have previously made clear that the compensable&para;<br>injury for RICO purposes is the harm caused by the predi­&para;<br>cate acts. See generally Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,&para;<br>473 U. S. 479, 495–496 (1985); cf. Cleveland v. United&para;<br>States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000). I can find no convincing&para;<br>reason in the context of this case to distinguish in the&para;<br>circumstances present here between “property” as used in&para;<br>the mail fraud statute and “property” as used in RICO.&para;<br>Hence, I would postpone for another day the question&para;<br>whether RICO covers instances where little more than the&para;<br>liability of an individual taxpayer is at issue. And I would&para;<br>find in the respondent’s favor here.&para;<br>With respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
