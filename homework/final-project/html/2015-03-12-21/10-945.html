Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS &para;<br>&para;<br>OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–945.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 12, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Jersey state&para;<br>trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a&para;<br>bench warrant issued for petitioner’s arrest after he failed to appear&para;<br>at a hearing to enforce a fine. He was initially detained in the Burlington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Correctional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the&para;<br>fine had been paid. At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming&para;<br>detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for&para;<br>scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed. Petitioner claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out&para;<br>his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals. At the second jail, petitioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while&para;<br>an officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an&para;<br>officer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, armpits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his&para;<br>clothes examined. Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift&para;<br>his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting. He filed a 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1983 action in the Federal District Court against the government entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging&para;<br>Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive&para;<br>searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of&para;<br>weapons, drugs, or other contraband. The court granted him summary judgment, ruling that “strip-searching” nonindictable offenders&para;<br>without reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment. The&para;<br>Third Circuit reversed.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>621 F. 3d 296, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to&para;<br>Part IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails&para;<br>struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of&para;<br>the institutions, and thus the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments&para;<br>do not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner proposes. Pp. 5−18, 19.&para;<br>(a) Maintaining safety and order at detention centers requires the&para;<br>expertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to problems. A regulation impinging on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley,&para;<br>482 U. S. 78, 89. This Court, in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558,&para;<br>upheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional facilities “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of&para;<br>a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from&para;<br>outside the institution[s],” deferring to the judgment of correctional&para;<br>officials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to&para;<br>deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.&para;<br>In Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586−587, the Court upheld a&para;<br>general ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling&para;<br>threat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions&para;<br>for certain detainees. The Court, in Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,&para;<br>522−523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband&para;<br>depends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable&para;<br>exceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of&para;<br>inmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is&para;<br>concealing a prohibited item. These cases establish that correctional&para;<br>officials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and&para;<br>that “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate&para;<br>that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such&para;<br>matters,” Block, supra, at 584–585.&para;<br>Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to&para;<br>be processed at jails. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 354.&para;<br>Pp. 5−9.&para;<br>(b) The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives&para;<br>involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.&para;<br>Correctional officials have a significant interest in conducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake process. The admission&para;<br>of new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee popula-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion, and the new detainees themselves. Officials therefore must&para;<br>screen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring&para;<br>immediate medical attention. It may be difficult to identify and treat&para;<br>medical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual inspection. Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving&para;<br>them reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for&para;<br>signs of gang affiliation as part of the intake process. Additionally,&para;<br>correctional officials have to detect weapons, drugs, alcohol, and&para;<br>other prohibited items new detainees may possess. Drugs can make&para;<br>inmates aggressive toward officers or each other, and drug trading&para;<br>can lead to violent confrontations. Contraband has value in a jail’s&para;<br>culture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods&para;<br>can lead to violence, extortion, and disorder. Pp. 9−13.&para;<br>(c) Petitioner’s proposal―that new detainees not arrested for serious crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from&para;<br>invasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding contraband―is unworkable. The seriousness of&para;<br>an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be&para;<br>difficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the&para;<br>proposed exemption. Even persons arrested for a minor offense may&para;<br>be coerced by others into concealing contraband. Exempting people&para;<br>arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may&para;<br>put them at greater risk and result in more contraband being&para;<br>brought into the detention facility.&para;<br>It also may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search. Jail officials know little at the&para;<br>outset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about&para;<br>his identity. The officers conducting an initial search often do not&para;<br>have access to criminal history records. And those records can be inaccurate or incomplete. Even with accurate information, officers&para;<br>would encounter serious implementation difficulties. They would be&para;<br>required to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were&para;<br>serious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol. Other&para;<br>possible classifications based on characteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of&para;<br>discriminatory application. To avoid liability, officers might be inclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population. While the restrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy&para;<br>of some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to everyone in the facility, including the less serious offenders. The Fourth&para;<br>and Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed&para;<br>framework. Pp. 13−18, 19.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v.

Facility personnel, other inmates, and the&para;<br>new detainee himself or herself may be in danger if these&para;<br>threats are introduced into the jail population. This case&para;<br>presents the question of what rules, or limitations, the&para;<br>Constitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who&para;<br>are to be held in jail while their cases are being processed.&para;<br>The term “jail” is used here in a broad sense to include&para;<br>prisons and other detention facilities.&para;<br>The specific&para;<br>measures being challenged will be described in more&para;<br>detail; but, in broad terms, the controversy concerns&para;<br>whether every detainee who will be admitted to the general population may be required to undergo a close visual&para;<br>inspection while undressed.&para;<br>The case turns in part on the extent to which this Court&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV of this opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>has sufficient expertise and information in the record to&para;<br>mandate, under the Constitution, the specific restrictions&para;<br>and limitations sought by those who challenge the visual&para;<br>search procedures at issue. In addressing this type of&para;<br>constitutional claim courts must defer to the judgment of&para;<br>correctional officials unless the record contains substantial&para;<br>evidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or unjustified response to problems of jail security. That&para;<br>necessary showing has not been made in this case.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, petitioner Albert Florence was arrested after fleeing from&para;<br>police officers in Essex County, New Jersey. He was&para;<br>charged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly&para;<br>weapon. Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser&para;<br>offenses and was sentenced to pay a fine in monthly installments. In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments&para;<br>and failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench&para;<br>warrant was issued for his arrest. He paid the outstanding balance less than a week later; but, for some unexplained reason, the warrant remained in a statewide&para;<br>computer database.&para;<br>Two years later, in Burlington County, New Jersey,&para;<br>petitioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile&para;<br>by a state trooper. Based on the outstanding warrant in&para;<br>the computer system, the officer arrested petitioner and&para;<br>took him to the Burlington County Detention Center. He&para;<br>was held there for six days and then was transferred to&para;<br>the Essex County Correctional Facility. It is not the arrest or confinement but the search process at each jail that&para;<br>gives rise to the claims before the Court.&para;<br>Burlington County jail procedures required every arrestee to shower with a delousing agent. Officers would&para;<br>check arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as they disrobed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner claims he was also instructed to open his&para;<br>mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and&para;<br>lift his genitals. (It is not clear whether this last step was&para;<br>part of the normal practice. See ibid.) Petitioner shared a&para;<br>cell with at least one other person and interacted with&para;<br>other inmates following his admission to the jail. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 17.&para;<br>The Essex County Correctional Facility, where petitioner was taken after six days, is the largest county jail&para;<br>in New Jersey. App. 70a. It admits more than 25,000 inmates each year and houses about 1,000 gang members at&para;<br>any given time. When petitioner was transferred there,&para;<br>all arriving detainees passed through a metal detector and&para;<br>waited in a group holding cell for a more thorough search.&para;<br>When they left the holding cell, they were instructed to&para;<br>remove their clothing while an officer looked for body&para;<br>markings, wounds, and contraband. Apparently without&para;<br>touching the detainees, an officer looked at their ears,&para;<br>nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits,&para;<br>and other body openings. Id., at 57a–59a; App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 137a–144a. This policy applied regardless of the&para;<br>circumstances of the arrest, the suspected offense, or the&para;<br>detainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history. Petitioner alleges he was required to lift his genitals, turn&para;<br>around, and cough in a squatting position as part of the&para;<br>process. After a mandatory shower, during which his&para;<br>clothes were inspected, petitioner was admitted to the&para;<br>facility. App. 3a–4a, 52a, 258a. He was released the next&para;<br>day, when the charges against him were dismissed.&para;<br>Petitioner sued the governmental entities that operated&para;<br>the jails, one of the wardens, and certain other defendants.&para;<br>The suit was commenced in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the District of New Jersey. Seeking relief under&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1983 for violations of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, petitioner maintained that persons arrested for a minor offense could not be required&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>to remove their clothing and expose the most private areas&para;<br>of their bodies to close visual inspection as a routine part&para;<br>of the intake process. Rather, he contended, officials could&para;<br>conduct this kind of search only if they had reason to&para;<br>suspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon, drugs,&para;<br>or other contraband. The District Court certified a class of&para;<br>individuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense&para;<br>under New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington&para;<br>County or Essex County jail, and directed to strip naked&para;<br>even though an officer had not articulated any reasonable&para;<br>suspicion they were concealing contraband.&para;<br>After discovery, the court granted petitioner’s motion&para;<br>for summary judgment on the unlawful search claim. It&para;<br>concluded that any policy of “strip searching” nonindictable offenders without reasonable suspicion violated the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment. A divided panel of the United States&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding&para;<br>that the procedures described by the District Court struck&para;<br>a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the&para;<br>security needs of the two jails. 621 F. 3d 296 (2010). The&para;<br>case proceeds on the understanding that the officers&para;<br>searched detainees prior to their admission to the general&para;<br>population, as the Court of Appeals seems to have assumed. See id., at 298, 311. Petitioner has not argued&para;<br>this factual premise is incorrect.&para;<br>The opinions in earlier proceedings, the briefs on file,&para;<br>and some cases of this Court refer to a “strip search.” The&para;<br>term is imprecise. It may refer simply to the instruction&para;<br>to remove clothing while an officer observes from a distance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual inspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance; it&para;<br>may include directing detainees to shake their heads or to&para;<br>run their hands through their hair to dislodge what might&para;<br>be hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise&para;<br>arms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the&para;<br>ears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cough in a squatting position. In the instant case, the&para;<br>term does not include any touching of unclothed areas&para;<br>by the inspecting officer. There are no allegations that&para;<br>the detainees here were touched in any way as part of the&para;<br>searches.&para;<br>The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing&para;<br>conclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires&para;<br>correctional officials to exempt some detainees who will be&para;<br>admitted to a jail’s general population from the searches&para;<br>here at issue. This Court granted certiorari to address the&para;<br>question. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The difficulties of operating a detention center must not&para;<br>be underestimated by the courts. Turner v. Safley, 482&para;<br>U. S. 78, 84–85 (1987). Jails (in the stricter sense of&para;<br>the term, excluding prison facilities) admit more than 13&para;<br>million inmates a year. See, e.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau&para;<br>of Justice Statistics, T. Minton, Jail Inmates at Midyear&para;<br>2010—Statistical Tables 2 (2011). The largest facilities&para;<br>process hundreds of people every day; smaller jails may be&para;<br>crowded on weekend nights, after a large police operation,&para;<br>or because of detainees arriving from other jurisdictions.&para;<br>Maintaining safety and order at these institutions requires the expertise of correctional officials, who must&para;<br>have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions&para;<br>to the problems they face. The Court has confirmed the&para;<br>importance of deference to correctional officials and explained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related&para;<br>to legitimate penological interests.” Turner, supra, at 89;&para;<br>see Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 131–132 (2003).&para;<br>But see Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 510–511&para;<br>(2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications).&para;<br>The Court’s opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520&para;<br>(1979), is the starting point for understanding how this&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>framework applies to Fourth Amendment challenges.&para;<br>That case addressed a rule requiring pretrial detainees&para;<br>in any correctional facility run by the Federal Bureau of&para;<br>Prisons “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection&para;<br>as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact&para;<br>visit with a person from outside the institution.” Id., at&para;<br>558. Inmates at the federal Metropolitan Correctional&para;<br>Center in New York City argued there was no security&para;<br>justification for these searches. Officers searched guests&para;<br>before they entered the visiting room, and the inmates&para;<br>were under constant surveillance during the visit. Id., at&para;<br>577–578 (Marshall, J., dissenting). There had been but&para;<br>one instance in which an inmate attempted to sneak contraband back into the facility. See id., at 559 (majority&para;<br>opinion). The Court nonetheless upheld the search policy.&para;<br>It deferred to the judgment of correctional officials that&para;<br>the inspections served not only to discover but also to&para;<br>deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items inside. Id., at 558. The Court explained that&para;<br>there is no mechanical way to determine whether intrusions on an inmate’s privacy are reasonable. Id., at 559.&para;<br>The need for a particular search must be balanced against&para;<br>the resulting invasion of personal rights. Ibid.&para;<br>Policies designed to keep contraband out of jails and&para;<br>prisons have been upheld in cases decided since Bell. In&para;<br>Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), for example, the&para;<br>Court concluded that the Los Angeles County Jail could&para;<br>ban all contact visits because of the threat they posed:&para;<br>“They open the institution to the introduction of&para;<br>drugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can&para;<br>easily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contraband in countless ways and pass them to an inmate&para;<br>unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers. And&para;<br>these items can readily be slipped from the clothing of&para;<br>an innocent child, or transferred by other visitors&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>permitted close contact with inmates.” Id., at 586.&para;<br>There were “many justifications” for imposing a general&para;<br>ban rather than trying to carve out exceptions for certain&para;<br>detainees. Id., at 587. Among other problems, it would be&para;<br>“a difficult if not impossible task” to identify “inmates who&para;<br>have propensities for violence, escape, or drug smuggling.”&para;<br>Ibid. This was made “even more difficult by the brevity of&para;<br>detention and the constantly changing nature of the inmate population.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Court has also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband depends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable exceptions. In Hudson&para;<br>v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984), it addressed the question&para;<br>of whether prison officials could perform random searches&para;<br>of inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect&para;<br>a particular individual of concealing a prohibited item.&para;<br>Id., at 522–523. The Court upheld the constitutionality of&para;<br>the practice, recognizing that “ ‘[f]or one to advocate that&para;<br>prison searches must be conducted only pursuant to an&para;<br>enunciated general policy or when suspicion is directed at&para;<br>a particular inmate is to ignore the realities of prison&para;<br>operation.’ ” Id., at 529 (quoting Marrero v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S. E. 2d 809, 811 (1981)).&para;<br>Inmates would adapt to any pattern or loopholes they&para;<br>discovered in the search protocol and then undermine the&para;<br>security of the institution. 468 U. S., at 529.&para;<br>These cases establish that correctional officials must be&para;<br>permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect&para;<br>and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities.&para;<br>See Bell, 441 U. S., at 546 (“[M]aintaining institutional&para;<br>security and preserving internal order and discipline are&para;<br>essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of&para;<br>retained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners&para;<br>and pretrial detainees”). The task of determining whether&para;<br>a policy is reasonably related to legitimate security inter-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>ests is “peculiarly within the province and professional&para;<br>expertise of corrections officials.” Id., at 548. This Court&para;<br>has repeated the admonition that, “ ‘in the absence of&para;<br>substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the&para;<br>officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert&para;<br>judgment in such matters.’ ” Block, supra, at 584–585;&para;<br>Bell, supra, at 548.&para;<br>In many jails officials seek to improve security by requiring some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be&para;<br>detained. These procedures have been used in different&para;<br>places throughout the country, from Cranston, Rhode&para;<br>Island, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho. See&para;<br>Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F. 3d 107, 108–109 (CA1&para;<br>2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F. 2d 393, 394 (CA10&para;<br>1993); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984)&para;<br>(per curiam); see also, e.g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San&para;<br>Francisco, 595 F. 3d 964 (CA9 2010) (en banc) (San Francisco, California); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298 (CA11&para;<br>2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Masters v.

Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5&para;<br>1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.).&para;<br>Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the&para;<br>detainees processed at these facilities. This is, in part, a&para;<br>consequence of the exercise of state authority that was the&para;<br>subject of Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001).&para;<br>Atwater addressed the perhaps more fundamental question of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in&para;<br>the first place. The case involved a woman who was arrested after a police officer noticed neither she nor her&para;<br>children were wearing their seatbelts. The arrestee argued the Fourth Amendment prohibited her custodial&para;<br>arrest without a warrant when an offense could not result&para;<br>in jail time and there was no compelling need for immedi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ate detention. Id., at 346. The Court held that a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment restriction on this power would put officers in&para;<br>an “almost impossible spot.” Id., at 350. Their ability to&para;<br>arrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the precise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat&para;<br>offender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling&para;<br>need to detain someone. Id., at 348–349. The Court rejected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred&para;<br>custodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of&para;<br>constitutional law. It ruled, based on established principles, that officers may make an arrest based upon probable cause to believe the person has committed a criminal&para;<br>offense in their presence. See id., at 354. The Court&para;<br>stated that “a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is&para;<br>not well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-bycase determinations of government need, lest every discretionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion&para;<br>for constitutional review.” Id., at 347.&para;<br>Atwater did not address whether the Constitution imposes special restrictions on the searches of offenders&para;<br>suspected of committing minor offenses once they are&para;<br>taken to jail.

The admission of inmates creates numerous risks&para;<br>for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and&para;<br>for a new detainee himself or herself. The danger of introducing lice or contagious infections, for example, is well&para;<br>documented.

PBA Brief 17.&para;<br>These considerations provide a reasonable basis to justify&para;<br>a visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of&para;<br>gang affiliation as part of the intake process.

S., at 528 (recognizing “the constant&para;<br>fight against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit&para;<br>drugs, and other contraband”). Correctional officers have&para;<br>had to confront arrestees concealing knives, scissors, razor&para;<br>blades, glass shards, and other prohibited items on their&para;<br>person, including in their body cavities.

See PBA Brief 11.&para;<br>There are many other kinds of contraband. The textbook definition of the term covers any unauthorized item.&para;<br>See Prisons: Today and Tomorrow 237 (J. Pollock ed.&para;<br>1997) (“Contraband is any item that is possessed in violation of prison rules. Contraband obviously includes drugs&para;<br>or weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even&para;<br>some types of clothing”). Everyday items can undermine&para;<br>security if introduced into a detention facility:&para;<br>“Lighters and matches are fire and arson risks or potential weapons. Cell phones are used to orchestrate&para;<br>violence and criminality both within and without jailhouse walls. Pills and medications enhance suicide&para;<br>risks. Chewing gum can block locking devices; hairpins can open handcuffs; wigs can conceal drugs and&para;<br>weapons.” New Jersey Wardens Brief 8–9.&para;<br>Something as simple as an overlooked pen can pose a&para;<br>significant danger. Inmates commit more than 10,000&para;<br>assaults on correctional staff every year and many more&para;<br>among themselves. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice&para;<br>Statistics, J. Stephan &amp; J. Karberg, Census of State and&para;<br>Federal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003).&para;<br>Contraband creates additional problems because scarce&para;<br>items, including currency, have value in a jail’s culture&para;<br>and underground economy. Correctional officials inform&para;<br>us “[t]he competition . . . for such goods begets violence,&para;<br>extortion, and disorder.” New Jersey Wardens Brief 2.&para;<br>Gangs exacerbate the problem. They “orchestrate thefts,&para;<br>commit assaults, and approach inmates in packs to take&para;<br>the contraband from the weak.” Id., at 9–10. This puts&para;<br>the entire facility, including detainees being held for a&para;<br>brief term for a minor offense, at risk. Gangs do coerce&para;<br>inmates who have access to the outside world, such as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

B1 (“Weekend-only jail sentences are a common punishment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . .”).&para;<br>These inmates, who might be thought to pose the least&para;<br>risk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into&para;<br>jail. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10. Concealing contraband often takes little time and effort. It might be done&para;<br>as an officer approaches a suspect’s car or during a brief&para;<br>commotion in a group holding cell. Something small&para;<br>might be tucked or taped under an armpit, behind an ear,&para;<br>between the buttocks, in the instep of a foot, or inside the&para;<br>mouth or some other body cavity.&para;<br>It is not surprising that correctional officials have&para;<br>sought to perform thorough searches at intake for disease,&para;<br>gang affiliation, and contraband. Jails are often crowded,&para;<br>unsanitary, and dangerous places. There is a substantial&para;<br>interest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own&para;<br>will or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or&para;<br>work at these institutions at even greater risk when he is&para;<br>admitted to the general population.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner acknowledges that correctional officials must&para;<br>be allowed to conduct an effective search during the intake&para;<br>process and that this will require at least some detainees&para;<br>to lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position.&para;<br>These procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are&para;<br>designed to uncover contraband that can go undetected by&para;<br>a patdown, metal detector, and other less invasive&para;<br>searches. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23&para;<br>(hereinafter United States Brief); New Jersey Wardens&para;<br>Brief 19, n. 6. Petitioner maintains there is little benefit&para;<br>to conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee&para;<br>who has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v.

In his view these detainees should be exempt from this process unless they&para;<br>give officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding&para;<br>contraband. It is reasonable, however, for correctional&para;<br>officials to conclude this standard would be unworkable.&para;<br>The record provides evidence that the seriousness of an&para;<br>offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband and&para;<br>that it would be difficult in practice to determine whether&para;<br>individual detainees fall within the proposed exemption.&para;<br>1&para;<br>People detained for minor offenses can turn out to be&para;<br>the most devious and dangerous criminals.

Others may make a quick decision to hide&para;<br>unlawful substances to avoid getting in more trouble at&para;<br>the time of their arrest. This record has concrete examples. Officers at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility,&para;<br>for example, discovered that a man arrested for driving&para;<br>under the influence had “2 dime bags of weed, 1 pack of&para;<br>rolling papers, 20 matches, and 5 sleeping pills” taped&para;<br>under his scrotum. Brief for Atlantic County et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). A&para;<br>person booked on a misdemeanor charge of disorderly&para;<br>conduct in Washington State managed to hide a lighter,&para;<br>tobacco, tattoo needles, and other prohibited items in his&para;<br>rectal cavity. See United States Brief 25, n. 15. San&para;<br>Francisco officials have discovered contraband hidden in&para;<br>body cavities of people arrested for trespassing, public&para;<br>nuisance, and shoplifting. San Francisco Brief 3. There&para;<br>have been similar incidents at jails throughout the country. See United States Brief 25, n. 15.&para;<br>Even if people arrested for a minor offense do not themselves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may&para;<br>be coerced into doing so by others. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 16; cf. Block, 468 U. S., at 587 (“It is not unreasonable to assume, for instance, that low security risk&para;<br>detainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or&para;<br>weapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact&para;<br>visits”). This could happen any time detainees are held in&para;<br>the same area, including in a van on the way to the station&para;<br>or in the holding cell of the jail. If, for example, a person&para;<br>arrested and detained for unpaid traffic citations is not&para;<br>subject to the same search as others, this will be well&para;<br>known to other detainees with jail experience. A hardened&para;<br>criminal or gang member can, in just a few minutes, approach the person and coerce him into hiding the fruits of&para;<br>a crime, a weapon, or some other contraband. As an expert in this case explained, “the interaction and mingling&para;<br>between misdemeanants and felons will only increase the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>amount of contraband in the facility if the jail can only&para;<br>conduct admission searches on felons.” App. 381a. Exempting people arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and&para;<br>result in more contraband being brought into the detention facility. This is a substantial reason not to mandate&para;<br>the exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional&para;<br>law.&para;<br>2&para;<br>It also may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify&para;<br>inmates by their current and prior offenses before the&para;<br>intake search. Jails can be even more dangerous than&para;<br>prisons because officials there know so little about the&para;<br>people they admit at the outset. See New Jersey Wardens&para;<br>Brief 11–14. An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie&para;<br>about his identity. The officers who conduct an initial&para;<br>search often do not have access to criminal history records.&para;<br>See, e.g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13. And&para;<br>those records can be inaccurate or incomplete. See Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of&para;<br>Press, 489 U. S. 749, 752 (1989). Petitioner’s rap sheet is&para;<br>an example. It did not reflect his previous arrest for possession of a deadly weapon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–19. In&para;<br>the absence of reliable information it would be illogical to&para;<br>require officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do&para;<br>not pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.&para;<br>The laborious administration of prisons would become&para;<br>less effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were&para;<br>the practical problems inevitable from the rules suggested&para;<br>by petitioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate.&para;<br>Even if they had accurate information about a detainee’s&para;<br>current and prior arrests, officers, under petitioner’s proposed regime, would encounter serious implementation&para;<br>difficulties. They would be required, in a few minutes, to&para;<br>determine whether any of the underlying offenses were&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>serious enough to authorize the more invasive search&para;<br>protocol. Other possible classifications based on characteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be&para;<br>unworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory&para;<br>application. Most officers would not be well equipped to&para;<br>make any of these legal determinations during the pressures of the intake process. Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 985–987&para;<br>(Kozinski, C. J., concurring); see also Welsh v. Wisconsin,&para;<br>466 U. S. 740, 761–762 (1984) (White, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(“[T]he Court’s approach will necessitate a case-by-case&para;<br>evaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes, a difficult task for which officers and courts are poorly&para;<br>equipped”). To avoid liability, officers might be inclined&para;<br>not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus&para;<br>creating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.&para;<br>Cf. Atwater, 532 U. S., at 351, and n. 22.&para;<br>The Court addressed an analogous problem in Atwater.&para;<br>The petitioner in that case argued the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>prohibited a warrantless arrest when being convicted of&para;<br>the suspected crime “could not ultimately carry any jail&para;<br>time” and there was “no compelling need for immediate&para;<br>detention.” Id., at 346. That rule “promise[d] very little in&para;<br>the way of administrability.” Id., at 350. Officers could&para;<br>not be expected to draw the proposed lines on a moment’s&para;<br>notice, and the risk of violating the Constitution would&para;<br>have discouraged them from arresting criminals in any&para;<br>questionable circumstances. Id., at 350–351 (“An officer&para;<br>not quite sure the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail&para;<br>time or not quite certain about a suspect’s risk of flight&para;<br>would not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn&para;<br>out that, in fact, the offense called for incarceration and&para;<br>the defendant was long gone on the day of trial”). The&para;<br>Fourth Amendment did not compel this result in Atwater.&para;<br>The Court held that officers who have probable cause to&para;<br>believe even a minor criminal offense has been committed&para;<br>in their presence may arrest the offender. See id., at 354.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v.

Officers who interact with those suspected of violating the law have an “essential interest in&para;<br>readily administrable rules.” Id., at 347; accord, New York&para;<br>v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981). The officials in charge&para;<br>of the jails in this case urge the Court to reject any complicated constitutional scheme requiring them to conduct less&para;<br>thorough inspections of some detainees based on their&para;<br>behavior, suspected offense, criminal history, and other&para;<br>factors. They offer significant reasons why the Constitution must not prevent them from conducting the same&para;<br>search on any suspected offender who will be admitted to&para;<br>the general population in their facilities. The restrictions&para;<br>suggested by petitioner would limit the intrusion on the&para;<br>privacy of some detainees but at the risk of increased&para;<br>danger to everyone in the facility, including the less serious offenders themselves.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>This case does not require the Court to rule on the types&para;<br>of searches that would be reasonable in instances where,&para;<br>for example, a detainee will be held without assignment to&para;<br>the general jail population and without substantial contact&para;<br>with other detainees. This describes the circumstances in&para;<br>Atwater. See 532 U. S., at 324 (“Officers took Atwater’s&para;<br>‘mug shot’ and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one&para;<br>hour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and&para;<br>released on $310 bond”). The accommodations provided in&para;<br>these situations may diminish the need to conduct some&para;<br>aspects of the searches at issue. Cf.

But as the Court&para;<br>explains, corrections officers are often in a very poor position to make such a determination, and the threat to the&para;<br>health and safety of detainees and staff, should the officers miscalculate, is simply too great.&para;<br>It is important to note, however, that the Court does not&para;<br>hold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip&para;<br>search of an arrestee whose detention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in available facilities apart from the general population. Most of&para;<br>those arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and&para;<br>most are released from custody prior to or at the time of&para;<br>their initial appearance before a magistrate.

This question&para;<br>is phrased more broadly than what is at issue. The&para;<br>case is limited to strip searches of those arrestees&para;<br>entering a jail’s general population, see 621 F. 3d 296,&para;<br>298 (CA3 2010). And the kind of strip search in question involves more than undressing and taking a&para;<br>shower (even if guards monitor the shower area for&para;<br>threatened disorder). Rather, the searches here involve close observation of the private areas of a person’s body and for that reason constitute a far more&para;<br>serious invasion of that person’s privacy.&para;<br>The visually invasive kind of strip search at issue&para;<br>here is not unique. A similar practice is well described&para;<br>in Dodge v. County of Orange, 282 F. Supp. 2d 41&para;<br>(SDNY 2003). In that New York case, the “strip&para;<br>search” (as described in a relevant prison manual)&para;<br>involved:&para;<br>“ ‘a visual inspection of the inmate’s naked body.

For females, the procedures are similar except females must in addition, squat to expose the&para;<br>vagina.’ ” Id., at 46.&para;<br>Because the Dodge court obtained considerable empirical&para;<br>information about the need for such a search in respect&para;<br>to minor offenders, and because the searches alleged in&para;<br>this case do not differ significantly, I shall use the succinct&para;<br>Dodge description as a template for the kind of strip&para;<br>search to which the Question Presented refers. See, e.g.,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a–4a (alleging that officers inspected his genitals from an arm’s length away, required&para;<br>him to lift his genitals, and examined his anal cavity).&para;<br>In my view, such a search of an individual arrested for a&para;<br>minor offense that does not involve drugs or violence—say&para;<br>a traffic offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil&para;<br>matter, or any other such misdemeanor—is an “unreasonable searc[h]” forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless&para;<br>prison authorities have reasonable suspicion to believe&para;<br>that the individual possesses drugs or other contraband.&para;<br>And I dissent from the Court’s contrary determination.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Those confined in prison retain basic constitutional&para;<br>rights. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979); Turner&para;<br>v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987) (“Prison walls do not&para;<br>form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution”). The constitutional right at&para;<br>issue here is the Fourth Amendment right to be free of&para;<br>“unreasonable searches and seizures.” And, as the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>notes, the applicable standard is the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>balancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates in&para;<br>Bell v. Wolfish, supra. The Court said:&para;<br>“The test of reasonableness under the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against&para;<br>the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.&para;<br>Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is&para;<br>conducted.” Id., at 559.&para;<br>I have described in general terms, see supra, at 1–2, the&para;<br>place, scope and manner of “the particular intrusion.”&para;<br>Bell, 441 U. S., at 559. I now explain why I believe that&para;<br>the “invasion of personal rights” here is very serious and&para;<br>lacks need or justification, ibid.—at least as to the category of minor offenders at issue.&para;<br>II&para;<br>A strip search that involves a stranger peering without&para;<br>consent at a naked individual, and in particular at the&para;<br>most private portions of that person’s body, is a serious invasion of privacy. We have recently said, in respect to a&para;<br>schoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the “meaning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may&para;<br>reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category&para;<br>of its own demanding its own specific suspicions.” Safford&para;<br>Unified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 11). The Courts of Appeals have more&para;<br>directly described the privacy interests at stake, writing,&para;<br>for example, that practices similar to those at issue here&para;<br>are “demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,&para;<br>terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, [and] repulsive,&para;<br>signifying degradation and submission.” Mary Beth G. v.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v.

Snow, 771&para;<br>F. 2d 556, 564 (CA1 1985) (“ ‘[A]ll courts’ ” have recognized&para;<br>the “ ‘ severe if not gross interference with a person’s privacy’ ” that accompany visual body cavity searches (quoting&para;<br>Arruda v. Fair, 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))). These&para;<br>kinds of searches also gave this Court the “most pause” in&para;<br>Bell, supra, at 558 (guards strip searched prisoners after&para;<br>they received outside visits). Even when carried out in a&para;<br>respectful manner, and even absent any physical touching,&para;<br>see ante at 4–5, 19, such searches are inherently harmful,&para;<br>humiliating, and degrading. And the harm to privacy&para;<br>interests would seem particularly acute where the person&para;<br>searched may well have no expectation of being subject&para;<br>to such a search, say, because she had simply received a&para;<br>traffic ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he&para;<br>had not previously paid a civil fine, or because she had&para;<br>been arrested for a minor trespass.&para;<br>In Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 323–324 (2001),&para;<br>for example, police arrested a mother driving with her two&para;<br>children because their seat belts were not buckled. This&para;<br>Court held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest&para;<br>for a minor seatbelt offense. Id., at 323. But, in doing so,&para;<br>it pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour&para;<br>(before being taken to a magistrate and released on bond)&para;<br>and that the search—she had to remove her shoes, jewelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355—was not&para;<br>“ ‘unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical interests.’ ” Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517&para;<br>U. S. 806, 818 (1996)). Would this Court have upheld the&para;<br>arrest had the magistrate not been immediately available,&para;<br>had the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had&para;<br>they subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here?&para;<br>Cf. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56&para;<br>(1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest).&para;<br>The petitioner, Albert W.

BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF &para;<br>&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>general population”).&para;<br>I need not go on. I doubt that we seriously disagree&para;<br>about the nature of the strip search or about the serious&para;<br>affront to human dignity and to individual privacy that it&para;<br>presents. The basic question before us is whether such&para;<br>a search is nonetheless justified when an individual arrested for a minor offense is involuntarily placed in the&para;<br>general jail or prison population.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The majority, like the respondents, argues that strip&para;<br>searches are needed (1) to detect injuries or diseases, such&para;<br>as lice, that might spread in confinement, (2) to identify&para;<br>gang tattoos, which might reflect a need for special housing to avoid violence, and (3) to detect contraband, including drugs, guns, knives, and even pens or chewing gum,&para;<br>which might prove harmful or dangerous in prison. In&para;<br>evaluating this argument, I, like the majority, recognize:&para;<br>that managing a jail or prison is an “inordinately difficult&para;<br>undertaking,” Turner, 482 U. S., at 85; that prison regulations that interfere with important constitutional interests&para;<br>are generally valid as long as they are “reasonably related&para;<br>to legitimate penological interests,” id., at 89; that finding&para;<br>injuries and preventing the spread of disease, minimizing&para;<br>the threat of gang violence, and detecting contraband are&para;<br>“legitimate penological interests,” ibid.; and that we normally defer to the expertise of jail and prison administrators in such matters, id., at 85.&para;<br>Nonetheless, the “particular” invasion of interests, Bell,&para;<br>441 U. S., at 559, must be “ ‘reasonably related’ ” to the justifying “penological interest” and the need must not be&para;<br>“ ‘exaggerated.’ ” Turner, supra, at 87. It is at this point&para;<br>that I must part company with the majority. I have found&para;<br>no convincing reason indicating that, in the absence of&para;<br>reasonable suspicion, involuntary strip searches of those&para;<br>arrested for minor offenses are necessary in order to fur-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ther the penal interests mentioned. And there are strong&para;<br>reasons to believe they are not justified.&para;<br>The lack of justification is fairly obvious with respect to&para;<br>the first two penological interests advanced. The searches&para;<br>already employed at Essex and Burlington include: (a)&para;<br>pat-frisking all inmates; (b) making inmates go through&para;<br>metal detectors (including the Body Orifice Screening&para;<br>System (BOSS) chair used at Essex County Correctional&para;<br>Facility that identifies metal hidden within the body); (c)&para;<br>making inmates shower and use particular delousing&para;<br>agents or bathing supplies; and (d) searching inmates’&para;<br>clothing. In addition, petitioner concedes that detainees&para;<br>could be lawfully subject to being viewed in their undergarments by jail officers or during showering (for security&para;<br>purposes). Brief for Petitioner 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7–8&para;<br>(“Showering in the presence of officers is not something&para;<br>that requires reasonable suspicion”). No one here has&para;<br>offered any reason, example, or empirical evidence suggesting the inadequacy of such practices for detecting&para;<br>injuries, diseases, or tattoos. In particular, there is no&para;<br>connection between the genital lift and the “squat and&para;<br>cough” that Florence was allegedly subjected to and health&para;<br>or gang concerns. See Brief for Academics on Gang Behavior as Amici Curiae; Brief for Medical Society of New&para;<br>Jersey et al. as Amici Curiae.&para;<br>The lack of justification for such a strip search is less&para;<br>obvious but no less real in respect to the third interest,&para;<br>namely that of detecting contraband. The information&para;<br>demonstrating the lack of justification is of three kinds.&para;<br>First, there are empirically based conclusions reached in&para;<br>specific cases. The New York Federal District Court, to&para;<br>which I have referred, conducted a study of 23,000 persons&para;<br>admitted to the Orange County correctional facility between 1999 and 2003. Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69.&para;<br>These 23,000 persons underwent a strip search of the kind&para;<br>described, supra, at 1. Of these 23,000 persons, the court&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF &para;<br>&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>wrote, “the County encountered three incidents of drugs&para;<br>recovered from an inmate’s anal cavity and two incidents&para;<br>of drugs falling from an inmate’s underwear during the&para;<br>course of a strip search.” 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69. The&para;<br>court added that in four of these five instances there may&para;<br>have been “reasonable suspicion” to search, leaving only&para;<br>one instance in 23,000 in which the strip search policy&para;<br>“arguably” detected additional contraband. Id., at 70. The&para;<br>study is imperfect, for search standards changed during&para;<br>the time it was conducted. Id., at 50–51. But the large&para;<br>number of inmates, the small number of “incidents,” and&para;<br>the District Court’s own conclusions make the study probative though not conclusive.&para;<br>Similarly, in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F. 3d 56, 60 (CA2&para;<br>2001), the court received data produced by the county&para;<br>jail showing that authorities conducted body-cavity strip&para;<br>searches, similar to those at issue here, of 75,000 new&para;<br>inmates over a period of five years. Brief for PlaintiffAppellee-Cross-Appellant in No. 00–7061 etc. (CA2), p. 16&para;<br>(citing to its App. 343a–493a). In 16 instances the&para;<br>searches led to the discovery of contraband. The record&para;<br>further showed that 13 of these 16 pieces of contraband&para;<br>would have been detected in a patdown or a search of shoes&para;<br>and outer-clothing. In the three instances in which contraband was found on the detainee’s body or in a body cavity,&para;<br>there was a drug or felony history that would have justified a strip search on individualized reasonable suspicion.&para;<br>Ibid.; Brief for National Police Accountability Project as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 10.&para;<br>Second, there is the plethora of recommendations of&para;<br>professional bodies, such as correctional associations, that&para;<br>have studied and thoughtfully considered the matter.

See, e.g., Mo. Stat.

Crouch, 872&para;<br>F. 2d 1248, 1255 (CA6 1989); Mary Beth G., 723 F. 2d, at&para;<br>1266, 1273; Edwards, 770 F. 2d, at 742; Hill v. Bogans,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>735 F. 2d 391, 394 (CA10 1984). But see 621 F. 3d, at 311&para;<br>(case below); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco,&para;<br>595 F. 3d 964, 975 (CA9 2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett,&para;<br>541 F. 3d 1298, 1307 (CA11 2008) (en banc). Respondents&para;<br>have not presented convincing grounds to believe that&para;<br>administration of these legal standards has increased the&para;<br>smuggling of contraband into prison.&para;<br>Indeed, neither the majority’s opinion nor the briefs set&para;<br>forth any clear example of an instance in which contraband was smuggled into the general jail population during&para;<br>intake that could not have been discovered if the jail was&para;<br>employing a reasonable suspicion standard. The majority&para;<br>does cite general examples from Atlantic County and&para;<br>Washington State where contraband has been recovered&para;<br>in correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving&para;<br>under the influence and disorderly conduct. Ante, at 15.&para;<br>Similarly, the majority refers to information, provided by&para;<br>San Francisco jail authorities, stating that they have&para;<br>found handcuff keys, syringes, crack pipes, drugs, and&para;<br>knives during body-cavity searches, including during&para;<br>searches of minor offenders, including a man arrested for&para;<br>illegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prostitution and public nuisance (“bindles of crack cocaine”).&para;<br>Brief for City and County of San Francisco et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 7–13; Bull, supra, at 969; ante, at 15. And associated statistics indicate that the policy of conducting visual&para;<br>cavity searches of all those admitted to the general population in San Francisco may account for the discovery of&para;<br>contraband in approximately 15 instances per year. Bull,&para;<br>supra, at 969.&para;<br>But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us&para;<br>whether reasonable suspicion was present or absent in any&para;<br>of the 15 instances. Nor is there any showing by the&para;<br>majority that the few unclear examples of contraband&para;<br>recovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or anywhere else could not have been discovered through a policy&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that required reasonable suspicion for strip searches. And&para;<br>without some such indication, I am left without an example of any instance in which contraband was found on an&para;<br>individual through an inspection of their private parts or&para;<br>body cavities which could not have been found under a&para;<br>policy requiring reasonable suspicion. Hence, at a minimum these examples, including San Francisco’s statistics,&para;<br>do not provide a significant counterweight to those presented in Dodge and Shain.&para;<br>Nor do I find the majority’s lack of examples surprising.&para;<br>After all, those arrested for minor offenses are often&para;<br>stopped and arrested unexpectedly. And they consequently will have had little opportunity to hide things in&para;<br>their body cavities. Thus, the widespread advocacy by&para;<br>prison experts and the widespread application in many&para;<br>States and federal circuits of “reasonable suspicion” requirements indicates an ability to apply such standards in&para;<br>practice without unduly interfering with the legitimate penal&para;<br>interest in preventing the smuggling of contraband.&para;<br>The majority is left with the word of prison officials in&para;<br>support of its contrary proposition. And though that word&para;<br>is important, it cannot be sufficient. Cf. Dept. of Justice,&para;<br>National Institute of Corrections, W. Collins, Jails and the&para;<br>Constitution: An Overview 28–29 (2d ed. 2007) (Though&para;<br>prison officials often “passionately believed” similar requirements would lead to contraband-related security&para;<br>problems, once those requirements were imposed those&para;<br>“problems did not develop”).&para;<br>The majority also relies upon Bell, 441 U. S. 520, itself.&para;<br>Ante, at 5–6. In that case, the Court considered a prison&para;<br>policy requiring a strip search of all detainees after “contact visits” with unimprisoned visitors. 441 U. S., at 558.&para;<br>The Court found that policy justified. Id., at 560. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, that case does not provide precedent for the proposition that the word of prison&para;<br>officials (accompanied by a “single instance” of empirical&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>example) is sufficient to support a strip search policy.&para;<br>Ante, at 6. The majority correctly points out that there&para;<br>was but “one instance” in which the policy had led to the&para;<br>discovery of an effort to smuggle contraband. Bell, 441&para;<br>U. S., at 558. But the Court understood that the prison&para;<br>had been open only four months. Id., at 526. And the&para;<br>Court was also presented with other examples where&para;<br>inmates attempted to smuggle contraband during contact&para;<br>visits. Id., at 559.&para;<br>It is true that in Bell the Court found the prison justified in conducting postcontact searches even as to pretrial detainees who had been brought before a magistrate,&para;<br>denied bail, and “committed to the detention facility only&para;<br>because no other less drastic means [could] reasonably&para;<br>assure [their] presence at trial.” 441 U. S., at 546, n. 28.&para;<br>The Court recognized that those ordered detained by a&para;<br>magistrate were often those “charged with serious crimes,&para;<br>or who have prior records.” Ibid. For that reason, those&para;<br>detainees posed at least the same security risk as convicted inmates, if not “a greater risk to jail security and&para;<br>order,” and a “greater risk of escape.” Ibid. And, of&para;<br>course, in Bell, both the inmates at issue and their visitors&para;<br>had the time to plan to smuggle contraband in that case,&para;<br>unlike those persons at issue here (imprisoned soon after&para;<br>an unexpected arrest).&para;<br>The Bell Court had no occasion to focus upon those&para;<br>arrested for minor crimes, prior to a judicial officer’s determination that they should be committed to prison. I&para;<br>share JUSTICE ALITO’s intuition that the calculus may be&para;<br>different in such cases, given that “[m]ost of those arrested&para;<br>for minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are released from custody prior to or at the time of their initial&para;<br>appearance before a magistrate.” Ante, at 2 (concurring&para;<br>opinion). As he notes, this case does not address, and&para;<br>“reserves judgment on,” whether it is always reasonable&para;<br>“to strip search an arrestee before the arrestee’s detention&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF&para;<br>COUNTY OF BURLINGTON&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>has been reviewed by a judicial officer.” Ante, at 3. In my&para;<br>view, it is highly questionable that officials would be&para;<br>justified, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world&para;<br>of the general jail population and subjecting to a strip&para;<br>search someone with no criminal background arrested for&para;<br>jaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 5.&para;<br>Indeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Federal Government and many States segregate such individuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions&para;<br>provide that such individuals be released without detention in the ordinary case. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann.&para;<br>§853.6 (West Supp. 2012).&para;<br>In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for&para;<br>the Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to&para;<br>admit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail&para;<br>population, and to subject her to the “humiliation of a strip&para;<br>search,” prior to any review by a judicial officer. Ante, at 2&para;<br>(ALITO, J., concurring).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons set forth, I cannot find justification for&para;<br>the strip search policy at issue here—a policy that would&para;<br>subject those arrested for minor offenses to serious invasions of their personal privacy. I consequently dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
