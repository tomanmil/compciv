DAVID EUGENE&para;<br>&para;<br>MATTHEWS&para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 11–845.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided June 11, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>In this habeas case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit set aside two 29-year-old murder convictions based on the flimsiest of rationales. The&para;<br>court’s decision is a textbook example of what the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)&para;<br>proscribes: “using federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to second-guess the reasonable decisions of state&para;<br>courts.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 12). We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and&para;<br>reverse.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Between 1 and 2 a.m. on the morning of June 29, 1981,&para;<br>respondent David Eugene Matthews broke into the Louisville home he had until recently shared with his estranged&para;<br>wife, Mary Marlene Matthews (Marlene). At the time,&para;<br>Matthews’ mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying&para;<br>at the home with her daughter. Matthews found Cruse in&para;<br>bed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a&para;<br>gun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before.&para;<br>Matthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went&para;<br>into the next room, where he found his wife. He had&para;<br>sexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her&para;<br>until about 6 a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her.&para;<br>Cruse would die from her wound later that day.&para;<br>Matthews was apprehended that morning at his mother’s house, where he had already begun to wash the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PARKER v. MATTHEWS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>clothes he wore during the crime. Later in the day, police&para;<br>officers found the murder weapon secreted below the&para;<br>floorboards of a backyard shed on the property. At the&para;<br>police station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement&para;<br>to a police detective in which he denied responsibility for&para;<br>the murders.&para;<br>A grand jury indicted Matthews for the two murders&para;<br>and for burglary. At trial, he did not contest that he killed&para;<br>the two victims. Instead, he sought to show that he had&para;<br>acted under “extreme emotional disturbance,” which under&para;<br>Kentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would&para;<br>otherwise be murder to first-degree manslaughter. Ky.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §§507.020(1)(a), 507.030(1)(b) (West 2006).&para;<br>As support for that claim, Matthews pointed to the troubled history of his marriage with Marlene. Matthews and&para;<br>his wife had been frequently separated from one another,&para;<br>and their periods of separation were marked by extreme&para;<br>hostility. Marlene would regularly procure criminal warrants against Matthews; several weeks before the murders&para;<br>she obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of&para;<br>Marlene’s 6-year-old daughter, which had led to Matthews’ spending roughly three weeks in jail. Witnesses&para;<br>also testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews&para;<br>when they were together and would yell at him from&para;<br>across the street when they were separated; and Matthews’ mother recounted that Marlene would leave the&para;<br>couple’s young child crying in the street late at night&para;<br>outside the house where Matthews was sleeping in order&para;<br>to antagonize him.&para;<br>Matthews also introduced the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews. Dr.&para;<br>Chutkow related what Matthews had told him about the&para;<br>murders, including that Matthews had been drinking heavily and taking Valium and a stimulant drug. Dr. Chutkow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suffering from an adjustment disorder, which he described&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>as a “temporary emotional and behavioral disturbance in&para;<br>individuals who are subject to a variety of stresses,” that&para;<br>would temporarily impair a person’s judgment and cause&para;<br>symptoms such as “anxiety, nervousness, depression, even&para;<br>suicide attempts or attempts to hurt other people.” 6&para;<br>Record 558. Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that&para;<br>Matthews was acting under the influence of extreme&para;<br>emotional disturbance at the time of the murders—in&para;<br>particular, that he experienced “extreme tension, irritability, and almost a kind of fear of his late wife,” id., at 567,&para;<br>whom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated&para;<br>him.&para;<br>The jury convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was&para;<br>sentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Matthews’&para;<br>37 claims of error. Matthews v. Commonwealth, 709 S. W.&para;<br>2d 414, 417 (1985). In response to Matthews’ argument&para;<br>that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had&para;<br>acted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the&para;<br>court concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews’&para;<br>“conduct before, during and after the offense was more&para;<br>than sufficient to support the jury’s findings of capital&para;<br>murder.” Id., at 421. A claim that the prosecutor had&para;<br>committed misconduct during his closing argument was&para;<br>rejected on the merits, but without discussion.&para;<br>Following an unsuccessful state postconviction proceeding, Matthews filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus&para;<br>under 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Matthews&para;<br>contended, among other things, that the Kentucky Supreme Court had contravened clearly established federal&para;<br>law in rejecting his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of&para;<br>extreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his claim&para;<br>of prosecutorial misconduct. The District Court dismissed&para;<br>the petition, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit re-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PARKER v. MATTHEWS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>versed with instructions to grant relief.&para;<br>(2011).&para;<br>&para;<br>651 F. 3d 489&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>Under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to&para;<br>issue the writ of habeas corpus unless the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an&para;<br>unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal&para;<br>law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United&para;<br>States,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination&para;<br>of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State&para;<br>court proceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). The Sixth Circuit&para;<br>gave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was&para;<br>entitled to relief under this “difficult to meet . . . and&para;<br>highly deferential standard,” Cullen v. Pinholster, 563&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Neither is valid.&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, the Sixth Circuit held that the Kentucky Supreme&para;<br>Court had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden&para;<br>of proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the&para;<br>Commonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme&para;<br>emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt. The&para;<br>Sixth Circuit reasoned that, at the time Matthews committed his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on&para;<br>extreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth,&para;<br>607 S. W. 2d 97, 108 (1980), which placed the burden of&para;<br>producing evidence on the defendant, but left the burden of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturbance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the&para;<br>defendant had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a&para;<br>reasonable doubt on the issue. According to the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit, however, the Kentucky Supreme Court departed&para;<br>from that understanding in Matthews’ case and placed the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance “entirely&para;<br>on the defendant,” 651 F. 3d, at 500.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit’s interpretation is supported by certain aspects of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s opinion in&para;<br>Matthews’ case. For example, the state court indicated&para;<br>that Matthews had “present[ed] extensive evidence” of his&para;<br>extreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his&para;<br>sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by finding the evidence&para;<br>he had presented “far from overwhelming,” rather than by&para;<br>stating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt. Matthews, 709 S. W. 2d, at 420–421. The state court also&para;<br>observed that it had recently clarified in Wellman v. Commonwealth, 694 S. W. 2d 696 (1985), that “absence of&para;<br>extreme emotional disturbance is not an element of the&para;<br>crime of murder which the Commonwealth must affirmatively prove.” Matthews, supra, at 421. In the Sixth Circuit’s view, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s reliance on this&para;<br>Wellman formulation of extreme emotional disturbance in&para;<br>resolving Matthews’ appeal violated the Due Process&para;<br>Clause, as construed by this Court in Bouie v. City of&para;<br>Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 354 (1964), because it involved&para;<br>the retroactive application of an “ ‘unexpected and indefensible’ ” judicial revision of the Kentucky murder statute.&para;<br>The Kentucky Supreme Court’s initial assessment of&para;<br>the evidence and reliance upon Wellman would be relevant&para;<br>if they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews’&para;<br>sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. It is not clear, however,&para;<br>that they did. The Kentucky Supreme Court explained that&para;<br>“[t]he trial court’s instructions in regard to extreme emotional disturbance were adequate, and the proof supported&para;<br>the jury’s findings of intentional murder.” 709 S. W. 2d,&para;<br>at 421. Those jury instructions required the jury to find&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted&para;<br>“under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for&para;<br>which there was a reasonable justification or excuse under&para;<br>the circumstances as he believed them to be.” 6 Record&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PARKER v. MATTHEWS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>625, 628–629. The case had been submitted to the jury&para;<br>with the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury&para;<br>had found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Supreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that&para;<br>finding. That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews’&para;<br>claim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a&para;<br>ground of questionable validity. See Wetzel v. Lambert,&para;<br>565 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at&para;<br>4–5).1&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit’s opinion also challenges the conclusion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme&para;<br>emotional disturbance. We have said that “it is the&para;<br>responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 An ambiguously worded footnote in the Sixth Circuit’s opinion, see&para;<br>651 F. 3d 489, 504, n. 5 (2011), suggests that the court may have found&para;<br>an additional due process violation. The court referred to a statement&para;<br>in the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth&para;<br>607 S. W. 2d 97, 109 (1980), that “[u]nless the evidence raising the&para;<br>issue [of extreme emotional disturbance] is of such probative force that&para;<br>otherwise the defendant would be entitled as a matter of law to an&para;<br>acquittal on the higher charge (murder), the prosecution is not required&para;<br>to come forth with negating evidence in order to sustain its burden of&para;<br>proof.” Relying on its own opinion in Gall’s federal habeas proceeding,&para;<br>Gall v. Parker, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000) (Gall II), the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>suggested that the quoted statement “require[d] a defendant to bear the&para;<br>heavy burden of disproving an element of a crime beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt,” 651 F. 3d, at 504, n. 5, in violation of this Court’s decision in&para;<br>Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975). That is not so. The statement explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the&para;<br>prosecution, but merely asserts that when the burden of production is&para;<br>assigned to the defendant the jury may find the prosecution’s burden of&para;<br>proof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the&para;<br>defendant’s evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as&para;<br>a matter of law. That seems to us a truism. See 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §338, pp. 419–420 (5th ed. 1999). Our opinion in&para;<br>Mullaney addressed a situation in which the burden of persuasion was&para;<br>shifted to the defendant, see 421 U. S., at 702, and n. 31; it does not&para;<br>remotely show that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s truism contravened&para;<br>clearly established federal law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at&para;<br>trial,” Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam)&para;<br>(slip op., at 1). The evidence is sufficient to support a&para;<br>conviction whenever, “after viewing the evidence in the&para;<br>light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier&para;<br>of fact could have found the essential elements of the&para;<br>crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia,&para;<br>443 U. S. 307, 319 (1979). And a state-court decision&para;<br>rejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on&para;<br>federal habeas unless the “decision was ‘objectively unreasonable.’ ” Cavazos, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).&para;<br>In light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abundantly clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection&para;<br>of Matthews’ sufficiency claim is controlling in this federal&para;<br>habeas proceeding. The Sixth Circuit noted that Dr.&para;<br>Chutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under&para;<br>the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time&para;<br>of the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on&para;<br>cross-examination. But there was ample evidence pointing in the other direction as well. As the Kentucky&para;<br>Supreme Court observed, Matthews’ claim of extreme emotional disturbance was belied by “the circumstances of the&para;<br>crime,” 709 S. W. 2d, at 421—including the facts that he&para;<br>borrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day&para;<br>of the murders, that he waited several hours after buying&para;<br>the gun before starting for his wife’s home, and that he&para;<br>delayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law&para;<br>and killing his wife. The claim was also belied by his&para;<br>behavior after the murders, including his “[taking] steps to&para;<br>hide the gun and clean his clothes,” and later “giv[ing]&para;<br>a false statement to the police.” Ibid. The Sixth Circuit&para;<br>discounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified&para;<br>that Matthews’ deliberateness and consciousness of&para;<br>wrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of&para;<br>extreme emotional disturbance. 651 F. 3d., at 504, n. 4.&para;<br>But expert testimony does not trigger a conclusive pre-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PARKER v. MATTHEWS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable&para;<br>to conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the&para;<br>tension between Dr. Chutkow’s testimony and their own&para;<br>common-sense understanding of emotional disturbance.&para;<br>In resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow’s testimony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its&para;<br>authority. See Jackson, supra, at 326.&para;<br>More fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to&para;<br>consider the possibility that the jury could have found the&para;<br>symptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to establish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter&para;<br>under Kentucky law: that Matthews “acted under the&para;<br>influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which&para;<br>there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint&para;<br>of a person in the defendant’s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.” Ky. Rev.&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §507.020(1)(a). Dr. Chutkow himself agreed&para;<br>that many people face tension and anxiety—two symptoms&para;<br>he attributed to Matthews. 6 Record 579–580. And he&para;<br>agreed that many people suffer from adjustment disorders. Id., at 592. But of course very few people commit&para;<br>murders. In light of these points, which bear on the&para;<br>proper characterization of Matthews’ mental condition and&para;<br>the reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme&para;<br>Court made no objectively unreasonable error in concluding that the question of extreme emotional disturbance&para;<br>was properly committed to the jury for resolution.&para;<br>B&para;<br>As a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>held that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during&para;<br>his closing argument constituted a denial of due process.&para;<br>This claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky&para;<br>Supreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore&para;<br>receives deferential review under the AEDPA standard.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>See Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip&para;<br>op., at 8). The “clearly established Federal law” relevant&para;<br>here is our decision in Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.&para;<br>168 (1986), which explained that a prosecutor’s improper&para;<br>comments will be held to violate the Constitution only if&para;<br>they “ ‘so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the&para;<br>resulting conviction a denial of due process.’ ” Id., at 181&para;<br>(quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 643&para;<br>(1974)).&para;<br>According to the Sixth Circuit, the prosecutor violated&para;<br>Darden by suggesting that Matthews had colluded with&para;<br>his lawyer, David Busse, and with Dr. Chutkow to manufacture an extreme emotional disturbance defense. But&para;<br>although the Sixth Circuit quoted a lengthy section of the&para;<br>prosecutor’s closing argument which could be understood&para;<br>as raising a charge of collusion,2 the court did not address&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>full text of the section the Sixth Circuit found objectionable is as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“He’s arraigned, he meets with his attorney and either he tells his attorney, I did it or I didn’t do it. One or the other. But, the attorney&para;<br>knows what the evidence is. By the way, the defendant knows what the&para;<br>evidence is, because while he’s giving this statement, it’s sitting right in&para;<br>front of him at the Homicide Office. Here’s the gun. Here’s the shoes,&para;<br>David. ‘Nah, nah, I never saw it before. I never borrowed a gun. I&para;<br>never borrowed any money. I wasn’t there. I was at home in bed&para;<br>asleep.’ He’s denying it there.&para;<br>“And what does his attorney think? His attorney sees all this evidence, and he’s going through his mind, what kind of legal excuse can&para;<br>I have? What is this man’s defense? Self protection? No, there’s no&para;<br>proof of a gun found at that house on 310 North 24th Street. No proof&para;<br>of that. Protection of another? The defendant’s mother is at home on&para;<br>Lytle Street. He isn’t protecting her over there on North 24th Street.&para;<br>Intoxication? Yeah, well, he was drinking that night. Maybe that will&para;<br>mean something.&para;<br>“But that isn’t enough, Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr. Busse has to&para;<br>contact a psychiatrist to see his client, and he comes in and sees his&para;<br>client one month after the day of his arrest, one month to the day, and&para;<br>by that time, Mr. David Eugene Matthews sees his defense in the form&para;<br>of Doctor Chutkow, and do you think this guy is aware of what’s going&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PARKER v. MATTHEWS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the prosecutor’s statement that immediately followed the&para;<br>quoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of&para;<br>collusion:&para;<br>“And that’s not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical.&para;<br>Not at all. He is entitled to the best defense he can&para;<br>get, but that’s the only defense he has, what the doctor has to say, and that’s not to say that the doctor&para;<br>gets on the stand and perjures himself. He’s telling&para;<br>you the truth. He wouldn’t perjure himself for anything. He’s telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentlemen.” 7 Record 674.&para;<br>With the prosecutor’s immediate clarification that he was&para;<br>not alleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion that this feature of the closing argument clearly&para;<br>violated due process is unsupportable. Nor does the prosecutor’s suggestion that Matthews had “enhance[d] his&para;<br>story to Doctor Chutkow,” ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit’s grant of habeas relief. In context, that statement&para;<br>is clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews&para;<br>had a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in&para;<br>his meetings with Dr. Chutkow. Shortly after the quoted&para;<br>statement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhetorical questions:&para;<br>“Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about&para;<br>his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things&para;<br>——————&para;<br>on? He’s competent. He can work with his attorney, and he enhances&para;<br>his story to Doctor Chutkow. Yeah, I was drinking. I was drinking a&para;<br>lot. I was taking a lot of pills, too, and let me tell you about the pills I&para;<br>was taking.&para;<br>“Don’t you think he has a purpose in enhancing his story to the&para;<br>psychiatrist? Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his&para;<br>wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other&para;<br>people might be doing to his mother? Don’t you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist? It’s the defense&para;<br>of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for his conduct,&para;<br>but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 673–674.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

He has no excuse for&para;<br>his conduct, but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 674.&para;<br>But the Kentucky Supreme Court could have understood&para;<br>this comment too as having been directed at Matthews’&para;<br>motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance—i.e., as&para;<br>emphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense&para;<br>raised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional&para;<br>disturbance.&para;<br>Moreover, even if the comment is understood as directing the jury’s attention to inappropriate considerations,&para;<br>that would not establish that the Kentucky Supreme&para;<br>Court’s rejection of the Darden prosecutorial misconduct&para;<br>claim “was so lacking in justification that there was an&para;<br>error well understood and comprehended in existing law&para;<br>beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”&para;<br>Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Indeed,&para;<br>Darden itself held that a closing argument considerably&para;<br>more inflammatory than the one at issue here did not&para;<br>warrant habeas relief. See 477 U.

Particularly because the&para;<br>Darden standard is a very general one, leaving courts&para;<br>“more leeway . . . in reaching outcomes in case-by-case&para;<br>determinations,” Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PARKER v. MATTHEWS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>664 (2004)), the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to set aside&para;<br>the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit also erred by consulting its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the&para;<br>reasonableness of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision.&para;<br>After quoting the governing standard from our decision in&para;<br>Darden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would “engag[e] in&para;<br>a two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial&para;<br>misconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality. ‘To&para;<br>satisfy the standard . . . , the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 505 (quoting Broom v.&para;<br>Mitchell, 441 F. 3d 392, 412 (CA6 2006)). It went on to&para;<br>evaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four&para;<br>factors derived from its own precedent: “ ‘(1) the likelihood&para;<br>that the remarks . . . tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated&para;<br>or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or&para;<br>accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against [Matthews].’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 506 (quoting&para;<br>Broom, supra, at 412). And it stated that “the prosecutor’s&para;<br>comments in this case were sufficiently similar to” certain&para;<br>comments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in&para;<br>Gall II, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000), “that they rise to the&para;<br>level of impropriety.” 651 F. 3d, at 506.&para;<br>As we explained in correcting an identical error by the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, see Renico, 559 U.

To make matters worse, the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit decided Gall II under pre-AEDPA law, see 231&para;<br>F. 3d, at 283, n. 2, so that case did not even purport to&para;<br>reflect clearly established law as set out in this Court’s&para;<br>holdings.
