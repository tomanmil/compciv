Argued January 19, 2011—Decided March 1, 2011&para;<br>The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make re&para;<br>cords and documents publicly available upon request, subject to sev&para;<br>eral statutory exemptions. One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C),&para;<br>covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which “could rea&para;<br>sonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of per&para;<br>sonal privacy.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(C). CompTel, a trade associa&para;<br>tion, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&amp;T had provided to&para;<br>the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau dur&para;<br>ing an investigation of that company. The Bureau found that Ex&para;<br>emption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&amp;T’s submissions&para;<br>but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not&para;<br>have “personal privacy” interests as required by the exemption. The&para;<br>FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third&para;<br>Circuit did not. It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the “personal&para;<br>privacy” of corporations, reasoning that “personal” is the adjective&para;<br>form of the term “person,” which Congress has defined, as applicable&para;<br>here, to include corporations, §551(2).&para;<br>Held: Corporations do not have “personal privacy” for the purposes of&para;<br>Exemption 7(C). Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) AT&amp;T argues that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C) incor&para;<br>porates the statutory definition of “person,” which includes corpora&para;<br>tions, §551(2). But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of&para;<br>corresponding nouns. “Person” is a defined term in the statute; “per&para;<br>sonal” is not. When a statute does not define a term, the Court typi&para;<br>cally “give[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.” Johnson v. United&para;<br>States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. “Personal” ordinarily refers to individuals.&para;<br>People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FCC v. AT&amp;T INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspon&para;<br>dence of corporations. In fact, “personal” is often used to mean pre&para;<br>cisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses&para;<br>and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion&para;<br>and a company’s view. Dictionary definitions also suggest that “per&para;<br>sonal” does not ordinarily relate to artificial “persons” like corpora&para;<br>tions.&para;<br>AT&amp;T contends that its reading of “personal” is supported by the&para;<br>common legal usage of the word “person.” Yet while “person,” in a le&para;<br>gal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&amp;T’s effort to ascribe&para;<br>a corresponding legal meaning to “personal” again elides the differ&para;<br>ence between “person” and “personal.” AT&amp;T provides scant support&para;<br>for the proposition that “personal” denotes corporations, even in a le&para;<br>gal context.&para;<br>Regardless of whether “personal” can carry a legal meaning apart&para;<br>from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed “in&para;<br>light of the terms surrounding it.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9.&para;<br>Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word “personal,” but to the term&para;<br>“personal privacy.” “Personal” in that phrase conveys more than just&para;<br>“of a person”; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human con&para;<br>cerns—not the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&amp;T.&para;<br>AT&amp;T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly&para;<br>referred to a corporation’s “personal privacy.” Nor does it identify&para;<br>any other statute that does so. While AT&amp;T argues that this Court&para;<br>has recognized “privacy” interests of corporations in the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for&para;<br>the Court to pass on the scope of a corporation’s “privacy” interests as&para;<br>a matter of constitutional or common law. AT&amp;T contends that the&para;<br>FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase “personal privacy” neces&para;<br>sarily excludes corporations’ privacy. But construing statutory lan&para;<br>guage is not merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of [a&para;<br>word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.&para;<br>481, 486, and AT&amp;T has provided no sound reason in the statutory&para;<br>text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.&para;<br>Pp. 3–9.&para;<br>(b) The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is further&para;<br>clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions. Exemption 6, which&para;<br>Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers “person&para;<br>nel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would&para;<br>constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”&para;<br>§552(b)(6). This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as in&para;<br>volving an “individual’s right of privacy,” Department of State v. Ray,&para;<br>502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same&para;<br>phrase—“personal privacy”—used in Exemption 6. In contrast, FOIA&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

One of those exemptions covers law&para;<br>enforcement records, the disclosure of which “could rea&para;<br>sonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion&para;<br>of personal privacy.” 5 U.

The ques&para;<br>tion presented is whether corporations have “personal&para;<br>privacy” for the purposes of this exemption.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Freedom of Information Act request at issue in this&para;<br>case relates to an investigation of respondent AT&amp;T Inc.,&para;<br>conducted by the Federal Communications Commission.&para;<br>AT&amp;T participated in an FCC-administered program—the&para;<br>E-Rate (or Education-Rate) program—that was created to&para;<br>enhance access for schools and libraries to advanced tele&para;<br>communications and information services. In August&para;<br>2004, AT&amp;T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FCC v. AT&amp;T INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>have overcharged the Government for services it provided&para;<br>as part of the program.&para;<br>The FCC’s Enforcement Bureau launched an investiga&para;<br>tion. As part of that investigation, AT&amp;T provided the&para;<br>Bureau various documents, including responses to inter&para;<br>rogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing infor&para;<br>mation, names and job descriptions of employees involved,&para;<br>and AT&amp;T’s assessment of whether those employees had&para;<br>violated the company’s code of conduct. 582 F. 3d 490,&para;<br>492–493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&amp;T resolved the&para;<br>matter in December 2004 through a consent decree in&para;<br>which AT&amp;T—without conceding liability—agreed to pay&para;<br>the Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure&para;<br>compliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,&para;<br>24016–24019.&para;<br>Several months later, CompTel—“a trade association&para;<br>representing some of AT&amp;T’s competitors”—submitted a&para;<br>FOIA request seeking “ ‘[a]ll pleadings and correspon&para;<br>dence’ ” in the Bureau’s file on the AT&amp;T investigation.&para;<br>582 F. 3d, at 493. AT&amp;T opposed CompTel’s request, and&para;<br>the Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.&para;<br>The Bureau concluded that some of the information&para;<br>AT&amp;T had provided (including cost and pricing data,&para;<br>billing-related information, and identifying information&para;<br>about staff, contractors, and customer representatives)&para;<br>should be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemp&para;<br>tion 4, which relates to “trade secrets and commercial or&para;<br>financial information,” 5 U.

Exemp&para;<br>tion 7(C) exempts “records or information compiled for law&para;<br>enforcement purposes” that “could reasonably be expected&para;<br>to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri&para;<br>vacy.” §552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that “indi&para;<br>viduals identified in [AT&amp;T’s] submissions” have “privacy&para;<br>rights” that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Id., at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that&para;<br>exemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that “busi&para;<br>nesses do not possess ‘personal privacy’ interests as re&para;<br>quired” by the exemption. Id., at 42a–43a.&para;<br>On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Com&para;<br>mission found AT&amp;T’s position that it is “a ‘private corpo&para;<br>rate citizen’ with personal privacy rights that should be&para;<br>protected from disclosure that would ‘embarrass’ it . . .&para;<br>within the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with&para;<br>established [FCC] and judicial precedent.” 23 FCC Rcd.&para;<br>13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that “Exemp&para;<br>tion 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as&para;<br>[AT&amp;T].” Id., at 13710.&para;<br>AT&amp;T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Third Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC’s reasoning.&para;<br>Noting that Congress had defined the word “person” to&para;<br>include corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the&para;<br>“personal privacy” of corporations, since “the root from&para;<br>which the statutory word [personal] . . . is derived” is the&para;<br>defined term “person.” 582 F. 3d, at 497. As the court&para;<br>explained, “[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival&para;<br>form of a defined term not to refer back to that defined&para;<br>term.” Ibid. The court accordingly ruled “that FOIA’s text&para;<br>unambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a&para;<br>‘personal privacy’ interest within the meaning of Exemp&para;<br>tion 7(C).” Id., at 498.&para;<br>The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third&para;<br>Circuit’s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent&para;<br>supporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2010), and now reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&amp;T relies on the&para;<br>argument that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C)&para;<br>incorporates the statutory definition of the word “person.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FCC v. AT&amp;T INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>See Brief for Respondent AT&amp;T 8–9, 14–15 (AT&amp;T Brief);&para;<br>582 F. 3d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act&para;<br>defines “person” to include “an individual, partnership,&para;<br>corporation, association, or public or private organization&para;<br>other than an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §551(2). Because that&para;<br>definition applies here, the argument goes, “personal”&para;<br>must mean relating to those “person[s]”: namely, corpora&para;<br>tions and other entities as well as individuals. This read&para;<br>ing, we are told, is dictated by a “basic principle of gram&para;<br>mar and usage.” AT&amp;T Brief 8; see id., at 14–15; see also&para;<br>582 F. 3d, at 497 (citing Delaware River Stevedores v.&para;<br>DiFidelto, 440 F. 3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., con&para;<br>curring), for “[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]” that “a&para;<br>statute which defines a noun has thereby defined the&para;<br>adjectival form of that noun”). According to AT&amp;T, “[b]y&para;<br>expressly defining the noun ‘person’ to include corpora&para;<br>tions, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form&para;<br>of that noun—‘personal’—also to include corporations.”&para;<br>AT&amp;T Brief 14 (emphasis added).&para;<br>We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of&para;<br>corresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they&para;<br>acquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun “crab”&para;<br>refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while&para;<br>the related adjective “crabbed” can refer to handwriting&para;<br>that is “difficult to read,” Webster’s Third New Interna&para;<br>tional Dictionary 527 (2002); “corny” can mean “using&para;<br>familiar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to&para;<br>the unsophisticated,” id., at 509, which has little to do&para;<br>with “corn,” id., at 507 (“the seeds of any of the cereal&para;<br>grasses used for food”); and while “crank” is “a part of an&para;<br>axis bent at right angles,” “cranky” can mean “given to&para;<br>fretful fussiness,” id., at 530.&para;<br>Even in cases such as these there may well be a link&para;<br>between the noun and the adjective. “Cranky” describes a&para;<br>person with a “wayward” or “capricious” temper, see 3&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED),&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>which might bear some relation to the distorted or crooked&para;<br>angular shape from which a “crank” takes its name. That&para;<br>is not the point. What is significant is that, in ordinary&para;<br>usage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings&para;<br>as disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC’s&para;<br>argument that “personal” does not, in fact, derive from the&para;<br>English word “person,” but instead developed along its&para;<br>own etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, sim&para;<br>ply highlights the shortcomings of AT&amp;T’s proposed rule.&para;<br>“Person” is a defined term in the statute; “personal” is&para;<br>not. When a statute does not define a term, we typically&para;<br>“give the phrase its ordinary meaning.” Johnson v. United&para;<br>States, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4). “Personal”&para;<br>ordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually speak&para;<br>of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal&para;<br>correspondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as&para;<br>referring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is&para;<br>not to say that corporations do not have correspondence,&para;<br>influence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not&para;<br>use the word “personal” to describe them.&para;<br>Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation&para;<br>approached the chief financial officer and said, “I have&para;<br>something personal to tell you,” we would not assume the&para;<br>CEO was about to discuss company business. Responding&para;<br>to a request for information, an individual might say,&para;<br>“that’s personal.” A company spokesman, when asked for&para;<br>information about the company, would not. In fact, we&para;<br>often use the word “personal” to mean precisely the oppo&para;<br>site of business-related: We speak of personal expenses&para;<br>and business expenses, personal life and work life, per&para;<br>sonal opinion and a company’s view.&para;<br>Dictionaries also suggest that “personal” does not ordi&para;<br>narily relate to artificial “persons” such as corporations.&para;<br>See, e.g., 7 OED 726 (1933) (“[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the&para;<br>individual person or self,” “individual; private; one’s own,”&para;<br>“[3] [o]f or pertaining to one’s person, body, or figure,” “[5]&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FCC v. AT&amp;T INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>[o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self&para;<br>conscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction”); 11&para;<br>OED at 599–600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (“[3] relating to&para;<br>the person or body”; “[4] relating to an individual, his&para;<br>character, conduct, motives, or private affairs”; “[5] relat&para;<br>ing to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from&para;<br>things”); ibid. (2002) (same).&para;<br>AT&amp;T dismisses these definitions, correctly noting that&para;<br>“personal”—at its most basic level—simply means “[o]f or&para;<br>pertaining to a particular person.” Webster’s New Inter&para;<br>national Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company&para;<br>acknowledges that “in non-legal usage, where a ‘person’ is&para;<br>a human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word&para;<br>‘personal’ is used to refer to human beings.” AT&amp;T Brief&para;<br>8. But in a watered-down version of the “grammatical&para;<br>imperative” argument, AT&amp;T contends that “person”—in&para;<br>common legal usage—is understood to include a corpora&para;<br>tion. “Personal” in the same context therefore can and&para;<br>should have the same scope, especially here in light of the&para;<br>statutory definition. See id., at 8–9, 16.&para;<br>The construction of statutory language often turns on&para;<br>context, see, e.g., Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5),&para;<br>which certainly may include the definitions of related&para;<br>words. But here the context to which AT&amp;T points does&para;<br>not dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of “personal.”&para;<br>We have no doubt that “person,” in a legal setting, often&para;<br>refers to artificial entities. The Dictionary Act makes that&para;<br>clear. 1 U. S. C. §1 (defining “person” to include “corpora&para;<br>tions, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, socie&para;<br>ties, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals”).&para;<br>But AT&amp;T’s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal mean&para;<br>ing to “personal” again elides the difference between “per&para;<br>son” and “personal.”&para;<br>When it comes to the word “personal,” there is little&para;<br>support for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

AT&amp;T notes that corporations are “pro&para;<br>tected by the doctrine of ‘personal’ jurisdiction,” AT&amp;T&para;<br>Brief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction in per&para;<br>sonam, as opposed to in rem, not the jurisdiction “of a&para;<br>person.” The only other example AT&amp;T cites is an 1896&para;<br>case that referred to the “ ‘personal privilege’ ” of a corpora&para;<br>tion. Ibid. (quoting Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee ex rel.&para;<br>Memphis, 161 U. S. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)).&para;<br>These examples fall far short of establishing that “per&para;<br>sonal” here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary&para;<br>one, even if “person” does. Cf. Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds,&para;<br>559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 8–10) (noting&para;<br>that “ ‘discovery’ is often used as a term of art in connec&para;<br>tion with the ‘discovery rule’ ” and describing the judicial&para;<br>and legislative codification of that meaning over time);&para;<br>Molzof v.

AT&amp;T’s effort to attribute a&para;<br>special legal meaning to the word “personal” in this par&para;<br>ticular context is wholly unpersuasive.&para;<br>AT&amp;T’s argument treats the term “personal privacy” as&para;<br>simply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.&para;<br>Under that view, the defined meaning of the noun “per&para;<br>son,” or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FCC v.

A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who&para;<br>is charming, lucky, and talented. A golden opportunity is&para;<br>one not to be missed. “Personal” in the phrase “personal&para;<br>privacy” conveys more than just “of a person.” It suggests&para;<br>a type of privacy evocative of human concerns—not the&para;<br>sort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&amp;T.&para;<br>Despite its contention that “[c]ommon legal usage” of the&para;<br>word “person” supports its reading of the term “personal&para;<br>privacy,” AT&amp;T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&amp;T does not cite a&para;<br>single instance in which this Court or any other (aside&para;<br>from the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to&para;<br>a corporation’s “personal privacy.” Nor does it identify any&para;<br>other statute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the&para;<br>contrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress&para;<br>drafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding&para;<br>that the specific concept of “personal privacy,” at least as a&para;<br>matter of common law, did not apply to corporations.

But construing statutory language is&para;<br>not merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of&para;<br>[a word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Ser&para;<br>vice, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006). AT&amp;T has given us no&para;<br>sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard&para;<br>the ordinary meaning of the phrase “personal privacy.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is&para;<br>further clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress en&para;<br>acted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing&para;<br>FOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemp&para;<br>tion 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this&para;<br>context. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip&para;<br>op., at 6) (“statutory interpretation turns on ‘the language&para;<br>itself, the specific context in which that language is used,&para;<br>and the broader context of the statute as a whole’ ” (quot&para;<br>ing Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997))).&para;<br>Two of those other exemptions are particularly relevant&para;<br>here.&para;<br>The phrase “personal privacy” first appeared in the&para;<br>FOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight&para;<br>years before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80&para;<br>Stat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(6).&para;<br>Exemption 6 covers “personnel and medical files and&para;<br>similar files the disclosure of which would constitute&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FCC v. AT&amp;T INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”&para;<br>§552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in&para;<br>drafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly&para;<br>identical manner.&para;<br>Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited&para;<br>to individuals has not come to us directly, we have regu&para;<br>larly referred to that exemption as involving an “individ&para;<br>ual’s right of privacy.” Department of State v. Ray, 502&para;<br>U. S. 164, 175 (1991) (quoting Department of Air Force v.&para;<br>Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)); see also Department of State v. Washington Post&para;<br>Co., 456 U. S. 595, 599 (1982).&para;<br>AT&amp;T does not dispute that “identical words and&para;<br>phrases within the same statute should normally be given&para;<br>the same meaning,” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy&para;<br>Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), but contends that&para;<br>“if Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because&para;<br>[it] applies only to ‘personnel and medical files and similar&para;<br>files,’ ” not because of the term “personal privacy.” AT&amp;T&para;<br>Brief 36 (quoting §552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the&para;<br>pertinent phrase—“the disclosure of which would consti&para;<br>tute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,”&para;<br>§552(b)(6)—cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it,&para;<br>Exemption 6 would categorically exempt “personnel and&para;<br>medical files” as well as any “similar” file. Even if the&para;<br>scope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it&para;<br>protects, the “personal privacy” phrase importantly de&para;<br>fines the particular subset of that information Congress&para;<br>sought to exempt. See Washington Post Co., supra, at 599.&para;<br>And because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption&para;<br>7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent&para;<br>in construing Exemption 7(C).&para;<br>In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the&para;<br>other hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.&para;<br>Exemption 4 pertains to “trade secrets and commercial or&para;<br>financial information obtained from a person and privi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>leged or confidential.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). This clearly&para;<br>applies to corporations—it uses the defined term “person”&para;<br>to describe the source of the information—and we far more&para;<br>readily think of corporations as having “privileged or&para;<br>confidential” documents than personally private ones. So&para;<br>at the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in&para;<br>place an exemption that plainly covered a corporation’s&para;<br>commercial and financial information, and another that&para;<br>we have described as relating to “individuals.” The lan&para;<br>guage of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.&para;<br>The Government has long interpreted the phrase “per&para;<br>sonal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly&para;<br>after Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted&para;<br>Exemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memoran&para;<br>dum to executive departments and agencies explaining&para;<br>that “personal privacy” in that exemption “pertains to the&para;<br>privacy interests of individuals.” U. S. Dept. of Justice,&para;<br>Attorney General’s Memorandum on the 1974 Amend&para;<br>ments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in&para;<br>House Committee on Government Operations and Senate&para;<br>Committee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act&para;<br>and Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93–502), 94th Cong., 1st&para;<br>Sess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The exemption,&para;<br>the Attorney General noted, “does not seem applicable to&para;<br>corporations or other entities.” Ibid. We have previously&para;<br>viewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpret&para;<br>ing FOIA, see National Archives and Records Admin. v.&para;<br>Favish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); FBI v. Abramson, 456&para;<br>U. S. 615, 622, n. 5 (1982), and we agree with its conclu&para;<br>sion here.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>We reject the argument that because “person” is defined&para;<br>for purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase&para;<br>“personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations&para;<br>as well.
