Claiming&para;<br>to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on federal land, re&para;<br>spondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve, filed this suit al&para;<br>leging a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause&para;<br>and seeking an injunction requiring the Government to remove the&para;<br>cross. In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I), the District Court&para;<br>found that Buono had standing to sue and, concluding that the pres&para;<br>ence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern&para;<br>mental endorsement of religion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S.&para;<br>602, 612–613, it granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 in&para;<br>junction). The District Court did not consider whether the Govern&para;<br>ment’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused&para;<br>entanglement with religion. While the Government’s appeal was&para;<br>pending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations&para;<br>Act, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior to&para;<br>transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in ex&para;<br>change for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve (land&para;<br>transfer statute). Affirming the District Court’s judgment both as to&para;<br>standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined to address the&para;<br>statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s constitutionality&para;<br>(Buono II). Because the Government did not seek review by this&para;<br>Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final. Buono then re&para;<br>turned to the District Court seeking injunctive relief against the land&para;<br>transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 in&para;<br>junction. In 2005, that court rejected the Government’s claim that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction,&para;<br>concluding, instead, that it was actually an invalid attempt to keep&para;<br>the cross on display. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the&para;<br>2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and perma&para;<br>nently enjoined the Government from implementing the land&para;<br>transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit again affirmed,&para;<br>largely following the District Court’s reasoning.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined in full by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and in part&para;<br>by JUSTICE ALITO, concluded:&para;<br>1. Buono has standing to maintain this action. Whatever the valid&para;<br>ity of the Government’s argument that Buono’s asserted injury—&para;<br>offense at a religious symbol’s presence on federal land—is not per&para;<br>sonal to him and so does not confer Article III standing, that argu&para;<br>ment is not available at this stage of the litigation. The District&para;<br>Court rejected the argument in Buono I, the Ninth Circuit affirmed&para;<br>in Buono II, and the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final and&para;<br>unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a&para;<br>certiorari petition, 28 U. S. C. §2101(c). Moreover, Buono had stand&para;<br>ing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against the&para;<br>land-transfer statute. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor&para;<br>acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance&para;<br>with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737. Buono’s en&para;<br>titlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II,&para;<br>he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or&para;<br>evading that injunction. His interests in doing so were sufficiently&para;<br>personal and concrete to support his standing, given the rights he ob&para;<br>tained under the earlier decree against the same party as to the same&para;<br>cross and the same land. The Government’s contention that Buono&para;<br>sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction is not an&para;<br>argument about standing, but about the merits of the District Court’s&para;<br>order. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>2. The District Court erred in enjoining the Government from im&para;<br>plementing the land-transfer statute on the premise that the relief&para;<br>was necessary to protect Buono’s rights under the 2002 injunction.&para;<br>Pp. 9–18.&para;<br>(a) A court may order an injunction only after taking into account&para;<br>all the circumstances bearing on the need for prospective relief. See,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Swift &amp; Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114. Here, the Dis&para;<br>trict Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry. The land&para;<br>transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing&para;<br>on the propriety of the requested relief. By dismissing as illicit the&para;<br>motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court took insufficient&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>account of the context in which the statute was enacted and the rea&para;<br>sons for its passage. Placement of the cross on federal land by pri&para;<br>vate persons was not an attempt to set the state’s imprimatur on a&para;<br>particular creed. Rather, the intent was simply to honor fallen sol&para;<br>diers. Moreover, the cross stood for nearly seven decades before the&para;<br>statute was enacted, by which time the cross and the cause it com&para;<br>memorated had become entwined in the public consciousness. The&para;<br>2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma. It&para;<br>could not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it&para;<br>could not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the&para;<br>cross was seen as honoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfac&para;<br>tory, Congress enacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embod&para;<br>ied a legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a&para;<br>framework and policy of accommodation. The statute should not&para;<br>have been dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of&para;<br>law and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.&para;<br>Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>(b) Where legislative action undermines the basis for previous re&para;<br>lief, the relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the&para;<br>court’s equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of ille&para;<br>gality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances render&para;<br>prospective relief inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002&para;<br>injunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the cross&para;<br>on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement&para;<br>of religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds. Nei&para;<br>ther court considered whether the Government had acted based on an&para;<br>improper purpose. Given this sole reliance on perception, any further&para;<br>relief grounded on the injunction should have rested on the same ba&para;<br>sis. But the District Court used an injunction granted for one reason&para;<br>(perceived governmental endorsement) as the basis for enjoining con&para;<br>duct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason (an il&para;<br>licit governmental purpose). Ordering relief under such circum&para;<br>stances was improper. The court failed to consider whether the&para;<br>change in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute&para;<br>had rendered the “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to re&para;<br>solve the dispute. Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono I’s&para;<br>findings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.&para;<br>Rather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, di&para;<br>vorced from its background and context. Pp. 13–17.&para;<br>(c) The same respect for a coordinate branch of Government that&para;<br>forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing&para;<br>of unconstitutionality, see, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S.&para;<br>598, 607, requires that a congressional command be given effect&para;<br>unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congres&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient ac&para;<br>commodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was in&para;<br>cumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than&para;<br>complete invalidation of the statute. See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Par&para;<br>enthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329. On remand, that&para;<br>court should conduct a proper inquiry into the continued necessity for&para;<br>injunctive relief in light of the statute. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO concluded that this case should not be remanded for&para;<br>the lower courts to decide whether implementation of the land&para;<br>transfer statute would violate the District Court’s injunction or the&para;<br>Establishment Clause. Rather, because the factual record has been&para;<br>sufficiently developed to permit resolution of these questions, he&para;<br>would decide them and hold that the statute may be implemented.&para;<br>The case’s singular circumstances presented Congress with a delicate&para;<br>problem. Its solution was an approach designed to eliminate any&para;<br>perception of religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the&para;<br>cross on federally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbol&para;<br>ism that some would associate with the destruction of this historic&para;<br>monument. The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in&para;<br>the West, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which&para;<br>the cross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for&para;<br>another nearby parcel of equal value. The land transfer would not&para;<br>violate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which&para;<br>was simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain&para;<br>on federal land. Nor would the statute’s implementation constitute&para;<br>an endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.&para;<br>The so-called “endorsement test” views a challenged religious display&para;<br>through the eyes of a hypothetical reasonable observer aware of the&para;<br>history and all other pertinent facts relating to the display. Here,&para;<br>therefore, this observer would be familiar with the monument’s origin&para;<br>and history and thereby appreciate that the transfer represents an&para;<br>effort by Congress to address a unique situation and to find a solution&para;<br>that best accommodates conflicting concerns. Finally, the statute&para;<br>was not enacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s&para;<br>religious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to&para;<br>avoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the&para;<br>monument’s destruction. Pp. 1–7.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded that this&para;<br>Court need not—indeed, cannot—decide this case’s merits because&para;<br>Buono lacks Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks, which&para;<br>is not enforcement of the original injunction but expansion of it. By&para;<br>enjoining the Government from implementing the statute at issue,&para;<br>the District Court’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunc&para;<br>tion’s proscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Buono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue&para;<br>that relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will “re&para;<br>dress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him]&para;<br>caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Is&para;<br>land Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___. He has failed, however, to allege&para;<br>any such injury. Even assuming that being offended by a religious&para;<br>display constitutes a cognizable injury, it is merely speculative&para;<br>whether the cross will remain in place, and in any event Buono has&para;<br>made clear, by admitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on&para;<br>private property, that he will not be offended. Neither district courts’&para;<br>discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this District&para;<br>Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely enforcing the ex&para;<br>isting injunction makes any difference. If in fact a court awards new&para;<br>relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so.

The original cross deteriorated&para;<br>over time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same&para;<br>place. It is on federal land.&para;<br>The Court is asked to consider a challenge, not to the&para;<br>first placement of the cross or its continued presence on&para;<br>federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross&para;<br>and the land on which it stands to a private party.

The District Court&para;<br>permanently enjoined the Government from implementing&para;<br>the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We conclude&para;<br>that its judgment was in error.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) spans ap&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>proximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern California.&para;<br>The Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose&para;<br>picturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square&para;<br>miles, exceeding in size the combined area of the Nation’s&para;<br>five smallest States. See Merriam-Webster’s Geographical&para;<br>Dictionary 755, 1228–1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90&para;<br>percent of the land in the Preserve is federally owned,&para;<br>with the rest owned either by the State of California or by&para;<br>private parties. The National Park Service, a division of&para;<br>the Department of the Interior, administers the Preserve&para;<br>as part of the National Park System.&para;<br>16 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§410aaa–41 and 410aaa–46.&para;<br>Sunrise Rock is a granite outcropping located within the&para;<br>Preserve. Sunrise Rock and the area in its immediate&para;<br>vicinity are federal land, but two private ranches are&para;<br>located less than two miles away. The record does not&para;<br>indicate whether fencing is used to mark the boundary of&para;<br>these ranches. In 1934, members of the Veterans of For&para;<br>eign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin cross on the rock as a&para;<br>memorial to soldiers who died in World War I. A Latin&para;<br>cross consists of two bars—a vertical one and a shorter,&para;<br>horizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at&para;<br>various times over the years, most recently in 1998 by&para;<br>Henry Sandoz. Sandoz is a private citizen who owns land&para;<br>elsewhere in the Preserve, a portion of which he is pre&para;<br>pared to transfer to the Government in return for its&para;<br>conveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross&para;<br>stands, all pursuant to the statute now under review.&para;<br>The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of 4-inch diame&para;<br>ter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less&para;<br>than eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest&para;<br>highway, which lies more than 10 miles away. It is visi&para;<br>ble, however, from Cima Road, a narrow stretch of black&para;<br>top that comes within 100 feet of Sunrise Rock.&para;<br>The cross has been a gathering place for Easter services&para;<br>since it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock and its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

At one&para;<br>time the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating&para;<br>“ ‘The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,’&para;<br>and ‘Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic]&para;<br>Wars, Death Valley post 2884.’ ” Buono v. Kempthorne,&para;<br>527 F. 3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since&para;<br>disappeared, and the cross now stands unmarked.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Frank Buono, respondent here, is a retired Park Service&para;<br>employee who makes regular visits to the Preserve.&para;<br>Buono claims to be offended by the presence of a religious&para;<br>symbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Central District of California. He&para;<br>alleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the&para;<br>First Amendment and sought an injunction requiring the&para;<br>Government to remove the cross.&para;<br>The litigation proceeded in what can be described as&para;<br>four stages. In the first, the District Court ruled in&para;<br>Buono’s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment.&para;<br>Buono v. Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (CD Cal. 2002)&para;<br>(Buono I). As an initial matter, the court found that&para;<br>Buono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause&para;<br>challenge. Id., at 1210–1214. On the merits, the parties&para;<br>agreed that the dispute should be governed by the so&para;<br>called Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“A government religious practice or symbol will sur&para;<br>vive an Establishment Clause challenge when it&para;<br>(1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that&para;<br>neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) does&para;<br>not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.”&para;<br>Buono I, supra, at 1214–1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtz&para;<br>man, 403 U. S. 602, 612–613 (1971)).&para;<br>The court expressly declined to consider whether the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular&para;<br>purpose, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they&para;<br>caused excessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,&para;<br>n. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the&para;<br>cross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable&para;<br>observer.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the&para;<br>cross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern&para;<br>mental endorsement of religion, the court granted Buono’s&para;<br>request for injunctive relief. The court’s order in Buono I&para;<br>(2002 injunction) permanently forbade the Government&para;<br>“from permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area&para;<br>of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 146a.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it re&para;<br>quired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not&para;<br>forbid alternative methods of complying with the order.&para;<br>The Government covered the cross, first with a tarpaulin&para;<br>and later with a plywood box.&para;<br>On appeal, the judgment of the District Court was af&para;<br>firmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s&para;<br>Establishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton, 371&para;<br>F. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II). Like the District Court,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the Govern&para;<br>ment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had&para;<br>been motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its&para;<br>ruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reason&para;<br>able observer would perceive a cross on federal land as&para;<br>governmental endorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550.&para;<br>The Government did not seek review by this Court, so that&para;<br>the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Buono II became&para;<br>final.&para;<br>C&para;<br>During the relevant proceedings, Congress enacted&para;<br>certain statutes related to the cross:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>(1) Before Buono I was filed, Congress passed an appro&para;<br>priations bill that included a provision forbidding the use&para;<br>of governmental funds to remove the cross. Consolidated&para;<br>Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat.&para;<br>2763A–230.&para;<br>(2) While Buono I was pending before the District Court,&para;<br>Congress designated the cross and its adjoining land “as a&para;<br>national memorial commemorating United States partici&para;<br>pation in World War I and honoring the American veter&para;<br>ans of that war.” Department of Defense Appropriations&para;<br>Act, 2002, Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The&para;<br>Secretary of the Interior was directed to expend up to&para;<br>$10,000 to acquire a replica of the original cross and its&para;<br>memorial plaque and to install the plaque at a suitable&para;<br>nearby location. §8137(c).&para;<br>(3) Three months after Buono I was decided, Congress&para;<br>again prohibited the spending of governmental funds to&para;<br>remove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations&para;<br>Act, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.&para;<br>(4) While the Government’s appeal in Buono II was&para;<br>pending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer statute)&para;<br>directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the&para;<br>VFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been&para;<br>designated a national memorial. Department of Defense&para;<br>Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117&para;<br>Stat. 1100. In exchange, the Government was to receive&para;<br>land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry Sandoz and his&para;<br>wife. Ibid. Any difference in value between the two par&para;<br>cels would be equalized through a cash payment.&para;<br>§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the&para;<br>property would revert to the Government if not main&para;<br>tained “as a memorial commemorating United States&para;<br>participation in World War I and honoring the American&para;<br>veterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100. The&para;<br>statute presents a central issue in this case.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals in Buono II did not address the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>effect on the suit of a potential land transfer under the&para;<br>statute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as&para;<br>long as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that&para;<br>its effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court&para;<br>thus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer com&para;<br>pleted under [the statute] would pass constitutional mus&para;<br>ter.” Id., at 546.&para;<br>D&para;<br>After the Court of Appeals affirmed in Buono II, Buono&para;<br>returned to the District Court seeking to prevent the land&para;<br>transfer. He sought injunctive relief against the transfer,&para;<br>either through enforcement or modification of the 2002&para;<br>injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court de&para;<br>scribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer&para;<br>was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as&para;<br>the Government claimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the&para;<br>cross in place (as Buono claimed). Buono v. Norton, 364&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III). In&para;<br>Buono III, the court did not consider whether the transfer&para;<br>itself was an “independent violation of the Establishment&para;<br>Clause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless con&para;<br>cluded that the transfer was an attempt by the Govern&para;<br>ment to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was&para;<br>invalid. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the&para;<br>2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it;&para;<br>and permanently enjoined the Government from imple&para;<br>menting the land-transfer statute.

To demonstrate stand&para;<br>ing, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in&para;<br>the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invoca&para;<br>tion of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores, 557&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The Government argues that Buono’s&para;<br>asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not&para;<br>confer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does&para;<br>not find the cross itself objectionable but instead takes&para;<br>offense at the presence of a religious symbol on federal&para;<br>land. Buono does not claim that, as a personal matter, he&para;<br>has been made to feel excluded or coerced, and so, the&para;<br>Government contends, he cannot object to the presence of&para;<br>the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17.&para;<br>Whatever the validity of the objection to Buono’s stand&para;<br>ing, that argument is not available to the Government at&para;<br>this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved the Dis&para;<br>trict Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring the&para;<br>removal of the cross, the Government raised the same&para;<br>standing objections it proffers now. Rejecting the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s position, the District Court entered a judgment&para;<br>in Buono’s favor, which the Court of Appeals affirmed in&para;<br>Buono II. The Government did not seek review in this&para;<br>Court. The judgment became final and unreviewable upon&para;<br>the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale&para;<br>Co. v. Computing Scale Co., 261 U. S. 399, 418 (1923); see&para;<br>Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990) (90-day dead&para;<br>line is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government&para;<br>cannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final&para;<br>judgment in Buono I.&para;<br>Of course, even though the Court may not reconsider&para;<br>whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>it is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono III to&para;<br>seek application of the injunction against the land&para;<br>transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the&para;<br>judgment upon which we granted review.&para;<br>This was a measure of relief that Buono had standing to&para;<br>seek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor ac&para;<br>quires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring com&para;<br>pliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.&para;<br>737, 763 (1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation&para;<br>decree to which they were parties is “a personal interest,&para;<br>created by law, in having the State refrain from taking&para;<br>specific actions”). Having obtained a final judgment&para;<br>granting relief on his claims, Buono had standing to seek&para;<br>its vindication.&para;<br>The Government does not deny this proposition as a&para;<br>general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not&para;<br>seeking to vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002&para;<br>injunction. The first injunction forbade the Government&para;<br>from maintaining the cross on Sunrise Rock; yet in Buono&para;<br>III he sought to preclude the land transfer, a different&para;<br>governmental action. The Government contends that&para;<br>Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.&para;<br>Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.&para;<br>The Government’s argument, however, is properly ad&para;<br>dressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not to&para;<br>Buono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has&para;<br>challenged whether appropriate relief was granted in&para;<br>Buono III in light of the relevant considerations and legal&para;<br>principles, and we shall consider these questions. The&para;<br>standing inquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury&para;<br>that prompted the plaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdic&para;<br>tion in the first place. Buono’s entitlement to an injunc&para;<br>tion having been established in Buono I and II, he sought&para;<br>in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating&para;<br>or evading that injunction. Based on the rights he ob&para;<br>tained under the earlier decree—against the same party,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>regarding the same cross and the same land—his interests&para;<br>in doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to&para;<br>support his standing. Although Buono also argued that&para;<br>the land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent”&para;<br>Establishment Clause violation, the District Court did not&para;<br>address or order relief on that claim, which is not before&para;<br>us. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a&para;<br>case in which a party seeks to import a previous standing&para;<br>determination into a wholly different dispute.&para;<br>In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather than to&para;<br>enforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence&para;<br>contends that the injunction did not provide a basis for&para;<br>the District Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is&para;<br>not an argument about standing but about the merits of&para;<br>the District Court’s order. Those points now must be&para;<br>addressed.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The procedural history of this litigation must be consid&para;<br>ered to identify the issues now subject to review. The&para;<br>District Court granted the 2002 injunction after conclud&para;<br>ing that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment&para;<br>Clause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that&para;<br>conclusion on appeal, and the judgment became final upon&para;<br>completion of direct review. At that point, the judgment&para;<br>“became res judicata to the parties and those in privity&para;<br>with them, not only as to every matter which was offered&para;<br>and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but&para;<br>as to any other admissible matter which might have been&para;<br>offered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v.&para;<br>Bailey, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). The Government therefore&para;<br>does not—and could not—ask this Court to reconsider the&para;<br>propriety of the 2002 injunction or the District Court’s&para;<br>reasons for granting it.&para;<br>The question now before the Court is whether the Dis&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>trict Court properly enjoined the Government from im&para;<br>plementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court&para;<br>did not consider whether the statute, in isolation, would&para;<br>have violated the Establishment Clause, and it did not&para;<br>forbid the land transfer as an independent constitutional&para;<br>violation. Buono III, supra, at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the&para;<br>court enjoined compliance with the statute on the premise&para;<br>that the relief was necessary to protect the rights Buono&para;<br>had secured through the 2002 injunction.&para;<br>An injunction is an exercise of a court’s equitable au&para;<br>thority, to be ordered only after taking into account all of&para;<br>the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective&para;<br>relief. See United States v. Swift &amp; Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114&para;<br>(1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.&para;<br>305, 312 (1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329&para;<br>(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal&para;<br>Practice and Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995)&para;<br>(hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). Equitable relief is not&para;<br>granted as a matter of course, see Weinberger, 456 U. S.,&para;<br>at 311–312, and a court should be particularly cautious&para;<br>when contemplating relief that implicates public interests,&para;<br>see id., at 312 (“In exercising their sound discretion, courts&para;<br>of equity should pay particular regard for the public con&para;<br>sequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of in&para;<br>junction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289&para;<br>U. S. 334, 338 (1933) (“Where an important public interest&para;<br>would be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunc&para;<br>tion may be compelling”). Because injunctive relief “is&para;<br>drafted in light of what the court believes will be the&para;<br>future course of events, . . . a court must never ignore&para;<br>significant changes in the law or circumstances underlying&para;<br>an injunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument&para;<br>of wrong.’ ” Wright &amp; Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting&para;<br>Swift &amp; Co., supra, at 115).&para;<br>Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropri&para;<br>ate inquiry.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>change in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the&para;<br>requested relief. The court, however, did not acknowledge&para;<br>the statute’s significance. It examined the events that led&para;<br>to the statute’s enactment and found an intent to prevent&para;<br>removal of the cross. Deeming this intent illegitimate, the&para;<br>court concluded that nothing of moment had changed.&para;<br>This was error. Even assuming that the land-transfer&para;<br>statute was an attempt to prevent removal of the cross, it&para;<br>does not follow that an injunction against its implementa&para;<br>tion was appropriate.&para;<br>By dismissing Congress’s motives as illicit, the District&para;<br>Court took insufficient account of the context in which the&para;<br>statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.&para;<br>Private citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to com&para;<br>memorate American servicemen who had died in World&para;<br>War I. Although certainly a Christian symbol, the cross&para;<br>was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian&para;<br>message. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liber&para;<br>ties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 661&para;<br>(1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids&para;<br>a city to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin&para;<br>cross on the roof of city hall . . . because such an obtrusive&para;<br>year-round religious display would place the government’s&para;<br>weight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of&para;<br>a particular religion”). Placement of the cross on Govern&para;<br>ment-owned land was not an attempt to set the imprima&para;<br>tur of the state on a particular creed. Rather, those who&para;<br>erected the cross intended simply to honor our Nation’s&para;<br>fallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of&para;<br>the United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting that&para;<br>the plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with&para;<br>VFW decals”).&para;<br>Time also has played its role. The cross had stood on&para;<br>Sunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute&para;<br>was enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it com&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>memorated had become entwined in the public conscious&para;<br>ness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly&para;<br>at Sunrise Rock to pay their respects. Rather than let the&para;<br>cross deteriorate, community members repeatedly took it&para;<br>upon themselves to replace it. Congress ultimately desig&para;<br>nated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it among&para;<br>those monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that con&para;<br>stitute our national heritage. See note following 16&para;<br>U. S. C. §431 (listing officially designated national memo&para;<br>rials, including the National D-Day Memorial and the&para;<br>Vietnam Veterans Memorial). Research discloses no other&para;<br>national memorial honoring American soldiers—more&para;<br>than 300,000 of them—who were killed or wounded in&para;<br>World War I. See generally A. Leland &amp; M. Oboroceanu,&para;<br>Congressional Research Service Report for Congress,&para;<br>American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists&para;<br>and Statistics 2 (2009). It is reasonable to interpret the&para;<br>congressional designation as giving recognition to the&para;<br>historical meaning that the cross had attained. Cf. Van&para;<br>Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 702–703 (2005) (BREYER, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (“40 years” without legal chal&para;<br>lenge to a Ten Commandments display “suggest that the&para;<br>public visiting the [surrounding] grounds has considered&para;<br>the religious aspect of the tablets’ message as part of what&para;<br>is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a&para;<br>cultural heritage”).&para;<br>The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government&para;<br>with a dilemma. It could not maintain the cross without&para;<br>violating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross&para;<br>without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen&para;<br>as honoring. Cf. id., at 704 (to invalidate a longstanding&para;<br>Ten Commandments display might “create the very kind&para;<br>of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment&para;<br>Clause seeks to avoid”).

That principle, how&para;<br>ever, was not a bar to this statute. The Government’s&para;<br>right to transfer the land was not adjudicated in Buono I&para;<br>or compromised by the 2002 injunction.&para;<br>In belittling the Government’s efforts as an attempt to&para;<br>“evade” the injunction, Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>1182, the District Court had things backwards. Con&para;<br>gress’s prerogative to balance opposing interests and its&para;<br>institutional competence to do so provide one of the princi&para;<br>pal reasons for deference to its policy determinations. See&para;<br>Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 513&para;<br>(1982). Here, Congress adopted a policy with respect to&para;<br>land it now owns in order to resolve a specific controversy.&para;<br>Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary all have a duty&para;<br>to support and defend the Constitution. See United States&para;<br>v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 703 (1974) (“In the performance of&para;<br>assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Govern&para;<br>ment must initially interpret the Constitution, and the&para;<br>interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great&para;<br>respect from the others”). The land-transfer statute em&para;<br>bodies Congress’s legislative judgment that this dispute is&para;<br>best resolved through a framework and policy of accom&para;<br>modation for a symbol that, while challenged under the&para;<br>Establishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the&para;<br>expression of religious views. That judgment should not&para;<br>have been dismissed as an evasion, for the statute brought&para;<br>about a change of law and a congressional statement of&para;<br>policy applicable to the case.&para;<br>Buono maintains that any governmental interest in&para;<br>keeping the cross up must cede to the constitutional con&para;<br>cerns on which the 2002 injunction was based. He argues&para;<br>that the land transfer would be “an incomplete remedy” to&para;<br>the constitutional violation underlying the injunction and&para;<br>that the transfer would make achieving a proper remedy&para;<br>more difficult.

BUONO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy&para;<br>to the wrong or injury that has been established. See&para;<br>Swift &amp; Co., 286 U. S., at 114 (“A continuing decree of&para;<br>injunction directed to events to come is subject always to&para;<br>adaptation as events may shape the need”). See also&para;<br>United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S.&para;<br>244, 249 (1968). Where legislative action has undermined&para;<br>the basis upon which relief has previously been granted, a&para;<br>court must consider whether the original finding of&para;<br>wrongdoing continues to justify the court’s intervention.&para;<br>See Railway Employees v.

The relevant question is&para;<br>whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable au&para;<br>thority is supported by the prior showing of illegality,&para;<br>judged against the claim that changed circumstances have&para;<br>rendered prospective relief inappropriate.&para;<br>The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based&para;<br>solely on its conclusion that presence of the cross on fed&para;<br>eral land conveyed an impression of governmental en&para;<br>dorsement of religion. The court expressly disavowed any&para;<br>inquiry into whether the Government’s actions had a&para;<br>secular purpose or caused excessive entanglement. Buono&para;<br>I, 212 F.

The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement&para;<br>does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the&para;<br>public realm. A cross by the side of a public highway&para;<br>marking, for instance, the place where a state trooper&para;<br>perished need not be taken as a statement of governmen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The Constitution does&para;<br>not oblige government to avoid any public acknowledg&para;<br>ment of religion’s role in society. See Lee v. Weisman, 505&para;<br>U. S. 577, 598 (1992) (“A relentless and all-pervasive&para;<br>attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public life&para;<br>could itself become inconsistent with the Constitution”).&para;<br>See also Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of&para;<br>Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v.

Rather, it leaves room to accommodate divergent&para;<br>values within a constitutionally permissible framework.&para;<br>Even assuming the propriety of the original relief,&para;<br>however, the question before the District Court in Buono&para;<br>III was whether to invalidate the land transfer. Given the&para;<br>sole reliance on perception as a basis for the 2002 injunc&para;<br>tion, one would expect that any relief grounded on that&para;<br>decree would have rested on the same basis. But the&para;<br>District Court enjoined the land transfer on an entirely&para;<br>different basis: its suspicion of an illicit governmental&para;<br>purpose. See Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. The&para;<br>court made no inquiry into the effect that knowledge of the&para;<br>transfer of the land to private ownership would have had&para;<br>on any perceived governmental endorsement of religion,&para;<br>the harm to which the 2002 injunction was addressed.&para;<br>The District Court thus used an injunction granted for one&para;<br>reason as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged&para;<br>to be objectionable for a different reason. Ordering relief&para;<br>under such circumstances was improper—absent a finding&para;<br>that the relief was necessary to address an independent&para;<br>wrong. See ibid., n. 8 (noting that the court “need not&para;<br>consider [Buono’s] other contention that the land transfer&para;<br>itself is an independent violation of the Establishment&para;<br>Clause”).&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v.

The injunction was issued to address the im&para;<br>pression conveyed by the cross on federal, not private,&para;<br>land. Even if its purpose were characterized more gener&para;<br>ally as avoiding the perception of governmental endorse&para;<br>ment, that purpose would favor—or at least not oppose—&para;<br>ownership of the cross by a private party rather than by&para;<br>the Government.

He also&para;<br>points to the reversionary clause in the land-transfer&para;<br>statute requiring that the land be returned to the Gov&para;<br>ernment if not maintained as a World War I memorial.&para;<br>Finally, he notes that the cross remains designated a&para;<br>national memorial by an Act of Congress, which arguably&para;<br>would prevent the VFW from dismantling the cross even if&para;<br>it wanted to do so. Brief for Respondent 37–48.&para;<br>The District Court failed to consider whether, in light of&para;<br>the change in law and circumstances effected by the land&para;<br>transfer statute, the “reasonable observer” standard con&para;<br>tinued to be the appropriate framework through which to&para;<br>consider the Establishment Clause concerns invoked to&para;<br>justify the requested relief.

See 149 Cong. Rec. H8793&para;<br>(Sept. 24, 2003); id., at S11943 (Sept. 25, 2003). In my&para;<br>view, there is no legal ground for blocking the implemen&para;<br>tation of this law.&para;<br>The dissent contends that the land transfer would vio&para;<br>late the District Court injunction, but that argument, for&para;<br>the reasons explained in JUSTICE SCALIA’s opinion, see&para;<br>post, at 2 (concurring in judgment), is plainly unsound.&para;<br>The obvious meaning of the injunction was simply that the&para;<br>Government could not allow the cross to remain on federal&para;<br>land.&para;<br>There is also no merit in JUSTICE STEVENS’ contention&para;<br>that implementation of the statute would constitute an&para;<br>endorsement of Christianity and would thus violate the&para;<br>Establishment Clause. Assuming that it is appropriate to&para;<br>apply the so-called “endorsement test,” this test would not&para;<br>be violated by the land exchange.

Citizens for Better Environment,&para;<br>523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 7&para;<br>Wall. 506, 514 (1869)).&para;<br>The plurality is correct that Buono’s standing to obtain&para;<br>the original injunction is not before us.

That doctrine comes into play only&para;<br>if an issue we are asked to resolve has already been decided in the same&para;<br>litigation. See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). In its&para;<br>earlier decision, the Ninth Circuit addressed only Buono’s standing to&para;<br>seek the original injunction barring the display of the cross on public&para;<br>land. See Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 546–548 (2004).

If he sought only to compel&para;<br>compliance with the existing order, Article III would not&para;<br>stand in his way.&para;<br>As the plurality all but admits, however, the relief&para;<br>Buono requests and the District Court awarded in this&para;<br>proceeding is not enforcement of the original injunction&para;<br>but expansion of it. See ante, at 15. The only reasonable&para;<br>reading of the original injunction, in context, is that it&para;<br>proscribed the cross’s display on federal land. Buono’s&para;<br>alleged injuries arose from the cross’s presence on public&para;<br>property, see App. 50, 59, and the injunction accordingly&para;<br>prohibited the Government, its “employees, agents, and&para;<br>those in active concert with [them] . . . from permitting the&para;<br>display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in&para;<br>the Mojave National Preserve.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>146a. Barring the Government from “permitting” the&para;<br>cross’s display at a particular location makes sense only if&para;<br>the Government owns the location. As the proprietor, it&para;<br>can remove the cross that private parties have erected and&para;<br>deny permission to erect another. But if the land is pri&para;<br>vately owned, the Government can prevent the cross’s&para;<br>display only by making it illegal. Prohibitory legislation&para;<br>does not consist of a mere refusal to “permi[t],” nor is the&para;<br>enactment of legislation what the injunction commanded&para;<br>(a command that would raise serious First Amendment&para;<br>and separation-of-powers questions).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Moreover, Buono failed to raise the issue in his brief in opposition to&para;<br>certiorari, and we may deem it waived. See this Court’s Rule 15.2; cf.&para;<br>Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 116, n. 2 (1998).&para;<br>2 The principal dissent does not dispute that the original injunction&para;<br>did not require the Government to ban the cross’s display on private&para;<br>land, yet it insists that the injunction nonetheless forbade transferring&para;<br>the land to a private party who could keep the cross in place. Post, at&para;<br>6–7 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).

A&para;<br>plaintiff cannot sidestep Article III’s requirements by&para;<br>combining a request for injunctive relief for which he has&para;<br>standing with a request for injunctive relief for which he&para;<br>lacks standing. And for the same reason, a plaintiff can&para;<br>not ask a court to expand an existing injunction unless he&para;<br>has standing to seek the additional relief.&para;<br>Buono must therefore demonstrate that the additional&para;<br>relief he sought—blocking the transfer of the memorial to&para;<br>a private party—will “redress or prevent actual or immi&para;<br>nently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>when failing to forbid the cross’s presence on already-private land&para;<br>within the Mojave National Preserve would not be treated as such.

To begin with, the predicate for any&para;<br>injury he might assert—that the VFW, after taking pos&para;<br>session of the land, will continue to display the cross—is at&para;<br>this stage merely speculative.3 Nothing in the statutes&para;<br>compels the VFW (or any future proprietor) to keep it up.&para;<br>The land reverts to the Government only if “the&para;<br>conveyed property is no longer being maintained as a war&para;<br>memorial,” Pub.

But those aspects would&para;<br>be irrelevant if the cross were no longer displayed.&para;<br>4 The principal dissent insists, post, at 4–5, n. 2, that it is clear the&para;<br>cross will remain because the VFW asserted in an amicus brief that it&para;<br>“intends to maintain and preserve the Veterans Memorial as a memo&para;<br>rial to United States veterans,” and elsewhere referred to “the seven&para;<br>foot-tall cross and plaque that comprise the Veterans Memorial,” Brief&para;<br>for VFW of the United States et al. as Amici Curiae 4, 7.

In short, even assuming that being “deeply of&para;<br>fended” by a religious display (and taking steps to avoid&para;<br>seeing it) constitutes a cognizable injury, Buono has made&para;<br>clear that he will not be offended.5&para;<br>These same considerations bear upon the plurality’s&para;<br>assertion that Buono has standing to “prevent the Gov&para;<br>ernment from frustrating or evading” the original injunc&para;<br>tion, ante, at 8.

In the first&para;<br>stage of this litigation, the District Court and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals ruled that the Government violated the Estab­&para;<br>lishment Clause by permitting the display of a single&para;<br>white Latin cross at Sunrise Rock. Those courts further&para;<br>ruled that the appropriate remedy was an injunction&para;<br>prohibiting the Government from “permitting the display&para;<br>of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mo­&para;<br>jave National Preserve.” App. 39. The Government de­&para;<br>clined to seek a writ of certiorari following those rulings.&para;<br>Accordingly, for the purpose of this case, it is settled that&para;<br>“the Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of govern­&para;<br>ment endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable observer,”&para;<br>Buono v.

See Department of Defense&para;<br>Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121, 117 Stat.&para;<br>1100. The District Court found that the land transfer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The District Court therefore enforced its 2002 judg­&para;<br>ment by enjoining the transfer, without considering&para;<br>whether “the land transfer itself is an independent viola­&para;<br>tion of the Establishment Clause.” Ibid., n. 8. Because&para;<br>the District Court did not base its decision upon an inde­&para;<br>pendent Establishment Clause violation, the constitution­&para;<br>ality of the land-transfer statute is not before us.

That formulation implies that the changed circum­&para;<br>stances all cut in one direction, against prospective relief,&para;<br>and that the defendant has asked the court to alleviate its&para;<br>obligations.

This difference in focus is a subtle one, but it is&para;<br>important to emphasize that the question that was before&para;<br>the District Court—and that is now before us—is whether&para;<br>enjoining the transfer was necessary to effectuate the&para;<br>letter or logic of the 2002 judgment.&para;<br>Although I agree with the plurality’s basic framework, I&para;<br>disagree with its decision to remand the case to the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court. The District Court already “engage[d] in the&para;<br>appropriate inquiry,” ante, at 10, and it was well within its&para;<br>rights to enforce the 2002 judgment. First, the District&para;<br>——————&para;<br>respondent has standing even under the analysis that JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>undertakes. It is not at all “speculative,” ante, at 4 (opinion concurring&para;<br>in judgment), that the VFW will continue to display the cross. VFW&para;<br>Post 385, the beneficiary of the land transfer, has filed an amici brief in&para;<br>this case indicating it “intends to maintain and preserve the Veterans&para;<br>Memorial,” Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States&para;<br>et al. as Amici Curiae 4, by which it means the cross, id., at 7 (identify­&para;<br>ing the Veterans Memorial as the “cross and plaque”). Respondent did,&para;<br>in his amended complaint, aver that he was offended specifically “by&para;<br>the display of a Latin Cross on government-owned property.” App. 50.&para;<br>But his claimed injury is that he is “unable to freely use the area of the&para;<br>Preserve around the cross,” Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 547 (CA9&para;<br>2004) (Buono II) (internal quotation marks omitted), because the&para;<br>Government’s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will induce&para;<br>him to avoid the Sunrise Rock area, even though it offers the most&para;<br>convenient route to the Preserve, App. 65. That endorsement and&para;<br>respondent’s resulting injury not only persist, but have been aggra­&para;<br>vated by the Government’s actions since the complaint was filed.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Court properly recognized that the transfer was a means&para;<br>of “permitting”—indeed, encouraging—the display of the&para;<br>cross. The transfer therefore would violate the terms of&para;<br>the court’s original injunction. Second, even if the transfer&para;<br>would not violate the terms of the 2002 injunction, the&para;<br>District Court properly took into account events that&para;<br>transpired since 2002 and determined that barring the&para;<br>transfer was necessary to achieve the intended result of&para;<br>the 2002 decree, as the transfer would not eliminate gov­&para;<br>ernment endorsement of religion.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The first step in the analysis is straightforward: The&para;<br>District Court had to ask whether the transfer of the&para;<br>property would violate the extant injunction. Under the&para;<br>terms of that injunction, the answer was yes.&para;<br>The 2002 injunction barred the Government from “per­&para;<br>mitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sun­&para;<br>rise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. 39. The&para;<br>land-transfer statute mandated transfer of the land to an&para;<br>organization that has announced its intention to maintain&para;<br>the cross on Sunrise Rock. That action surely “permit[s]”&para;<br>the display of the cross. See 11 Oxford English Dictionary&para;<br>578 (2d ed. 1989) (defining “permit” as “[t]o admit or allow&para;<br>the doing or occurrence of; to give leave or opportunity&para;<br>for”). True, the Government would no longer exert direct&para;<br>control over the cross. But the transfer itself would be an&para;<br>act permitting its display.&para;<br>I therefore disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the “only&para;<br>reasonable reading of the original injunction . . . is that it&para;<br>proscribed the cross’s display on federal land.” Ante, at 2&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment). If the land were already&para;<br>privately owned, JUSTICE SCALIA may be correct that the&para;<br>cross’ display on Sunrise Rock would not violate the in­&para;<br>junction because the Government would not have to do&para;<br>anything to allow the cross to stand, and the Government&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>could try to prevent its display only by making such a&para;<br>display illegal. But the Government does own this land,&para;<br>and the transfer statute requires the Executive Branch to&para;<br>take an affirmative act (transfer to private ownership)&para;<br>designed to keep the cross in place. In evaluating a claim&para;<br>that the Government would impermissibly “permit” the&para;<br>cross’ display by effecting a transfer, a court cannot&para;<br>start from a baseline in which the cross has already been&para;<br>transferred.&para;<br>Moreover, §8121 was designed specifically to foster the&para;<br>display of the cross. Regardless of why the Government&para;<br>wanted to “accommodat[e]” the interests associated with&para;<br>its display, ante, at 13 (plurality opinion), it was not only&para;<br>foreseeable but also intended that the cross would remain&para;<br>standing. Indeed, so far as the record indicates, the Gov­&para;<br>ernment had no other purpose for turning over this land to&para;<br>private hands. It was therefore proper for the District&para;<br>Court to find that the transfer would violate its 2002&para;<br>injunction and to enforce that injunction against the&para;<br>transfer.&para;<br>III&para;<br>As already noted, it was respondent, the beneficiary of&para;<br>the injunction, who moved the District Court for relief.&para;<br>When the beneficiary of an injunction seeks relief “to&para;<br>achieve the purposes of the provisions of the decree,”&para;<br>United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S., at 249, a district&para;<br>court has the authority to “modify the decree so as to&para;<br>achieve the required result with all appropriate expedi­&para;<br>tion,” id., at 252. Thus, regardless of whether the transfer&para;<br>was prohibited by the plain terms of the 2002 judgment,&para;<br>the District Court properly inquired into whether enjoin­&para;<br>ing the transfer was necessary to achieve the objective of&para;<br>that judgment. The Government faces a high burden in&para;<br>arguing the District Court exceeded its authority. A de­&para;<br>cree “may not be changed in the interests of the defen­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dants if the purposes of the litigation . . . have not been&para;<br>fully achieved.” Id., at 248 (emphasis deleted). And con­&para;<br>trary to the Government’s position, the changed circum­&para;<br>stances in this case support, rather than count against,&para;<br>the District Court’s enforcement decision.&para;<br>The objective of the 2002 judgment, as the plurality&para;<br>grudgingly allows, was to “avoi[d] the perception of gov­&para;<br>ernmental endorsement” of religion. Ante, at 16; see&para;<br>Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1178 (analyzing “ ‘whether&para;<br>government action endorsing religion has actually ceased’ ”&para;<br>in light of the transfer). The parties do not disagree on&para;<br>this point; rather, they dispute whether the transfer would&para;<br>end government endorsement of the cross. Compare Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 21 (“Congress’s transfer of the land . . .&para;<br>ends any governmental endorsement of the cross”) with&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 34 (“[T]he government’s endorsement&para;<br>of the Christian cross is not remedied” by the land trans­&para;<br>fer). The District Court rightly found that the transfer&para;<br>would not end government endorsement of the cross.&para;<br>A government practice violates the Establishment&para;<br>Clause if it “either has the purpose or effect of ‘endorsing’&para;<br>religion.” County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties&para;<br>Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592&para;<br>(1989). “Whether the key word is ‘endorsement,’ ‘favorit­&para;<br>ism,’ or ‘promotion,’ the essential principle remains the&para;<br>same. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, pro­&para;<br>hibits government from appearing to take a position on&para;<br>questions of religious belief or from ‘making adherence to&para;<br>a religion relevant in any way to a person’s standing&para;<br>in the political community.’ ” Id., at 593–594 (quoting&para;<br>Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 687 (1984) (O’Connor, J.,&para;<br>concurring)).&para;<br>The 2002 injunction was based on a finding that display&para;<br>of the cross had the effect of endorsing religion. That is,&para;<br>“the Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a message of gov­&para;<br>ernment endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable ob­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The determination&para;<br>that the Government had endorsed religion necessarily&para;<br>rested on two premises: first, that the Government en­&para;<br>dorsed the cross, and second, that the cross “take[s] a&para;<br>position on questions of religious belief” or “ ‘mak[es] ad­&para;<br>herence to religion relevant . . . to a person’s standing in&para;<br>the political community,’ ” County of Allegheny, 492 U. S.,&para;<br>at 594. Taking the District Court’s 2002 finding of an&para;<br>Establishment Clause violation as res judicata, as we&para;<br>must, the land transfer has the potential to dislodge only&para;<br>the first of those premises, in that the transfer might&para;<br>change the Government’s endorsing relationship with the&para;<br>cross. As I explain below, I disagree that the transfer&para;<br>ordered by §8121 would in fact have this result. But it is&para;<br>also worth noting at the outset that the transfer statute&para;<br>could not (and does not) dislodge the second premise—that&para;<br>the cross conveys a religious message. Continuing gov­&para;<br>ernment endorsement of the cross is thus continuing&para;<br>government endorsement of religion.&para;<br>In my view, the transfer ordered by §8121 would not end&para;<br>government endorsement of the cross for two independ­&para;<br>ently sufficient reasons. First, after the transfer it would&para;<br>continue to appear to any reasonable observer that the&para;<br>Government has endorsed the cross, notwithstanding that&para;<br>the name has changed on the title to a small patch of&para;<br>underlying land. This is particularly true because the&para;<br>Government has designated the cross as a national memo­&para;<br>rial, and that endorsement continues regardless of&para;<br>whether the cross sits on public or private land. Second,&para;<br>the transfer continues the existing government endorse­&para;<br>ment of the cross because the purpose of the transfer is to&para;<br>preserve its display. Congress’ intent to preserve the&para;<br>display of the cross maintains the Government’s endorse­&para;<br>ment of the cross.&para;<br>The plurality does not conclude to the contrary; that is,&para;<br>it does not decide that the transfer would end government&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v.

Rather, the plurality concludes that the District&para;<br>Court did not conduct an appropriate analysis, and it&para;<br>remands the case for a do-over. I take up each of the&para;<br>purported faults the plurality finds in the District Court’s&para;<br>analysis in my examination of the reasons why the trans­&para;<br>fer does not cure the existing Establishment Clause&para;<br>violation.&para;<br>Perception of the Cross Post-Transfer&para;<br>The 2002 injunction was based upon a finding of im­&para;<br>permissible effect: The “Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a&para;<br>message of government endorsement [of religion] to a&para;<br>reasonable observer.” Buono II, 371 F. 3d, at 549. The&para;<br>transfer would not end that impermissible state of affairs&para;<br>because the cross, post-transfer, would still have “the&para;<br>effect of communicating a message of government en­&para;<br>dorsement . . . of religion.” Lynch, 465 U. S., at 692&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring). As the Court of Appeals cor­&para;<br>rectly found, “[n]othing in the present posture of the case&para;<br>alters” the conclusion that a “reasonable observer would&para;<br>perceive governmental endorsement of the message” the&para;<br>cross conveys. Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783&para;<br>(CA9 2008) (Buono IV).3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>plurality faults the District Court for not engaging in this&para;<br>analysis, but the District Court did implicitly consider how a reason­&para;<br>able observer would perceive the cross post-transfer when it analyzed&para;<br>the terms of the transfer, the Government’s continuing property rights&para;<br>in the conveyed land, and the history of the Government’s efforts to&para;<br>preserve the cross. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals affirmed the&para;<br>District Court’s order on the express ground that a reasonable observer&para;<br>would still perceive government endorsement of the cross. See Buono&para;<br>IV, 527 F. 3d, at 782–783.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests this is much ado about nothing because&para;<br>respondent’s counsel conceded that the injunction would not be violated&para;<br>were the Government to have gone through an “empty ritual” of taking&para;<br>down the cross before transferring the land. Ante, at 1 (concurring&para;<br>opinion). But in the colloquy to which THE CHIEF JUSTICE refers,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>In its original judgment, the Court of Appeals found&para;<br>that a well-informed reasonable observer would perceive&para;<br>government endorsement of religion, notwithstanding the&para;<br>cross’ initial “placement by private individuals,” based&para;<br>upon the following facts: “that the cross rests on public&para;<br>land[,] . . . that Congress has designated the cross as a war&para;<br>memorial and prohibited the use of funds to remove it, and&para;<br>that the Park Service has denied similar access for expres­&para;<br>sion by an adherent of the . . . Buddhist faith.” Buono II,&para;<br>371 F. 3d, at 550. After the transfer, a well-informed&para;<br>observer would know that the cross was no longer on&para;<br>public land, but would additionally be aware of the follow­&para;<br>ing facts: The cross was once on public land, the Govern­&para;<br>ment was enjoined from permitting its display, Congress&para;<br>transferred it to a specific purchaser in order to preserve&para;<br>its display in the same location, and the Government&para;<br>maintained a reversionary interest in the land. From this&para;<br>chain of events, in addition to the factors that remain the&para;<br>same after the transfer, he would perceive government&para;<br>endorsement of the cross.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>counsel assumed that the Government would not retain a reversionary&para;<br>interest in the land, and that the cross would not retain its designation&para;<br>as a national memorial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. Even under THE&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE’s revised version of the hypothetical, I would not so&para;<br>quickly decide that taking down the cross makes no material difference.&para;<br>And counsel’s statement takes no position as to whether the hypotheti­&para;<br>cal poses any constitutional problem independent of the injunction.&para;<br>Regardless, we must deal with the substance of the case before us,&para;<br>which involves much more than Congress directing the Government to&para;<br>execute a simple land transfer.&para;<br>4 A less informed reasonable observer, see Capitol Square Review and&para;<br>Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 807 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissent­&para;<br>ing), would reach the same conclusion because the cross would still&para;<br>appear to stand on Government property. The transfer merely “carv[es]&para;<br>out a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Preserve—like a&para;<br>donut hole with the cross atop it.” Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d&para;<br>758, 783 (CA9 2008). For any reasonable observer, then, the transfer&para;<br>simply would not change the effect of the cross.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Particularly important to this analysis is that although&para;<br>the transfer might remove the implicit endorsement that&para;<br>presence on public land signifies, see Capitol Square&para;<br>Review and Advisory Bd. v.

Buono II, 371 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 550. Their significance does not depend upon the own­&para;<br>ership of the land.&para;<br>In 2000, and again after the District Court had entered&para;<br>its initial injunction, Congress passed legislation prohibit­&para;<br>ing the use of any federal funds to remove the cross from&para;<br>its location on federal property.

L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.&para;<br>Thus, beyond merely acquiescing in the continued pres­&para;<br>ence of a cross on federal property, Congress singled out&para;<br>that cross for special treatment, and it affirmatively com­&para;<br>manded that the cross must remain.&para;<br>Congress also made a more dramatic intervention.&para;<br>Without the benefit of any committee hearings or floor&para;<br>debate in either the Senate or the House of Representa­&para;<br>tives—indeed, without a moment of discussion in any&para;<br>official forum—Congress passed legislation officially des­&para;<br>ignating the “five-foot-tall white cross” in the Mojave&para;<br>Desert “as a national memorial commemorating United&para;<br>States participation in World War I and honoring the&para;<br>American veterans of that war.” §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278.&para;<br>Thereafter, the cross was no longer just a local artifact; it&para;<br>acquired a formal national status of the highest order.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

In argu­&para;<br>ing that Congress can legitimately favor the cross because&para;<br>of its purported double meaning, the plurality implicitly&para;<br>tries to reopen what is closed.8&para;<br>The plurality also poses a different objection to consid­&para;<br>eration of whether the transfer would change a reasonable&para;<br>observer’s perception of the cross. The plurality suggests&para;<br>that the “ ‘reasonable observer’ standard” may not “be the&para;<br>appropriate framework” because “courts considering Es­&para;<br>tablishment Clause challenges do not,” as a general mat­&para;<br>ter, “inquire into ‘reasonable observer’ perceptions with&para;<br>respect to objects on private land.” Ante, at 16. Once&para;<br>again, the plurality’s approach fails to pay heed to the&para;<br>posture of this case.&para;<br>At the risk of stating the obvious, respondent is not&para;<br>simply challenging a private object on private land. Al­&para;<br>though “an Establishment Clause violation must be&para;<br>moored in government action of some sort,” Pinette, 515&para;<br>U. S., at 779 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concur­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The plurality’s assertions regarding the meaning of the cross are&para;<br>therefore beside the point. For the record, however, I cannot agree that&para;<br>a bare cross such as this conveys a nonsectarian meaning simply&para;<br>because crosses are often used to commemorate “heroic acts, noble&para;<br>contributions, and patient striving” and to honor fallen soldiers. Ante,&para;<br>at 17. The cross is not a universal symbol of sacrifice. It is the symbol&para;<br>of one particular sacrifice, and that sacrifice carries deeply significant&para;<br>meaning for those who adhere to the Christian faith. The cross has&para;<br>sometimes been used, it is true, to represent the sacrifice of an individ­&para;<br>ual, as when it marks the grave of a fallen soldier or recognizes a state&para;<br>trooper who perished in the line of duty. Even then, the cross carries a&para;<br>religious meaning. But the use of the cross in such circumstances is&para;<br>linked to, and shows respects for, the individual honoree’s faith and&para;<br>beliefs. I, too, would consider it tragic if the Nation’s fallen veterans&para;<br>were to be forgotten. See ibid. But there are countless different ways,&para;<br>consistent with the Constitution, that such an outcome may be averted.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ring in judgment), respondent’s objection to the transfer&para;<br>easily meets that test for two reasons. First, he is cur­&para;<br>rently challenging official legislation, taken in response to&para;<br>an identified Establishment Clause violation. That legis­&para;<br>lation would transfer public land to a particular private&para;<br>party, with the proviso that the transferee must use the&para;<br>land to fulfill a specific public function or else the land&para;<br>reverts back to the Government. Second, even once the&para;<br>transfer is complete, the cross would remain a national&para;<br>memorial. The cross is therefore not a purely “private”&para;<br>object in any meaningful sense.&para;<br>Notwithstanding these facts, the plurality appears to&para;<br>conclude that the transfer might render the cross purely&para;<br>private speech. It relies in part on the plurality opinion in&para;<br>Pinette for its suggestion that the reasonable observer&para;<br>standard may not be apposite, and Pinette addressed a&para;<br>privately owned cross displayed in a public forum. The&para;<br>Pinette plurality would have rejected the idea that “a&para;<br>neutrally behaving government” can ever endorse “private&para;<br>religious expression,” id., at 764, even if a reasonable&para;<br>observer would perceive government endorsement, id., at&para;<br>768. But the Pinette plurality acknowledged that govern­&para;<br>ment favoritism of private religious speech is unconstitu­&para;<br>tional, as when a government “giv[es] sectarian religious&para;<br>speech preferential access to a forum close to the seat of&para;<br>government (or anywhere else for that matter).” Id., at&para;<br>766. And in this case, the Government is not acting neu­&para;<br>trally: The transfer statute and the government actions&para;<br>preceding it have all favored the cross.&para;<br>Furthermore, even assuming (wrongly) that the cross&para;<br>would be purely private speech after the transfer, and&para;<br>even assuming (quite implausibly) that the transfer stat­&para;<br>ute is neutral with respect to the cross, it would still be&para;<br>appropriate for the District Court to apply the reasonable&para;<br>observer standard. The majority of the Pinette Court&para;<br>rejected the per se rule proposed by the plurality. Instead,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the relevant standard provides that the Establishment&para;<br>Clause is violated whenever “the State’s own actions . . . ,&para;<br>and their relationship to the private speech at issue, actu&para;<br>ally convey a message of endorsement.” Id., at 777&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg­&para;<br>ment). Moreover, the Establishment Clause “imposes&para;<br>affirmative obligations that may require a State, in some&para;<br>situations, to take steps to avoid being perceived as sup­&para;<br>porting or endorsing a private religious message.” Ibid. It&para;<br>is particularly appropriate in this context—when the issue&para;<br>is whether the transfer cures an already identified Estab­&para;<br>lishment Clause violation—for the District Court to con­&para;<br>sider whether the Government, by complying with §8121,&para;<br>would have taken sufficient steps to avoid being perceived&para;<br>as endorsing the cross.&para;<br>As I explained at the outset of this section, the answer&para;<br>to that inquiry is surely no. The reasonable observer “who&para;<br>knows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances sur­&para;<br>rounding the symbol and its placement,” ante, at 17, would&para;<br>perceive that the Government has endorsed the cross: It&para;<br>prohibited the use of federal funds to take down the cross,&para;<br>designated the cross as a national memorial, and engaged&para;<br>in “herculean efforts to preserve the Latin cross” following&para;<br>the District Court’s initial injunction, Buono III, 364&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. Those efforts include a transfer&para;<br>statute designed to keep the cross in place. Changing the&para;<br>ownership status of the underlying land in the manner&para;<br>required by §8121 would not change the fact that the cross&para;<br>conveys a message of government endorsement of religion.&para;<br>Purpose in Enacting the Transfer Statute&para;<br>Even setting aside that the effect of the post-transfer&para;<br>cross would still be to convey a message of government&para;<br>endorsement of religion, the District Court was correct to&para;<br>conclude that §8121 would not cure the Establishment&para;<br>Clause violation because the very purpose of the transfer&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was to preserve the display of the cross. That evident&para;<br>purpose maintains government endorsement of the cross.&para;<br>The plurality does not really contest that this was Con­&para;<br>gress’ purpose, ante, at 11, so I need not review the evi­&para;<br>dence in great detail. Suffice it to say that the record&para;<br>provides ample support. The land-transfer statute author­&para;<br>izes a conveyance to the particular recipient that has&para;<br>expressed an intent to preserve the cross. See Brief for&para;<br>Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 4 (transfer recipient “intends to maintain&para;<br>and preserve the Veterans Memorial”); id., at 7 (identify­&para;<br>ing Veterans Memorial as the “cross and plaque”). And it&para;<br>conveys the particular land that has already been desig­&para;<br>nated “as a national memorial” commemorating the veter­&para;<br>ans of World War I, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100, subject to a&para;<br>reversionary clause requiring that a memorial “commemo­&para;<br>rating United States participation in World War I and&para;<br>honoring the American veterans of that war” be main­&para;<br>tained, §8121(e). If it does not categorically require the&para;<br>new owner of the property to display the existing memo­&para;<br>rial meeting that description (the cross), see §8137, 115&para;<br>Stat. 2278, the statute most certainly encourages this&para;<br>result. Indeed, the Government concedes that Congress&para;<br>sought to “preserve a longstanding war memorial” at the&para;<br>site, Brief for Petitioners 28 (emphasis added), and the&para;<br>only memorial that could be “preserved” at Sunrise Rock is&para;<br>the cross itself.&para;<br>The plurality insists, however, that even assuming the&para;<br>purpose of the land transfer was to preserve the display of&para;<br>the cross, enjoining the transfer was not necessarily ap­&para;<br>propriate. It contends the District Court failed to give&para;<br>adequate consideration to “the context in which the [land­&para;<br>transfer] statute was enacted and the reasons for its pas­&para;<br>sage,” ante, at 11, and it directs the District Court’s atten­&para;<br>tion to three factors: the message intended by the private&para;<br>citizens who first erected the cross, ibid.; the time the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The&para;<br>District Court, in its enforcement decision, had no occasion&para;<br>to consider anew either the private message intended by&para;<br>those who erected the cross or how long the cross had&para;<br>stood atop Sunrise Rock. Neither of these factors consti­&para;<br>tuted a novel or changed circumstance since the entry of&para;<br>the 2002 injunction. Whatever message those who ini­&para;<br>tially erected the cross intended—and I think we have to&para;<br>presume it was a Christian one, at least in part, for the&para;<br>simple reason that those who erected the cross chose to&para;<br>commemorate American veterans in an explicitly Chris­&para;<br>tian manner—that historical fact did not change between&para;<br>2002 and 2005. I grant that the amount of time the cross&para;<br>had stood on Sunrise Rock did change, from 68 years to 71&para;<br>years, but no one can seriously maintain that “the histori­&para;<br>cal meaning that the cross had attained,” ante, at 12, was&para;<br>materially transformed in that 3-year increment.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 I also disagree with the plurality’s factual premise that “the cross&para;<br>and the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public&para;<br>consciousness” in a secular manner, ante, at 11–12. Although some&para;<br>members of the community knew that the cross had been originally&para;<br>erected as a war memorial, there is no support in the record for the idea&para;<br>that members of the public “gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay&para;<br>their respects,” ibid., to the fallen of World War I or any other veterans.&para;<br>The study conducted by a National Park Service historian indicates&para;<br>that a group of veterans gathered at the cross as early as 1935 for&para;<br>Easter sunrise services.

See Buono III, 364 F.

It was entirely appropriate for&para;<br>the District Court to characterize a transfer with the&para;<br>purpose of preserving the cross as an attempt to evade&para;<br>that injunction, and to find that the Government’s purpose&para;<br>to preserve the cross maintains government endorsement&para;<br>of the cross.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>faded but locals were “inspired . . . to reinstate the Easter sunrise&para;<br>services” at the cross.

County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 601, n. 51 (“Nor can the display of&para;<br>the crèche be justified as an ‘accommodation’ of religion. . . .

As I have al­&para;<br>ready explained, the meaning of the cross (complex or&para;<br>otherwise) is no longer before us, and the plurality’s reli­&para;<br>ance on a “congressional statement of policy,” ibid., as&para;<br>negating any government endorsement of religion finds no&para;<br>support in logic or precedent. The cross cannot take on a&para;<br>nonsectarian character by congressional (or judicial) fiat,&para;<br>and the plurality’s evaluation of Congress’ actions is di­&para;<br>vorced from the methodology prescribed by our doctrine.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 JUSTICE ALITO similarly affords great weight to Congress’ purported&para;<br>interest in “avoiding the disturbing symbolism associated with the&para;<br>destruction of the historic monument.” Ante, at 5 (opinion concurring&para;<br>in part and concurring in judgment).

Instead, the plurality insists&para;<br>that deference is owed because of “Congress’s prerogative&para;<br>to balance opposing interests and its institutional compe­&para;<br>tence to do so.” Ante, at 13.&para;<br>The proper remedy for an Establishment Clause viola­&para;<br>tion is a legal judgment, which is not the sort of issue for&para;<br>which Congress “ ‘has both wisdom and experience . . . that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>been adjudged in this case and is now beyond question, a plaintiff must&para;<br>be afforded a complete remedy.

But it does not follow that the&para;<br>government can decline to cure an Establishment Clause violation in&para;<br>order to avoid offense.

It is odd that the plurality&para;<br>ignores all of these well-settled principles in exalting this&para;<br>particular legislative determination.&para;<br>A reasonable observer, considering the nature of this&para;<br>symbol, the timing and the substance of Congress’ efforts,&para;<br>and the history of the Sunrise Rock site, could conclude&para;<br>that Congress chose to preserve the cross primarily be­&para;<br>cause of its salience as a cross.

Because the transfer would perpetuate&para;<br>the Establishment Clause violation at issue in the 2002&para;<br>injunction, I further conclude that enjoining the transfer&para;<br>was necessary to secure relief. Given the transfer stat­&para;<br>ute’s fundamental inadequacy as a remedy, there was—&para;<br>and is—no need for the District Court to consider “less&para;<br>drastic relief than complete invalidation of the . . . stat­&para;<br>ute.” Ante, at 18. Allowing the transfer to go forward&para;<br>would interfere with the District Court’s authority to&para;<br>enforce its judgment and deprive the District Court of the&para;<br>ability to ensure a complete remedy. Nor could allowing&para;<br>the transfer to go forward be made a complete remedy&para;<br>with add-on measures, such as signs or fences indicating&para;<br>the ownership of the land. Such measures would not&para;<br>completely end the government endorsement of this cross,&para;<br>as the land would have been transferred in a manner&para;<br>favoring the cross and the cross would remain designated&para;<br>as a national memorial. Enjoining compliance with §8121&para;<br>was therefore a proper exercise of the District Court’s&para;<br>authority to enforce the 2002 judgment.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Congressional action, taken after due deliberation, that&para;<br>honors our fallen soldiers merits our highest respect. As&para;<br>far as I can tell, however, it is unprecedented in the Na­&para;<br>tion’s history to designate a bare, unadorned cross as the&para;<br>national war memorial for a particular group of veterans.&para;<br>Neither the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam War&para;<br>Memorial, nor the World War II Memorial commemorates&para;<br>our veterans’ sacrifice in sectarian or predominantly reli­&para;<br>gious ways.

And because Congress has established no other&para;<br>national monument to the veterans of the Great War, this&para;<br>solitary cross in the middle of the desert is the national&para;<br>World War I memorial. The sequence of legislative deci­&para;<br>sions made to designate and preserve a solitary Latin&para;<br>cross at an isolated location in the desert as a memorial&para;<br>for those who fought and died in World War I not only&para;<br>failed to cure the Establishment Clause violation but also,&para;<br>in my view, resulted in a dramatically inadequate and&para;<br>inappropriate tribute.&para;<br>I believe that most judges would find it to be a clear&para;<br>Establishment Clause violation if Congress had simply&para;<br>directed that a solitary Latin cross be erected on the Mall&para;<br>in the Nation’s Capital to serve as a World War I Memo­&para;<br>rial. Congress did not erect this cross, but it commanded&para;<br>that the cross remain in place, and it gave the cross the&para;<br>imprimatur of Government.

The Government did not ask the District Court to&para;<br>modify it. In fact, the Government did not ask the District&para;<br>Court for any relief at all. Rather, it was the plaintiff who&para;<br>asked the District Court either (1) to “ ‘hold that the [land]&para;<br>transfer violates the current injunction,’ ” or (2) to “ ‘modify&para;<br>that injunction to prohibit the land transfer because it&para;<br>violates the Establishment Clause.’ ” 364 F.

The District Court did&para;<br>the former, i.e., it interpreted the injunction as prohibiting&para;<br>the Government from transferring the land for purposes of&para;<br>displaying the cross. And having granted the plaintiff’s&para;<br>request to enforce the injunction, it dismissed the plain&para;<br>tiff’s alternative request to modify the injunction as moot.&para;<br>Thus, as I said at the outset, the only question before us&para;<br>is whether the law permits the District Court to hold that&para;<br>the land transfer (presumably along with the subsequent&para;<br>public display of the cross) falls within the scope of its&para;<br>original injunctive order, an order that says the Govern&para;<br>ment must not “permi[t] the display of the Latin cross in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

In my view the law authorizes the Dis&para;<br>trict Court to do so.&para;<br>The legal principles that answer the question presented&para;<br>are found not in the Constitution but in cases that concern&para;<br>the law of injunctions. First, the law of injunctions grants&para;<br>a district court considerable leeway to interpret the mean&para;<br>ing and application of its own injunctive order. Members&para;<br>of this Court have written that the “construction given to”&para;<br>an “injunction by the issuing judge . . . is entitled to great&para;<br>weight.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S.&para;<br>753, 795 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part&para;<br>and dissenting in part). And the Courts of Appeals have&para;<br>consistently held that district courts have considerable&para;<br>discretion in interpreting and applying their own injunc&para;<br>tive decrees. See, e.g., JTH Tax, Inc. v. H &amp; R Block East&para;<br>ern Tax Servs., Inc., 359 F. 3d 699, 705 (CA4 2004); Ala&para;<br>bama Nursing Home Assn v. Harris, 617 F. 2d 385, 388&para;<br>(CA5 1980). This principle is longstanding and well estab&para;<br>lished, as reflected in a prominent treatise writer’s sum&para;<br>mary of the case law: “The court granting the injunction is&para;<br>necessarily invested with large discretion in enforcing&para;<br>obedience to its mandate, and . . . courts of appellate&para;<br>powers are exceedingly averse to interfering with the&para;<br>exercise of such judgment and discretion.” 2 J. High, Law&para;<br>of Injunctions §1458, pp. 1467–1468 (4th ed. 1905).&para;<br>Second, a court should construe the scope of an injunc&para;<br>tion in light of its purpose and history, in other words,&para;<br>“what the decree was really designed to accomplish.”&para;<br>Mayor of Vicksburg v. Henson, 231 U. S. 259, 273 (1913).&para;<br>Courts have long looked to “the objects for which the&para;<br>[injunctive] relief was granted, as well as the circum&para;<br>stances attending it,” in deciding whether an enjoined&para;<br>party has complied with an injunction. 2 High, supra,&para;<br>§1446, at 1455, and n. 68 (citing cases); see also John B.&para;<br>Stetson Co. v. Stephen L. Stetson Co., 128 F. 2d 981, 983&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(CA2 1942). And they have long refused to “permit defen&para;<br>dants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction,&para;<br>by doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms&para;<br>a violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing&para;<br>substantially that which they were enjoined from doing.”&para;<br>Stodder v. Rosen Talking Mach. Co., 247 Mass. 60, 68, 141&para;<br>N. E. 569, 571 (1923).&para;<br>These two principles adequately support the District&para;<br>Court’s interpretation and application of the injunctive&para;<br>language at issue here. As an initial matter, the plain text&para;<br>of the injunction is reasonably read to prohibit the trans&para;<br>fer. Right now, the cross is covered with a plywood box;&para;<br>after the transfer, the box will be removed and the cross&para;<br>will be displayed. The transfer thus “permits” the public&para;<br>“display” of the cross. Indeed, that is the statute’s&para;<br>objective.&para;<br>Consideration of the injunction’s purpose points in the&para;<br>same direction. The injunction rested upon the District&para;<br>Court’s determination that the display of the cross “con&para;<br>veys a message of endorsement of religion” to “a reason&para;<br>able observer” in violation of the Establishment Clause.&para;<br>212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1216–1217. (As I have said, for pre&para;<br>sent purposes we must assume that this is so.) The pur&para;<br>pose of the injunction is to prevent the conveyance of such&para;<br>a message to the reasonable observer.&para;<br>With that purpose in mind, consider the following facts&para;<br>that confronted the District Court when the plaintiff asked&para;<br>it to enforce the decree:&para;<br>•	 The Government had designated the “white cross&para;<br>. . . as well as a limited amount of adjoining [land]”&para;<br>as a national memorial. Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a),&para;<br>115 Stat. 2278–2279.&para;<br>•	 The new statute directed the transfer of the “prop&para;<br>erty . . . designated . . . as a national memorial” to a&para;<br>private entity with an interest in maintaining the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>cross in its current location, in exchange for a par&para;<br>cel of land located elsewhere in the Preserve owned&para;<br>by private individuals who have taken a similar in&para;<br>terest in the cross. Pub. L. 108–87, §§8121(a) and&para;<br>(b), 117 Stat. 1100.&para;<br>•	 The transfer was made “subject to the condition&para;<br>that the recipient maintain the conveyed property&para;<br>as a memorial,” and the property reverts to the&para;<br>United States if the Secretary determines that the&para;<br>recipient has failed to do so. §8121(e), id., at 1100.&para;<br>•	 After the transfer, the cross would sit on 1 acre of&para;<br>privately owned land in a 1.6 million acre national&para;<br>preserve, over 90% of which is federally owned.&para;<br>212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1205.&para;<br>•	 Congress had previously prevented the use of fed&para;<br>eral funds to remove the cross from its present lo&para;<br>cation. Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551;&para;<br>Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230.&para;<br>The District Court considered the facts before it through&para;<br>the lens of the injunction’s original purpose. See 364&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1180 (explaining that the “[G]overnment’s&para;<br>continuing control over the Latin cross” and the involve&para;<br>ment of private parties who “desir[e] its continued pres&para;<br>ence in the Preserve,” “demonstrat[e]” that the transfer&para;<br>would not end “the [G]overnment’s apparent endorsement&para;<br>of a particular religion”); id., at 1182 (considering the&para;<br>historical context of the transfer statute); see also Buono&para;<br>v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783 (CA9 2008) (“carving&para;<br>out a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Pre&para;<br>serve . . . will do nothing to minimize the impermissible&para;<br>governmental endorsement” perceived by the reasonable&para;<br>observer). And it concluded that the land transfer would&para;<br>frustrate that purpose. See 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (the&para;<br>transfer would “keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise Rock&para;<br>without actually curing the continuing Establishment&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. BUONO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Clause violation”); see also 527 F. 3d, at 783 (finding that&para;<br>“[n]othing in the present posture of the case alters . . .&para;<br>earlier conclusions” regarding what a reasonable observer&para;<br>would perceive).&para;<br>In my view, this is a reasonable&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>The injunction forbids the Government to permit the&para;<br>display of the cross on Sunrise Rock, and its basic purpose&para;<br>was to prevent a reasonable observer from believing that&para;<br>the Government had endorsed the cross. Under the cir&para;<br>cumstances presented to the District Court, the transfer&para;<br>would have resulted in such a display and might well have&para;<br>conveyed such a message. Consequently, the District&para;<br>Court’s decision that the land transfer violated the injunc&para;<br>tion as written and intended was not an abuse of discre&para;<br>tion. And that is what the Ninth Circuit properly held on&para;<br>appeal. What the Establishment Clause implications of&para;<br>the changed circumstances may be is a matter not before&para;<br>us. Cf. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 442 (2004) (“If&para;<br>the [enjoined defendant] establishes reason to modify the&para;<br>decree, the court should make the necessary changes;&para;<br>where it has not done so, however, the decree should be&para;<br>enforced according to its terms”).&para;<br>Because my conclusion rests primarily upon the law of&para;<br>injunctions, because that law is fairly clear, and because&para;<br>we cannot properly reach beyond that law to consider the&para;<br>underlying Establishment Clause and standing questions,&para;<br>I can find no federal question of general significance in&para;<br>this case. I believe we should not have granted the peti&para;<br>tion for certiorari. Having granted it, the Court should&para;<br>now dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Since the&para;<br>Court has not done so, however, I believe that we should&para;<br>simply affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.&para;<br>With respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
