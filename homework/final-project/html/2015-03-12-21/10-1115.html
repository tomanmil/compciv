Decided October 31, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM. &para;<br>&para;<br>The opinion of the Court in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 &para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 307 (1979), makes clear that it is the responsibility of&para;<br>the jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should&para;<br>be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing&para;<br>court may set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground of&para;<br>insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could&para;<br>have agreed with the jury. What is more, a federal court&para;<br>may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal&para;<br>court instead may do so only if the state court decision&para;<br>was “objectively unreasonable.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Because rational people can sometimes disagree, the&para;<br>inevitable consequence of this settled law is that judges&para;<br>will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to&para;<br>be mistaken, but that they must nonetheless uphold. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals in this case substituted its judgment for&para;<br>that of a California jury on the question whether the&para;<br>prosecution’s or the defense’s expert witnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death. For this reason,&para;<br>certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals is reversed.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>This case concerns the death of 7-week-old Etzel Glass.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CAVAZOS v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>On November 29, 1996, Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, put&para;<br>Etzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in&para;<br>another room. Respondent Shirley Ree Smith—Tomeka’s&para;<br>mother—slept on the floor next to Etzel. Several hours later,&para;<br>Smith ran into Tomeka’s room, holding Etzel, who was&para;<br>limp, and told her that “[s]omething [was] wrong with&para;<br>Etzel.” Tr. 416. By the time emergency officials arrived,&para;<br>Etzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat. Smith&para;<br>reported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa.&para;<br>The officials’ efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed.&para;<br>Doctors initially attributed Etzel’s death to sudden&para;<br>infant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis&para;<br>when an infant shows no outward signs of trauma. But&para;<br>after an autopsy, the coroner concluded that the cause of&para;<br>death was instead shaken baby syndrome (SBS). When a&para;<br>social worker informed Smith of that finding, Smith told&para;<br>her that Etzel had not responded to her touch while sleeping, so she had picked him up and given him “a little&para;<br>shake, a jostle” to wake him. Id., at 842. According to the&para;<br>social worker, Smith then said something to the effect of,&para;<br>“Oh, my God. Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.” Id.,&para;<br>at 847 (internal quotation marks omitted). In an interview with the police a few days later, Smith said that she&para;<br>had shaken Etzel, but then she corrected herself and said&para;<br>that she had twisted him to try to elicit a reaction. Smith&para;<br>was arrested and charged with assault on a child resulting&para;<br>in death. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §273ab (West 2008)&para;<br>(“Any person who, having the care or custody of a child&para;<br>who is under eight years of age, assaults the child by&para;<br>means of force that to a reasonable person would be likely&para;<br>to produce great bodily injury, resulting in the child’s&para;<br>death, shall be punished by imprisonment . . .”).&para;<br>At trial, the jury heard seven days of expert medical&para;<br>testimony on the cause of Etzel’s death. The prosecution&para;<br>offered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzel’s&para;<br>death was the result of SBS—not SIDS, as the defense&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>contended. The first expert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was&para;<br>the medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner&para;<br>who had supervised Etzel’s autopsy. Dr. Carpenter is&para;<br>board certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical pathology. He testified that Etzel’s autopsy revealed recent hemorrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and&para;<br>other features of Etzel’s pathology, including a bruise and&para;<br>abrasion on the lower back of the baby’s head, were consistent with violent shaking. Dr. Carpenter identified two&para;<br>means by which shaking can result in a baby’s death: The&para;<br>first is that the shaking causes blood vessels in the brain&para;<br>to tear, creating a pool of blood that pushes the brain&para;<br>downward into the spinal canal, resulting in death but&para;<br>little direct damage to the brain. The second is that the&para;<br>shaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly&para;<br>tears in vital areas, causing death with very little bleeding. Dr. Carpenter testified that Etzel’s injuries were&para;<br>consistent with the latter pathology. He also explained&para;<br>that the injuries could not be attributed to either a fall&para;<br>from the sofa or the administration of cardiopulmonary&para;<br>resuscitation. Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was it&para;<br>possible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of&para;<br>internal trauma. Dr. Carpenter did testify, however, that&para;<br>while SBS victims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging,&para;<br>Etzel’s autopsy revealed no such injury.&para;<br>The prosecution’s second expert, Dr. Stephanie Erlich,&para;<br>was the associate deputy medical examiner who actually&para;<br>performed Etzel’s autopsy. She is board certified in anatomic pathology and neuropathology. She corroborated&para;<br>Dr. Carpenter’s testimony about the autopsy findings, and&para;<br>added that a followup neuropathological examination of&para;<br>Etzel’s brain confirmed the existence of recent hemorrhaging. Noting only a minimal amount of new blood in Etzel’s&para;<br>brain, she testified that the cause of death was direct&para;<br>trauma to the brainstem. On cross-examination, she&para;<br>agreed with defense counsel that retinal hemorrhaging&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CAVAZOS v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>(absent in Etzel’s case) is present in 75 to 80 percent of&para;<br>SBS cases.&para;<br>The third prosecution expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is&para;<br>board certified in pediatrics and the author of articles on&para;<br>childhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that&para;<br>Etzel’s injuries were consistent with SBS and that old&para;<br>trauma could not have been the cause of the child’s death.&para;<br>The defense called two experts to dispute these conclusions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified&para;<br>that Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the&para;<br>result of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He&para;<br>admitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence&para;<br>of retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS.&para;<br>He also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause&para;<br>of Etzel’s death was SIDS. According to Dr. Siegler,&para;<br>Etzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the&para;<br>basis of studying photographs of the neuropathological&para;<br>examination.&para;<br>The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr.&para;<br>William Goldie, testified that Etzel’s death was due to&para;<br>SIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a&para;<br>heart murmur, and low birth weight—making him more&para;<br>susceptible to SIDS. Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists&para;<br>had not been able to determine the cause of Etzel’s death&para;<br>and that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts.&para;<br>The jury found Smith guilty. Concluding that the jury&para;<br>“carefully weighed” the “tremendous amount of evidence”&para;<br>supporting the verdict, Tr. 1649, the trial judge denied&para;<br>Smith’s motion for a new trial and sentenced her to an&para;<br>indeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison.&para;<br>On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence&para;<br>was not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS.&para;<br>After thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testimony, the California Court of Appeal rejected this claim,&para;<br>concluding:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>“The expert opinion evidence we have summarized&para;<br>was conflicting. It was for the jury to resolve the conflicts. The credited evidence was substantial and sufficient to support the jury’s conclusions that Etzel died&para;<br>from shaken baby syndrome. The conviction is supported by substantial evidence.” People v. Smith, No.&para;<br>B118869 (Feb. 10, 2000), App. K to Pet. for Cert. 86.&para;<br>The California Supreme Court denied review. App. J, id.,&para;<br>at 74.&para;<br>Smith then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus&para;<br>with the United States District Court for the Central&para;<br>District of California, renewing her claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Etzel died of SBS.&para;<br>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act&para;<br>of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, that court had no power&para;<br>to afford relief unless Smith could show either that the&para;<br>California Court of Appeal’s decision affirming the conviction “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,” clearly established federal law as reflected in&para;<br>the holdings of this Court’s cases, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1),&para;<br>or that it “was based on an unreasonable determination of&para;<br>the facts” in light of the state court record, §2254(d)(2).&para;<br>Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 10).&para;<br>The Magistrate Judge to whom the case was assigned&para;<br>issued a report acknowledging that “[t]his is not the typical shaken baby case” and that the evidence against Smith&para;<br>“raises many questions.” App. I to Pet. for Cert. 65. But&para;<br>the Magistrate Judge nevertheless concluded that the&para;<br>evidence was “clearly sufficient to support a conviction.”&para;<br>Ibid. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s&para;<br>report and denied the petition. App. G, id., at 52.&para;<br>On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with instructions&para;<br>to grant the writ. Smith v. Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884 (2006).&para;<br>Despite the plentitude of expert testimony in the trial&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CAVAZOS v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>record concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of the&para;<br>brainstem was the cause of Etzel’s death, the Ninth Circuit determined that there was “no evidence to permit an&para;<br>expert conclusion one way or the other” on that question&para;<br>because there was “no physical evidence of . . . tearing or&para;<br>shearing, and no other evidence supporting death by&para;<br>violent shaking.” Id., at 890. The court said that the&para;<br>State’s experts “reached [their] conclusion because there&para;<br>was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death.”&para;<br>Ibid. (emphasis in original). The court concluded that&para;<br>because “[a]bsence of evidence cannot constitute proof&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt,” ibid., the California Court of&para;<br>Appeal had “unreasonably applied” this Court’s opinion in&para;<br>Jackson v. Virginia in upholding Smith’s conviction, 437&para;<br>F. 3d, at 890.&para;<br>That conclusion was plainly wrong. Jackson says that&para;<br>evidence is sufficient to support a conviction so long as&para;<br>“after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to&para;<br>the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found&para;<br>the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt.” 443 U. S., at 319. It also unambiguously instructs&para;<br>that a reviewing court “faced with a record of historical&para;<br>facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume—&para;<br>even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record—that&para;<br>the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the&para;<br>prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.” Id., at&para;<br>326. When the deference to state court decisions required&para;<br>by §2254(d) is applied to the state court’s already deferential review, see Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),&para;<br>there can be no doubt of the Ninth Circuit’s error below.&para;<br>The jury was presented with competing views of how&para;<br>Etzel died. It was made aware of the various experts’&para;<br>qualifications and their familiarity with both the subject&para;<br>of SBS and the physical condition of Etzel’s body. It observed the attorneys for each party cross-examine the&para;<br>experts and elicit concessions from them. The State’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>experts, whom the jury was entitled to believe, opined that&para;<br>the physical evidence was consistent with, and best explained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem&para;<br>caused by shaking. The Ninth Circuit’s assertion that&para;<br>these experts “reached [their] conclusion because there&para;<br>was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death” is&para;<br>simply false. There was “evidence in the brain itself.” The&para;<br>autopsy revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel’s&para;<br>brain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging,&para;<br>hemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence&para;<br>of a blood clot between the brain’s hemispheres. The&para;<br>autopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower&para;<br>back of Etzel’s head. These affirmative indications of&para;<br>trauma formed the basis of the experts’ opinion that Etzel&para;<br>died from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore.&para;<br>Defense counsel made certain that the jury understood&para;<br>that the prosecution’s experts were unable to identify the&para;<br>precise point of tearing itself. But as Judge Bea noted in&para;<br>his dissent from the Ninth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en&para;<br>banc, the experts explained why the location of the tear&para;<br>was undetectable: “Etzel’s death happened so quickly that&para;<br>the effects of the trauma did not have time to develop.”&para;<br>Smith v. Mitchell, 453 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (2006). According&para;<br>to the prosecutions’ experts, there was simply no opportunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before&para;<br>Etzel died.&para;<br>In light of the evidence presented at trial, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit plainly erred in concluding that the jury’s verdict was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for&para;<br>the California Court of Appeal to think otherwise. See&para;<br>§2254(d). Doubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are&para;<br>understandable. But it is not the job of this Court, and&para;<br>was not that of the Ninth Circuit, to decide whether the&para;<br>State’s theory was correct. The jury decided that question,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CAVAZOS v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>and its decision is supported by the record.*&para;<br>It is said that Smith, who already has served years in&para;<br>prison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no&para;<br>danger to society. These or other considerations perhaps&para;<br>would be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted&para;<br>to executive authorities to help ensure that justice is&para;<br>tempered by mercy. It is not clear to the Court whether&para;<br>this process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has&para;<br>been. It is not for the Judicial Branch to determine the&para;<br>standards for this discretion. If the clemency power is&para;<br>exercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that&para;<br>calls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.&para;<br>The decision below cannot be allowed to stand. This&para;<br>Court vacated and remanded this judgment twice before,&para;<br>calling the panel’s attention to this Court’s opinions highlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in&para;<br>§2254(d) habeas cases. Each time the panel persisted in&para;<br>its course, reinstating its judgment without seriously&para;<br>confronting the significance of the cases called to its attention. See Patrick v. Smith, 550 U. S. 915 (vacating and&para;<br>remanding in light of Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70&para;<br>(2006)), reinstated on remand, 508 F. 3d 1256 (2007)&para;<br>(per curiam); 558 U. S. ___ (2010) (vacating and remanding in light of McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U. S. ___ (2010) (per&para;<br>curiam)), reinstated on remand sub nom. Smith v. Mitchell, 624 F. 3d 1235 (2010) (per curiam). Its refusal to do so&para;<br>necessitates this Court’s action today.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The dissent’s review of the evidence presented to the jury over seven&para;<br>days is precisely the sort of reweighing of facts that is precluded by&para;<br>Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979), and precisely the sort of&para;<br>second-guessing of a state court decision applying Jackson that is&para;<br>precluded by AEDPA, §2254(d). The dissent’s views on how “adamantly” experts would testify today as opposed to at the time of trial, post, at&para;<br>6 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.), are of course pure speculation, as would be&para;<br>any views on how a jury would react to less adamant testimony.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

He observed, however, that the evidence, “though&para;<br>clearly sufficient to support a conviction, raises many&para;<br>questions”:&para;<br>“Grandmothers, especially those not serving as the&para;<br>primary caretakers, are not the typical perpetrators&para;<br>[in shaken baby cases]. Further, [Smith] was helping&para;<br>her daughter raise her other children (a [4-year-old]&para;<br>and a 14-month-old) and there was no hint of [Smith]&para;<br>abusing or neglecting these other children, who were&para;<br>in the room with Etzel when he died. Still further,&para;<br>there was no evidence of any precipitating event that&para;<br>might have caused [Smith] to snap and assault her&para;<br>grandson. She was not trapped in a hopeless situa­&para;<br>tion with a child she did not want or love. Nor was&para;<br>she forced to single-handedly care for a baby that had&para;<br>been crying all day and all night. In fact, there is no&para;<br>evidence that Etzel was doing anything other than&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CAVAZOS v. SMITH&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sleeping the night he died. In addition, [Smith’s]&para;<br>daughter [Tomeka], Etzel’s mother, was in the room&para;<br>next door when Etzel died. The medical evidence was&para;<br>not typical either, in that some of the telltale signs&para;<br>usually found in shaken baby cases did not exist in&para;<br>this case.” Smith v. Mitchell, Case No. CV 01–4484–&para;<br>ABC (CD Cal., Mar. 22, 2004), p. 10, App. I to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 65.&para;<br>The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s rec­&para;<br>ommendation to deny Smith’s petition, but granted a&para;<br>certificate of appealability, recognizing that “reasonable&para;<br>jurists would find the [court’s] assessment of [Smith’s]&para;<br>claims debatable.” Order in No. CV 01–4484–ABC (CD&para;<br>Cal., Apr. 29, 2004), Doc. 36, p. 1.&para;<br>After full briefing and argument, the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>reversed the District Court’s judgment. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals acknowledged the limitations on its authority.&para;<br>“We approach this case,” the court said, “with a firm&para;<br>awareness of the very strict limits that the [Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)] places&para;<br>on our collateral review of state criminal convictions.”&para;<br>Smith v. Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884, 888–889 (CA9 2006).&para;<br>Accurately describing the standards applicable under&para;<br>AEDPA and Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), and&para;<br>reviewing the evidence in some detail, the court concluded&para;<br>that “[i]n this most unusual case,. . . the [California] Court&para;<br>of Appeal unreasonably applied Jackson.” 437 F. 3d, at&para;<br>889.&para;<br>Beyond question, the Court today reviews a case as&para;<br>tragic as it is extraordinary and fact intensive. By taking&para;<br>up the case, one may ask, what does the Court achieve&para;<br>other than to prolong Smith’s suffering and her separation&para;<br>from her family. Is this Court’s intervention really neces­&para;<br>sary? Our routine practice counsels no.&para;<br>Error correction is “outside the mainstream of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice&para;<br>§5.12(c)(3), p. 351 (9th ed. 2007). As this Court’s Rule 10&para;<br>informs, “[a] petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely&para;<br>granted when the asserted error [is] . . . the misapplication&para;<br>of a properly stated rule of law.” The Ninth Circuit cor­&para;<br>rectly described the relevant legal rules under AEDPA and&para;<br>Jackson v. Virginia. This Court, therefore, has no law­&para;<br>clarifying role to play. Its summary adjudication seems to&para;<br>me all the more untoward for these reasons: What is now&para;<br>known about shaken baby syndrome (SBS) casts grave&para;<br>doubt on the charge leveled against Smith; and uncontra­&para;<br>dicted evidence shows that she poses no danger whatever&para;<br>to her family or anyone else in society.&para;<br>I turn first to the medical evidence presented at trial.&para;<br>Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervisor, testified that the&para;<br>following symptoms are consistent with, but not required&para;<br>for, a diagnosis of SBS: cerebral edema, subdural hemor­&para;<br>rhage, retinal hemorrhage, bleeding at the joints of the&para;<br>back of the neck, bruises on the arms, fractures of the ribs,&para;<br>and internal injuries to the buttocks, abdominal organs,&para;<br>and chest organs. Tr. 575. Few of these signs of SBS were&para;<br>present here. Etzel’s subdural hemorrhage and subarach­&para;<br>noid hemorrhage were “minimal,” insufficient to cause&para;<br>death. Id., at 540–541, 557–558, 675, 693, 700, 729, 1484–&para;<br>1485. There was no brain swelling and no retinal hemor­&para;<br>rhage in either eye. Id., at 580, 693, 802, 1274.1 Similarly&para;<br>absent were any fractures, sprains, bleeding in the joints,&para;<br>or displacement of joints. Id., at 682. A “tiny” abrasion on&para;<br>the skin and a corresponding bruise under the scalp did&para;<br>not produce brain trauma. Id., at 555, 562, 576, 712–713.&para;<br>These findings led Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervi­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The State’s third expert, Dr. Chadwick, who was not present at&para;<br>Etzel’s autopsy, testified that there may have been some swelling. But&para;<br>he conceded that any swelling could not have caused death. Tr. 1478.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CAVAZOS v. SMITH&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sor, and Dr. Erlich, who performed Etzel’s autopsy, to rule&para;<br>out two commonly proffered causes of death in SBS cases:&para;<br>massive bleeding and massive swelling that create pres­&para;<br>sure and push the brain downward. Id., at 541, 551–552,&para;<br>729–730, 801. Instead, they opined, Etzel’s death was&para;<br>caused by direct injury—shearing or tearing of the brain­&para;<br>stem or the brain itself. Id., at 694–696, 729–730, 801,&para;<br>1298. The autopsy revealed no physical evidence of such&para;<br>injury, either grossly or microscopically. Id., at 730, 763,&para;<br>803–804, 1298–1299. Dr. Carpenter was unable to state&para;<br>which particular areas of the brain were injured, and the&para;<br>neuropathologist found no evidence of specific brain inju­&para;<br>ry. Id., at 696, 1475. No doctor located any tear. Indeed,&para;<br>the examining physicians did not cut open Etzel’s brain­&para;<br>stem, or submit it to neuropathology, because, in their own&para;<br>estimation, “[w]e wouldn’t have seen anything anyway.”&para;<br>Id., at 803, 1299.2&para;<br>Neither doctor testified to ever having performed an&para;<br>autopsy on an infant in which a similar conclusion was&para;<br>reached.

Id., at&para;<br>576–577, 660–661. Smith’s conviction thus turned on, as&para;<br>Dr. Erlich put it, “direct trauma which we don’t see to the&para;<br>brainstem.” Id., at 801.

Instead, the evidence&para;<br>indicated that Smith was warm hearted, sensitive, and&para;<br>gentle. Tr. 1086. As earlier observed, see supra, at 1, the&para;<br>Magistrate Judge noted the absence of any motive or&para;<br>precipitating event that might have led Smith to shake&para;<br>Etzel violently. Although shaking may quiet a crying&para;<br>child, Tr. 601, no evidence showed that Etzel was crying in&para;<br>the hours before he died, id., at 444. To the contrary: Any&para;<br>loud crying likely would have woken Etzel’s siblings,&para;<br>Yondale, age 14 months, and Yolanda, age 4, asleep only&para;<br>feet away, even Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, asleep in the&para;<br>neighboring room. Id., at 335, 358–361. Yet no one’s&para;<br>slumber was disturbed. Id., at 358–361.&para;<br>The prosecution relied on the testimony of a social&para;<br>worker, who asserted that Smith, after hearing that the&para;<br>cause of Etzel’s death had been changed from Sudden&para;<br>Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) to shaken baby syndrome,&para;<br>id., at 840, and after stating that she had given Etzel “a&para;<br>little shake, a jostle to awaken him” when she found him&para;<br>unresponsive, asked “something like ‘Oh, my God. Did I&para;<br>do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.’ ” Id., at 842, 847.3 Etzel’s&para;<br>mother, Tomeka, contradicted this account. According to&para;<br>Tomeka, after the social worker accused Smith of killing&para;<br>Etzel, Smith started crying, id., at 429–430, and respond­&para;<br>ed, “No, I didn’t,” id., at 387. Taking the social worker’s&para;<br>version of events as true, Smith’s distraught and equivocal&para;<br>question fairly cannot be equated to a confession of guilt.&para;<br>Giving a baby “a little shake, a jostle to wake him,” ante,&para;<br>at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted), after finding him&para;<br>unexpectedly unresponsive, surely is not an admission to&para;<br>shaking a child violently, causing his brainstem to tear.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The social worker also testified that Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, told&para;<br>Smith: “If it wasn’t for you this wouldn’t have happened.” Id., at 847.&para;<br>Tomeka denied making any statement to that effect.

SMITH&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Moreover, Smith’s counsel, Ubiwe Eriye,4 represented&para;<br>her poorly at trial. In a case as trying as this one, compe­&para;<br>tent counsel might have persuaded the jury to disbelieve&para;<br>the prosecution’s case. A few examples from the record&para;<br>are illustrative. At the suppression hearing, the presiding&para;<br>judge was so disturbed about Eriye’s preparation for trial&para;<br>that he remarked to the defendant, “Miss Smith, I’m&para;<br>scared.” Tr. A52. Eriye badly misportrayed the burden of&para;<br>proof when he declared, both at the suppression hearing&para;<br>and in his opening remarks, that he would prove, beyond a&para;<br>shadow of a doubt, that Smith was not guilty. Id., at A58–&para;<br>A59, 213. The two experts Eriye called presented testi­&para;<br>mony that hardly meshed.5&para;<br>In sum, this is a notably fact-bound case in which the&para;<br>Court of Appeals unquestionably stated the correct rule of&para;<br>law. It is thus “the type of case in which we are most&para;<br>inclined to deny certiorari.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.&para;<br>419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the&para;<br>Court is bent on rebuking the Ninth Circuit for what it&para;<br>conceives to be defiance of our prior remands. See ante, at&para;<br>8.

The fact­&para;<br>intensive character of the case calls for attentive review of&para;<br>the record, including a trial transcript that runs over&para;<br>1,500 pages.

Id., at 994–995, 1403. In&para;<br>contrast, Dr. Siegler testified that the old blood provided the basis for&para;<br>his conclusion that Etzel died of an earlier brain trauma, id., at 1152–&para;<br>1153, 1166–1167, not SIDS, id., at 1193–1194.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.
