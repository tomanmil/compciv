EQUAL EMPLOYMENT &para;<br>&para;<br>OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–553.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 5, 2011—Decided January 11, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is&para;<br>a member congregation of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.&para;<br>The Synod classifies its school teachers into two categories: “called”&para;<br>and “lay.” “Called” teachers are regarded as having been called to&para;<br>their vocation by God. To be eligible to be considered “called,” a&para;<br>teacher must complete certain academic requirements, including a&para;<br>course of theological study. Once called, a teacher receives the formal&para;<br>title “Minister of Religion, Commissioned.” “Lay” teachers, by contrast, are not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran. Although lay and called teachers at Hosanna-Tabor generally performed the same duties, lay teachers were hired only when&para;<br>called teachers were unavailable.&para;<br>After respondent Cheryl Perich completed the required training,&para;<br>Hosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted the call and was designated a commissioned minister. In addition&para;<br>to teaching secular subjects, Perich taught a religion class, led her&para;<br>students in daily prayer and devotional exercises, and took her students to a weekly school-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel&para;<br>service herself about twice a year.&para;<br>Perich developed narcolepsy and began the 2004–2005 school year&para;<br>on disability leave. In January 2005, she notified the school principal&para;<br>that she would be able to report to work in February. The principal&para;<br>responded that the school had already contracted with a lay teacher&para;<br>to fill Perich’s position for the remainder of the school year. The&para;<br>principal also expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to return to the classroom. The congregation subsequently offered to pay&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v. EEOC &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>a portion of Perich’s health insurance premiums in exchange for her&para;<br>resignation as a called teacher. Perich refused to resign. In February, Perich presented herself at the school and refused to leave until&para;<br>she received written documentation that she had reported to work.&para;<br>The principal later called Perich and told her that she would likely be&para;<br>fired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and intended to assert her legal rights. In a subsequent letter, the chairman of the school board advised Perich that the congregation would&para;<br>consider whether to rescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds&para;<br>for termination, the letter cited Perich’s “insubordination and disruptive behavior,” as well as the damage she had done to her “working&para;<br>relationship” with the school by “threatening to take legal action.”&para;<br>The congregation voted to rescind Perich’s call, and Hosanna-Tabor&para;<br>sent her a letter of termination.&para;<br>Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity&para;<br>Commission, claiming that her employment had been terminated in&para;<br>violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The EEOC brought&para;<br>suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in&para;<br>retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened&para;<br>in the litigation. Invoking what is known as the “ministerial exception,” Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the First&para;<br>Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers. The&para;<br>District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in HosannaTabor’s favor. The Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded. It recognized the existence of a ministerial exception rooted in the First&para;<br>Amendment, but concluded that Perich did not qualify as a “minister”&para;<br>under the exception.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First&para;<br>Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their&para;<br>churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimination laws. Pp. 6–15.&para;<br>(a) The First Amendment provides, in part, that “Congress shall&para;<br>make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting&para;<br>the free exercise thereof.” Familiar with life under the established&para;<br>Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the&para;<br>possibility of a national church. By forbidding the “establishment of&para;<br>religion” and guaranteeing the “free exercise thereof,” the Religion&para;<br>Clauses ensured that the new Federal Government—unlike the English Crown—would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices. Pp. 6–&para;<br>10.&para;<br>(b) This Court first considered the issue of government interference with a church’s ability to select its own ministers in the context&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of disputes over church property. This Court’s decisions in that area&para;<br>confirm that it is impermissible for the government to contradict a&para;<br>church’s determination of who can act as its ministers. See Watson v.&para;<br>Jones, 13 Wall. 679; Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian&para;<br>Orthodox Church in North America, 344 U. S. 94; Serbian Eastern&para;<br>Orthodox Diocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich, 426&para;<br>U. S. 696. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>(c) Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&para;<br>and other employment discrimination laws, the Courts of Appeals&para;<br>have uniformly recognized the existence of a “ministerial exception,”&para;<br>grounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of such&para;<br>legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers. The Court agrees that&para;<br>there is such a ministerial exception. Requiring a church to accept or&para;<br>retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do&para;<br>so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving&para;<br>the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its&para;<br>beliefs. By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the&para;<br>Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group’s right to&para;<br>shape its own faith and mission through its appointments. According&para;<br>the state the power to determine which individuals will minister to&para;<br>the faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits&para;<br>government involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.&para;<br>The EEOC and Perich contend that religious organizations can defend against employment discrimination claims by invoking their&para;<br>First Amendment right to freedom of association. They thus see no&para;<br>need—and no basis—for a special rule for ministers grounded in the&para;<br>Religion Clauses themselves. Their position, however, is hard to&para;<br>square with the text of the First Amendment itself, which gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. The Court&para;<br>cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have&para;<br>nothing to say about a religious organization’s freedom to select its&para;<br>own ministers.&para;<br>The EEOC and Perich also contend that Employment Div., Dept. of&para;<br>Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, precludes recognition of a ministerial exception. But Smith involved government regulation of only outward physical acts. The present case, in contrast,&para;<br>concerns government interference with an internal church decision&para;<br>that affects the faith and mission of the church itself. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>2. Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of the ministerial exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of this employment discrimination suit against her religious employer. Pp. 15–&para;<br>21.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v. EEOC &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>(a) The ministerial exception is not limited to the head of a religious congregation. The Court, however, does not adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister. Here, it&para;<br>is enough to conclude that the exception covers Perich, given all the&para;<br>circumstances of her employment. Hosanna-Tabor held her out as a&para;<br>minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members. That&para;<br>title represented a significant degree of religious training followed by&para;<br>a formal process of commissioning. Perich also held herself out as a&para;<br>minister by, for example, accepting the formal call to religious service. And her job duties reflected a role in conveying the Church’s&para;<br>message and carrying out its mission: As a source of religious instruction, Perich played an important part in transmitting the Lutheran faith.&para;<br>In concluding that Perich was not a minister under the exception,&para;<br>the Sixth Circuit committed three errors. First, it failed to see any&para;<br>relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister. Although such a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage,&para;<br>the fact that an employee has been ordained or commissioned as a&para;<br>minister is surely relevant, as is the fact that significant religious&para;<br>training and a recognized religious mission underlie the description&para;<br>of the employee’s position. Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much&para;<br>weight to the fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same&para;<br>religious duties as Perich. Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive&para;<br>that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions—particularly when, as here, they did so only&para;<br>because commissioned ministers were unavailable. Third, the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit placed too much emphasis on Perich’s performance of secular&para;<br>duties. Although the amount of time an employee spends on particular activities is relevant in assessing that employee’s status, that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the other considerations discussed above. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>(b) Because Perich was a minister for purposes of the exception,&para;<br>this suit must be dismissed. An order reinstating Perich as a called&para;<br>teacher would have plainly violated the Church’s freedom under the&para;<br>Religion Clauses to select its own ministers. Though Perich no longer&para;<br>seeks reinstatement, she continues to seek frontpay, backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. An award of&para;<br>such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating&para;<br>an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the First&para;<br>Amendment than an order overturning the termination. Such relief&para;<br>would depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to&para;<br>have relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling&para;<br>that is barred by the ministerial exception.&para;<br>Any suggestion that Hosanna-Tabor’s asserted religious reason for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>firing Perich was pretextual misses the point of the ministerial exception. The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church’s&para;<br>decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.&para;<br>The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control&para;<br>who will minister to the faithful is the church’s alone. Pp. 19–20.&para;<br>(c) Today the Court holds only that the ministerial exception bars&para;<br>an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister,&para;<br>challenging her church’s decision to fire her. The Court expresses no&para;<br>view on whether the exception bars other types of suits. Pp. 20–21.&para;<br>597 F. 3d 769, reversed.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

EEOC &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>The Synod classifies teachers into two categories:&para;<br>“called” and “lay.” “Called” teachers are regarded as&para;<br>having been called to their vocation by God through a&para;<br>congregation. To be eligible to receive a call from a congregation, a teacher must satisfy certain academic&para;<br>requirements. One way of doing so is by completing a&para;<br>“colloquy” program at a Lutheran college or university. The&para;<br>program requires candidates to take eight courses of&para;<br>theological study, obtain the endorsement of their local&para;<br>Synod district, and pass an oral examination by a faculty&para;<br>committee. A teacher who meets these requirements may&para;<br>be called by a congregation. Once called, a teacher receives the formal title “Minister of Religion, Commissioned.” App. 42, 48. A commissioned minister serves for&para;<br>an open-ended term; at Hosanna-Tabor, a call could be&para;<br>rescinded only for cause and by a supermajority vote of the&para;<br>congregation.&para;<br>“Lay” or “contract” teachers, by contrast, are not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran.&para;<br>At Hosanna-Tabor, they were appointed by the school&para;<br>board, without a vote of the congregation, to one-year&para;<br>renewable terms. Although teachers at the school generally performed the same duties regardless of whether they&para;<br>were lay or called, lay teachers were hired only when&para;<br>called teachers were unavailable.&para;<br>Respondent Cheryl Perich was first employed by&para;<br>Hosanna-Tabor as a lay teacher in 1999. After Perich completed her colloquy later that school year, Hosanna-Tabor&para;<br>asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted the&para;<br>call and received a “diploma of vocation” designating her a&para;<br>commissioned minister. Id., at 42.&para;<br>Perich taught kindergarten during her first four years&para;<br>at Hosanna-Tabor and fourth grade during the 2003–2004&para;<br>school year. She taught math, language arts, social studies, science, gym, art, and music. She also taught a religion class four days a week, led the students in prayer and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Perich led the chapel service&para;<br>herself about twice a year.&para;<br>Perich became ill in June 2004 with what was eventually diagnosed as narcolepsy. Symptoms included sudden&para;<br>and deep sleeps from which she could not be roused.&para;<br>Because of her illness, Perich began the 2004–2005 school&para;<br>year on disability leave. On January 27, 2005, however,&para;<br>Perich notified the school principal, Stacey Hoeft, that she&para;<br>would be able to report to work the following month.&para;<br>Hoeft responded that the school had already contracted&para;<br>with a lay teacher to fill Perich’s position for the remainder of the school year. Hoeft also expressed concern that&para;<br>Perich was not yet ready to return to the classroom.&para;<br>On January 30, Hosanna-Tabor held a meeting of its&para;<br>congregation at which school administrators stated that&para;<br>Perich was unlikely to be physically capable of returning&para;<br>to work that school year or the next. The congregation&para;<br>voted to offer Perich a “peaceful release” from her call,&para;<br>whereby the congregation would pay a portion of her&para;<br>health insurance premiums in exchange for her resignation as a called teacher. Id., at 178, 186. Perich refused to&para;<br>resign and produced a note from her doctor stating that&para;<br>she would be able to return to work on February 22. The&para;<br>school board urged Perich to reconsider, informing her&para;<br>that the school no longer had a position for her, but Perich&para;<br>stood by her decision not to resign.&para;<br>On the morning of February 22—the first day she was&para;<br>medically cleared to return to work—Perich presented&para;<br>herself at the school. Hoeft asked her to leave but she&para;<br>would not do so until she obtained written documentation&para;<br>that she had reported to work.

Id., at 229.&para;<br>Salo subsequently followed up with a letter advising&para;<br>Perich that the congregation would consider whether to&para;<br>rescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds for termination, the letter cited Perich’s “insubordination and&para;<br>disruptive behavior” on February 22, as well as the damage she had done to her “working relationship” with the&para;<br>school by “threatening to take legal action.” Id., at 55.&para;<br>The congregation voted to rescind Perich’s call on April 10,&para;<br>and Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination the&para;<br>next day.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that her employment had&para;<br>been terminated in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C. §12101 et seq.&para;<br>(1990). The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of disability.&para;<br>§12112(a). It also prohibits an employer from retaliating&para;<br>“against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or&para;<br>because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted,&para;<br>or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA].” §12203(a).1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The ADA itself provides religious entities with two defenses to&para;<br>claims of discrimination that arise under subchapter I of the Act. The&para;<br>first provides that “[t]his subchapter shall not prohibit a religious&para;<br>corporation, association, educational institution, or society from giving&para;<br>preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion to&para;<br>perform work connected with the carrying on by such [entity] of its&para;<br>activities.” §12113(d)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III). The second provides that&para;<br>“[u]nder this subchapter, a religious organization may require that all&para;<br>applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such&para;<br>organization.” §12113(d)(2).

S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened in the&para;<br>litigation, claiming unlawful retaliation under both the&para;<br>ADA and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights&para;<br>Act, Mich. Comp. Laws §37.1602(a) (1979). The EEOC&para;<br>and Perich sought Perich’s reinstatement to her former&para;<br>position (or frontpay in lieu thereof), along with backpay,&para;<br>compensatory and punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and&para;<br>other injunctive relief.&para;<br>Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment. Invoking what is known as the “ministerial exception,” the&para;<br>Church argued that the suit was barred by the First&para;<br>Amendment because the claims at issue concerned the&para;<br>employment relationship between a religious institution&para;<br>and one of its ministers. According to the Church, Perich&para;<br>was a minister, and she had been fired for a religious&para;<br>reason—namely, that her threat to sue the Church violated the Synod’s belief that Christians should resolve their&para;<br>disputes internally.&para;<br>The District Court agreed that the suit was barred by&para;<br>the ministerial exception and granted summary judgment&para;<br>in Hosanna-Tabor’s favor. The court explained that&para;<br>“Hosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her&para;<br>out to the world as such long before this litigation began,”&para;<br>and that the “facts surrounding Perich’s employment in a&para;<br>religious school with a sectarian mission” supported the&para;<br>Church’s characterization. 582 F. Supp. 2d, at 891–892.&para;<br>In light of that determination, the court concluded that it&para;<br>could “inquire no further into her claims of retaliation.”&para;<br>Id., at 892.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated and&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>§12203(a), appears in a different subchapter—subchapter IV. The &para;<br>&para;<br>EEOC and Perich contend, and Hosanna-Tabor does not dispute, that &para;<br>&para;<br>these defenses therefore do not apply to retaliation claims. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v.

The Court of Appeals&para;<br>recognized the existence of a ministerial exception barring&para;<br>certain employment discrimination claims against religious institutions—an exception “rooted in the First&para;<br>Amendment’s guarantees of religious freedom.” 597 F. 3d&para;<br>769, 777 (2010). The court concluded, however, that&para;<br>Perich did not qualify as a “minister” under the exception,&para;<br>noting in particular that her duties as a called teacher&para;<br>were identical to her duties as a lay teacher. Id., at 778–&para;<br>781. Judge White concurred. She viewed the question&para;<br>whether Perich qualified as a minister to be closer than&para;<br>did the majority, but agreed that the “fact that the duties&para;<br>of the contract teachers are the same as the duties of the&para;<br>called teachers is telling.” Id., at 782, 784.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The First Amendment provides, in part, that “Congress&para;<br>shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,&para;<br>or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” We have said&para;<br>that these two Clauses “often exert conflicting pressures,”&para;<br>Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 719 (2005), and that&para;<br>there can be “internal tension . . . between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,” Tilton v.&para;<br>Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Not so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government&para;<br>from interfering with the decision of a religious group to&para;<br>fire one of its ministers.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Controversy between church and state over religious&para;<br>offices is hardly new. In 1215, the issue was addressed in&para;<br>the very first clause of Magna Carta. There, King John&para;<br>agreed that “the English church shall be free, and shall&para;<br>have its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The King in particular accepted the “freedom of elections,”&para;<br>a right “thought to be of the greatest necessity and importance to the English church.” J. Holt, Magna Carta&para;<br>App. IV, p. 317, cl. 1 (1965).&para;<br>That freedom in many cases may have been more theoretical than real. See, e.g., W. Warren, Henry II 312&para;<br>(1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II to the electors&para;<br>of a bishopric in Winchester, stating: “I order you to hold a&para;<br>free election, but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard&para;<br>my clerk”). In any event, it did not survive the reign of&para;<br>Henry VIII, even in theory. The Act of Supremacy of 1534,&para;<br>26 Hen. 8, ch. 1, made the English monarch the supreme&para;<br>head of the Church, and the Act in Restraint of Annates,&para;<br>25 Hen. 8, ch. 20, passed that same year, gave him the&para;<br>authority to appoint the Church’s high officials. See G.&para;<br>Elton, The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary 331–332 (1960). Various Acts of Uniformity, enacted&para;<br>subsequently, tightened further the government’s grip on&para;<br>the exercise of religion. See, e.g., Act of Uniformity, 1559,&para;<br>1 Eliz., ch. 2; Act of Uniformity, 1549, 2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6, ch. 1.&para;<br>The Uniformity Act of 1662, for instance, limited service&para;<br>as a minister to those who formally assented to prescribed&para;<br>tenets and pledged to follow the mode of worship set forth&para;<br>in the Book of Common Prayer. Any minister who refused&para;<br>to make that pledge was “deprived of all his Spiritual&para;<br>Promotions.” Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car. 2, ch. 4.&para;<br>Seeking to escape the control of the national church, the&para;<br>Puritans fled to New England, where they hoped to elect&para;<br>their own ministers and establish their own modes of&para;<br>worship.

Cobb,&para;<br>The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 440–441 (1970).&para;<br>Colonists in the South, in contrast, brought the Church&para;<br>of England with them. But even they sometimes chafed at&para;<br>the control exercised by the Crown and its representatives&para;<br>over religious offices. In Virginia, for example, the law&para;<br>vested the governor with the power to induct ministers&para;<br>presented to him by parish vestries, 2 Hening’s Statutes&para;<br>at Large 46 (1642), but the vestries often refused to make&para;<br>such presentations and instead chose ministers on their&para;<br>own. See H. Eckenrode, Separation of Church and State&para;<br>in Virginia 13–19 (1910). Controversies over the selection&para;<br>of ministers also arose in other Colonies with Anglican&para;<br>establishments, including North Carolina. See C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom from Federal&para;<br>Establishment: Formation and Early History of the First&para;<br>Amendment Religion Clauses 10–11 (1964). There, the&para;<br>royal governor insisted that the right of presentation lay&para;<br>with the Bishop of London, but the colonial assembly&para;<br>enacted laws placing that right in the vestries. Authorities in England intervened, repealing those laws as inconsistent with the rights of the Crown. See id., at 11;&para;<br>Weeks, Church and State in North Carolina, Johns Hopkins U. Studies in Hist. &amp; Pol. Sci., 11th Ser., Nos. 5–6,&para;<br>pp. 29–36 (1893).&para;<br>It was against this background that the First Amendment was adopted. Familiar with life under the established Church of England, the founding generation sought&para;<br>to foreclose the possibility of a national church. See 1&para;<br>Annals of Cong. 730–731 (1789) (noting that the Establishment Clause addressed the fear that “one sect might&para;<br>obtain a pre-eminence, or two combine together, and&para;<br>establish a religion to which they would compel others to&para;<br>conform” (remarks of J. Madison)). By forbidding the&para;<br>“establishment of religion” and guaranteeing the “free&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exercise thereof,” the Religion Clauses ensured that the&para;<br>new Federal Government—unlike the English Crown—&para;<br>would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices. The&para;<br>Establishment Clause prevents the Government from&para;<br>appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with the freedom of religious&para;<br>groups to select their own.&para;<br>This understanding of the Religion Clauses was reflected in two events involving James Madison, “ ‘the leading&para;<br>architect of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.’ ”&para;<br>Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn,&para;<br>563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Flast v.&para;<br>Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 103 (1968)). The first occurred in&para;<br>1806, when John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the&para;<br>United States, solicited the Executive’s opinion on who&para;<br>should be appointed to direct the affairs of the Catholic&para;<br>Church in the territory newly acquired by the Louisiana&para;<br>Purchase. After consulting with President Jefferson, thenSecretary of State Madison responded that the selection&para;<br>of church “functionaries” was an “entirely ecclesiastical”&para;<br>matter left to the Church’s own judgment. Letter from&para;<br>James Madison to Bishop Carroll (Nov. 20, 1806), reprinted in 20 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society 63 (1909). The “scrupulous policy of the Constitution&para;<br>in guarding against a political interference with religious&para;<br>affairs,” Madison explained, prevented the Government&para;<br>from rendering an opinion on the “selection of ecclesiastical individuals.” Id., at 63–64.&para;<br>The second episode occurred in 1811, when Madison was&para;<br>President. Congress had passed a bill incorporating the&para;<br>Protestant Episcopal Church in the town of Alexandria in&para;<br>what was then the District of Columbia. Madison vetoed&para;<br>the bill, on the ground that it “exceeds the rightful authority to which Governments are limited, by the essential&para;<br>distinction between civil and religious functions, and&para;<br>violates, in particular, the article of the Constitution of the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v. EEOC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>United States, which declares, that ‘Congress shall make&para;<br>no law respecting a religious establishment.’ ” 22 Annals&para;<br>of Cong. 982–983 (1811). Madison explained:&para;<br>“The bill enacts into, and establishes by law, sundry&para;<br>rules and proceedings relative purely to the organization and polity of the church incorporated, and&para;<br>comprehending even the election and removal of the&para;<br>Minister of the same; so that no change could be made&para;<br>therein by the particular society, or by the general&para;<br>church of which it is a member, and whose authority&para;<br>it recognises.” Id., at 983 (emphasis added).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Given this understanding of the Religion Clauses—and&para;<br>the absence of government employment regulation generally—it was some time before questions about government&para;<br>interference with a church’s ability to select its own ministers came before the courts. This Court touched upon the&para;<br>issue indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over&para;<br>church property. Our decisions in that area confirm that&para;<br>it is impermissible for the government to contradict a&para;<br>church’s determination of who can act as its ministers.&para;<br>In Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679 (1872), the Court considered a dispute between antislavery and proslavery&para;<br>factions over who controlled the property of the Walnut&para;<br>Street Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky. The&para;<br>General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church had recognized the antislavery faction, and this Court—applying&para;<br>not the Constitution but a “broad and sound view of the&para;<br>relations of church and state under our system of laws”—&para;<br>declined to question that determination. Id., at 727. We&para;<br>explained that “whenever the questions of discipline, or of&para;<br>faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been&para;<br>decided by the highest of [the] church judicatories to which&para;<br>the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must&para;<br>accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ibid. As we would put it later, our opinion in Watson&para;<br>“radiates . . . a spirit of freedom for religious organizations, an independence from secular control or manipulation—in short, power to decide for themselves, free from&para;<br>state interference, matters of church government as well&para;<br>as those of faith and doctrine.” Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas&para;<br>Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America,&para;<br>344 U. S. 94, 116 (1952).&para;<br>Confronting the issue under the Constitution for the&para;<br>first time in Kedroff, the Court recognized that the&para;<br>“[f]reedom to select the clergy, where no improper methods&para;<br>of choice are proven,” is “part of the free exercise of religion” protected by the First Amendment against government interference. Ibid. At issue in Kedroff was the right&para;<br>to use a Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York City.&para;<br>The Russian Orthodox churches in North America had&para;<br>split from the Supreme Church Authority in Moscow, out&para;<br>of concern that the Authority had become a tool of the&para;<br>Soviet Government.&para;<br>The North American churches&para;<br>claimed that the right to use the cathedral belonged to an&para;<br>archbishop elected by them; the Supreme Church Authority claimed that it belonged instead to an archbishop appointed by the patriarch in Moscow. New York’s highest&para;<br>court ruled in favor of the North American churches,&para;<br>based on a state law requiring every Russian Orthodox&para;<br>church in New York to recognize the determination of the&para;<br>governing body of the North American churches as authoritative. Id., at 96–97, 99, n. 3, 107, n. 10.&para;<br>This Court reversed, concluding that the New York law&para;<br>violated the First Amendment. Id., at 107. We explained&para;<br>that the controversy over the right to use the cathedral&para;<br>was “strictly a matter of ecclesiastical government, the&para;<br>power of the Supreme Church Authority of the Russian&para;<br>Orthodox Church to appoint the ruling hierarch of the&para;<br>archdiocese of North America.” Id., at 115. By “pass[ing]&para;<br>the control of matters strictly ecclesiastical from one&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v. EEOC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>church authority to another,” the New York law intruded&para;<br>the “power of the state into the forbidden area of religious freedom contrary to the principles of the First Amendment.” Id., at 119. Accordingly, we declared the law&para;<br>unconstitutional because it “directly prohibit[ed] the free&para;<br>exercise of an ecclesiastical right, the Church’s choice of its&para;<br>hierarchy.” Ibid.&para;<br>This Court reaffirmed these First Amendment principles in Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for United States&para;<br>and Canada v. Milivojevich, 426 U. S. 696 (1976), a case&para;<br>involving a dispute over control of the American-Canadian&para;<br>Diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church, including its&para;<br>property and assets. The Church had removed Dionisije&para;<br>Milivojevich as bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese&para;<br>because of his defiance of the church hierarchy. Following&para;<br>his removal, Dionisije brought a civil action in state court&para;<br>challenging the Church’s decision, and the Illinois Supreme Court “purported in effect to reinstate Dionisije as&para;<br>Diocesan Bishop,” on the ground that the proceedings&para;<br>resulting in his removal failed to comply with church laws&para;<br>and regulations. Id., at 708.&para;<br>Reversing that judgment, this Court explained that the&para;<br>First Amendment “permit[s] hierarchical religious organizations to establish their own rules and regulations for&para;<br>internal discipline and government, and to create tribunals for adjudicating disputes over these matters.” Id., at&para;<br>724. When ecclesiastical tribunals decide such disputes,&para;<br>we further explained, “the Constitution requires that civil&para;<br>courts accept their decisions as binding upon them.” Id.,&para;<br>at 725. We thus held that by inquiring into whether the&para;<br>Church had followed its own procedures, the State Supreme Court had “unconstitutionally undertaken the&para;<br>resolution of quintessentially religious controversies&para;<br>whose resolution the First Amendment commits exclusively to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals” of the Church.&para;<br>Id., at 720.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

The&para;<br>members of a religious group put their faith in the hands&para;<br>of their ministers. Requiring a church to accept or retain&para;<br>an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to&para;<br>do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action interferes with the internal governance&para;<br>of the church, depriving the church of control over the&para;<br>selection of those who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free&para;<br>Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group’s right to&para;<br>shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See Natal v.

EEOC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>According the state the power to determine which individuals will minister to the faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement&para;<br>in such ecclesiastical decisions.&para;<br>The EEOC and Perich acknowledge that employment&para;<br>discrimination laws would be unconstitutional as applied&para;<br>to religious groups in certain circumstances. They grant,&para;<br>for example, that it would violate the First Amendment for&para;<br>courts to apply such laws to compel the ordination of&para;<br>women by the Catholic Church or by an Orthodox Jewish&para;<br>seminary. Brief for Federal Respondent 31; Brief for&para;<br>Respondent Perich 35–36. According to the EEOC and&para;<br>Perich, religious organizations could successfully defend&para;<br>against employment discrimination claims in those circumstances by invoking the constitutional right to freedom&para;<br>of association—a right “implicit” in the First Amendment.&para;<br>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622&para;<br>(1984). The EEOC and Perich thus see no need—and no&para;<br>basis—for a special rule for ministers grounded in the&para;<br>Religion Clauses themselves.&para;<br>We find this position untenable. The right to freedom of&para;<br>association is a right enjoyed by religious and secular&para;<br>groups alike. It follows under the EEOC’s and Perich’s&para;<br>view that the First Amendment analysis should be the&para;<br>same, whether the association in question is the Lutheran&para;<br>Church, a labor union, or a social club. See Perich Brief&para;<br>31; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. That result is hard to square with&para;<br>the text of the First Amendment itself, which gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. We&para;<br>cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion&para;<br>Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organization’s freedom to select its own ministers.&para;<br>The EEOC and Perich also contend that our decision in&para;<br>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.&para;<br>Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), precludes recognition of a&para;<br>ministerial exception. In Smith, two members of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

We held that this did not violate the Free Exercise&para;<br>Clause, even though the peyote had been ingested for&para;<br>sacramental purposes, because the “right of free exercise&para;<br>does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply&para;<br>with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the&para;<br>ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that&para;<br>his religion prescribes (or proscribes).” Id., at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>It is true that the ADA’s prohibition on retaliation, like&para;<br>Oregon’s prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral&para;<br>law of general applicability. But a church’s selection of its&para;<br>ministers is unlike an individual’s ingestion of peyote.&para;<br>Smith involved government regulation of only outward&para;<br>physical acts. The present case, in contrast, concerns&para;<br>government interference with an internal church decision&para;<br>that affects the faith and mission of the church itself. See&para;<br>id., at 877 (distinguishing the government’s regulation of&para;<br>“physical acts” from its “lend[ing] its power to one or&para;<br>the other side in controversies over religious authority or&para;<br>dogma”).

EEOC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for us to conclude, in this our first case involving the&para;<br>ministerial exception, that the exception covers Perich,&para;<br>given all the circumstances of her employment.&para;<br>To begin with, Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a&para;<br>minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members. When Hosanna-Tabor extended her a call, it issued&para;<br>her a “diploma of vocation” according her the title “Minister of Religion, Commissioned.” App. 42. She was tasked&para;<br>with performing that office “according to the Word of God&para;<br>and the confessional standards of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as drawn from the Sacred Scriptures.” Ibid.&para;<br>The congregation prayed that God “bless [her] ministrations to the glory of His holy name, [and] the building of&para;<br>His church.” Id., at 43. In a supplement to the diploma,&para;<br>the congregation undertook to periodically review Perich’s&para;<br>“skills of ministry” and “ministerial responsibilities,” and&para;<br>to provide for her “continuing education as a professional&para;<br>person in the ministry of the Gospel.” Id., at 49.&para;<br>Perich’s title as a minister reflected a significant degree&para;<br>of religious training followed by a formal process of commissioning. To be eligible to become a commissioned&para;<br>minister, Perich had to complete eight college-level courses in subjects including biblical interpretation, church&para;<br>doctrine, and the ministry of the Lutheran teacher. She&para;<br>also had to obtain the endorsement of her local Synod&para;<br>district by submitting a petition that contained her academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, personal&para;<br>statement, and written answers to various ministryrelated questions. Finally, she had to pass an oral examination by a faculty committee at a Lutheran college. It&para;<br>took Perich six years to fulfill these requirements. And&para;<br>when she eventually did, she was commissioned as a&para;<br>minister only upon election by the congregation, which&para;<br>recognized God’s call to her to teach. At that point, her&para;<br>call could be rescinded only upon a supermajority vote of&para;<br>the congregation—a protection designed to allow her to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

She did so in other ways as well. For example,&para;<br>she claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that&para;<br>was available only to employees earning their compensation “ ‘in the exercise of the ministry.’ ” App. 220 (“If you&para;<br>are not conducting activities ‘in the exercise of the ministry,’ you cannot take advantage of the parsonage or&para;<br>housing allowance exclusion” (quoting Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod Brochure on Whether the IRS Considers&para;<br>Employees as a Minister (2007)). In a form she submitted&para;<br>to the Synod following her termination, Perich again&para;<br>indicated that she regarded herself as a minister at&para;<br>Hosanna-Tabor, stating: “I feel that God is leading me to&para;<br>serve in the teaching ministry . . . . I am anxious to be in&para;<br>the teaching ministry again soon.” App. 53.&para;<br>Perich’s job duties reflected a role in conveying the&para;<br>Church’s message and carrying out its mission. HosannaTabor expressly charged her with “lead[ing] others toward&para;<br>Christian maturity” and “teach[ing] faithfully the Word of&para;<br>God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as&para;<br>set forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical&para;<br>Lutheran Church.” Id., at 48. In fulfilling these responsibilities, Perich taught her students religion four days a&para;<br>week, and led them in prayer three times a day. Once a&para;<br>week, she took her students to a school-wide chapel service, and—about twice a year—she took her turn leading&para;<br>it, choosing the liturgy, selecting the hymns, and delivering a short message based on verses from the Bible. During her last year of teaching, Perich also led her fourth&para;<br>graders in a brief devotional exercise each morning. As a&para;<br>source of religious instruction, Perich performed an important role in transmitting the Lutheran faith to the next&para;<br>generation.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v. EEOC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In light of these considerations—the formal title given&para;<br>Perich by the Church, the substance reflected in that title,&para;<br>her own use of that title, and the important religious&para;<br>functions she performed for the Church—we conclude&para;<br>that Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial&para;<br>exception.&para;<br>In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>committed three errors. First, the Sixth Circuit failed to&para;<br>see any relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister. Although such a title, by itself, does not&para;<br>automatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee&para;<br>has been ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely&para;<br>relevant, as is the fact that significant religious training&para;<br>and a recognized religious mission underlie the description&para;<br>of the employee’s position. It was wrong for the Court of&para;<br>Appeals—and Perich, who has adopted the court’s view,&para;<br>see Perich Brief 45—to say that an employee’s title does&para;<br>not matter.&para;<br>Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much weight to the&para;<br>fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same&para;<br>religious duties as Perich. We express no view on whether&para;<br>someone with Perich’s duties would be covered by the&para;<br>ministerial exception in the absence of the other considerations we have discussed. But though relevant, it cannot&para;<br>be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions—&para;<br>particularly when, as here, they did so only because&para;<br>commissioned ministers were unavailable.&para;<br>Third, the Sixth Circuit placed too much emphasis on&para;<br>Perich’s performance of secular duties. It is true that her&para;<br>religious duties consumed only 45 minutes of each workday, and that the rest of her day was devoted to teaching&para;<br>secular subjects. The EEOC regards that as conclusive,&para;<br>contending that any ministerial exception “should be&para;<br>limited to those employees who perform exclusively religious functions.” Brief for Federal Respondent 51. We&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cannot accept that view. Indeed, we are unsure whether&para;<br>any such employees exist. The heads of congregations&para;<br>themselves often have a mix of duties, including secular&para;<br>ones such as helping to manage the congregation’s finances, supervising purely secular personnel, and overseeing&para;<br>the upkeep of facilities.&para;<br>Although the Sixth Circuit did not adopt the extreme&para;<br>position pressed here by the EEOC, it did regard the&para;<br>relative amount of time Perich spent performing religious&para;<br>functions as largely determinative. The issue before us,&para;<br>however, is not one that can be resolved by a stopwatch.&para;<br>The amount of time an employee spends on particular&para;<br>activities is relevant in assessing that employee’s status,&para;<br>but that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without&para;<br>regard to the nature of the religious functions performed&para;<br>and the other considerations discussed above.&para;<br>Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of&para;<br>the exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of&para;<br>this employment discrimination suit against her religious&para;<br>employer. The EEOC and Perich originally sought an&para;<br>order reinstating Perich to her former position as a called&para;<br>teacher. By requiring the Church to accept a minister it&para;<br>did not want, such an order would have plainly violated&para;<br>the Church’s freedom under the Religion Clauses to select&para;<br>its own ministers.&para;<br>Perich no longer seeks reinstatement, having abandoned&para;<br>that relief before this Court. See Perich Brief 58. But that&para;<br>is immaterial. Perich continues to seek frontpay in lieu of&para;<br>reinstatement, backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. An award of such relief would&para;<br>operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an&para;<br>unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the&para;<br>First Amendment than an order overturning the termination. Such relief would depend on a determination that&para;<br>Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved Perich of her&para;<br>position, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH&para;<br>AND SCHOOL v.

That suggestion misses the point of&para;<br>the ministerial exception.

We conclude that&para;<br>the exception operates as an affirmative defense to an otherwise&para;<br>cognizable claim, not a jurisdictional bar.

The term “minister”&para;<br>is commonly used by many Protestant denominations to&para;<br>refer to members of their clergy, but the term is rarely if&para;<br>ever used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists.2 In addition, the concept of ordination&para;<br>as understood by most Christian churches and by Judaism&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 It is unconventional to refer to many persons who clearly fall within the “ministerial” exception, such as Protestant ministers, Catholic&para;<br>priests, and Jewish rabbis, as “employees,” but I use the term in the&para;<br>sense in which it is used in the antidiscrimination laws that are often&para;<br>implicated in cases involving the exception. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000e(f) (Title VII); §12111(4) (ADA); 29 U. S.

Because virtually every religion&para;<br>in the world is represented in the population of the United&para;<br>States, it would be a mistake if the term “minister” or the&para;<br>concept of ordination were viewed as central to the important issue of religious autonomy that is presented in&para;<br>cases like this one. Instead, courts should focus on the&para;<br>function performed by persons who work for religious&para;<br>bodies.&para;<br>The First Amendment protects the freedom of religious&para;<br>groups to engage in certain key religious activities, including the conducting of worship services and other religious&para;<br>ceremonies and rituals, as well as the critical process of&para;<br>communicating the faith. Accordingly, religious groups&para;<br>must be free to choose the personnel who are essential to&para;<br>the performance of these functions.&para;<br>The “ministerial” exception should be tailored to this&para;<br>purpose. It should apply to any “employee” who leads&para;<br>a religious organization, conducts worship services or important religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a&para;<br>messenger or teacher of its faith. If a religious group&para;<br>believes that the ability of such an employee to perform&para;<br>these key functions has been compromised, then the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom protects the&para;<br>group’s right to remove the employee from his or her&para;<br>position.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Throughout our Nation’s history, religious bodies have&para;<br>been the preeminent example of private associations that&para;<br>have “act[ed] as critical buffers between the individual and&para;<br>the power of the State.” Roberts v. United States Jaycees,&para;<br>468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984). In a case like the one now&para;<br>before us—where the goal of the civil law in question, the&para;<br>elimination of discrimination against persons with disabilities, is so worthy—it is easy to forget that the autonomy&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

To safeguard this crucial autonomy, we have&para;<br>long recognized that the Religion Clauses protect a private&para;<br>sphere within which religious bodies are free to govern&para;<br>themselves in accordance with their own beliefs. The&para;<br>Constitution guarantees religious bodies “independence&para;<br>from secular control or manipulation—in short, power to&para;<br>decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and&para;<br>doctrine.” Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian&para;<br>Orthodox Church in North America, 344 U. S. 94, 116&para;<br>(1952).&para;<br>Religious autonomy means that religious authorities&para;<br>must be free to determine who is qualified to serve in&para;<br>positions of substantial religious importance. Different&para;<br>religions will have different views on exactly what qualifies as an important religious position, but it is nonetheless possible to identify a general category of “employees”&para;<br>whose functions are essential to the independence of practically all religious groups. These include those who serve&para;<br>in positions of leadership, those who perform important&para;<br>functions in worship services and in the performance of&para;<br>religious ceremonies and rituals, and those who are entrusted with teaching and conveying the tenets of the faith&para;<br>to the next generation.&para;<br>Applying the protection of the First Amendment to roles&para;<br>of religious leadership, worship, ritual, and expression&para;<br>focuses on the objective functions that are important for&para;<br>the autonomy of any religious group, regardless of its&para;<br>beliefs. As we have recognized in a similar context,&para;<br>“[f]orcing a group to accept certain members may impair&para;<br>[its ability] to express those views, and only those views,&para;<br>that it intends to express.” Boy Scouts of America v.

As the Court notes, the First Amendment “gives special solicitude to the rights of religious&para;<br>organizations,” ante, at 14, but our expressive-association&para;<br>cases are nevertheless useful in pointing out what those&para;<br>essential rights are. Religious groups are the archetype&para;<br>of associations formed for expressive purposes, and their&para;<br>fundamental rights surely include the freedom to choose&para;<br>who is qualified to serve as a voice for their faith.&para;<br>When it comes to the expression and inculcation of&para;<br>religious doctrine, there can be no doubt that the messenger matters. Religious teachings cover the gamut from&para;<br>moral conduct to metaphysical truth, and both the content&para;<br>and credibility of a religion’s message depend vitally on&para;<br>the character and conduct of its teachers. A religion cannot depend on someone to be an effective advocate for its&para;<br>religious vision if that person’s conduct fails to live up to&para;<br>the religious precepts that he or she espouses. For this&para;<br>reason, a religious body’s right to self-governance must&para;<br>include the ability to select, and to be selective about,&para;<br>those who will serve as the very “embodiment of its message” and “its voice to the faithful.” Petruska v.

The Fourth Circuit traced the exception&para;<br>back to McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F. 2d 553 (CA5&para;<br>1972), which invoked the Religion Clauses to bar a Title&para;<br>VII sex-discrimination suit brought by a woman who was&para;<br>described by the court as a Salvation Army “minister,” id.,&para;<br>at 554, although her actual title was “officer.” See&para;<br>McClure v.

But there is no principled&para;<br>basis for proscribing a pretext inquiry in such a case while&para;<br>permitting it in a case like the one now before us.

EEOC&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>Roman Catholic Church’s insistence on clerical celibacy&para;<br>may be much better known than the Lutheran Church’s&para;<br>doctrine of internal dispute resolution, but popular familiarity with a religious doctrine cannot be the determinative&para;<br>factor.&para;<br>What matters in the present case is that Hosanna-Tabor&para;<br>believes that the religious function that respondent performed made it essential that she abide by the doctrine of&para;<br>internal dispute resolution; and the civil courts are in no&para;<br>position to second-guess that assessment. This conclusion&para;<br>rests not on respondent’s ordination status or her formal&para;<br>title, but rather on her functional status as the type of&para;<br>employee that a church must be free to appoint or dismiss&para;<br>in order to exercise the religious liberty that the First&para;<br>Amendment guarantees.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
