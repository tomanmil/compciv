STEPHEN &para;<br>&para;<br>UPTON, WARDEN &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–8852. Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced&para;<br>to death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his&para;<br>lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they&para;<br>failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suf&para;<br>fered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after&para;<br>making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an&para;<br>expert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under&para;<br>the governing federal statute, that factual finding is pre&para;<br>sumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.&para;<br>See 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court&para;<br>of Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifi&para;<br>cally §2254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself&para;<br>“duty-bound” to accept the state court’s finding, and re&para;<br>jected Jefferson’s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did&para;<br>not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable&para;<br>exceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.&para;<br>I&para;<br>When Jefferson was a child, he “suffered a serious in&para;<br>jury to his head.” Jefferson v. Terry, 490 F. Supp. 2d 1261,&para;<br>1326 (ND Ga. 2007); see id., at 1320 (quoting Jefferson’s&para;<br>mother’s testimony that “a car ran over the top of his&para;<br>head” when he was two years old). The accident left his&para;<br>skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly&para;<br>scarred. Jefferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1311, 1315, n. 4&para;<br>(CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting). During the District&para;<br>Court proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>that, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has “perma&para;<br>nent brain damage” that “causes abnormal behavior” over&para;<br>which he “has no or substantially limited control.” 490&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1321–1322. According to these experts,&para;<br>Jefferson’s condition causes “ ‘emotional dullness,’ ” “ ‘rest&para;<br>less or aggressive characteristics,’ ” “ ‘impulsiveness,’ ”&para;<br>“ ‘temper outbursts,’ ” “ ‘markedly diminished impulse&para;<br>control,’ ” “ ‘impaired social judgment,’ ” and “ ‘transient&para;<br>outbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his&para;<br>normal behavioral pattern.’ ” Id., at 1322, 1327.&para;<br>The experts further testified that Jefferson’s “ ‘severe&para;<br>cognitive disabilities’ ” “ ‘profoundly alter’ ” his “ ‘ability to&para;<br>plan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the conse&para;<br>quences of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or&para;<br>intentional acts.’ ” Id., at 1327. But they testified he is&para;<br>neither psychotic nor retarded. Id., at 1319. Thus, they&para;<br>said, to a lay observer or even to a professional psycholo&para;<br>gist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally im&para;<br>paired. Indeed, according to the experts, “ ‘the behavior&para;<br>that may result from’ ” his condition “ ‘could, without the&para;<br>administration of proper testing, be mistaken for voli&para;<br>tional.’ ” Id., at 1322.&para;<br>Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co&para;<br>worker while the two men were fishing. Id., at 1271–1272.&para;<br>Prior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named&para;<br>Dr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which&para;<br>he concluded that Jefferson’s mental deficiencies do not&para;<br>impair “ ‘his judgment or decision-making capacity.’ ” 570&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley’s report&para;<br>included a caveat: “ ‘One possibility that could not be&para;<br>explored because of [Jefferson’s] incarceration has to do&para;<br>with the sequelae,’ ” i.e., pathologies, related to a “ ‘head&para;<br>injury experienced during childhood.’ ” Ibid. “ ‘In my&para;<br>opinion,’ ” he wrote, “ ‘it would be worthwhile to conduct&para;<br>neuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out&para;<br>an organic etiology,’ ” i.e., to rule out brain damage. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Although “it is undisputed that the testing” Dr. Dudley&para;<br>recommended “could have easily been performed,” 490&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson’s attorneys pos&para;<br>sessed police reports and hospital records recounting his&para;<br>head injury, id., at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jef&para;<br>ferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testi&para;<br>mony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson&para;<br>was an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of&para;<br>Jefferson’s family, who testified that he is a “responsible,&para;<br>generous, gentle, and kind” person and “a good father.”&para;<br>570 F. 3d, at 1290–1291. And while Jefferson’s mother&para;<br>briefly mentioned the car accident, “she was not ques&para;<br>tioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the&para;<br>impact, if any, that the accident had on him.” Id., at 1291.&para;<br>Thus, “[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer&para;<br>from brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no&para;<br>organic disorders”; and “his emotional stability, impulse&para;<br>control, and judgment were perfectly normal.” Id., at 1311&para;<br>(Carnes, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing&para;<br>that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue&para;<br>brain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys&para;<br>testified that they did not pursue such testing because,&para;<br>after delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later&para;<br>told them that further investigation “ ‘may be a waste of&para;<br>time because the rest of [his] report’ ” had “ ‘said that&para;<br>[Jefferson] was non psychotic.’ ” 570 F. 3d, at 1295 (quot&para;<br>ing testimony). Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the&para;<br>hearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that&para;<br>he had ever made such statements. He said “it had al&para;<br>ways been his expert opinion ‘that neuropsychological&para;<br>testing was necessary’ ” and that when he wrote as much&para;<br>in his formal report “he ‘meant it.’ ” Id., at 1312 (Carnes,&para;<br>J., dissenting) (quoting affidavit). He added, “ ‘I never,&para;<br>before or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson’s attor&para;<br>neys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>would not be worthwhile.’ ” Ibid.; cf. Pet. for Cert. 17,&para;<br>n. 12.&para;<br>Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that&para;<br>after the hearing concluded the state-court judge con&para;<br>tacted the attorneys for the State ex parte. And in a pri&para;<br>vate conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his&para;<br>attorneys, the judge asked the State’s attorneys to draft&para;<br>the opinion of the court. See id., at 3, 12. According to&para;<br>Jefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he&para;<br>informed of the request made to opposing counsel. Id., at&para;<br>12, n. 8, 13; see also Jefferson v. Zant, 263 Ga. 316, 431&para;<br>S. E. 2d 110, 111 (1993) (“Jefferson contends [the order]&para;<br>amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which&para;<br>[he] has not had a chance to respond”).&para;<br>The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding&para;<br>that “Dr. Dudley led [Jefferson’s trial attorneys] to believe&para;<br>that further investigation would simply be a waste of time&para;<br>because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.” Jefferson v. Zant,&para;<br>Civ. Action No. 87–V–1241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga.,&para;<br>Oct. 7, 1992), p. 16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter&para;<br>State Order); see also id., at 37. The opinion “specifically&para;<br>credits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to&para;<br>their efforts to investigate Petitioner’s mental condition.”&para;<br>Id., at 18; see also id., at 36. And relying on these find&para;<br>ings, it concludes that Jefferson’s attorneys “made a rea&para;<br>sonable investigation into [his] mental health” and were&para;<br>thus not ineffective. Id., at 37.&para;<br>Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged,&para;<br>the State’s opinion discusses statements purportedly made&para;<br>on Jefferson’s behalf by a witness “who did not testify” or&para;<br>participate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S. E.&para;<br>2d, at 112; see State Order 24–25. Nonetheless, the opin&para;<br>ion “was adopted verbatim by the [state] court.” 263 Ga.,&para;<br>at 316, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme&para;<br>Court recognized that we have “ ‘criticized’ ” such a prac&para;<br>tice, it affirmed the judgment. Id., at 317, 320, 431 S. E.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>2d, at 112, 114 (quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470&para;<br>U. S. 564, 572 (1985)).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the Dis&para;<br>trict Court. In his opening brief, he argued that “there is&para;<br>no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give&para;<br>any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus&para;<br>Court.” Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND&para;<br>Ga.), Doc. 105, p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court&para;<br>Brief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the&para;<br>state court “merely signed an order drafted by the State&para;<br>without revision of a single word,” even though the order&para;<br>“described witnesses who never testified.” Ibid. And he&para;<br>said that such a process “rais[es] serious doubts as to&para;<br>whether [the judge] even read, much less carefully consid&para;<br>ered, the proposed order submitted by the State.” Ibid.&para;<br>The District Court ruled in Jefferson’s favor. It noted&para;<br>that under the relevant statute “factual findings of state&para;<br>courts are presumed to be correct unless one of . . . eight&para;<br>enumerated exceptions . . . applies.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>1280; see also id., at 1280, n. 5 (listing the exceptions).&para;<br>And it acknowledged “the state habeas corpus court’s&para;<br>failure to explain the basis” for its credibility findings. Id.,&para;<br>at 1324, n. 17. But it accepted Jefferson’s claim of ineffec&para;<br>tive assistance of counsel without disturbing the state&para;<br>court’s factual findings because it believed he should&para;<br>prevail even accepting those findings as true. Id., at&para;<br>1324–1325.&para;<br>On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court’s judg&para;<br>ment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that&para;<br>the state court’s factfinding was “dubious at best” in light&para;<br>of the process that court employed, and that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals therefore “should harbor serious doubts about the&para;<br>findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state&para;<br>court record.” Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07–&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>12502 (CA11), pp. 31–32, n. 10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).&para;<br>A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jeffer&para;<br>son filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing,&para;<br>he challenges—as he did in the State Supreme Court, the&para;<br>District Court, and the Court of Appeals—“the fact find&para;<br>ings of the state court,” given what he describes as the&para;<br>deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing&para;<br>his claim. Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13 (re&para;<br>counting “ ‘reason[s] to doubt’ ” the state court’s findings).&para;<br>Cf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,&para;<br>513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995) (stating standard for preserving&para;<br>an issue for review in this Court).&para;<br>III&para;<br>This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment&para;<br>of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it&para;<br>existed prior to that point. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.&para;<br>320, 326–336 (1997). In 1963, we set forth the “appropri&para;<br>ate standard” to be applied by a “federal court in habeas&para;<br>corpus” when “the facts” pertinent to a habeas application&para;<br>“are in dispute.” Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312.&para;<br>We held that when “the habeas applicant was afforded a&para;<br>full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable&para;<br>findings” the district court “ordinarily should . . . accept&para;<br>the facts as found” by the state-court judge. Id., at 318.&para;<br>However, “if the habeas applicant did not receive a full&para;<br>and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the&para;<br>time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,” we held that&para;<br>the federal court “must hold an evidentiary hearing” to&para;<br>resolve any facts that “are in dispute.” Id., at 312. We&para;<br>further “explain[ed] the controlling criteria” by enumerat&para;<br>ing six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hear&para;<br>ing would be required:&para;<br>“(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determina&para;<br>tion is not fairly supported by the record as a whole;&para;<br>(3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state&para;<br>court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hear&para;<br>ing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly dis&para;<br>covered evidence; (5) the material facts were not ade&para;<br>quately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for&para;<br>any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not&para;<br>afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hear&para;<br>ing.” Id., at 313 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Three years later, in 1966, Congress enacted an&para;<br>amendment to the federal habeas statute that “was an&para;<br>almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated&para;<br>in Townsend v. Sain.” Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 111&para;<br>(1985). That codification read in relevant part as follows:&para;<br>“In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by&para;<br>an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person&para;<br>in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,&para;<br>a determination . . . of a factual issue, made by a State&para;<br>court of competent jurisdiction . . . , shall be presumed&para;<br>to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or&para;<br>it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall&para;<br>admit—&para;<br>“(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not&para;<br>resolved in the State court hearing;&para;<br>“(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the&para;<br>State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair&para;<br>hearing;&para;<br>“(3) that the material facts were not adequately de&para;<br>veloped at the State court hearing;&para;<br>“(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the&para;<br>subject matter or over the person of the applicant in&para;<br>the State court proceeding;&para;<br>“(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the&para;<br>State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State&para;<br>court proceeding;&para;<br>“(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair,&para;<br>and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or&para;<br>“(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due&para;<br>process of law in the State court proceeding;&para;<br>“(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a considera&para;<br>tion of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole con&para;<br>cludes that such factual determination is not fairly&para;<br>supported by the record.” §2254(d) (emphasis added).&para;<br>As is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as&para;<br>the District Court correctly stated, if any “one of the eight&para;<br>enumerated exceptions . . . applies” then “the state court’s&para;<br>factfinding is not presumed correct.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>1280; accord, Miller, supra, at 105 (“Under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d), state-court findings of fact ‘shall be presumed to&para;<br>be correct’ in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless&para;<br>one of eight enumerated exceptions applies”); see also 1 R.&para;<br>Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and&para;<br>Procedure §20.2c, pp. 915–918 (5th ed. 2005).&para;<br>Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts&para;<br>“should harbor serious doubts about” and should not “give&para;<br>any deference to” the “findings of fact and credibility&para;<br>determinations” made by the state habeas court because&para;<br>those findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys&para;<br>for the State pursuant to an ex parte request from the&para;<br>state-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson,&para;<br>failed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing&para;<br>counsel, and adopted the State’s proposed opinion verba&para;<br>tim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent&para;<br>witness. See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court&para;<br>Brief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that&para;<br>the state court’s process was deficient. In other words,&para;<br>they are arguments that Jefferson “did not receive a full&para;<br>and fair evidentiary hearing in . . . state court.” Town&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>send, supra, at 312. Or, to use the statutory language,&para;<br>they are arguments that the state court’s “factfinding&para;<br>procedure,” “hearing,” and “proceeding” were not “full,&para;<br>fair, and adequate.” §§2254(d)(2), (6), (7).&para;<br>But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state&para;<br>court’s process when it applied the statutory presumption&para;<br>of correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that&para;<br>applied only paragraph (8) of §2254(d), which, codifying&para;<br>the second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the&para;<br>presumption of correctness for findings that are “not fairly&para;<br>supported by the record.” See 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (quoting&para;<br>Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in&para;<br>turn quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)). And even though&para;<br>the Court of Appeals “recognize[d]” that Jefferson had&para;<br>argued that the state court’s process had produced factual&para;<br>findings that were “ ‘dubious at best,’ ” and that federal&para;<br>courts should therefore “ ‘harbor serious doubts about’ ” the&para;<br>state court’s “ ‘findings of fact and credibility,’ ” the Court&para;<br>of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings&para;<br>are “ ‘entitled to a presumption of correctness’ ” that it was&para;<br>“duty-bound” to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting&para;<br>Appeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly&para;<br>stated that it considered itself “duty-bound” to defer to the&para;<br>state court’s findings because “Jefferson has not argued&para;<br>that any of the state courts’ factual findings were ‘not&para;<br>fairly supported by the record,’ ” a direct reference to&para;<br>§2254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception. 570&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then con&para;<br>cluded: “Based on these factual findings of the state ha&para;<br>beas courts—all of which are fairly supported by the re&para;<br>cord—we believe that Jefferson’s counsel were reasonable&para;<br>in deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.” Id.,&para;<br>at 1304 (emphasis added).&para;<br>In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly con&para;<br>sider the legal status of the state court’s factual findings.&para;<br>Under Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>federal court is not “duty-bound” to accept any and all&para;<br>state-court findings that are “fairly supported by the&para;<br>record.” Those words come from §2254(d)(8), which is only&para;<br>one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of&para;<br>correctness. But there are seven others, see §§2254(d)(1)–&para;<br>(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when&para;<br>addressing Jefferson’s claim. To be sure, we have previ&para;<br>ously stated in cases applying §2254(d)(8) that “a federal&para;<br>court” may not overturn a state court’s factual conclusion&para;<br>“unless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the re&para;<br>cord.’ ” Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (grant&para;<br>ing federal habeas relief after rejecting state court’s find&para;<br>ing under §2254(d)(8)); see also Demosthenes v. Baal, 495&para;<br>U. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying §2254(d)(8)); cf.&para;<br>post, at 10 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But in those cases&para;<br>there was no suggestion that any other provisions enu&para;<br>merated in §2254(d) were at issue. That is not the case&para;<br>here. In treating §2254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory&para;<br>exception, and by failing to address Jefferson’s argument&para;<br>that the state court’s procedures deprived its findings of&para;<br>deference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and&para;<br>our precedents incorrectly.&para;<br>Although we have stated that a court’s “verbatim adop&para;<br>tion of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties”&para;<br>should be treated as findings of the court, we have also&para;<br>criticized that practice. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And&para;<br>we have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the applica&para;<br>tion of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice&para;<br>where (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,&para;<br>(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to&para;<br>criticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts&para;<br>findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that&para;<br>the judge may not have read them. Cf. id., at 568; Ga.&para;<br>Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibit&para;<br>ing ex parte judicial communications).&para;<br>We decline to determine in the first instance whether&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Wilkinson, 544 U. S.&para;<br>709, 718, n. 7 (2005), especially given that the facts sur&para;<br>rounding the state habeas court’s process are undeveloped.&para;<br>Respondent has conceded that it drafted the state court’s&para;<br>final order at that court’s request and that the order was&para;<br>adopted verbatim, 263 Ga., at 317, 431 S.

E. 2d, at 111&para;<br>(noting dispute as to whether Jefferson “had a chance to&para;<br>respond” to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.&para;<br>Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts&para;<br>to determine on remand whether the state court’s factual&para;<br>findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to&para;<br>conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in&para;<br>light of their resolution of that issue. See Townsend,&para;<br>supra, at 313–319; Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1&para;<br>(1992).

Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,&para;<br>dissenting.&para;<br>The question presented by Jefferson’s petition for writ of&para;<br>certiorari is whether his trial attorneys rendered ineffec&para;<br>tive assistance of counsel when they declined to pursue&para;<br>further investigation of Jefferson’s childhood head injury.&para;<br>In my view the Court should either answer that question&para;<br>or (as I would prefer) deny the petition. Instead, it sum&para;<br>marily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an&para;<br>altogether different ground that was neither raised nor&para;<br>passed upon below and that is not fairly included within&para;<br>the sole question presented. To make matters worse, the&para;<br>Court conjures up an “error” with respect to that ground&para;<br>by misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>opinion, ante, at 9–10, and by overlooking relevant author&para;<br>ity from this Court. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The prior version of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.)&para;<br>applicable in this case provided that in federal habeas&para;<br>proceedings the factual determinations of a state court&para;<br>“shall be presumed to be correct,” unless the applicant&para;<br>proves, the respondent admits, or a federal court deter&para;<br>mines that one of eight exceptions set forth in §2254(d)(1)–&para;<br>(8) applies. The Court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>misapplied that provision and our precedents by treating&para;<br>one of those exceptions, §2254(d)(8), “as the exclusive&para;<br>statutory exception” to the presumption of correctness,&para;<br>and by failing to address whether §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7)&para;<br>might also bar application of that presumption.1 Ante, at&para;<br>10.&para;<br>The Court’s opinion, however, is the first anyone (in&para;<br>cluding Jefferson) has heard of this argument. Jefferson’s&para;<br>briefs below contain no discussion or even citation of sub&para;<br>section (d)—let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)—and the&para;<br>courts below understandably never passed upon the appli&para;<br>cation of those provisions. Under our longstanding prac&para;<br>tice, that should be the end of the matter. See, e.g., Penn&para;<br>sylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212–&para;<br>213 (1998).&para;<br>But the Court insists, ante, at 5–6, 8–9, that if we squint&para;<br>at them long enough we can see in Jefferson’s briefs below&para;<br>a challenge to the state court’s fact-finding process cogni&para;<br>zable under §2254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of&para;<br>isolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds&para;<br>of pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court’s only&para;<br>evidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District&para;<br>Court, ante, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text&para;<br>(and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the “Prior&para;<br>Proceedings” section of his 180-page brief. Final Eviden&para;<br>tiary Brief and Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 These&para;<br>&para;<br>four exceptions in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.) were:&para;<br>“(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was&para;<br>not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing;&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate&para;<br>hearing in the State court proceeding; or&para;<br>“(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the&para;<br>State court proceeding;&para;<br>“(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a consideration of [the rele&para;<br>vant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determi&para;<br>nation is not fairly supported by the record . . . .”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The sentence is: “In&para;<br>entering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton&para;<br>merely signed an order drafted by the State without revi&para;<br>sion of a single word.” Id., at 4. The footnote adds:&para;<br>“[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described wit&para;<br>nesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to&para;<br>whether he even read, much less carefully considered,&para;<br>the proposed order submitted by the State. In this&para;<br>circumstance, there is no reason under principles of&para;<br>comity or otherwise to give any deference to the find&para;<br>ings of the State Habeas Court, because there was ap&para;<br>parently no serious consideration or deliberation of&para;<br>the factual and legal issues raised.” Ibid., n. 1.&para;<br>This passing suggestion that deference would be unwar&para;<br>ranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that&para;<br>the state fact-finding procedure was inadequate,&para;<br>§2254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and&para;<br>adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was de&para;<br>nied due process of law, §2254(d)(7). And it only appeared,&para;<br>I emphasize again, in the “Prior Proceedings” section of&para;<br>the brief. The argument section of Jefferson’s District&para;<br>Court Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing sepa&para;<br>rate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no&para;<br>mention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.&para;<br>And the assignment of error that is the basis for the ques&para;<br>tion presented in Jefferson’s petition, VI, id., at 47–80, did&para;<br>not dispute the state courts’ factual findings under&para;<br>§2254(d), but only challenged the state courts’ legal con&para;<br>clusion that his attorneys’ failure to conduct a fuller inves&para;<br>tigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not&para;<br>deficient performance under Strickland v. Washington,&para;<br>466 U. S. 668 (1984).&para;<br>Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>state courts’ “[f]indings of fact and credibility determina&para;<br>tions are reviewed for clear error.” Brief for Peti&para;<br>tioner/Appellee, No. 07–12502, pp. 16–17 (hereinafter&para;<br>Appeals Brief). It declared that “The District Court Cor&para;<br>rectly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court” in&para;<br>adjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.&para;<br>Id., at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see&para;<br>also id., at 29, and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with&para;<br>respect to the ineffective-assistance claim, “[t]he relevant&para;<br>facts are not in dispute.” Id., at 24. Jefferson did charac&para;<br>terize the state habeas court’s factual findings as gener&para;<br>ally “dubious” and suggested there were “serious doubts”&para;<br>about them, id., at 32, n. 10. But not once did he argue&para;<br>that the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence&para;<br>of a failure to meet the requirements of §2254(d)(2), (6), or&para;<br>(7)—or even more generally that the findings should not&para;<br>be presumed correct under §2254(d). Instead, he pressed&para;<br>the same argument he made in the District Court: Even if&para;<br>the state courts’ factual findings were correct, his trial&para;<br>attorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to&para;<br>forgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.&para;<br>Id., at 31–33, 50–51.&para;<br>Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the&para;<br>Court now addresses. The District Court did not dispute&para;<br>the state courts’ factual findings. Jefferson v. Terry, 490&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1319–1320 (ND Ga. 2007). It accepted&para;<br>those findings as true, including the state habeas court’s&para;<br>credibility findings, id., at 1323–1324, and n. 17, but held&para;<br>“as a matter of law” that it was objectively unreasonable&para;<br>for Jefferson’s attorneys “not to investigate” further into&para;<br>the effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson’s mental&para;<br>capacity and health, id., at 1324. Concluding that Jeffer&para;<br>son was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sen&para;<br>tencing hearing. Id., at 1328.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination&para;<br>and reversed, holding that his trial attorneys’ performance&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was not objectively unreasonable under Strickland. Jef&para;<br>ferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1301–1309 (CA11 2009).&para;<br>That court correctly stated the applicable framework&para;<br>under §2254(d):&para;<br>“Pre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions&para;<br>of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are re&para;<br>viewed de novo, while the state courts’ factual findings&para;<br>are ‘subject to the presumption of correctness.’&para;<br>Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 861 (11th Cir.&para;<br>1999). Although these findings may be disregarded if,&para;<br>for example, they are not ‘fairly supported by the re&para;<br>cord,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (11th&para;<br>Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)), this Court&para;<br>has construed the ‘presumption of correctness’ stan&para;<br>dard to be the same as the ‘clear error’ standard of&para;<br>review.” Id., at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Confronted with no argument that §2254(d)(1)–(7) applied&para;<br>or that it must disregard the state courts’ factual findings,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon&para;<br>those questions.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own,&para;<br>as required by §2254(d)(8), to determine whether the state&para;<br>courts’ factual determinations were fairly supported by the&para;<br>record. Id., at 1303–1304, and n. 8. In doing so, the court&para;<br>“specifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district&para;<br>court questioned the state court’s factual finding that [the&para;<br>defense’s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson’s attor&para;<br>ney’s] to believe that further investigation would simply&para;<br>be a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney’s] testimony&para;<br>that [the expert] told him it ‘may’ be a waste of time.” Id.,&para;<br>at 1303, n. 8. It added that Jefferson did not “point to any&para;<br>particular finding that was clearly erroneous,” id., at 1304,&para;<br>n. 8—applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed&para;<br>in his brief, see supra, at 3. Even the dissent agreed that&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the court was “obliged to accept” the state courts’ credibil&para;<br>ity determination, despite the “reasons to doubt it.” 570&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not&para;<br>cite §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the&para;<br>same question of constitutional law that occupied Jeffer&para;<br>son’s briefs, the District Court’s opinion, and the major&para;<br>ity’s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and&para;<br>credibility determination of the state courts as true, Jef&para;<br>ferson’s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of coun&para;<br>sel. That is only the question that occupied the courts and&para;<br>the parties below.&para;<br>B&para;<br>It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not&para;<br>raised or resolved in the lower courts. It is much worse&para;<br>that it decides an issue Jefferson has not even asked us to&para;<br>address. Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the&para;<br>questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included&para;<br>therein, will be considered by the Court.” We apply that&para;<br>rule in all but “the most exceptional cases, where reasons&para;<br>of urgency or of economy suggest the need to address the&para;<br>unpresented question under consideration.” Yee v. Escon&para;<br>dido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (citation and internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Jefferson’s petition for writ of certiorari presents a&para;<br>single question:&para;<br>“[W]hether the majority opinion, in affording trial&para;<br>counsel’s decision to limit the scope of investigation in&para;<br>a death penalty case ‘higher-than-strong presumption&para;<br>of reasonableness’ [sic] conflicts with this Court’s&para;<br>precedent as announced in Williams v.

There is no argument, anywhere in the section&para;<br>entitled “Reasons for Granting the Writ,” that the state&para;<br>courts’ factual findings are not entitled to a presumption&para;<br>of correctness.&para;<br>The Court claims, ante, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently&para;<br>presented the statutory issue by his characterizations of&para;<br>the state courts’ factual findings in the “Statement of the&para;<br>Case” section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17,&para;<br>n. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, “ ‘the fact that [peti&para;<br>tioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for&para;<br>certiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires&para;<br>that a subsidiary question be fairly included in the ques&para;<br>tion presented for our review.’ ” Wood v. Allen, 558 U.

But in any event, the&para;<br>cited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue.&para;<br>They contain no argument that §2254(d)’s presumption is&para;<br>inapplicable because of §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely&para;<br>describe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13,&para;<br>and assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>court findings (but for the §2254(d) presumption), see id.,&para;<br>at 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13.&para;<br>“The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate&para;<br>courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry&para;<br>and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions&para;<br>presented and argued by the parties before them.” Car&para;<br>ducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion&para;<br>of Scalia, J.). Our refusal to abide by standard rules of&para;<br>appellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose&para;<br>judgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respon&para;<br>dent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without ever&para;<br>having an opportunity to address the merits of the statu&para;<br>tory question the Court decides.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court’s approach would be objectionable even if it&para;<br>were correct that the Court of Appeals went astray. But&para;<br>it is not. The Court of Appeals did not treat §2254(d)(8)&para;<br>as “the exclusive statutory exception” to the presumption&para;<br>of correctness. Ante, at 10. It is true that the major&para;<br>ity’s opinion—as well as the dissent’s—discussed only&para;<br>§2254(d)(8). But that is because only §2254(d)(8), and&para;<br>not §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the&para;<br>court’s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Elev&para;<br>enth Circuit’s opinion, there simply was no error in its&para;<br>application of §2254(d).&para;<br>The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>ignored the other seven paragraphs in §2254(d) when it&para;<br>“invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8)&para;<br>of §2254(d).” Ante, at 9. It did nothing of the sort. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals said that a state court’s factual findings&para;<br>“may be disregarded if, for example, they are not ‘fairly&para;<br>supported by the record,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d&para;<br>1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(8)).” 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The&para;<br>Court of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§2254(d)(8) was but one example of the grounds for disre&para;<br>garding a state court’s factual findings. And the Circuit&para;<br>precedent it cited, Jackson v. Herring, similarly did not&para;<br>imply, much less hold, that §2254(d)(8) provided the only&para;<br>grounds for setting aside a state court’s factual findings&para;<br>under §2254(d). See 42 F. 3d, at 1366.&para;<br>Next, the Court states:&para;<br>“And even though the Court of Appeals ‘recognize[d]’&para;<br>that Jefferson had argued that the state court’s proc&para;<br>ess had produced factual findings that were ‘ “dubious&para;<br>at best,” ’ and that federal courts should therefore&para;<br>‘ “harbor serious doubts about” ’ the state court’s&para;<br>‘ “findings of fact and credibility,” ’ the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings&para;<br>are ‘ “entitled to a presumption of correctness” ’ that it&para;<br>was ‘ “duty-bound” ’ to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8&para;<br>(quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).” Ante, at 9.&para;<br>Again, the Court has plucked isolated language from here&para;<br>and there in the Court of Appeals’ opinion, to produce a&para;<br>reading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed&para;<br>with, or at least did not contest, Jefferson’s claim of “seri&para;<br>ous doubts.” That is not so. In the first paragraph of&para;<br>footnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was&para;<br>“duty-bound to accept” the state courts’ factual findings&para;<br>because it concluded they “are clear, unambiguous, and&para;<br>fairly supported by the record.” 570 F. 3d, at 1303–1304,&para;<br>n. 8. That language precedes the panel’s analysis—in the&para;<br>second paragraph of footnote eight—regarding Jefferson’s&para;<br>statements that the findings were “dubious” and raised&para;<br>“serious doubts.” The Court omits the panel’s actual&para;<br>explanation for declining to credit Jefferson’s general&para;<br>characterization of the quality of the record, which is:&para;<br>“Jefferson does not point to any particular factual finding&para;<br>that was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the&para;<br>argument section of his brief that, ‘[t]he relevant facts are&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>JEFFERSON v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not in dispute.’ ” Id., at 1304, n. 8.&para;<br>By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly&para;<br>described application of the pre-AEDPA version of&para;<br>§2254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that&para;<br>would have been no worse than what we have done. For&para;<br>example, in Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731, 735&para;<br>(1990) (per curiam), we stated that a federal court may not&para;<br>overturn a state habeas court’s factual determinations&para;<br>“unless it concludes that they are not ‘fairly supported by&para;<br>the record.’ See 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8).” And in Parker v.&para;<br>Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991), we explained that a&para;<br>federal habeas court “is not to overturn a factual conclu&para;<br>sion of a state court, including a state appellate court,&para;<br>unless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the&para;<br>record.’ ”2&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the&para;<br>duly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we&para;<br>find it to have been in error. More specifically, except&para;<br>where there has been an intervening legal development&para;<br>(such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground&para;<br>that they contained “no suggestion that any other provisions enumer&para;<br>ated in §2254(d) were at issue,” whereas “[t]hat is not the case here.”&para;<br>Ante, at 10. That is simply not so. As already noted, there was no&para;<br>“suggestion” here (let alone an actual argument) that paragraphs (2),&para;<br>(6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that&para;<br>petitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true—and&para;<br>indeed more true—of Parker and Demosthenes. In Parker, we stated&para;<br>the “crux of [petitioner’s] contentions” was that the state courts “fail[ed]&para;<br>to treat adequately” the evidence he presented. 498 U. S., at 313. In&para;<br>Demosthenes, the Ninth Circuit had said that the state court’s process&para;<br>for determining whether the capital inmate was competent was defi&para;<br>cient because “ ‘a full evidentiary hearing on competence should have&para;<br>been held.’ ” 495 U. S., at 736 (quoting Order in Baal v. Godinez, No.&para;<br>90–15716 (CA9, June 2, 1990), p. 5).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.
