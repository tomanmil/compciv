Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. ET AL. v. AMARA ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY &para;<br>&para;<br>AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED&para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–804.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 16, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Until 1998, petitioner CIGNA Corporation’s pension plan provided a&para;<br>retiring employee with an annuity based on preretirement salary and&para;<br>length of service. Its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash&para;<br>balance based on a defined annual contribution from CIGNA, in&para;<br>creased by compound interest. The new plan translated already&para;<br>earned benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the&para;<br>cash balance account. Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the&para;<br>CIGNA Pension Plan (also a petitioner), challenged the new plan’s&para;<br>adoption, claiming, as relevant here, that CIGNA’s notice of the&para;<br>changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain&para;<br>respects provided them with less generous benefits. The District&para;<br>Court found that CIGNA’s disclosures violated its obligations under&para;<br>§§102(a), 104(b), and 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Se&para;<br>curity Act of 1974 (ERISA). In determining relief, it found that&para;<br>CIGNA’s notice defects had caused the employees “likely harm.” It&para;<br>then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits ac&para;<br>cordingly, finding its authority in ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), which author&para;<br>izes a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil action” to “re&para;<br>cover benefits due . . . under the terms of his plan.” The Second&para;<br>Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Although §502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority&para;<br>to reform CIGNA’s plan, relief is authorized by §502(a)(3), which al&para;<br>lows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to obtain other appropri&para;<br>ate equitable relief” to redress violations of ERISA “or the [plan’s]&para;<br>terms.” Pp. 12–20.&para;<br>(a) The court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It ordered the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>terms of the plan reformed. Step 2: It ordered CIGNA to enforce the&para;<br>plan as reformed. Step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by&para;<br>the “terms of [the reformed] plan” and is thus consistent with&para;<br>§502(a)(1)(B). However, that provision—which speaks of “enforc[ing]”&para;<br>the plan’s terms, not changing them—does not suggest that it author&para;<br>izes a court to alter those terms here, where the change, akin to re&para;<br>forming a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a con&para;<br>tract as written and more like an equitable remedy. Nor can the&para;<br>Court accept the Solicitor General’s alternative rationale: that the&para;<br>District Court enforced the summary plan descriptions and that they&para;<br>are plan terms. That reading cannot be squared with ERISA §102(a),&para;<br>which obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descrip&para;<br>tions, but does not suggest that information about the plan provided&para;<br>by those disclosures is itself part of the plan.&para;<br>Nothing in&para;<br>§502(a)(1)(B) suggests the contrary. The Solicitor General’s reading&para;<br>also cannot be squared with the statute’s division of authority be&para;<br>tween a plan’s sponsor—who, like a trust’s settlor, creates the plan’s&para;<br>basic terms and conditions, executes a written instrument containing&para;<br>those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument a proce&para;<br>dure for making amendments—and the plan’s administrator—a trus&para;<br>tee-like fiduciary who manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so,&para;<br>and provides participants with the summary plan descriptions. ERISA carefully distinguishes these roles, and there is no reason to be&para;<br>lieve that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the&para;<br>administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly in the summa&para;<br>ries, even when, as here, the administrator is also the plan sponsor.&para;<br>Finally, it is difficult to reconcile an interpretation that would make a&para;<br>summary’s language legally binding with the basic summary plan&para;<br>description objective of clear, simple communication. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(b) This Court has interpreted §502(a)(3)’s phrase “appropriate&para;<br>equitable relief” as referring to “ ‘those categories of relief ’ ” that, be&para;<br>fore the merger of law and equity,“ ‘were typically available in eq&para;<br>uity.’ ” Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356,&para;<br>361. This case—concerning a beneficiary’s suit against a plan fiduci&para;<br>ary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a&para;<br>plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust)—is the kind of lawsuit&para;<br>that, before the merger, could have been brought only in an equity&para;<br>court, where the remedies available were traditionally considered eq&para;<br>uitable remedies. The District Court’s injunctions obviously fall&para;<br>within this category. The other relief it ordered closely resembles&para;<br>three forms of traditional equitable relief. First, what the court did&para;<br>here may be regarded as the reformation of the plan’s terms, in order&para;<br>to remedy false or misleading information CIGNA provided. The&para;<br>power to reform contracts is a traditional power of an equity court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and is used to prevent fraud. Second, the part of the remedy holding&para;<br>CIGNA to its promise that the new plan would not take from its em&para;<br>ployees previously accrued benefits resembles estoppel, also a tradi&para;<br>tional equitable remedy. Third, the injunctions require the plan ad&para;<br>ministrator to pay already retired beneficiaries money owed them&para;<br>under the plan as reformed. Equity courts possessed the power to&para;<br>provide monetary “compensation” for a loss resulting from a trustee’s&para;<br>breach of duty, or to prevent the trustee’s unjust enrichment. That&para;<br>surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fidu&para;<br>ciary encompassing any violation of duty imposed on that fiduciary.&para;<br>Pp. 16–20.&para;<br>2. Because §502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable relief” for&para;<br>violations of ERISA, the relevant standard of harm will depend on&para;<br>the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief. That&para;<br>court is to conduct the analysis in the first instance, but there are&para;<br>several equitable principles that it might apply on remand. Neither&para;<br>ERISA’s relevant substantive provisions nor §502(a)(3) sets a particu&para;<br>lar standard for determining harm. And equity law provides no gen&para;<br>eral principle that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a&para;<br>remedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement arises, it is&para;<br>because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that re&para;<br>quirement. Thus, when a court exercises authority under §502(a)(3)&para;<br>to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental&para;<br>reliance must be made. However, equity courts did not insist on a&para;<br>detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where&para;<br>a fraudulent suppression, omission, or insertion materially affected&para;<br>the substance of a contract. Nor did they require a detrimental reli&para;<br>ance showing when they ordered surcharge. They simply ordered a&para;<br>trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee’s breach of trust.&para;<br>This flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance require&para;<br>ment. To be sure, a fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3)&para;<br>only upon a showing of actual harm, and such harm may consist of&para;<br>detrimental reliance. But it might also come from the loss of a right&para;<br>protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. It is not difficult to&para;<br>imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here,&para;<br>in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they did not them&para;<br>selves act in reliance on the summaries. Thus, to obtain relief by&para;<br>surcharge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or&para;<br>beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury, but need&para;<br>show only actual harm and causation, not detrimental reliance.&para;<br>Pp. 20–22.&para;<br>348 Fed.

Previously,&para;<br>the plan provided a retiring employee with a defined&para;<br>benefit in the form of an annuity calculated on the basis of&para;<br>his preretirement salary and length of service. The new&para;<br>plan provided most retiring employees with a (lump sum)&para;<br>cash balance calculated on the basis of a defined annual&para;<br>contribution from CIGNA as increased by compound inter&para;<br>est. Because many employees had already earned at least&para;<br>some old-plan benefits, the new plan translated already&para;<br>earned benefits into an opening amount in the employee’s&para;<br>cash balance account.&para;<br>Respondents, acting on behalf of approximately 25,000&para;<br>beneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (which is also a&para;<br>petitioner here), challenged CIGNA’s adoption of the new&para;<br>plan. They claimed in part that CIGNA had failed to give&para;<br>them proper notice of changes to their benefits, particu&para;<br>larly because the new plan in certain respects provided&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>them with less generous benefits. See Employee Retire&para;<br>ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) §§102(a),&para;<br>104(b), 204(h), 88 Stat. 841, 848, 862, as amended, 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h).&para;<br>The District Court agreed that the disclosures made by&para;<br>CIGNA violated its obligations under ERISA. In deter&para;<br>mining relief, the court found that CIGNA’s notice failures&para;<br>had caused the employees “likely harm.” The Court then&para;<br>reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits&para;<br>accordingly. It found legal authority for doing so in&para;<br>ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B) (authoriz&para;<br>ing a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil&para;<br>action” to “recover benefits due to him under the terms of&para;<br>his plan”).&para;<br>We agreed to decide whether the District Court applied&para;<br>the correct legal standard, namely, a “likely harm” stan&para;<br>dard, in determining that CIGNA’s notice violations&para;<br>caused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal&para;<br>relief. To reach that question, we must first consider a&para;<br>more general matter—whether the ERISA section just&para;<br>mentioned (ERISA’s recovery-of-benefits-due provision,&para;<br>§502(a)(1)(B)) authorizes entry of the relief the District&para;<br>Court provided. We conclude that it does not authorize&para;<br>this relief. Nonetheless, we find that a different equity&para;<br>related ERISA provision, to which the District Court also&para;<br>referred, authorizes forms of relief similar to those that&para;<br>the court entered. §502(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3).&para;<br>Section 502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable&para;<br>relief ” for violations of ERISA. Accordingly, the relevant&para;<br>standard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by&para;<br>which the District Court provides relief. We leave it to the&para;<br>District Court to conduct that analysis in the first in&para;<br>stance, but we identify equitable principles that the court&para;<br>might apply on remand.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>Because our decision rests in important part upon the&para;<br>circumstances present here, we shall describe those cir&para;<br>cumstances in some detail. We still simplify in doing so.&para;<br>But the interested reader can find a more thorough de&para;<br>scription in two District Court opinions, which set forth&para;<br>that court’s findings reached after a lengthy trial. See 559&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 192 (Conn. 2008); 534 F. Supp. 2d 288 (Conn.&para;<br>2008).&para;<br>A&para;<br>Under CIGNA’s pre-1998 defined-benefit retirement&para;<br>plan, an employee with at least five years service would&para;<br>receive an annuity annually paying an amount that de&para;<br>pended upon the employee’s salary and length of service.&para;<br>Depending on when the employee had joined CIGNA, the&para;<br>annuity would equal either (1) 2 percent of the employee’s&para;<br>average salary over his final three years with CIGNA,&para;<br>multiplied by the number of years worked (up to 30); or (2)&para;<br>12⁄3 percent of the employee’s average salary over his final&para;<br>five years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years&para;<br>worked (up to 35). Calculated either way, the annuity&para;<br>would approach 60 percent of a longtime employee’s final&para;<br>salary. A well-paid longtime employee, earning, say,&para;<br>$160,000 per year, could receive a retirement annuity&para;<br>paying the employee about $96,000 per year until his&para;<br>death. The plan offered many employees at least one&para;<br>other benefit: They could retire early, at age 55, and re&para;<br>ceive an only-somewhat-reduced annuity.&para;<br>In November 1997, CIGNA sent its employees a news&para;<br>letter announcing that it intended to put in place a new&para;<br>pension plan. The new plan would substitute an “account&para;<br>balance plan” for CIGNA’s pre-existing defined-benefit&para;<br>system. App. 991a (emphasis deleted). The newsletter&para;<br>added that the old plan would end on December 31, 1997,&para;<br>that CIGNA would introduce (and describe) the new plan&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sometime during 1998, and that the new plan would apply&para;<br>retroactively to January 1, 1998.&para;<br>Eleven months later CIGNA filled in the details. Its&para;<br>new plan created an individual retirement account for&para;<br>each employee. (The account consisted of a bookkeeping&para;<br>entry backed by a CIGNA-funded trust.) Each year&para;<br>CIGNA would contribute to the employee’s individual&para;<br>account an amount equal to between 3 percent and 8.5&para;<br>percent of the employee’s salary, depending upon age,&para;<br>length of service, and certain other factors. The account&para;<br>balance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to&para;<br>the return on 5-year treasury bills plus one-quarter per&para;<br>cent (but no less than 4.5 percent and no greater than 9&para;<br>percent). Upon retirement the employee would receive the&para;<br>amount then in his or her individual account—in the form&para;<br>of either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum&para;<br>then would buy. As promised, CIGNA would open the&para;<br>accounts and begin to make contributions as of January 1,&para;<br>1998.&para;<br>But what about the retirement benefits that employees&para;<br>had already earned prior to January 1, 1998? CIGNA&para;<br>promised to make an initial contribution to the individ&para;<br>ual’s account equal to the value of that employee’s already&para;<br>earned benefits. And the new plan set forth a method for&para;<br>calculating that initial contribution. The method con&para;<br>sisted of calculating the amount as of the employee’s&para;<br>(future) retirement date of the annuity to which the em&para;<br>ployee’s salary and length of service already (i.e., as of&para;<br>December 31, 1997) entitled him and then discounting&para;<br>that sum to its present (i.e., January 1, 1998) value.&para;<br>An example will help: Imagine an employee born on&para;<br>January 1, 1966, who joined CIGNA in January 1991 on&para;<br>his 25th birthday, and who (during the five years preced&para;<br>ing the plan changeover) earned an average salary of&para;<br>$100,000 per year. As of January 1, 1998, the old plan&para;<br>would have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>$100,000 times 7 (years then worked) times 12⁄3 percent, or&para;<br>$11,667 per year—when he retired in 2031 at age 65. The&para;<br>2031 price of an annuity paying $11,667 per year until&para;<br>death depends upon interest rates and mortality assump&para;<br>tions at that time. If we assume the annuity would pay 7&para;<br>percent until the holder’s death (and we use the mortality&para;<br>assumptions used by the plan, see App. 407a (incorporat&para;<br>ing the mortality table prescribed by Rev. Rul. 95–6,&para;<br>1995–1 Cum. Bull. 80)), then the 2031 price of such an&para;<br>annuity would be about $120,500. And CIGNA should&para;<br>initially deposit in this individual’s account on January 1,&para;<br>1998, an amount that will grow to become $120,500, 33&para;<br>years later, in 2031, when the individual retires. If we&para;<br>assume a 5 percent average interest rate, then that&para;<br>amount presently (i.e., as of January 1, 1998) equals about&para;<br>$24,000. And (with one further mortality-related adjust&para;<br>ment that we shall describe infra, at 6–7) that is the&para;<br>amount, more or less, that the new plan’s transition rules&para;<br>would have required CIGNA initially to deposit. Then&para;<br>CIGNA would make further annual deposits, and all the&para;<br>deposited amounts would earn compound interest. When&para;<br>the employee retired, he would receive the resulting lump&para;<br>sum.&para;<br>The new plan also provided employees a guarantee: An&para;<br>employee would receive upon retirement either (1) the&para;<br>amount to which he or she had become entitled as of&para;<br>January 1, 1998, or (2) the amount then in his or her&para;<br>individual account, whichever was greater. Thus, the&para;<br>employee in our example would receive (in 2031) no less&para;<br>than an annuity paying $11,667 per year for life.&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>The District Court found that CIGNA’s initial descrip&para;<br>tions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and&para;<br>misled its employees. In November 1997, for example,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA sent the employees a newsletter that said the new&para;<br>plan would “significantly enhance” its “retirement pro&para;<br>gram,” would produce “an overall improvement in . . .&para;<br>retirement benefits,” and would provide “the same benefit&para;<br>security” with “steadier benefit growth.” App. 990a, 991a,&para;<br>993a. CIGNA also told its employees that they would “see&para;<br>the growth in [their] total retirement benefits from&para;<br>CIGNA every year,” id., at 952a, that its initial deposit&para;<br>“represent[ed] the full value of the benefit [they] earned&para;<br>for service before 1998,” Record E–503 (Exh. 98), and that&para;<br>“[o]ne advantage the company will not get from the re&para;<br>tirement program changes is cost savings.” App. 993a.&para;<br>In fact, the new plan saved the company $10 million&para;<br>annually (though CIGNA later said it devoted the savings&para;<br>to other employee benefits). Its initial deposit did not&para;<br>“represen[t] the full value of the benefit” that employees&para;<br>had “earned for service before 1998.” And the plan made a&para;<br>significant number of employees worse off in at least the&para;<br>following specific ways:&para;<br>First, the initial deposit calculation ignored the fact that&para;<br>the old plan offered many CIGNA employees the right to&para;<br>retire early (beginning at age 55) with only somewhat&para;<br>reduced benefits. This right was valuable. For example,&para;<br>as of January 1, 1998, respondent Janice Amara had&para;<br>earned vested age-55 retirement benefits of $1,833 per&para;<br>month, but CIGNA’s initial deposit in her new-plan indi&para;<br>vidual retirement account (ignoring this benefit) would&para;<br>have allowed her at age 55 to buy an annuity benefit of&para;<br>only $900 per month.&para;<br>Second, as we previously indicated but did not explain,&para;<br>supra at 5, the new plan adjusted CIGNA’s initial deposit&para;<br>downward to account for the fact that, unlike the old&para;<br>plan’s lifetime annuity, an employee’s survivors would&para;<br>receive the new plan’s benefits (namely, the amount in the&para;<br>employee’s individual account) even if the employee died&para;<br>before retiring. The downward adjustment consisted of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>multiplying the otherwise-required deposit by the prob&para;<br>ability that the employee would live until retirement—a&para;<br>90 percent probability in the example of our 32-year-old,&para;<br>supra, at 4–5. And that meant that CIGNA’s initial de&para;<br>posit in our example—the amount that was supposed to&para;<br>grow to $120,500 by 2031—would be less than $22,000,&para;<br>not $24,000 (the number we computed). The employee, of&para;<br>course, would receive a benefit in return—namely, a form&para;<br>of life insurance. But at least some employees might have&para;<br>preferred the retirement benefit and consequently could&para;<br>reasonably have thought it important to know that the&para;<br>new plan traded away one-tenth of their already-earned&para;<br>benefits for a life insurance policy that they might not&para;<br>have wanted.&para;<br>Third, the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest&para;<br>rates from CIGNA to its employees. Under the old plan,&para;<br>CIGNA had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that&para;<br>paid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling inter&para;<br>est rates made it more expensive for CIGNA to pay for&para;<br>that annuity. And falling interest rates also meant that&para;<br>any sum CIGNA set aside to buy that annuity would grow&para;<br>more slowly over time, thereby requiring CIGNA to set&para;<br>aside more money to make any specific sum available at&para;<br>retirement. Under the new plan CIGNA did not have to&para;<br>buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific&para;<br>sum. The employee would simply receive whatever sum&para;<br>his account contained. And falling interest rates meant&para;<br>that the account’s lump sum would earn less money each&para;<br>year after the employee retired. Annuities, for example,&para;<br>would become more expensive (any fixed purchase price&para;<br>paying for less annual income). At the same time falling&para;<br>interest meant that the individual account would grow&para;<br>more slowly over time, leaving the employee with less&para;<br>money at retirement.&para;<br>Of course, interest rates might rise instead of fall, leav&para;<br>ing CIGNA’s employees better off under the new plan.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>But the latter advantage does not cancel out the former&para;<br>disadvantage, for most individuals are risk averse. And&para;<br>that means that most of CIGNA’s employees would have&para;<br>preferred that CIGNA, rather than they, bear these risks.&para;<br>The amounts likely involved are significant. If, in our&para;<br>example, interest rates between 1998 and 2031 averaged 4&para;<br>percent rather than the 5 percent we assumed, and if in&para;<br>2031 annuities paid 6 percent rather than the 7 percent&para;<br>we assumed, then CIGNA would have had to make an&para;<br>initial deposit of $35,500 (not $24,000) to assure that&para;<br>employee the $11,667 annual annuity payment to which&para;<br>he had already become entitled. Indeed, that $24,000 that&para;<br>CIGNA would have contributed (leaving aside the life&para;<br>insurance problem) would have provided enough money to&para;<br>buy (in 2031) an annuity that assured the employee an&para;<br>annual payment of only about $8,000 (rather than&para;<br>$11,667).&para;<br>We recognize that the employee in our example (like&para;<br>others) might have continued to work for CIGNA after&para;<br>January 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have&para;<br>earned a pension that, by the time of his retirement, was&para;<br>worth far more than $11,667. But that is so because&para;<br>CIGNA made an additional contribution for each year&para;<br>worked after January 1, 1998. If interest rates fell (as&para;<br>they did), it would take the employee several additional&para;<br>years of work simply to catch up (under the new plan) to&para;<br>where he had already been (under the old plan) as of&para;<br>January 1, 1998—a phenomenon known in pension jargon&para;<br>as “wear away,” see 534 F. Supp. 2d, at 303–304 (referring&para;<br>to respondents’ requiring 6 to 10 years to catch up).&para;<br>The District Court found that CIGNA told its employees&para;<br>nothing about any of these features of the new plan—&para;<br>which individually and together made clear that CIGNA’s&para;<br>descriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate.&para;<br>The District Court also found that CIGNA intentionally&para;<br>misled its employees. A focus group and many employees&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>asked CIGNA, for example, to “ ‘[d]isclose details’ ” about&para;<br>the plan, to provide “ ‘individual comparisons,’ ” or to show&para;<br>“ ‘[a]n actual projection for retirement.’ ” Id., at 342. But&para;<br>CIGNA did not do so. Instead (in the words of one inter&para;<br>nal document), it “ ‘focus[ed] on NOT providing employees&para;<br>before and after samples of the Pension Plan changes.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 343.&para;<br>The District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that&para;<br>CIGNA’s representations (and omissions) about the plan,&para;<br>made between November 1997 (when it announced the&para;<br>plan) and December 1998 (when it put the plan into effect)&para;<br>violated:&para;<br>(a) ERISA §204(h), implemented by Treas. Reg.&para;<br>§1.411(d)–6, 26 CFR §1.411(d)–6 (2000), which (as it ex&para;<br>isted at the relevant time) forbade an amendment of a&para;<br>pension plan that would “provide for a significant reduc&para;<br>tion in the rate of future benefit accrual” unless the plan&para;<br>administrator also sent a “written notice” that provided&para;<br>either the text of the amendment or summarized its likely&para;<br>effects, 29 U. S. C. §1054(h) (2000 ed.) (amended 2001);&para;<br>Treas. Reg. §1.411(d)–6, Q&amp;A–10, 63 Fed. Reg. 68682&para;<br>(1998); and&para;<br>(b) ERISA §§102(a) and 104(b), which require a plan&para;<br>administrator to provide beneficiaries with summary plan&para;<br>descriptions and with summaries of material modifica&para;<br>tions, “written in a manner calculated to be understood by&para;<br>the average plan participant,” that are “sufficiently accu&para;<br>rate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such par&para;<br>ticipants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations&para;<br>under the plan,” 29 U. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b) (2006 ed.&para;<br>and Supp. III).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The District Court then turned to the remedy. First, the&para;<br>court agreed with CIGNA that only employees whom&para;<br>CIGNA’s disclosure failures had harmed could obtain&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relief. But it did not require each individual member of&para;<br>the relevant CIGNA employee class to show individual&para;<br>injury. Rather, it found (1) that the evidence presented&para;<br>had raised a presumption of “likely harm” suffered by the&para;<br>members of the relevant employee class, and (2) that&para;<br>CIGNA, though free to offer contrary evidence in respect&para;<br>to some or all of those employees, had failed to rebut that&para;<br>presumption. It concluded that this unrebutted showing&para;<br>was sufficient to warrant class-applicable relief.&para;<br>Second, the court noted that §204(h) had been inter&para;<br>preted by the Second Circuit to permit the invalidation of&para;<br>plan amendments not preceded by a proper notice, prior to&para;<br>the 2001 amendment that made this power explicit. 559&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 207 (citing Frommert v. Conkright, 433&para;<br>F. 3d 254, 263 (2006)); see 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(6) (2006&para;<br>ed.) (entitling participants to benefits “without regard to&para;<br>[the] amendment” in case of an “egregious failure”). But&para;<br>the court also thought that granting this relief here would&para;<br>harm, not help, the injured employees. That is because&para;<br>the notice failures all concerned the new plan that took&para;<br>effect in December 1998. The court thought that the&para;<br>notices in respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits,&para;<br>effective December 31, 1997, were valid. To strike the new&para;<br>plan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not&para;<br>help CIGNA’s employees.&para;<br>The court considered treating the November 1997 notice&para;<br>as a sham or treating that notice and the later 1998 no&para;<br>tices as part and parcel of a single set of related events.&para;<br>But it pointed out that respondents “ha[d] argued none of&para;<br>these things.” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 208. And it said that&para;<br>the court would “not make these arguments now on [re&para;<br>spondents’] behalf.” Ibid.&para;<br>Third, the court reformed the terms of the new plan’s&para;<br>guarantee. It erased the portion that assured participants&para;<br>who retired the greater of “A” (that which they had al&para;<br>ready earned as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>$11,667 in our example) or “B” (that which they would&para;<br>earn via CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan,&para;<br>including CIGNA’s initial deposit). And it substituted a&para;<br>provision that would guarantee each employee “A” (that&para;<br>which they had already earned, as of December 31, 1997,&para;<br>under the old plan) plus “B” (that which they would earn&para;<br>via CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan, exclud&para;<br>ing CIGNA’s initial deposit). In our example, the District&para;<br>Court’s remedy would no longer force our employee to&para;<br>choose upon retirement either an $11,667 annuity or his&para;<br>new plan benefits (including both CIGNA’s annual depos&para;<br>its and CIGNA’s initial deposit). It would give him an&para;<br>$11,667 annuity plus his new plan benefits (with CIGNA’s&para;<br>annual deposits but without CIGNA’s initial deposit).&para;<br>Fourth, the court “order[ed] and enjoin[ed] the CIGNA&para;<br>Plan to reform its records to reflect that all class members&para;<br>. . . now receive [the just described] ‘A + B’ benefits,” and&para;<br>that it pay appropriate benefits to those class members&para;<br>who had already retired. Id., at 222.&para;<br>Fifth, the court held that ERISA §502(a)(1)(B) provided&para;<br>the legal authority to enter this relief. That provision&para;<br>states that a “civil action may be brought” by a plan “par&para;<br>ticipant or beneficiary . . . to recover benefits due to him&para;<br>under the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).&para;<br>The court wrote that its orders in effect awarded “benefits&para;<br>under the terms of the plan” as reformed. 559 F. Supp. 2d,&para;<br>at 212.&para;<br>At the same time the court considered whether ERISA&para;<br>§502(a)(3) also provided legal authority to enter this relief.&para;<br>That provision states that a civil action may be brought&para;<br>“by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to en&para;<br>join any act or practice which violates any provision of&para;<br>this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to ob&para;<br>tain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress&para;<br>such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>subchapter or the terms of the plan.”&para;<br>§1132(a)(3) (emphasis added).&para;<br>&para;<br>29 U. S. C.&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court decided not to answer this question&para;<br>because (1) it had just decided that the same relief was&para;<br>available under §502(a)(1)(B), regardless, cf. Varity Corp.&para;<br>v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 515 (1996); and (2) the Supreme&para;<br>Court has “issued several opinions . . . that have severely&para;<br>curtailed the kinds of relief that are available under&para;<br>§502(a)(3),” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205 (citing Sereboff v.&para;<br>Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356 (2006);&para;<br>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.&para;<br>204 (2002); and Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S.&para;<br>248 (1993)).&para;<br>3&para;<br>The parties cross-appealed the District Court’s judg&para;<br>ment. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued&para;<br>a brief summary order, rejecting all their claims, and&para;<br>affirming “the judgment of the district court for substan&para;<br>tially the reasons stated” in the District Court’s “well&para;<br>reasoned and scholarly opinions.” 348 Fed. Appx. 627&para;<br>(2009). The parties filed cross-petitions for writs of certio&para;<br>rari in this Court. We granted the request in CIGNA’s&para;<br>petition to consider whether a showing of “likely harm” is&para;<br>sufficient to entitle plan participants to recover benefits&para;<br>based on faulty disclosures.&para;<br>II&para;<br>CIGNA in the merits briefing raises a preliminary&para;<br>question. Brief for Petitioners 13–20. It argues first and&para;<br>foremost that the statutory provision upon which the&para;<br>District Court rested its orders, namely, the provision for&para;<br>recovery of plan benefits, §502(a)(1)(B), does not in fact&para;<br>authorize the District Court to enter the kind of relief it&para;<br>entered here.&para;<br>And for that reason, CIGNA argues,&para;<br>whether the District Court did or did not use a proper&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>standard for determining harm is beside the point. We&para;<br>believe that this preliminary question is closely enough&para;<br>related to the question presented that we shall consider it&para;<br>at the outset.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The District Court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It&para;<br>ordered the terms of the plan reformed (so that they pro&para;<br>vided an “A plus B,” rather than a “greater of A or B”&para;<br>guarantee). Step 2: It ordered the plan administrator&para;<br>(which it found to be CIGNA) to enforce the plan as re&para;<br>formed. One can fairly describe step 2 as consistent with&para;<br>§502(a)(1)(B), for that provision grants a participant the&para;<br>right to bring a civil action to “recover benefits due . . .&para;<br>under the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).&para;<br>And step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the&para;<br>“terms of [the] plan” as reformed.&para;<br>But what about step 1? Where does §502(a)(1)(B) grant&para;<br>a court the power to change the terms of the plan as they&para;<br>previously existed? The statutory language speaks of&para;<br>“enforc[ing]” the “terms of the plan,” not of changing them.&para;<br>29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(l)(B) (emphasis added). The provision&para;<br>allows a court to look outside the plan’s written language&para;<br>in deciding what those terms are, i.e., what the language&para;<br>means. See UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526&para;<br>U. S. 358, 377–379 (1999) (permitting the insurance terms&para;<br>of an ERISA-governed plan to be interpreted in light of&para;<br>state insurance rules). But we have found nothing sug&para;<br>gesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those&para;<br>terms, at least not in present circumstances, where that&para;<br>change, akin to the reform of a contract, seems less like&para;<br>the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more&para;<br>like an equitable remedy. See infra, at 18.&para;<br>Nor can we accept the Solicitor General’s alternative&para;<br>rationale seeking to justify the use of this provision. The&para;<br>Solicitor General says that the District Court did enforce&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the plan’s terms as written, adding that the “plan” in&para;<br>cludes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan&para;<br>descriptions. In other words, in the view of the Solicitor&para;<br>General, the terms of the summaries are terms of the&para;<br>plan.&para;<br>Even if the District Court had viewed the summaries&para;<br>as plan “terms” (which it did not, see supra, at 10–11),&para;<br>however, we cannot agree that the terms of statutorily&para;<br>required plan summaries (or summaries of plan modifica&para;<br>tions) necessarily may be enforced (under §502(a)(1)(B)) as&para;<br>the terms of the plan itself. For one thing, it is difficult to&para;<br>square the Solicitor General’s reading of the statute with&para;<br>ERISA §102(a), the provision that obliges plan adminis&para;<br>trators to furnish summary plan descriptions. The syntax&para;<br>of that provision, requiring that participants and benefici&para;<br>aries be advised of their rights and obligations “under the&para;<br>plan,” suggests that the information about the plan pro&para;<br>vided by those disclosures is not itself part of the plan.&para;<br>See 29 U. S. C. §1022(a). Nothing in §502(a)(1)(B) (or, as&para;<br>far as we can tell, anywhere else) suggests the contrary.&para;<br>Nor do we find it easy to square the Solicitor General’s&para;<br>reading with the statute’s division of authority between a&para;<br>plan’s sponsor and the plan’s administrator. The plan’s&para;<br>sponsor (e.g., the employer), like a trust’s settlor, creates&para;<br>the basic terms and conditions of the plan, executes a&para;<br>written instrument containing those terms and conditions,&para;<br>and provides in that instrument “a procedure” for making&para;<br>amendments. §402, 29 U. S. C. §1102. The plan’s admin&para;<br>istrator, a trustee-like fiduciary, manages the plan, follows&para;<br>its terms in doing so, and provides participants with the&para;<br>summary documents that describe the plan (and modifica&para;<br>tions) in readily understandable form. §§3(21)(A), 101(a),&para;<br>102, 104, 29 U. S. C. §§1002(21)(A), 1021(a), 1022, 1024&para;<br>(2006 ed. and Supp. III). Here, the District Court found&para;<br>that the same entity, CIGNA, filled both roles. See 534&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 331. But that is not always the case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Regardless, we have found that ERISA carefully distin&para;<br>guishes these roles. See, e.g., Varity Corp., 516 U. S., at&para;<br>498. And we have no reason to believe that the statute&para;<br>intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the adminis&para;<br>trator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including&para;<br>them in the summary plan descriptions. See CurtissWright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 81–85 (1995).&para;<br>Finally, we find it difficult to reconcile the Solicitor&para;<br>General’s interpretation with the basic summary plan&para;<br>description objective: clear, simple communication. See&para;<br>§§2(a), 102(a), 29 U. S. C. §1001(a), 1022(a) (2006 ed.). To&para;<br>make the language of a plan summary legally binding&para;<br>could well lead plan administrators to sacrifice simplicity&para;<br>and comprehensibility in order to describe plan terms in&para;<br>the language of lawyers. Consider the difference between&para;<br>a will and the summary of a will or between a property&para;<br>deed and its summary. Consider, too, the length of Part I&para;<br>of this opinion, and then consider how much longer Part I&para;<br>would have to be if we had to include all the qualifications&para;<br>and nuances that a plan drafter might have found impor&para;<br>tant and feared to omit lest they lose all legal significance.&para;<br>The District Court’s opinions take up 109 pages of the&para;<br>Federal Supplement. None of this is to say that plan&para;<br>administrators can avoid providing complete and accurate&para;<br>summaries of plan terms in the manner required by&para;<br>ERISA and its implementing regulations. But we fear&para;<br>that the Solicitor General’s rule might bring about com&para;<br>plexity that would defeat the fundamental purpose of the&para;<br>summaries.&para;<br>For these reasons taken together we conclude that the&para;<br>summary documents, important as they are, provide&para;<br>communication with beneficiaries about the plan, but that&para;<br>their statements do not themselves constitute the terms of&para;<br>the plan for purposes of §502(a)(1)(B). We also conclude&para;<br>that the District Court could not find authority in that&para;<br>section to reform CIGNA’s plan as written.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>If §502(a)(1)(B) does not authorize entry of the relief&para;<br>here at issue, what about nearby §502(a)(3)? That provi&para;<br>sion allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to&para;<br>obtain other appropriate equitable relief ” to redress viola&para;<br>tions of (here relevant) parts of ERISA “or the terms of the&para;<br>plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). The&para;<br>District Court strongly implied, but did not directly hold,&para;<br>that it would base its relief upon this subsection were it&para;<br>not for (1) the fact that the preceding “plan benefits due”&para;<br>provision, §502(a)(1)(B), provided sufficient authority; and&para;<br>(2) certain cases from this Court that narrowed the appli&para;<br>cation of the term “appropriate equitable relief,” see, e.g.,&para;<br>Mertens, 508 U. S. 248; Great-West, 534 U. S. 204. Our&para;<br>holding in Part II–A, supra, removes the District Court’s&para;<br>first obstacle. And given the likelihood that, on remand,&para;<br>the District Court will turn to and rely upon this alterna&para;<br>tive subsection, we consider the court’s second concern.&para;<br>We find that concern misplaced.&para;<br>We have interpreted the term “appropriate equitable&para;<br>relief ” in §502(a)(3) as referring to “ ‘those categories of&para;<br>relief ’ ” that, traditionally speaking (i.e., prior to the&para;<br>merger of law and equity) “ ‘were typically available in&para;<br>equity.’ ” Sereboff, 547 U. S., at 361 (quoting Mertens, 508&para;<br>U. S., at 256). In Mertens, we applied this principle to a&para;<br>claim seeking money damages brought by a beneficiary&para;<br>against a private firm that provided a trustee with actuar&para;<br>ial services. We found that the plaintiff sought “nothing&para;<br>other than compensatory damages” against a nonfiduci&para;<br>ary. Id., at 253, 255 (emphasis deleted). And we held that&para;<br>such a claim, traditionally speaking, was legal, not equi&para;<br>table, in nature. Id., at 255.&para;<br>In Great-West, we considered a claim brought by a fidu&para;<br>ciary against a tort-award-winning beneficiary seeking&para;<br>monetary reimbursement for medical outlays that the plan&para;<br>had previously made on the beneficiary’s behalf. We noted&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the fiduciary sought to obtain a lien attaching to (or a&para;<br>constructive trust imposed upon) money that the benefici&para;<br>ary had received from the tort-case defendant. But we&para;<br>noted that the money in question was not the “particular”&para;<br>money that the tort defendant had paid. And, tradition&para;<br>ally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a constructive&para;<br>trust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the funds&para;<br>in question were “particular funds or property in the&para;<br>defendant’s possession.” 534 U. S., at 213 (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>The case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary&para;<br>against a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as&para;<br>a trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typi&para;<br>cally treats as a trust). See LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &amp;&para;<br>Associates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 253, n. 4 (2008); Varity&para;<br>Corp., 516 U. S., at 496–497.

AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>trict Court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief.&para;<br>That is because equity chancellors developed a host of&para;<br>other “distinctively equitable” remedies—remedies that&para;<br>were “fitted to the nature of the primary right” they were&para;<br>intended to protect. 1 S. Symons, Pomeroy’s Equity Juris&para;<br>prudence §108, pp. 139–140 (5th ed. 1941) (hereinafter&para;<br>Pomeroy). See generally 1 J. Story, Commentaries on&para;<br>Equity Jurisprudence §692 (12th ed. 1877) (hereinafter&para;<br>Story). Indeed, a maxim of equity states that “[e]quity&para;<br>suffers not a right to be without a remedy.” R. Francis,&para;<br>Maxims of Equity 29 (1st Am. ed. 1823). And the relief&para;<br>entered here, insofar as it does not consist of injunctive&para;<br>relief, closely resembles three other traditional equitable&para;<br>remedies.&para;<br>First, what the District Court did here may be regarded&para;<br>as the reformation of the terms of the plan, in order to&para;<br>remedy the false or misleading information CIGNA pro&para;<br>vided. The power to reform contracts (as contrasted with&para;<br>the power to enforce contracts as written) is a traditional&para;<br>power of an equity court, not a court of law, and was used&para;<br>to prevent fraud. See Baltzer v. Raleigh &amp; Augusta R. Co.,&para;<br>115 U. S. 634, 645 (1885) (“[I]t is well settled that equity&para;<br>would reform the contract, and enforce it, as reformed, if&para;<br>the mistake or fraud were shown”); Hearne v.

Equitable estoppel&para;<br>“operates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the&para;<br>same position he would have been in had the representa&para;<br>tions been true.” Eaton §62, at 176. And, as Justice Story&para;<br>long ago pointed out, equitable estoppel “forms a very&para;<br>essential element in . . . fair dealing, and rebuke of all&para;<br>fraudulent misrepresentation, which it is the boast of&para;<br>courts of equity constantly to promote.” 2 Story §1533, at&para;<br>776.&para;<br>Third, the District Court injunctions require the plan&para;<br>administrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries&para;<br>money owed them under the plan as reformed. But the&para;<br>fact that this relief takes the form of a money payment&para;<br>does not remove it from the category of traditionally equi&para;<br>table relief. Equity courts possessed the power to provide&para;<br>relief in the form of monetary “compensation” for a loss&para;<br>resulting from a trustee’s breach of duty, or to prevent the&para;<br>trustee’s unjust enrichment.&para;<br>Restatement (Third) of&para;<br>Trusts §95, and Comment a (Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 2,&para;<br>2009) (hereinafter Third Restatement); Eaton §§211–212,&para;<br>at 440. Indeed, prior to the merger of law and equity this&para;<br>kind of monetary remedy against a trustee, sometimes&para;<br>called a “surcharge,” was “exclusively equitable.” Princess&para;<br>Lida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456, 464&para;<br>(1939); Third Restatement §95, and Comment a; G. Bogert&para;<br>&amp; G.

See Second Restate&para;<br>ment §201; Adams 59; 4 Pomeroy §1079; 2 Story §§1261,&para;<br>1268. Thus, insofar as an award of make-whole relief is&para;<br>concerned, the fact that the defendant in this case, unlike&para;<br>the defendant in Mertens, is analogous to a trustee makes&para;<br>a critical difference. See 508 U. S., at 262–263. In sum,&para;<br>contrary to the District Court’s fears, the types of reme&para;<br>dies the court entered here fall within the scope of the&para;<br>term “appropriate equitable relief ” in §502(a)(3).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Section 502(a)(3) invokes the equitable powers of the&para;<br>District Court. We cannot know with certainty which&para;<br>remedy the District Court understood itself to be impos&para;<br>ing, nor whether the District Court will find it appropriate&para;<br>to exercise its discretion under §502(a)(3) to impose that&para;<br>remedy on remand. We need not decide which remedies&para;<br>are appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve&para;<br>the parties’ dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in&para;<br>determining whether members of the relevant employee&para;<br>class were injured.&para;<br>The relevant substantive provisions of ERISA do not set&para;<br>forth any particular standard for determining harm. They&para;<br>simply require the plan administrator to write and to&para;<br>distribute written notices that are “sufficiently accurate&para;<br>and comprehensive to reasonably apprise” plan partici&para;<br>pants and beneficiaries of “their rights and obligations&para;<br>under the plan.” §102(a); see also §§104(b), 204(h). Nor&para;<br>can we find a definite standard in the ERISA provision,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§502(a)(3) (which authorizes the court to enter “appropri&para;<br>ate equitable relief ” to redress ERISA “violations”). Hence&para;<br>any requirement of harm must come from the law of&para;<br>equity.&para;<br>Looking to the law of equity, there is no general princi&para;<br>ple that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a&para;<br>remedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement&para;<br>arises, it is because the specific remedy being contem&para;<br>plated imposes such a requirement. Thus, as CIGNA&para;<br>points out, when equity courts used the remedy of estop&para;<br>pel, they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental&para;<br>reliance, i.e., that the defendant’s statement “in truth,&para;<br>influenced the conduct of ” the plaintiff, causing “preju&para;<br>dic[e].” Eaton §61, at 175; see 3 Pomeroy §805. Accord&para;<br>ingly, when a court exercises its authority under&para;<br>§502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a&para;<br>showing of detrimental reliance must be made.&para;<br>But this showing is not always necessary for other&para;<br>equitable remedies. Equity courts, for example, would&para;<br>reform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of&para;<br>the contracting parties where “fraudulent suppression[s],&para;<br>omission[s], or insertion[s],” 1 Story §154, at 149, “mate&para;<br>rial[ly] . . . affect[ed]” the “substance” of the contract, even&para;<br>if the “complaining part[y]” was negligent in not realizing&para;<br>its mistake, as long as its negligence did not fall below a&para;<br>standard of “reasonable prudence” and violate a legal&para;<br>duty. 3 Pomeroy §§856, 856b, at 334, 340–341; see Balt&para;<br>zer, 115 U. S., at 645; Eaton §307(b).&para;<br>Nor did equity courts insist upon a showing of detrimen&para;<br>tal reliance in cases where they ordered “surcharge.”&para;<br>Rather, they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made&para;<br>whole following a trustee’s breach of trust. In such in&para;<br>stances equity courts would “mold the relief to protect the&para;<br>rights of the beneficiary according to the situation in&para;<br>volved.” Bogert §861, at 4. This flexible approach belies a&para;<br>strict requirement of “detrimental reliance.”&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>To be sure, just as a court of equity would not surcharge&para;<br>a trustee for a nonexistent harm, 4 Scott &amp; Ascher §24.9,&para;<br>a fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3) only upon a&para;<br>showing of actual harm—proved (under the default rule&para;<br>for civil cases) by a preponderance of the evidence. That&para;<br>actual harm may sometimes consist of detrimental reli&para;<br>ance, but it might also come from the loss of a right pro&para;<br>tected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. In the&para;<br>present case, it is not difficult to imagine how the failure&para;<br>to provide proper summary information, in violation of the&para;<br>statute, injured employees even if they did not themselves&para;<br>act in reliance on summary documents—which they might&para;<br>not themselves have seen—for they may have thought&para;<br>fellow employees, or informal workplace discussion, would&para;<br>have let them know if, say, plan changes would likely&para;<br>prove harmful. We doubt that Congress would have&para;<br>wanted to bar those employees from relief.&para;<br>The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a&para;<br>limited extent. We believe that, to obtain relief by sur&para;<br>charge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan partici&para;<br>pant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured&para;<br>him or her. But to do so, he or she need only show harm&para;<br>and causation. Although it is not always necessary to&para;<br>meet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words&para;<br>“detrimental reliance,” actual harm must be shown.&para;<br>We are not asked to reassess the evidence. And we are&para;<br>not asked about the other prerequisites for relief. We are&para;<br>asked about the standard of prejudice. And we conclude&para;<br>that the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from&para;<br>equitable principles, as modified by the obligations and&para;<br>injuries identified by ERISA itself. Information-related&para;<br>circumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too&para;<br>various in nature to insist that harm must always meet&para;<br>that more vigorous “detrimental harm” standard when&para;<br>equity imposed no such strict requirement.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §1002(3), and it requires that&para;<br>a “plan” “be established and maintained pursuant to a&para;<br>written instrument,” §1102(a)(1). An SPD, in contrast, is&para;<br>a disclosure meant “to reasonably apprise [plan] partici&para;<br>pants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations&para;<br>under the plan.” §1022(a). It would be peculiar for a doc&para;<br>ument meant to “apprise” participants of their rights&para;<br>“under the plan” to be itself part of the “plan.” Any doubt&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v.

PACE Int’l Union, 551 U. S. 96,&para;<br>101 (2007). An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its pur&para;<br>pose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan&para;<br>if it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor&para;<br>omissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising&para;<br>the plan.&para;<br>Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case.&para;<br>The District Court based the relief it awarded upon&para;<br>ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone. It thought&para;<br>that the “benefits” due “under the terms of the plan,” 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either&para;<br>because the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable&para;<br>of somehow modifying the plan. Under either justifica&para;<br>tion, that conclusion is wrong. An SPD is separate from a&para;<br>plan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so pro&para;<br>vides. See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514&para;<br>U. S. 73, 79, 85 (1995). I would go no further.&para;<br>The Court, however, ventures on to address a different&para;<br>question: whether respondents may recover under&para;<br>§502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants “to&para;<br>obtain other appropriate equitable relief.” 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1132(a)(3). The District Court expressly declined to&para;<br>answer this question, stating that it “need not consider&para;<br>whether any relief ordered under §502(a)(1)(B) would also&para;<br>be available under §502(a)(3).” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 205&para;<br>(Conn. 2008). It did note that §502(a)(3) might not help&para;<br>respondents because that provision authorizes only relief&para;<br>that was “ ‘typically available in equity.’ ” Ibid. (quoting&para;<br>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.&para;<br>204, 210 (2002)). But it described this question as “par&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508&para;<br>U. S. 248 (1993), the case the District Court feared had&para;<br>“severely curtailed the kinds of relief . . . available under&para;<br>§502(a)(3),” 559 F.

And this, bear in mind, is not just a&para;<br>guess as to what the District Court would have done if it&para;<br>had known that its §502(a)(1)(B) relief was (as we today&para;<br>hold) improper. The apparent answer to that is that it&para;<br>would have denied relief, since it thought itself con&para;<br>strained by “certain cases from this Court that [have]&para;<br>narrowed [§502(a)(3)],” ante, at 16. No, the course the&para;<br>Court guesses about is what the District Court would have&para;<br>done if it had known both that §502(a)(1)(B) denies relief&para;<br>and that §502(a)(3) provides it. This speculation upon&para;<br>speculation hardly renders our discussion of §502(a)(3)&para;<br>relevant to the decision below; it is utterly irrelevant.&para;<br>Why the Court embarks on this peculiar path is beyond&para;<br>me. It cannot even be explained by an eagerness to&para;<br>demonstrate—by blatant dictum, if necessary—that, by&para;<br>George, plan members misled by an SPD will be compen&para;<br>sated. That they will normally be compensated is not in&para;<br>doubt. As the opinion for the Court notes, ante, at 10, the&para;<br>Second Circuit has interpreted ERISA as permitting the&para;<br>invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by proper&para;<br>notice, by reason of §204(h), which reads:&para;<br>“An applicable pension plan may not be amended so&para;<br>as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of&para;<br>future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator&para;<br>provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each&para;<br>applicable individual . . . .” 29 U.

C. §1054(h)(1).&para;<br>This provision appears a natural fit to respondents’ claim,&para;<br>which is not that CIGNA was prohibited from changing its&para;<br>plan, but that CIGNA “failed to give them proper notice of&para;<br>changes to their benefits.” Ante, at 1. It was inapplicable&para;<br>here only because of the peculiar facts of this case and the&para;<br>manner in which respondents chose to argue the case. 2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The District Court found that §204(h) was unhelpful because&para;<br>CIGNA had provided a valid notice of its decision to freeze benefits&para;<br>under the old plan.

If the District Court dis&para;<br>misses the case based on an incorrect reading of Mertens,&para;<br>the Second Circuit can correct its error, and if the Second&para;<br>Circuit does not do so this Court can grant certiorari. The&para;<br>Court’s discussion of the relief available under §502(a)(3)&para;<br>and Mertens is purely dicta, binding upon neither us nor&para;<br>the District Court. The District Court need not read any&para;<br>of it—and, indeed, if it takes our suggestions to heart, we&para;<br>may very well reverse. Even if we adhere to our dicta that&para;<br>contract reformation, estoppel, and surcharge are “ ‘dis&para;<br>tinctively equitable’ remedies,” ante, at 18, it is far from&para;<br>clear that they are available remedies in this case. The&para;<br>opinion for the Court does not say (much less hold) that&para;<br>they are and disclaims the implication, see ante, at 20.&para;<br>Contract reformation is a standard remedy for altering&para;<br>the terms of a writing that fails to express the agreement&para;<br>of the parties “owing to the fraud of one of the parties and&para;<br>mistake of the other.” 27 Williston on Contracts §69:55,&para;<br>p. 160 (4th ed. 2010). But here, the Court would be em&para;<br>ploying that doctrine to alter the terms of a contract in&para;<br>response to a third party’s misrepresentations—not those&para;<br>of a party to the contract. The SPD is not part of the&para;<br>ERISA plan, and it was not written by the plan’s sponsor.&para;<br>Although in this case CIGNA wrote both the plan and the&para;<br>SPD, it did so in different capacities: as sponsor when&para;<br>writing the plan, and as administrator when preparing the&para;<br>SPD. ERISA “carefully distinguishes these roles,” ante, at&para;<br>15; see also Beck, 551 U. S., at 101, and nothing the Court&para;<br>cites suggests that they blend together when performed by&para;<br>——————&para;<br>defective §204(h) notice, the freeze would return to force, and respon&para;<br>dents would be worse off. Respondents might (and likely should) have&para;<br>argued that the notice for the freeze was itself void, but they “argued&para;<br>none of these things,” and the District Court declined to “make these&para;<br>arguments now on [their] behalf.” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 208 (Conn.&para;<br>2008).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>the same entity.&para;<br>Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third&para;<br>party was an agent of a contracting party and its misrep&para;<br>resentations could thus be attributed to it under agency&para;<br>law. But such a relationship has not been alleged and is&para;<br>unlikely here. An ERISA administrator’s duty to provide&para;<br>employees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1024(b)(1), and not by reason of its relationship to the&para;<br>sponsor. The administrator is a legally distinct entity.&para;<br>Moreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as&para;<br>agent and the sponsor as principal. Were this the case,&para;<br>and were the administrator contracting with employees as&para;<br>an agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the&para;<br>SPD would be part of the plan or would amend it—exactly&para;<br>what the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II–A, ante,&para;<br>at 13–15. And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished&para;<br>months after an employee accepts a pension or benefit&para;<br>plan. §1024(b)(1). Reformation is meant to effectuate&para;<br>mutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is&para;<br>not retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.&para;<br>Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better&para;<br>suited to the facts of this case. CIGNA admits that re&para;<br>spondents might be able to recover under §502(a)(3) pur&para;<br>suant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably&para;<br>makes this concession only because questions of reliance&para;<br>would be individualized and potentially inappropriate for&para;<br>class-action treatment. Surcharge (which CIGNA does not&para;<br>concede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same&para;<br>problem. The amount for which an administrator may&para;<br>be surcharged is, as the opinion for the Court notes, the&para;<br>“actual harm” suffered by an employee, ante, at 22—that&para;<br>is, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost&para;<br>opportunity to contest or react to the switch. Cf. 3 A. Scott&para;<br>&amp; W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts §205, pp. 237–243 (4th ed.&para;<br>1988). A remedy relating only to that harm would of course&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Because this is the only&para;<br>question properly presented for our review, and the only&para;<br>question briefed and argued before us, I concur only in the&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 It is also not obvious that the relief sought in this case would consti&para;<br>tute an equitable surcharge allowable under Mertens v.
