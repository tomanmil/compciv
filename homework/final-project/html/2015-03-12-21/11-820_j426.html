To avoid removal, she sought to overturn that conviction by filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis, contending that her&para;<br>former attorney’s failure to advise her of the guilty plea’s immigration consequences constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment. While her petition was pending, this Court&para;<br>held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, that the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>requires defense attorneys to inform non-citizen clients of the deportation risks of guilty pleas. The District Court vacated Chaidez’s&para;<br>conviction, determining that Padilla did not announce a “new rule”&para;<br>under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, and thus applied to Chaidez’s&para;<br>case. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Padilla had declared a new rule and should not apply in a challenge to a final conviction.&para;<br>Held: Padilla does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. Pp. 3−15.&para;<br>(a) Under Teague, a person whose conviction is already final may&para;<br>not benefit from a new rule of criminal procedure on collateral review. A “case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by&para;<br>precedent existing at the time the defendant’s conviction became final.” Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. And a holding is not so dictated unless it would have been “apparent to all reasonable jurists.” Lambrix&para;<br>v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527−528. At the same time, a case does&para;<br>not “announce a new rule, [when] it [is] merely an application of the&para;<br>principle that governed” a prior decision to a different set of facts.&para;<br>Teague, 489 U. S., at 307. Thus, garden-variety applications of the&para;<br>test in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, for assessing ineffec-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tive assistance claims do not produce new rules, id., at 687−688.&para;<br>But Padilla did more than just apply Strickland’s general standard&para;<br>to yet another factual situation. Before deciding if failing to inform a&para;<br>client about the risk of deportation “fell below [Strickland’s] objective&para;<br>standard of reasonableness,” 466 U. S., at 688, Padilla first considered the threshold question whether advice about deportation was&para;<br>“categorically removed” from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right&para;<br>to counsel because it involved only a “collateral consequence” of a&para;<br>conviction, rather than a component of a criminal sentence, 559 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___. That is, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied, Padilla asked whether that test applied at all.&para;<br>That preliminary question came to the Court unsettled. Hill v.&para;<br>Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, had explicitly left open whether the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right extends to collateral consequences. That left the&para;<br>issue to the state and lower federal courts, and they almost unanimously concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attorneys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral consequences,&para;<br>including deportation. Padilla’s contrary ruling thus answered an&para;<br>open question about the Sixth Amendment’s reach, in a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions. In so doing, Padilla broke new&para;<br>ground and imposed a new obligation. Pp. 3−11.&para;<br>(b) Chaidez argues that Padilla did no more than apply Strickland&para;<br>to a new set of facts. But she ignores that Padilla had to develop new&para;<br>law to determine that Strickland applied at all. The few lower court&para;<br>decisions she cites held only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepresent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client as to&para;<br>any important matter. Those rulings do not apply to her case, and&para;<br>they do not show that all reasonable judges thought that lawyers had&para;<br>to advise their clients about deportation risks. Neither does INS v.&para;<br>St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, have any relevance here. In saying that a reasonably competent lawyer would tell a non-citizen client about a&para;<br>guilty plea’s deportation consequences, St. Cyr did not determine that&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide such information.&para;<br>It took Padilla to decide that question.

Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), this Court&para;<br>held that the Sixth Amendment requires an attorney for&para;<br>a criminal defendant to provide advice about the risk of&para;<br>deportation arising from a guilty plea. We consider here&para;<br>whether that ruling applies retroactively, so that a person&para;<br>whose conviction became final before we decided Padilla&para;<br>can benefit from it. We conclude that, under the prin­&para;<br>ciples set out in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),&para;<br>Padilla does not have retroactive effect.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Roselva Chaidez hails from Mexico, but be­&para;<br>came a lawful permanent resident of the United States&para;<br>in 1977. About 20 years later, she helped to defraud an&para;<br>automobile insurance company out of $26,000. After&para;<br>federal agents uncovered the scheme, Chaidez pleaded&para;<br>guilty to two counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1341. The District Court sentenced her to four&para;<br>years of probation and ordered her to pay restitution.&para;<br>Chaidez’s conviction became final in 2004.&para;<br>Under federal immigration law, the offenses to which&para;<br>Chaidez pleaded guilty are “aggravated felonies,” subject­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v.

But accord­&para;<br>ing to Chaidez, her attorney never advised her of that fact,&para;<br>and at the time of her plea she remained ignorant of it.&para;<br>Immigration officials initiated removal proceedings&para;<br>against Chaidez in 2009, after an application she made for&para;<br>citizenship alerted them to her prior conviction. To avoid&para;<br>removal, Chaidez sought to overturn that conviction by&para;<br>filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis in Federal Dis­&para;<br>trict Court.1 She argued that her former attorney’s failure&para;<br>to advise her of the immigration consequences of pleading&para;<br>guilty constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>While Chaidez’s petition was pending, this Court decided&para;<br>Padilla. Our ruling vindicated Chaidez’s view of the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment: We held that criminal defense attor­&para;<br>neys must inform non-citizen clients of the risks of depor­&para;<br>tation arising from guilty pleas. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 9). But the Government argued that Chaidez could&para;<br>not benefit from Padilla because it announced a “new&para;<br>rule” and, under Teague, such rules do not apply in collat­&para;<br>eral challenges to already-final convictions.&para;<br>The District Court determined that Padilla “did not&para;<br>announce a new rule for Teague purposes,” and therefore&para;<br>should apply to Chaidez’s case. 730 F. Supp. 2d 896, 904&para;<br>(ND Ill. 2010). It then found that Chaidez’s counsel had&para;<br>performed deficiently under Padilla and that Chaidez&para;<br>suffered prejudice as a result. Accordingly, the court&para;<br>vacated Chaidez’s conviction. See No. 03 CR 636–6, 2010&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 A petition for a writ of coram nobis provides a way to collaterally&para;<br>attack a criminal conviction for a person, like Chaidez, who is no longer&para;<br>“in custody” and therefore cannot seek habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2255 or §2241. See United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 507, 510–&para;<br>511 (1954). Chaidez and the Government agree that nothing in this&para;<br>case turns on the difference between a coram nobis petition and a&para;<br>habeas petition, and we assume without deciding that they are correct.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>WL 3979664 (ND Ill., Oct. 6, 2010).&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit reversed, holding that Padilla had declared a new&para;<br>rule and so should not apply in a challenge to a final con­&para;<br>viction. “Before Padilla,” the Seventh Circuit reasoned,&para;<br>“the [Supreme] Court had never held that the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment requires a criminal defense attorney to pro­&para;<br>vide advice about matters not directly related to [a]&para;<br>client’s criminal prosecution,” including the risks of deporta­&para;<br>tion. 655 F. 3d 684, 693 (2011). And state and lower&para;<br>federal courts had uniformly concluded that an attorney&para;<br>need not give “advice concerning [such a] collateral (as&para;<br>opposed to direct) consequenc[e] of a guilty plea.” Id., at&para;<br>690. According to the Seventh Circuit, Padilla’s holding&para;<br>was new because it ran counter to that widely accepted&para;<br>“distinction between direct and collateral consequences.”&para;<br>655 F. 3d, at 691. Judge Williams dissented. Agreeing&para;<br>with the Third Circuit’s view, she argued that Padilla&para;<br>“broke no new ground” because it merely applied estab­&para;<br>lished law about a lawyer’s “duty to consult” with a client.&para;<br>655 F. 3d, at 695 (quoting United States v. Orocio, 645&para;<br>F. 3d 630, 638–639 (CA3 2011) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a&para;<br>split among federal and state courts on whether Padilla&para;<br>applies retroactively.2 Holding that it does not, we affirm&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Teague makes the retroactivity of our criminal proce­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Compare 655 F. 3d 684 (CA7 2011) (case below) (not retroactive);&para;<br>United States v.

When we&para;<br>announce a “new rule,” a person whose conviction is al­&para;<br>ready final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas&para;<br>or similar proceeding.3 Only when we apply a settled rule&para;<br>may a person avail herself of the decision on collateral&para;<br>review. Here, Chaidez filed her coram nobis petition five&para;<br>years after her guilty plea became final. Her challenge&para;<br>therefore fails if Padilla declared a new rule.&para;<br>“[A] case announces a new rule,” Teague explained,&para;<br>“when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation”&para;<br>on the government. 489 U. S., at 301. “To put it differ­&para;<br>ently,” we continued, “a case announces a new rule if the&para;<br>result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time&para;<br>the defendant’s conviction became final.” Ibid. And a&para;<br>holding is not so dictated, we later stated, unless it would&para;<br>have been “apparent to all reasonable jurists.” Lambrix v.&para;<br>Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527–528 (1997).&para;<br>But that account has a flipside. Teague also made clear&para;<br>that a case does not “announce a new rule, [when] it ‘[is]&para;<br>merely an application of the principle that governed’ ” a&para;<br>prior decision to a different set of facts. 489 U. S., at 307&para;<br>(quoting Yates v. Aiken, 484 U. S. 211, 217 (1988)). As&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY has explained, “[w]here the beginning&para;<br>point” of our analysis is a rule of “general application, a&para;<br>rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a&para;<br>myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case&para;<br>that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one&para;<br>not dictated by precedent.” Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277,&para;<br>309 (1992) (concurring in judgment); see also Williams v.&para;<br>Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000). Otherwise said, when&para;<br>all we do is apply a general standard to the kind of factual&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Teague stated two exceptions: “[W]atershed rules of criminal proce­&para;<br>dure” and rules placing “conduct beyond the power of the [government]&para;<br>to proscribe” apply on collateral review, even if novel. 489 U. S., at 311&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Chaidez does not argue that either&para;<br>of those exceptions is relevant here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>circumstances it was meant to address, we will rarely&para;<br>state a new rule for Teague purposes.&para;<br>Because that is so, garden-variety applications of the&para;<br>test in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), for&para;<br>assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do&para;<br>not produce new rules. In Strickland, we held that legal&para;<br>representation violates the Sixth Amendment if it falls&para;<br>“below an objective standard of reasonableness,” as indi­&para;<br>cated by “prevailing professional norms,” and the defend­&para;<br>ant suffers prejudice as a result. Id., at 687–688. That&para;<br>standard, we later concluded, “provides sufficient guidance&para;<br>for resolving virtually all” claims of ineffective assistance,&para;<br>even though their particular circumstances will differ.&para;<br>Williams, 529 U. S., at 391. And so we have granted relief&para;<br>under Strickland in diverse contexts without ever suggest­&para;<br>ing that doing so required a new rule. See, e.g., ibid.;&para;<br>Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,&para;<br>539 U. S. 510 (2003).4 In like manner, Padilla would not&para;<br>have created a new rule had it only applied Strickland’s&para;<br>general standard to yet another factual situation—that is,&para;<br>had Padilla merely made clear that a lawyer who neglects&para;<br>to inform a client about the risk of deportation is profes­&para;<br>sionally incompetent.&para;<br>But Padilla did something more. Before deciding if&para;<br>failing to provide such advice “fell below an objective stan­&para;<br>dard of reasonableness,” Padilla considered a threshold&para;<br>question: Was advice about deportation “categorically&para;<br>removed” from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to&para;<br>counsel because it involved only a “collateral consequence”&para;<br>of a conviction, rather than a component of the criminal&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 We did not consider Teague in Williams, Rompilla, and Wiggins, but&para;<br>we granted habeas relief pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) because&para;<br>state courts had unreasonably applied “clearly established” law. And,&para;<br>as we have explained, “clearly established” law is not “new” within the&para;<br>meaning of Teague. See Williams, 529 U. S., at 412.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sentence? 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7–9).5 In other&para;<br>words, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied&para;<br>(“Did this attorney act unreasonably?”), Padilla asked&para;<br>whether the Strickland test applied (“Should we even&para;<br>evaluate if this attorney acted unreasonably?”). And as we&para;<br>will describe, that preliminary question about Strickland’s&para;<br>ambit came to the Padilla Court unsettled—so that the&para;<br>Court’s answer (“Yes, Strickland governs here”) required a&para;<br>new rule.&para;<br>The relevant background begins with our decision in&para;<br>Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), which explicitly left&para;<br>open whether advice concerning a collateral consequence&para;<br>must satisfy Sixth Amendment requirements. Hill pleaded&para;<br>guilty to first-degree murder after his attorney misin­&para;<br>formed him about his parole eligibility. In addressing his&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance, we first held that the&para;<br>Strickland standard extends generally to the plea process.&para;<br>See Hill, 474 U. S., at 57. We then determined, however,&para;<br>that Hill had failed to allege prejudice from the lawyer’s&para;<br>error and so could not prevail under that standard. See&para;<br>id., at 60. That conclusion allowed us to avoid another,&para;<br>more categorical question: whether advice about parole&para;<br>(however inadequate and prejudicial) could possibly vio­&para;<br>late the Sixth Amendment. The Court of Appeals, we&para;<br>noted, had held “that parole eligibility is a collateral ra­&para;<br>ther than a direct consequence of a guilty plea, of which a&para;<br>defendant need not be informed.” Id., at 55. But our&para;<br>ruling on prejudice made “it unnecessary to determine&para;<br>whether there may be circumstances under which” ad——————&para;<br>5 We have never attempted to delineate the world of “collateral conse­&para;<br>quences,” see Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8), nor do&para;<br>we do so here. But other effects of a conviction commonly viewed as&para;<br>collateral include civil commitment, civil forfeiture, sex offender regis­&para;<br>tration, disqualification from public benefits, and disfranchisement.&para;<br>See id., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3)&para;<br>(listing other examples).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vice about a matter deemed collateral violates the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment. Id., at 60.6&para;<br>That non-decision left the state and lower federal courts&para;<br>to deal with the issue; and they almost unanimously con­&para;<br>cluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attor­&para;<br>neys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral&para;<br>consequences, including deportation. All 10 federal appel­&para;<br>late courts to consider the question decided, in the words&para;<br>of one, that “counsel’s failure to inform a defendant of the&para;<br>collateral consequences of a guilty plea is never” a viola­&para;<br>tion of the Sixth Amendment. Santos-Sanchez v. United&para;<br>States, 548 F. 3d 327, 334 (CA5 2008).7 That constitutional&para;<br>guarantee, another typical decision expounded, “assures&para;<br>an accused of effective assistance of counsel in ‘criminal&para;<br>prosecutions’ ”; accordingly, advice about matters like deportation, which are “not a part of or enmeshed in the&para;<br>criminal proceeding,” does not fall within the Amend­&para;<br>ment’s scope. United States v. George, 869 F. 2d 333, 337&para;<br>(CA7 1989). Appellate courts in almost 30 States agreed.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 In saying that much, we declined to rule not only on whether advice&para;<br>about a conviction’s collateral consequences falls outside the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment’s scope, but also on whether parole eligibility should be&para;<br>considered such a consequence, as the court of appeals held.&para;<br>7 See Broomes v.

In&para;<br>the normal Strickland case, a court begins by evaluating&para;<br>the reasonableness of an attorney’s conduct in light of&para;<br>professional norms, and then assesses prejudice. But as&para;<br>earlier indicated, see supra, at 5–6, Padilla had a different&para;<br>starting point. Before asking whether the performance&para;<br>of Padilla’s attorney was deficient under Strickland, we&para;<br>considered (in a separately numbered part of the opinion)&para;<br>whether Strickland applied at all. See 559 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 7–9). Many courts, we acknowledged, had&para;<br>excluded advice about collateral matters from the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment’s ambit; and deportation, because the conse­&para;<br>quence of a distinct civil proceeding, could well be viewed&para;<br>as such a matter. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But, we&para;<br>continued, no decision of our own committed us to “appl[y]&para;<br>a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to&para;<br>define the scope” of the right to counsel. Id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 8). And however apt that distinction might be in&para;<br>other contexts, it should not exempt from Sixth Amend­&para;<br>ment scrutiny a lawyer’s advice (or non-advice) about&para;<br>a plea’s deportation risk. Deportation, we stated, is&para;<br>“unique.” Ibid. It is a “particularly severe” penalty, and&para;<br>one “intimately related to the criminal process”; indeed,&para;<br>immigration statutes make it “nearly an automatic result”&para;<br>of some convictions. Ibid. We thus resolved the threshold&para;<br>question before us by breaching the previously chink-free&para;<br>wall between direct and collateral consequences: Notwith­&para;<br>standing the then-dominant view, “Strickland applies to&para;<br>Padilla’s claim.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>If that does not count as “break[ing] new ground” or&para;<br>“impos[ing] a new obligation,” we are hard pressed to&para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>could not do so. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>know what would. Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. Before&para;<br>Padilla, we had declined to decide whether the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment had any relevance to a lawyer’s advice about&para;<br>matters not part of a criminal proceeding. Perhaps some&para;<br>advice of that kind would have to meet Strickland’s rea­&para;<br>sonableness standard—but then again, perhaps not: No&para;<br>precedent of our own “dictated” the answer. Teague, 489&para;<br>U. S., at 301. And as the lower courts filled the vacuum,&para;<br>they almost uniformly insisted on what Padilla called the&para;<br>“categorica[l] remov[al]” of advice about a conviction’s non­&para;<br>criminal consequences—including deportation—from the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment’s scope. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>It was Padilla that first rejected that categorical ap­&para;<br>proach—and so made the Strickland test operative—when&para;<br>a criminal lawyer gives (or fails to give) advice about&para;<br>immigration consequences.11 In acknowledging that fact,&para;<br>we do not cast doubt on, or at all denigrate, Padilla.&para;<br>Courts often need to, and do, break new ground; it is the&para;<br>very premise of Teague that a decision can be right and&para;<br>also be novel. All we say here is that Padilla’s holding&para;<br>that the failure to advise about a non-criminal conse­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The separate opinions in Padilla objected to just this aspect of the&para;<br>Court’s ruling. Dissents have been known to exaggerate the novelty&para;<br>of majority opinions; and “the mere existence of a dissent,” like the&para;<br>existence of conflicting authority in state or lower federal courts, does&para;<br>not establish that a rule is new. Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 416,&para;<br>n. 5 (2004); see Williams, 529 U. S., at 410. But the concurring and&para;<br>dissenting opinions in Padilla were on to something when they de­&para;<br>scribed the line the Court was crossing. “Until today,” JUSTICE ALITO&para;<br>wrote, “the longstanding and unanimous position of the federal courts&para;<br>was that reasonable defense counsel generally need only advise a client&para;<br>about the direct consequences of a criminal conviction.” See 559 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2). Or again, this time from&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA: “[U]ntil today,” the Sixth Amendment guaranteed only&para;<br>“legal advice directly related to defense against prosecution” of a&para;<br>criminal charge. Id., at ___ (dissenting) (slip op., at 2). One need not&para;<br>agree with any of the separate opinions’ criticisms of Padilla to concur&para;<br>with their view that it modified governing law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>quence could violate the Sixth Amendment would not have&para;<br>been—in fact, was not—“apparent to all reasonable ju­&para;<br>rists” prior to our decision. Lambrix, 520 U. S., at 527–&para;<br>528. Padilla thus announced a “new rule.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>Chaidez offers, and the dissent largely adopts, a differ­&para;<br>ent account of Padilla, in which we did no more than&para;<br>apply Strickland to a new set of facts. On Chaidez’s view,&para;<br>Strickland insisted “[f]rom its inception” that all aspects of&para;<br>a criminal lawyer’s performance pass a test of “ ‘reasona­&para;<br>bleness under prevailing professional norms’ ”: The deci­&para;<br>sion thus foreclosed any “categorical distinction between&para;<br>direct and collateral consequences.” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>21–22 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 688). Indeed, Chaidez contends, courts prior to Padilla&para;<br>recognized Strickland’s all-encompassing scope and so&para;<br>applied its reasonableness standard to advice concerning&para;<br>deportation. See Brief for Petitioner 25–26; Reply Brief&para;<br>10–12. She here points to caselaw in three federal appeals&para;<br>courts allowing ineffective assistance claims when attor­&para;<br>neys affirmatively misled their clients about the deporta­&para;<br>tion consequences of guilty pleas.12 The only question left&para;<br>for Padilla to resolve, Chaidez claims, was whether pro­&para;<br>fessional norms also require criminal lawyers to volunteer&para;<br>advice about the risk of deportation. In addressing that&para;<br>issue, she continues, Padilla did a run-of-the-mill Strickland analysis. And more: It did an especially easy Strickland analysis. We had earlier noted in INS v. St. Cyr, 533&para;<br>U. S. 289 (2001)—a case raising an issue of immigration&para;<br>law unrelated to the Sixth Amendment—that a “compe­&para;<br>tent defense counsel” would inform his client about a&para;<br>guilty plea’s deportation consequences. Id., at 323, n. 50.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 See United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005);&para;<br>United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan&para;<br>v. United States, 765 F. 2d 1534, 1540–1541 (CA11 1985).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>All Padilla had to do, Chaidez concludes, was recite that&para;<br>prior finding.&para;<br>But Chaidez’s (and the dissent’s) story line is wrong, for&para;<br>reasons we have mostly already noted: Padilla had to&para;<br>develop new law, establishing that the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>applied at all, before it could assess the performance of&para;<br>Padilla’s lawyer under Strickland. See supra, at 5–6, 9.&para;<br>Our first order of business was thus to consider whether&para;<br>the widely accepted distinction between direct and collat­&para;<br>eral consequences categorically foreclosed Padilla’s claim,&para;<br>whatever the level of his attorney’s performance. We did&para;<br>not think, as Chaidez argues, that Strickland barred&para;<br>resort to that distinction. Far from it: Even in Padilla we&para;<br>did not eschew the direct-collateral divide across the&para;<br>board. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (“Whether that&para;<br>distinction is [generally] appropriate is a question we need&para;<br>not consider in this case”). Rather, we relied on the spe­&para;<br>cial “nature of deportation”—the severity of the penalty&para;<br>and the “automatic” way it follows from conviction—to&para;<br>show that “[t]he collateral versus direct distinction [was]&para;<br>ill-suited” to dispose of Padilla’s claim. Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 8–9). All that reasoning came before we conducted a&para;<br>Strickland analysis (by examining professional norms and&para;<br>so forth), and none of it followed ineluctably from prior&para;<br>law.13&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 The dissent’s entire analysis founders on this most basic point. In&para;<br>its lengthy description of Padilla, the dissent picks up in the middle—&para;<br>after the Court concluded that the direct-collateral distinction did not&para;<br>preclude finding that Padilla’s lawyer provided ineffective assistance&para;<br>under the Sixth Amendment. See post, at 3–5. The dissent justifies&para;<br>ignoring that threshold conclusion on the ground that “Padilla declined&para;<br>to embrace the . . . distinction between collateral and direct conse­&para;<br>quences” and “stated very clearly that it found the distinction irrele­&para;<br>vant” to the case. Post, at 6. But it is exactly in refusing to apply the&para;<br>direct-collateral distinction that the Padilla Court did something novel.&para;<br>Before then, as the Court forthrightly acknowledged, that distinction&para;<br>would have doomed Padilla’s claim in well-nigh every court in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Predictably, then, the caselaw Chaidez and the dissent&para;<br>cite fails to support their claim that lower courts “accepted&para;<br>that Strickland applied to deportation advice.” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 25; see post, at 8–11. True enough, three federal circuits (and a handful of state courts) held before Padilla that misstatements about deportation could support&para;<br>an ineffective assistance claim. But those decisions rea­&para;<br>soned only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepre­&para;<br>sent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client&para;<br>on any important matter, however related to a criminal&para;<br>prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d&para;<br>1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005). They co-existed happily&para;<br>with precedent, from the same jurisdictions (and almost&para;<br>all others), holding that deportation is not “so unique as to&para;<br>warrant an exception to the general rule that a defendant&para;<br>need not be advised of the [collateral] consequences of a&para;<br>guilty plea.” United States v. Campbell, 778 F. 2d 764,&para;<br>769 (CA11 1985).14 So at most, Chaidez has shown that a&para;<br>minority of courts recognized a separate rule for material&para;<br>misrepresentations, regardless whether they concerned&para;<br>deportation or another collateral matter. That limited&para;<br>rule does not apply to Chaidez’s case. And because it lived&para;<br>in harmony with the exclusion of claims like hers from the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment, it does not establish what she needs&para;<br>to—that all reasonable judges, prior to Padilla, thought&para;<br>they were living in a Padilla-like world.&para;<br>Nor, finally, does St. Cyr have any relevance here. That&para;<br>——————&para;<br>United States. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7); supra, at 9.&para;<br>14 See also Resendiz v.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>decision stated what is common sense (and what we again&para;<br>recognized in Padilla): A reasonably competent lawyer will&para;<br>tell a non-citizen client about a guilty plea’s deportation&para;<br>consequences because “ ‘[p]reserving the client’s right to&para;<br>remain in the United States may be more important to the&para;<br>client than any potential jail sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at&para;<br>322). But in saying that much, St. Cyr did not determine&para;<br>that the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide&para;<br>such information. Courts had held to the contrary not&para;<br>because advice about deportation was insignificant to a&para;<br>client—really, who could think that, whether before or&para;<br>after St. Cyr?—but because it concerned a matter collat­&para;<br>eral to the criminal prosecution.15 On those courts’ view,&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment no more demanded competent&para;<br>advice about a plea’s deportation consequences than it&para;<br>demanded competent representation in the deportation&para;<br>process itself. Padilla decided that view was wrong. But&para;<br>to repeat: It was Padilla that did so. In the years follow­&para;<br>ing St. Cyr, not a single state or lower federal court con­&para;<br>sidering a lawyer’s failure to provide deportation advice&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 The dissent claims the opposite, averring that lower court “deci­&para;<br>sions show nothing more than that the underlying professional norms&para;<br>had not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide advice about depor­&para;<br>tation consequences.” Post, at 8. But the dissent cannot point to a&para;<br>single decision stating that a lawyer’s failure to offer advice about&para;<br>deportation met professional norms; all the decisions instead held that&para;<br>a lawyer’s breach of those norms was constitutionally irrelevant be­&para;<br>cause deportation was a collateral consequence. See supra, at 7. Had&para;<br>courts in fact considered professional standards in the slew of cases&para;<br>before Padilla that presented Padilla-like claims, they would have&para;<br>discovered as early as 1968 that the American Bar Association in­&para;<br>structed criminal lawyers to advise their non-citizen clients about the&para;<br>risks of deportation. See 3 ABA Project on Standards for Criminal&para;<br>Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Commentary,&para;<br>p. 71 (App. Draft 1968). The difficulty in upholding such claims prior to&para;<br>Padilla had nothing to do with courts’ view of professional norms and&para;<br>everything to do with their use of the direct-collateral divide.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 4–5.&para;<br>The Teague inquiry turns centrally on the “nature of the&para;<br>rule” in question, and for that reason, “[w]here the begin­&para;<br>ning point is a rule of . . . general application, . . . it will be&para;<br>the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it&para;<br>forges a new rule.” Wright v.

The majority makes the important observation that&para;<br>“when all we do is apply a general standard to the kind&para;<br>of factual circumstances it was meant to address, we will&para;<br>rarely state a new rule.” Ibid. It makes sense, then, that&para;<br>“garden-variety applications of . . . Strickland . . . do not&para;<br>produce new rules.” Ante, at 5.&para;<br>In Strickland, we did not provide a comprehensive definition of deficient performance, and instead held that&para;<br>“[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains&para;<br>simply reasonableness under prevailing professional&para;<br>norms.” 466 U.

Strickland’s reasonableness&para;<br>prong therefore takes its content from the standards by&para;<br>which lawyers judge their professional obligations, ibid.,&para;<br>and those standards are subject to change. That is why,&para;<br>despite the many different settings in which it has been&para;<br>applied, we have never found that an application of Strickland resulted in a new rule.1&para;<br>Significantly, we have previously found that applica­&para;<br>tions of Strickland to new factual scenarios are not barred&para;<br>under 28 U.

S., at 522. Similarly, in Lafler v.&para;<br>Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 6,&para;<br>14–16), we rejected the argument advanced by the Solici­&para;<br>tor General that the Sixth Amendment did not extend to&para;<br>advice about a plea offer because it did not impact the&para;<br>fairness of the trial. Instead, we simply held that Strickland applied to this form of attorney misconduct.&para;<br>In short, where we merely apply Strickland in a way&para;<br>that corresponds to an evolution in professional norms, we&para;<br>make no new law.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Contrary to the majority’s reconstruction, Padilla is&para;<br>built squarely on the foundation laid out by Strickland.&para;<br>Padilla relied upon controlling precedent. It began by&para;<br>reciting the basic rule that “[u]nder Strickland, we first&para;<br>determine whether counsel’s representation ‘fell below an&para;<br>objective standard of reasonableness.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at&para;<br>688). We recognized that “[t]he first prong—constitutional&para;<br>deficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and expec­&para;<br>tations of the legal community: ‘[t]he proper measure of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 AEDPA of course differs from the Teague rule in other important&para;<br>respects. See, e.g., Greene v. Fisher, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 5). But these differences aside, the fact that we have repeatedly&para;<br>found AEDPA cases involving Strickland to be controlled by established&para;<br>precedent underscores that the application of Strickland in a new&para;<br>context should almost never result in a new rule.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v.

S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688).&para;<br>We therefore examined the substantial changes in federal immigration law that provided the backdrop to the&para;<br>relevant professional standards. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 2–6). Pursuant to the Immigration Act of&para;<br>1917, 39 Stat. 889–890, a judge could recommend that a&para;<br>defendant who had committed a deportable offense not&para;<br>be removed from the country. Congress entirely eliminated&para;<br>this procedure in 1990. 104 Stat. 5050. Then the Illegal&para;<br>Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of&para;<br>1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–596, abolished the Attorney General’s authority to grant discretionary relief from&para;<br>removal for all but a small number of offenses. Padilla,&para;<br>559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). These changes in immi­&para;<br>gration law meant that for a noncitizen who committed&para;<br>a removable offense, “removal [had become] practically&para;<br>inevitable.” Ibid.&para;<br>In parallel with these developments, the standards of&para;<br>professional responsibility relating to immigration had&para;<br>become more demanding. “For at least the past 15 years,”&para;<br>we observed in Padilla, “professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on&para;<br>the deportation consequences of a client’s plea.” Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 15). Citing an array of practice guides and&para;<br>professional responsibility manuals, we noted that “[t]he&para;<br>weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view&para;<br>that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of&para;<br>deportation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Indeed, “authori­&para;<br>ties of every stripe—including the American Bar Associa­&para;<br>tion, criminal defense and public defender organizations,&para;<br>authoritative treatises, and state and city bar publica­&para;<br>tions—universally require defense attorneys to advise as&para;<br>to the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen&para;<br>clients.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>We drew further support for our conclusion that profes­&para;<br>sional standards required advice about deportation conse­&para;<br>quences from our decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289&para;<br>(2001). See Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)&para;<br>(citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 323). In St. Cyr, we had&para;<br>explained that the availability of discretionary relief from&para;<br>removal was critical to a noncitizen’s decision to accept a&para;<br>plea offer, and expected counsel to follow the instructions&para;<br>of “numerous practice guides,” such as the ABA’s Stand­&para;<br>ards for Criminal Justice, to inform themselves of the&para;<br>possible immigration consequences of a plea. Padilla, 559&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at&para;<br>323, n. 50); see id., at 322, n. 48. And we there found that&para;<br>many States already required that a trial judge advise&para;<br>defendants of the same. Ibid. St. Cyr thus “recognized&para;<br>that ‘preserving the client’s right to remain in the United&para;<br>States may be more important to the client than any&para;<br>potential jail sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322).&para;<br>Our application of Strickland in Padilla followed natu­&para;<br>rally from these earlier observations about changes in&para;<br>immigration law and the accompanying evolution of pro­&para;<br>fessional norms. When we decided St. Cyr and Padilla,&para;<br>nothing about Strickland’s substance or applicability had&para;<br>changed. The only difference from prior law was that&para;<br>the underlying professional norms had changed such that&para;<br>counsel’s failure to give this advice now amounted to&para;<br>constitutionally deficient performance.3 Both before Pa——————&para;<br>3 Even before IIRIRA and St. Cyr, lawyers of course understood that&para;<br>it was good practice to inform clients of the deportation consequences of&para;<br>a plea. See ante, at 14, n. 15 (citing 3 ABA Project on Standards for&para;<br>Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Com­&para;<br>mentary, p. 71 (App. Draft 1968)). Following the sea change in immi­&para;<br>gration law, however, the professional norms had become so established&para;<br>and universally recognized that the measure of constitutionally ade­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dilla and after, counsel was obligated to follow the rele­&para;<br>vant professional norms. It was only because those norms&para;<br>reflected changes in immigration law that Padilla reached&para;<br>the result it did, not because the Sixth Amendment right&para;<br>had changed at all.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Accepting that routine applications of Strickland do not&para;<br>result in new rules, the majority nevertheless holds that&para;<br>Padilla went a step further. In its view, Padilla “ ‘br[oke]&para;<br>new ground’ ” by addressing the threshold question of&para;<br>whether advice about deportation is a collateral conse­&para;<br>quence of a criminal conviction that falls within the scope&para;<br>of the Sixth Amendment. Ante, at 9–10. But that is&para;<br>wrong, because Padilla declined to embrace the very&para;<br>distinction between collateral and direct consequences of a&para;<br>criminal conviction that the majority says it did. In fact,&para;<br>the Court stated very clearly that it found the distinction&para;<br>irrelevant for the purposes of determining a defense law­&para;<br>yer’s obligation to provide advice about the immigration&para;<br>consequences of a plea. 559 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op.,&para;<br>at 7, n. 8). We asserted that we had “never applied a dis­&para;<br>tinction between direct and collateral consequences to&para;<br>define the scope of constitutionally ‘reasonable professional&para;<br>assistance’ required under Strickland,” and concluded that&para;<br>“[w]hether that distinction is appropriate is a question we&para;<br>need not consider in this case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8)&para;<br>(emphasis added). The distinction was “ill suited” to the&para;<br>task at hand, we explained, because deportation has a&para;<br>“close connection to the criminal process,” and is “uniquely&para;<br>difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral conse­&para;<br>quence.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8–9). Indeed, “[o]ur law&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>quate performance now included giving such advice in the form Padilla&para;<br>&para;<br>recognized. See 559 U.

With­&para;<br>out this revision to our recent decisional history, the ma­&para;<br>jority’s analysis unravels.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The majority finds that the “legal landscape,” Graham v.&para;<br>Collins, 506 U.

Ante, at 7–10.&para;<br>It concludes that the lower courts were generally in&para;<br>agreement that the Sixth Amendment did not require&para;<br>attorneys to inform clients of the collateral consequences&para;<br>of a plea, and that this weighs heavily in favor of finding&para;<br>that Padilla announced a new rule.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>development of professional standards over time. St. Cyr&para;<br>noted the importance of advising clients about immigra­&para;<br>tion consequences was of recent vintage, indeed more recent than some of the cases the majority cites. See 533&para;<br>U. S., at 322–323. The Court relies upon decisions issued&para;<br>over a period that spans more than 30 years. See ante, at&para;<br>7–8, nn. 7, 8. Nearly half of them (17) were decided before&para;<br>the enactment of IIRIRA. See ibid. And all but two of&para;<br>the Federal Court of Appeals cases were decided before St.&para;<br>Cyr. See ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8. These earlier decisions&para;<br>show nothing more than that the underlying professional&para;<br>norms had not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide&para;<br>advice about deportation consequences.&para;<br>Cases from the period following IIRIRA and St. Cyr&para;<br>undermine the majority’s generalizations about the state&para;<br>of the law before Padilla. Deportation had long been understood by lower courts to present “the most difficult”&para;<br>penalty to classify as either a collateral or direct conse­&para;<br>quence. United States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC&para;<br>1982); cf. Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 455&para;<br>(CA2 1986) (holding that Strickland applied to advice&para;<br>about a judicial recommendation against deportation).&para;<br>Eventually, and in parallel with changes in federal immi­&para;<br>gration law and the corresponding professional norms, the&para;<br>lower courts had acknowledged an important qualification&para;<br>to the collateral consequences rule. After the passage of&para;<br>IIRIRA and this Court’s decision in St. Cyr, many courts&para;<br>concluded that a lawyer’s affirmative misstatements about&para;<br>the immigration consequences of a guilty plea can consti­&para;<br>tute deficient performance under Strickland. Indeed, each&para;<br>Federal Court of Appeals to address the question after St.&para;<br>Cyr so held. See United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179,&para;<br>188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005,&para;<br>1015 (CA9 2005); cf. Downs-Morgan v. United States, 765&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

They also fore­&para;<br>shadowed the Court’s reasoning in Padilla by basing their&para;<br>analysis of the relevant professional norms on the special&para;<br>nature of deportation, the ABA standards governing im­&para;<br>migration practice, and the Court’s assessment of those&para;<br>standards in St Cyr. See Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016 (“That&para;<br>counsel may have misled [the defendant] out of ignorance&para;<br>is no excuse.

Ante, at 12–13. But, as explained, the reasoning of&para;<br>these cases renders that characterization at best incom­&para;<br>plete. See, e.g., Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016. While these&para;<br>lower court precedents are consistent with the general&para;<br>principle that attorneys should not mislead clients by&para;<br>providing incorrect advice, they did not rest primarily on&para;<br>that rule. Rather, they recognized the significant changes&para;<br>in professional norms that predated Padilla and that we&para;<br>had noted in St. Cyr. As a consequence, the “wall between&para;<br>direct and collateral consequences” that the lower courts&para;<br>had erected, ante, at 9, had already been dealt a serious&para;<br>blow by the time the Court decided Padilla.&para;<br>As the majority points out, these misrepresentation&para;<br>cases stopped short of imposing an affirmative obligation&para;<br>on lawyers to consult with clients about the consequences&para;<br>of deportation. Ante, at 12–13. But the majority places&para;<br>too much emphasis on the absence of lower court authority&para;<br>finding that an attorney’s omissions with respect to depor­&para;<br>tation resulted in ineffective assistance. The distinction&para;<br>between omissions and affirmative misrepresentations on&para;<br>which these lower court cases depended cannot be recon­&para;<br>ciled with Strickland. In Padilla itself, we rejected the&para;<br>Solicitor General’s suggestion that Strickland should&para;<br>apply to advice about the immigration consequences of a&para;<br>plea only in cases where defense counsel makes an affirm­&para;<br>ative misstatement. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>12). We did so because we found that Strickland was&para;<br>incompatible with the distinction between an obligation to&para;<br>give advice and a prohibition on affirmative misstate­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ments. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12–13) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690). Strickland made clear that its&para;<br>standard of attorney performance applied to both “acts”&para;<br>and “omissions,” and that a rule limiting the performance&para;<br>inquiry to one or the other was too narrow. 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 690. Thus, the distinction between misrepresentations&para;<br>and omissions, on which the majority relies in classifying&para;<br>lower court precedent, implies a categorical rule that is&para;<br>inconsistent with Strickland’s requirement of a case-by­&para;<br>case assessment of an attorney’s performance.7 Id., at&para;<br>688–689; see, e.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479&para;<br>(2000). In short, that some courts have differentiated&para;<br>between misleading by silence and affirmative misrepresentation hardly establishes the rationality of the dis­&para;<br>tinction. Notably, the Court offers no reasoned basis for&para;<br>believing that such a distinction can be extracted from&para;<br>Strickland.&para;<br>To be sure, lower courts did continue to apply the dis­&para;<br>tinction between collateral and direct consequences after&para;<br>St. Cyr. See ante, at 13–14; see, e.g., Broomes v. Ashcroft,&para;<br>358 F. 3d 1251, 1256–1257 (CA10 2004). Even so, and&para;<br>even assuming the misrepresentation cases did not call&para;<br>the distinction into question, the existence of these lower&para;<br>court decisions is not dispositive. “[T]he standard for&para;<br>determining when a case establishes a new rule is ‘objec­&para;<br>tive,’ and the mere existence of conflicting authority does&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority cites a law review article for the proposition that the&para;<br>categorical consequences rule is “one of ‘the most widely recognized&para;<br>rules of American law.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quoting Chin &amp; Holmes, Effective&para;<br>Assistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell&para;<br>L. Rev. 697, 706 (2002)). But the article was, in fact, quite critical of&para;<br>the rule. The authors explained that “[t]he real work of the conviction&para;<br>is performed by the collateral consequences,” and that the direct/&para;<br>collateral distinction in the context of ineffective-assistance claims&para;<br>was “surprising because it seems inconsistent with the framework that&para;<br>the Supreme Court . . . laid out” in Strickland.

Nevertheless, the majority reaches the paradoxi­&para;<br>cal conclusion that by declining to apply a collateral­&para;<br>consequence doctrine the Court had never adopted, Padilla announced a new rule.&para;<br>III&para;<br>What truly appears to drive the majority’s analysis is its&para;<br>sense that Padilla occasioned a serious disruption in lower&para;<br>court decisional reasoning.
