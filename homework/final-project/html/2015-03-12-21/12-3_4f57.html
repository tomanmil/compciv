FMR LLC ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–3. Argued November 12, 2013—Decided March 4, 2014&para;<br>To safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the&para;<br>financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. One of the Act’s provisions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provision instructed: “No [public] company . . ., or any . . . contractor [or]&para;<br>subcontractor . . . of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend,&para;<br>threaten, harass, or . . . discriminate against an employee in the&para;<br>terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activity].” 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a).&para;<br>Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respondents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or&para;<br>manage mutual funds. As is common in the industry, the mutual&para;<br>funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees. Both&para;<br>plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating&para;<br>to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by&para;<br>FMR. Each commenced suit in federal court. Moving to dismiss the&para;<br>suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under&para;<br>§1514A, for that provision protects only employees of public companies, and not employees of private companies that contract with public companies. On interlocutory appeal from the District Court’s denial of FMR’s motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed,&para;<br>concluding that the term “an employee” in §1514A(a) refers only to&para;<br>employees of public companies.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.&para;<br>670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that&para;<br>§1514A’s whistleblower protection includes employees of a public&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v. FMR LLC&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>company’s private contractors and subcontractors. Pp. 9–29.&para;<br>(a) This reading of §1514A is supported by the provision’s text.&para;<br>Pp. 9–16.&para;<br>(1) The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provision’s language. See Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108. As&para;<br>relevant here, §1514A(a) provides that “no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.” The ordinary meaning of “an employee” in&para;<br>this proscription is the contractor’s own employee. FMR’s “narrower&para;<br>construction” requires inserting “of a public company” after “an employee,” but where Congress meant “an employee of a public company,” it said so.&para;<br>The provision as a whole supports this reading. The prohibited retaliatory measures enumerated in §1514A(a)—discharge, demotion,&para;<br>suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment&para;<br>terms and conditions—are actions an employer takes against its own&para;<br>employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse&para;<br>actions against employees of the public company with whom they&para;<br>contract. FMR’s interpretation of §1514A, therefore, would shrink to&para;<br>insignificance the provision’s ban on retaliation by contractors. The&para;<br>protected activity covered by §1514A, and the provision’s enforcement&para;<br>procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an&para;<br>employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblowing employee. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(2) FMR’s textual arguments are unpersuasive. It urges that “an&para;<br>employee” must be read to refer exclusively to public company employees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the personal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their housekeepers or gardeners. This concern appears more theoretical than&para;<br>real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments&para;<br>opposing FMR’s reading of §1514A. FMR also urges that its reading&para;<br>is supported by the provision’s statutory headings, but those headings are “not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the&para;<br>text.” Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528.&para;<br>Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(b) Other considerations support the Court’s textual analysis.&para;<br>Pp. 16–27.&para;<br>(1) The Court’s reading fits §1514A’s aim to ward off another Enron debacle. The legislative record shows Congress’ understanding&para;<br>that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting&para;<br>fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that&para;<br>fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the&para;<br>employees of Enron’s contractors. Sarbanes-Oxley contains numerous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only §1514A&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>affords such employees protection from retaliation by their employers&para;<br>for complying with the Act’s reporting requirements. Pp. 16–20.&para;<br>(2) This Court’s reading of §1514A avoids insulating the entire&para;<br>mutual fund industry from §1514A. Virtually all mutual funds are&para;<br>structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are&para;<br>managed, instead, by independent investment advisors. Accordingly,&para;<br>the “narrower construction” endorsed by FMR would leave §1514A&para;<br>with no application to mutual funds. The Court’s reading of §1514A,&para;<br>in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are&para;<br>often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mutual funds. Pp. 20–22.&para;<br>(3) There is scant evidence that today’s decision will open any&para;<br>floodgates for whistleblowing suits outside §1514A’s purposes. The&para;<br>Department of Labor’s regulations have interpreted §1514A as protecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable&para;<br>to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor&para;<br>has asserted a §1514A claim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various&para;<br>limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems. This Court&para;<br>need not determine §1514A’s bounds here, however, because, if plaintiffs’ allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the “firsthand&para;<br>witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud” Congress anticipated §1514A&para;<br>would protect. S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 10. Pp. 22–24.&para;<br>(4) The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act does not affect this Court’s task of determining whether&para;<br>Congress in 2002 afforded protection to whistleblowing contractor&para;<br>employees. Pp. 24–27.&para;<br>(c) AIR 21’s whistleblower protection provision has been read to&para;<br>cover, in addition to employees of air carriers, employees of contractors and subcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statutory&para;<br>texts and whistleblower protective aims, the Court reads the words&para;<br>“an employee” in AIR 21 and in §1514A to have similar import.&para;<br>Pp. 27–29.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, relying only on 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1514A’s text and broader context, agreed that §1514A protects employees of private contractors from retaliation when they report covered forms of fraud.

See S. Rep. No. 107–146,&para;<br>pp. 2–11 (2002). A provision of the Act, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1514A, protects whistleblowers. Section 1514A, at the&para;<br>time here relevant, instructed:&para;<br>“No [public] company . . . , or any officer, employee,&para;<br>contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company,&para;<br>may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,&para;<br>or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].”&para;<br>§1514A(a) (2006 ed.).&para;<br>This case concerns the definition of the protected class:&para;<br>Does §1514A shield only those employed by the public&para;<br>company itself, or does it shield as well employees of privately held contractors and subcontractors—for example,&para;<br>investment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises—&para;<br>who perform work for the public company?&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v. FMR LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We hold, based on the text of §1514A, the mischief to&para;<br>which Congress was responding, and earlier legislation&para;<br>Congress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees&para;<br>of private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shelters employees of the public company served by the contractors and subcontractors. We first summarize our&para;<br>principal reasons, then describe this controversy and&para;<br>explain our decision more comprehensively.&para;<br>Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees&para;<br>of private companies that contract to advise or manage&para;<br>mutual funds. The mutual funds themselves are public&para;<br>companies that have no employees. Hence, if the whistle&para;<br>is to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund investors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another&para;<br>company’s payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual&para;<br>fund’s investment adviser or manager.&para;<br>Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both&para;<br>plaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to&para;<br>the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse&para;<br>action by their employers. Plaintiffs read §1514A to convey that “[n]o . . . contractor . . . may . . . discriminate&para;<br>against [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].” We find&para;<br>that reading consistent with the text of the statute and&para;<br>with common sense. Contractors are in control of their&para;<br>own employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control&para;<br>someone else’s workers. Moreover, we resist attributing to&para;<br>Congress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating&para;<br>against whistleblowers employed by the public company&para;<br>the contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to&para;<br>retaliate against its own employees when they reveal&para;<br>corporate fraud.&para;<br>In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley&para;<br>Act, contractors and subcontractors, including the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron’s&para;<br>fraud and its coverup. When employees of those contractors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encoun-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tered retaliation by their employers. The Sarbanes-Oxley&para;<br>Act contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the&para;<br>conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work&para;<br>with public companies. See, e.g., 116 Stat. 750–765, 773–&para;<br>774, 784, §§101–107, 203–206, 307. Given Congress’&para;<br>concern about contractor conduct of the kind that contributed to Enron’s collapse, we regard with suspicion construction of §1514A to protect whistleblowers only when&para;<br>they are employed by a public company, and not when&para;<br>they work for the public company’s contractor.&para;<br>Congress borrowed §1514A’s prohibition against retaliation from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR&para;<br>21), 49 U. S. C. §42121. That Act provides: “No air carrier&para;<br>or contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may discharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an&para;<br>employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions,&para;<br>or privileges of employment” when the employee provides&para;<br>information regarding violations “relating to air carrier&para;<br>safety” to his or her employer or federal authorities.&para;<br>§42121(a)(1). AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to&para;<br>employees of air carriers, employees of contractors and&para;<br>subcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statutory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we read&para;<br>the words “an employee” in AIR 21 and in §1514A to have&para;<br>similar import.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act)&para;<br>aims to “prevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud,&para;<br>protect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of&para;<br>such fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their&para;<br>actions.” S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 2 (2002) (hereinafter&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v. FMR LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>S. Rep.).1 Of particular concern to Congress was abundant&para;<br>evidence that Enron had succeeded in perpetuating its&para;<br>massive shareholder fraud in large part due to a “corporate code of silence”; that code, Congress found, “discourage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not&para;<br>only to the proper authorities, such as the FBI and the&para;<br>SEC, but even internally.” Id., at 4–5 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). When employees of Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, attempted to report&para;<br>corporate misconduct, Congress learned, they faced retaliation, including discharge. As outside counsel advised&para;<br>company officials at the time, Enron’s efforts to “quiet”&para;<br>whistleblowers generally were not proscribed under thenexisting law. Id., at 5, 10. Congress identified the lack of&para;<br>whistleblower protection as “a significant deficiency” in&para;<br>the law, for in complex securities fraud investigations,&para;<br>employees “are [often] the only firsthand witnesses to the&para;<br>fraud.” Id., at 10.&para;<br>Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley addresses this concern.&para;<br>Titled “Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud,” §806 added a new&para;<br>provision to Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1514A, which reads in relevant part:&para;<br>“Civil action to protect against retaliation in&para;<br>fraud cases&para;<br>“(a) WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Title VIII of the Act, which contains the whistleblower protection&para;<br>provision at issue in this case, was authored by Senators Leahy and&para;<br>Grassley and originally constituted a discrete bill, S. 2010.

We note, however, that the SEC apparently does not share the&para;<br>dissent’s view that it, rather than DOL, has interpretive authority over&para;<br>§1514A.

The dissent observes that the SEC “has&para;<br>not issued a regulation applying §1514A whistleblower protection to&para;<br>employees of public company contractors,” post, at 18, but omits to&para;<br>inform that the SEC has not promulgated any regulations interpreting&para;<br>§1514A, consistent with its view that Congress delegated that responsibility to DOL.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v.

Under the dissent’s reading of §1514A, the&para;<br>inclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more&para;<br>than make the contractor secondarily liable for complying&para;<br>with such marching orders—hardly a hole at all.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The dissent suggests that we “fai[l] to recognize” that its construction also makes contractors primarily liable for retaliating of their own&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v.

If, as we hold, “an employee” includes&para;<br>employees of contractors, then grammatically, the term&para;<br>also includes employees of public company officers and&para;<br>employees. Nothing suggests Congress’ attention was&para;<br>drawn to the curiosity its drafting produced. The issue,&para;<br>however, is likely more theoretical than real. Few housekeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon&para;<br>and comprehend evidence of their employer’s complicity in&para;<br>fraud. In any event, FMR’s point is outweighed by the&para;<br>compelling arguments opposing FMR’s contention that “an&para;<br>employee” refers simply and only to public company employees.

Although §1514A’s own heading is&para;<br>broad (“Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud&para;<br>cases”), subsection (a) is captioned “Whistleblower Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.” Similarly, the relevant public law section, §806 of SarbanesOxley, is captioned “Protection for Employees of Publicly&para;<br>Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.” 116&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The ARB endorsed this view in Spinner v.

We&para;<br>have no occasion to determine whether the ARB would be entitled to&para;<br>deference in this regard, for, as explained in text, we find that the&para;<br>statutory text unambiguously affords protection to personal employees&para;<br>of public company officers and employees. §1514A(a).&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v.

In&para;<br>Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 331 U.

The under-inclusiveness of the two&para;<br>headings relied on by the Court of Appeals is apparent.&para;<br>The provision indisputably extends protection to employees of companies that file reports with the SEC pursuant&para;<br>to §15(d) of the 1934 Act, even when such companies are&para;<br>not “publicly traded.” And the activity protected under&para;<br>§1514A is not limited to “provid[ing] evidence of fraud”; it&para;<br>also includes reporting violations of SEC rules or regulations. §1514A(a)(1). As in Trainmen, the headings here&para;<br>are “but a short-hand reference to the general subject&para;<br>matter” of the provision, “not meant to take the place of&para;<br>the detailed provisions of the text.” 331 U.

It&para;<br>nonetheless declined to interpret §1514A the same way,&para;<br>because, in its view, “important differences” separate the&para;<br>two provisions.

I therefore&para;<br>join the Court’s opinion in principal part.&para;<br>I do not endorse, however, the Court’s occasional excursions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and&para;<br>context, into the swamps of legislative history. Reliance&para;<br>on legislative history rests upon several frail premises.&para;<br>First, and most important: That the statute means what&para;<br>Congress intended. It does not. Because we are a government of laws, not of men, and are governed by what&para;<br>Congress enacted rather than by what it intended, the sole&para;<br>object of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what&para;<br>a law says. Second: That there was a congressional “intent” apart from that reflected in the enacted text. On&para;<br>most issues of detail that come before this Court, I am&para;<br>confident that the majority of Senators and Representatives had no views whatever on how the issues should be&para;<br>resolved—indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely.&para;<br>Third: That the views expressed in a committee report or a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v.

Many of them almost certainly did not read the&para;<br>report or hear the statement, much less agree with it—not&para;<br>to mention the Members of the other House and the President who signed the bill.&para;<br>Since congressional “intent” apart from enacted text is&para;<br>fiction to begin with, courts understandably allow themselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it. Today’s&para;<br>opinion is no exception. It cites parts of the legislative&para;<br>record that are consistent with its holding that §1514A&para;<br>covers employees of private contractors and subcontractors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in&para;<br>the opposite direction. For example, the following remark&para;<br>by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s lead sponsor in the Senate:&para;<br>“[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively&para;<br>to public companies—that is, to companies registered&para;<br>with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not&para;<br>applicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[*] who make up the&para;<br>vast majority of companies across the country.” 148 Cong.&para;<br>Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Sarbanes).&para;<br>Two other minor points in the Court’s opinion I do not&para;<br>agree with. First, I do not rely on the fact that a separate&para;<br>anti-retaliation provision, 49 U. S. C. §42121(a), “has been&para;<br>read” by an administrative tribunal to cover contractor&para;<br>employees. Ante, at 29. Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled&para;<br>“Procedure,” contains cross-references to the procedural&para;<br>rules set forth in §42121(b), but the substantive provisions&para;<br>of §1514A(a) are worded quite differently from the substantive prohibition of §42121, which is contained in subsection (a)—thus making interpretation of the latter an&para;<br>unreliable guide to §1514A’s meaning. Second, I do not&para;<br>agree with the Court’s acceptance of the possible validity&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The Congressional Record reads “provide companies,” but context as&para;<br>well as grammar makes clear that this is a scrivener’s error for “private&para;<br>companies.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Three indicators of Congress’ intent&para;<br>clearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower interpretation of §1514A: the statute’s headings, the statutory&para;<br>context, and the absurd results that follow from the majority’s interpretation.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring&para;<br>that the “ ‘relevant syntactic elements’ ” of §1514A are that&para;<br>“ ‘ “no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.” ’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 9.

But §1514A(a) actually provides that “[n]o [public] company . . . or any officer,&para;<br>employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such&para;<br>company . . . may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,&para;<br>harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an&para;<br>employee.” The provision thus does not speak only (or&para;<br>even primarily) to “contractors.” It speaks to public companies, and then includes a list of five types of representatives that companies hire to carry out their business:&para;<br>“officer[s], employee[s], contractor[s], subcontractor[s],&para;<br>[and] agent[s].”&para;<br>Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous. The majority is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause&para;<br>of action both for employees of public companies and for&para;<br>employees of the enumerated public company representatives. But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to&para;<br>prohibit the public company and the listed representatives—all of whom act on the company’s behalf—from&para;<br>retaliating against just the public company’s employees.&para;<br>The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense&para;<br>when one considers the other terms in the list of company representatives. The majority acknowledges that, as a&para;<br>matter of “gramma[r],” the scope of protected employees&para;<br>must be consistent with respect to all five types of company representatives listed in §1514A(a).

Yet&para;<br>the Government and petitioners readily concede that&para;<br>§1514A is meant to bar two of the enumerated representatives—“officer[s]” and “employee[s]”—from retaliating&para;<br>against other employees of the public company, as opposed&para;<br>to their own babysitters and housekeepers.

Ante, at 15. In&para;<br>reaching this result, however, the majority only adds to the absurdities&para;<br>produced by its holding. See infra, at 12–13.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Here, two headings strongly suggest that&para;<br>Congress intended §1514A to apply only to employees of&para;<br>public companies. First, the title of §806—the section of&para;<br>the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted §1514A—speaks&para;<br>clearly to the scope of employees protected by the provision: “Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.” 116 Stat. 802.&para;<br>Second, the heading of §1514A(a) reinforces that the provision provides “[w]histleblower protection for employees&para;<br>of publicly traded companies.”&para;<br>The majority suggests that in covering “employees of&para;<br>publicly traded companies,” the headings may be imprecise. Ante, at 16. Section 1514A(a) technically applies to&para;<br>the employees of two types of companies: those “with a&para;<br>class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,” and those that are “required&para;<br>to file reports under section 15(d) of the” same Act. Both&para;<br>types of companies are “public” in that they are publicly&para;<br>owned. See ante, at 7–8. The difference is that shares of&para;<br>the §12 companies are listed and traded on a national&para;<br>securities exchange; §15(d) companies, by contrast, exchange their securities directly with the public. The headings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase&para;<br>“publicly traded” is commonly associated with companies&para;<br>whose securities are traded on national exchanges. Congress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer&para;<br>to §15(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are&para;<br>traded publicly, too. For instance, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 20, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic&para;<br>example of a §15(d) company. And mutual funds, like&para;<br>other §15(d) companies, are both publicly owned and&para;<br>widely traded; the trades just take place typically between&para;<br>the fund and its investors directly.&para;<br>In any case, even if referring to employees of §12 and&para;<br>§15(d) companies together as “employees of publicly traded&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v. FMR LLC&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>companies” may be slightly imprecise, the majority’s competing interpretation of §1514A would stretch the statute’s headings far past the point of recognition. As the&para;<br>majority understands the law, Congress used the term&para;<br>“employees of publicly traded companies” as shorthand not&para;<br>just for (1) employees of §12 and §15(d) companies, but&para;<br>also for (2) household employees of any individual who&para;<br>works for a §12 or §15(d) company; (3) employees of any&para;<br>private company that contracts with a §12 or §15(d) company; (4) employees of any private company that, even if&para;<br>it does not contract with a public company, subcontracts&para;<br>with a private company that does; and (5) employees of&para;<br>any agent of a §12 or §15(d) company. If Congress had&para;<br>wanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would&para;<br>have called it something other than “[w]histleblower&para;<br>protection for employees of publicly traded companies.”&para;<br>Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are&para;<br>inconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes&para;<br>that the Court has “placed less weight on captions.” Ante,&para;<br>at 16. But where the captions favor one interpretation so&para;<br>decisively, their significance should not be dismissed so&para;<br>quickly. As we have explained, headings are important&para;<br>“ ‘tools available for the resolution of a doubt’ about the&para;<br>meaning of a statute.” Almendarez-Torres v. United&para;<br>States, 523 U. S. 224, 234 (1998).&para;<br>C&para;<br>1&para;<br>Statutory context confirms that Congress intended&para;<br>§1514A to apply only to employees of public companies.&para;<br>To start, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a whole evinces a&para;<br>clear focus on public companies. Congress stated in the&para;<br>Act’s preamble that its objective was to “protect investors&para;<br>by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate&para;<br>disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,” 116&para;<br>Stat. 745, disclosures that public companies alone must&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>file. The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations&para;<br>for public companies, §401; added new conflict of interest&para;<br>rules for their executives, §402; increased the responsibilities of their audit committees, §301; and created new rules&para;<br>governing insider trading by their executives and directors, §306. The common denominator among all of these&para;<br>provisions is their singular focus on the activities of public&para;<br>companies.&para;<br>When Congress wanted to depart from the Act’s public&para;<br>company focus to regulate private firms and their employees, it spoke clearly. For example, §307 of the Act ordered&para;<br>the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue&para;<br>rules “setting forth minimum standards of professional&para;<br>conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the&para;<br>[SEC],” including a rule requiring outside counsel to report violations of the securities laws to public company&para;<br>officers and directors. 15 U. S. C. §7245. Similarly, Title I&para;<br>of the Act created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and vested it with the authority&para;<br>to register, regulate, investigate, and discipline privately&para;<br>held outside accounting firms and their employees.&para;<br>§§7211–7215. And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules&para;<br>governing outside securities analysts when they make&para;<br>public recommendations regarding securities. §78o–6.&para;<br>Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously&para;<br>cover the employees of private businesses that contract&para;<br>with public companies or the employees of individuals who&para;<br>work for public companies. Far from it, for the reasons&para;<br>noted above. Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act&para;<br>demonstrates, if Congress had really wanted §1514A to&para;<br>impose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it&para;<br>would have said so more clearly.&para;<br>Congress’ intent to adopt the narrower understanding of&para;<br>§1514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the&para;<br>whistleblower provision that served as its model. That&para;<br>provision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v. FMR LLC&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49&para;<br>U. S.

But as&para;<br>the majority acknowledges, “Congress strayed” from&para;<br>§42121 in significant ways when it wrote §1514A. Ante,&para;<br>at 29. First, §42121 specifically defines the term “contractor,” limiting the term to “a company that performs&para;<br>safety-sensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.”&para;<br>§42121(e). That is in notable distinction to §1514A, which&para;<br>does not define the word “contractor” as a particular type&para;<br>of company, instead placing the term in a list alongside&para;<br>individual “officer[s]” and “employee[s]” who act on a&para;<br>company’s behalf. Second, unlike §42121, §1514A sets off&para;<br>the term “contractor” in a separate clause that is subsidiary to the primary subject of the provision—the public&para;<br>company itself. Third, the title of §42121 is “[p]rotection of&para;<br>employees providing air safety information,” a title that&para;<br>comfortably encompasses the employees of contractors.&para;<br>Not so of §1514A’s headings, as explained above. In short,&para;<br>§42121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if&para;<br>it wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet&para;<br>chose to depart from that model in several important&para;<br>ways. We should not presume that choice to be accidental.&para;<br>See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S.&para;<br>723, 734 (1975).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The majority relies on statutory context as well, but its&para;<br>examples are unconvincing. It first argues that the types&para;<br>of conduct prohibited by the statute—“discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, [and] discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment”—are&para;<br>“commonly actions an employer takes against its own&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>employees.” Ante, at 10. The problem is that §1514A does&para;<br>not forbid retaliation by an “employer”; it forbids retaliation by a “[public] company . . . or any officer, employee,&para;<br>contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.” For&para;<br>the reasons already discussed, Congress could have reasonably included the five types of representatives not in&para;<br>their capacity as employers, but rather as representatives&para;<br>of the company who are barred from retaliating against a&para;<br>public company’s employees on the company’s behalf.&para;<br>The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely&para;<br>“positioned to take adverse actions against employees of&para;<br>the public company with whom they contract.” Ante, at&para;<br>10. That misconceives the nature of modern work forces,&para;<br>which increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and&para;<br>persons laboring under more typical employment relationships. For example, public companies often hire “independent contractors,” of whom there are more than 10&para;<br>million,3 and contract workers,4 of whom there are more&para;<br>than 11 million.5 And they employ outside lawyers, accountants, and auditors as well.

Otherwise, the statute would have had a&para;<br>gaping hole—a public company could evade §1514A simply&para;<br>by hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory&para;<br>acts that an officer or employee could not.6&para;<br>The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence&para;<br>of “outplacement” firms, or consultants that help companies determine whom to fire.

It surely does, but that is the point—&para;<br>the whole reason §1514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly&para;<br>forbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through&para;<br>“any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.” The prohibition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain&para;<br>(hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to&para;<br>retaliate through its “officers and employees.” Moreover, while the&para;<br>majority concedes that, under the narrower reading of §1514A, Congress’ inclusion of the term “contractor” imposes secondary liability in&para;<br>the event a public company is judgment proof, ante, at 13, the majority&para;<br>fails to recognize that Congress’ use of the term also imposes primary&para;<br>liability against contractors who threaten public company employees&para;<br>without direction from the company. Thus, for example, FMR’s interpretation of §1514A would prevent an outside accountant from threatening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the&para;<br>accountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the&para;<br>whistle on that fraud.&para;<br>7 Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010,&para;<br>www.slate.com / articles / news_and_politics / explainer/2010/01/getting_&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Ante, at&para;<br>13. But there is no requirement that a statute must make&para;<br>every type of remedy available against every type of defendant.

Ante, at 11, n. 9. The two&para;<br>words are not legally synonymous, however.

Yet the majority might well embroil&para;<br>federal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane&para;<br>labor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns.&para;<br>For instance, a construction worker could file a §1514A&para;<br>suit against her employer (that has a long-term contract&para;<br>with a public company) if the worker is demoted after&para;<br>reporting that another client has mailed the company a&para;<br>false invoice.9&para;<br>The majority’s interpretation also produces truly odd&para;<br>distinctions. Under the rule it announces, a babysitter&para;<br>can bring a §1514A retaliation suit against his employer&para;<br>if his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart&para;<br>(a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the&para;<br>local Petco (a private company). Likewise, the day laborer&para;<br>who works for a construction business can avail himself of&para;<br>§1514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the&para;<br>local Dick’s Sporting Goods store (a public company), but&para;<br>not if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private&para;<br>company).&para;<br>In light of the reasonable alternative reading of §1514A,&para;<br>there is no reason to accept these absurd results. The&para;<br>majority begs to differ, arguing that “[t]here is scant evidence” that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude&para;<br>of newly covered employees “ ‘who have no exposure to&para;<br>investor-related activities and thus could not possibly&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Recognizing that the majority’s reading would lead to a “notably&para;<br>expansive scope untethered to the purpose of the statute,” the District&para;<br>Court in this case sought to impose an extratextual limiting principle&para;<br>under which an employee who reports fraud is entitled to protection&para;<br>only if her report “relat[es] to fraud against shareholders.” 724&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 141, 160 (Mass. 2010).

Until&para;<br>today, however, no court has deemed §1514A applicable to&para;<br>household employees of individuals who work for public&para;<br>companies; even the Department of Labor’s ARB rejected&para;<br>that view. Spinner, ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, at 8. And as&para;<br>the District Court noted, prior to the ARB’s 2012 decision&para;<br>in Spinner, the ARB “ha[d] yet to provide . . . definitive&para;<br>clarification” on the question whether §1514A extends to&para;<br>the employees of a public company’s private contractors.&para;<br>724 F. Supp. 2d 141, 155 (Mass. 2010). So the fact that&para;<br>individuals and private businesses have yet to suffer&para;<br>burdensome litigation offers little assurance that the majority’s capacious reading of §1514A will produce no untoward effects.&para;<br>Finally, it must be noted that §1514A protects the reporting of a variety of frauds—not only securities fraud,&para;<br>but also mail, wire, and bank fraud. By interpreting a&para;<br>statute that already protects an expansive class of conduct&para;<br>also to cover a large class of employees, today’s opinion&para;<br>threatens to subject private companies to a costly new&para;<br>front of employment litigation. Congress almost certainly&para;<br>did not intend the statute to have that reach.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The majority argues that the broader reading of §1514A&para;<br>is necessary because a small number of the millions of&para;<br>individuals and private companies affected by its ruling&para;<br>have a special role to play in preventing public company&para;<br>fraud. If §1514A does not bar retaliation against employees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms&para;<br>and accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their&para;<br>employees when those employees report fraud on the part&para;<br>of their public company clients.&para;<br>It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role&para;<br>that outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron&para;<br>debacle and the importance of encouraging them to play&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

But it hardly&para;<br>follows that Congress must have meant to apply §1514A to&para;<br>every employee of every public company contractor, subcontractor, officer, and employee as a result. It is far more&para;<br>likely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and&para;<br>professional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and&para;<br>accountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the&para;<br>hands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.&para;<br>Specifically, rather than imposing §1514A’s generic&para;<br>approach on outside accounting firms, Congress established the PCAOB, which regulates “every detail” of an&para;<br>accounting firm’s practice, including “supervision of audit work,” “internal inspection procedures,” “professional&para;<br>ethics rules,” and “ ‘such other requirements as the Board&para;<br>may prescribe.’ ” Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company&para;<br>Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 3–4). Importantly, the PCAOB is empowered to&para;<br>levy “severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to&para;<br>and including the permanent revocation of a firm’s registration . . . and money penalties of $15 million.” Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 4) (citing 15 U. S. C. §7215(c)(4)). Such sanctions could well provide a more powerful incentive to&para;<br>prevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its&para;<br>employees than §1514A.&para;<br>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory&para;<br>authority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys. The&para;<br>Act requires the SEC to establish rules of professional&para;<br>conduct for attorneys, §307 (codified at 15 U. S. C. §7245),&para;<br>and confers broad power on the SEC to punish attorneys&para;<br>for “improper professional conduct,” which would include,&para;<br>for example, a law firm partner’s decision to retaliate&para;<br>against an associate who reports fraud. §602 (codified at&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §78d–3). Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the&para;<br>power to censure culpable attorneys and to deny “permanently” to any such attorney the “privilege of appearing of&para;<br>practicing before” the SEC “in any way.” §602.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v. FMR LLC&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress thus evidently made the judgment that decisions concerning how best to punish law firms and accounting firms ought to be handled not by the Department&para;<br>of Labor, but by the SEC and the PCAOB. Such judgment&para;<br>should not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much&para;<br>less at the cost to congressional intent produced by today’s&para;<br>ruling. The majority does offer cogent policy arguments&para;<br>for why Congress might have been wiser to include certain&para;<br>types of contractors within §1514A, noting for example&para;<br>that a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retaliate against its employees for making reports required&para;<br>under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ante, at 19. But as the&para;<br>majority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that&para;<br>precise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower&para;<br>incentive and protection program that unequivocally&para;<br>“prohibit[s] any employer”—public or private—“from retaliating against ‘a whistleblower’ for providing information to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or&para;<br>making disclosures required or protected under SarbanesOxley and certain other securities laws.” Ante, at 26&para;<br>(citing 15 U. S. C. §§78u–6(a)(6), (b)(1), (h)). The majority&para;<br>thus acknowledges that, moving forward, retaliation&para;<br>claims like the petitioners’ may “procee[d] under [§78u-6],”&para;<br>ante, at 26, n. 17. In other words, to the extent the majority worries about a “hole” in FMR’s interpretation, ante,&para;<br>at 14, Congress has already addressed it.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority also contends that its reading is necessary to avoid&para;<br>“insulating the entire mutual fund industry from §1514A.” Ante, at 20.&para;<br>But that argument is misguided for a reason similar to the majority’s&para;<br>concern about lawyers and accountants. As this Court has observed,&para;<br>Congress responded to the “ ‘potential for abuse inherent in the structure of investment companies,’ ” Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464&para;<br>U.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).11&para;<br>Under United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–&para;<br>227 (2001), an agency may claim Chevron deference “when&para;<br>it appears [1] that Congress delegated authority to the&para;<br>agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,&para;<br>and [2] that the agency interpretation claiming deference&para;<br>was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” Neither requirement is met here.&para;<br>First, the agency interpretation for which petitioners&para;<br>claim deference is the position announced by the ARB, the&para;<br>board to which the Secretary of Labor has delegated authority “in review or on appeal” in connection with §1514A&para;<br>proceedings. 75 Fed. Reg. 3924 (2010). According to&para;<br>petitioners, the ARB’s rulings are entitled to deference&para;<br>because the “Secretary is responsible for enforcing Section&para;<br>1514A both through investigation and through formal&para;<br>adjudication.” Brief for Petitioners 61. That is right as far&para;<br>as it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>§80b–11. The Act also authorizes fines and imprisonment of up to five&para;<br>years for violations of SEC rules. The SEC thus has broad discretion to&para;<br>punish retaliatory actions taken by mutual fund advisers against their&para;<br>employees. And to the extent these provisions may have been insufficient to protect mutual fund adviser employees, §78u–6’s extensive&para;<br>whistleblower incentive and protection program now unambiguously&para;<br>covers such employees.&para;<br>11 Although it claims not to reach the issue, ante, at 9, n. 6, the majority implicitly declines to defer to a portion of the ARB’s ruling as well,&para;<br>rejecting the ARB’s ruling that §1514A does not apply to the household&para;<br>employees of public company officers and employees, ante, at 15, and&para;<br>n. 11.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v.

C.&para;<br>§7202(a), provides that the SEC “shall promulgate such&para;<br>rules and regulations, as may be necessary or appropriate&para;<br>in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and&para;<br>in furtherance of this Act.” So if any agency has the authority to resolve ambiguities in §1514A with the force&para;<br>of law, it is the SEC, not the Department of Labor.&para;<br>See Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review&para;<br>Comm’n, 499 U. S. 144, 154 (1991). The SEC, however, has&para;<br>not issued a regulation applying §1514A whistleblower&para;<br>protection to employees of public company contractors.&para;<br>And while the majority notes that the SEC may share the&para;<br>(incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has interpretive authority regarding §1514A, ante, at 9, n. 6, the&para;<br>majority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may&para;<br>transfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Congress to a different agency simply by signing onto an&para;<br>amicus brief.&para;<br>That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to resolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by §1514A’s&para;<br>mechanism for judicial review. The statute does not merely&para;<br>permit courts to review the Secretary’s final adjudicatory&para;<br>rulings under the Administrative Procedure Act’s deferential standard. It instead allows a claimant to bring an&para;<br>action in a federal district court, and allows district courts&para;<br>to adjudicate such actions de novo, in any case where the&para;<br>Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.&para;<br>That is a conspicuously short amount of time in light of&para;<br>the three-tiered process of agency review of §1514A&para;<br>claims. See ante, at 5–6. As a result, even if Congress had&para;<br>not delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambiguities in §1514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>suggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts,&para;<br>and not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power. See&para;<br>Mead, 533 U. S., at 232 (declining to defer to Customs&para;<br>Service classifications where, among other things, the&para;<br>statute authorized “independent review of Customs classifications by the [Court of International Trade]”).&para;<br>As to the second Mead requirement, even if Congress&para;<br>had delegated authority to the Secretary to make “rules&para;<br>carrying the force of law,” the “agency interpretation&para;<br>claiming deference” in this case was not “promulgated in&para;<br>the exercise of that authority.” Id., at 226–227. That is&para;<br>because the Secretary has explicitly vested any policymaking authority he may have with respect to §1514A in the&para;<br>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)&para;<br>instead of the ARB. See 67 Fed. Reg. 65008 (2002). In&para;<br>fact, the Secretary has expressly withdrawn from the ARB&para;<br>any power to deviate from the rules OSHA issues on the&para;<br>Department of Labor’s behalf. 75 Fed. Reg. 3925 (“The&para;<br>[ARB] shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of&para;<br>any portion of the Code of Federal Regulations that has&para;<br>been duly promulgated by the Department of Labor and&para;<br>shall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in&para;<br>its decisions”).&para;<br>OSHA has promulgated regulations supporting the&para;<br>majority’s reading of §1514A. See 29 CFR §1980.101(f )–(g)&para;<br>(2013). The Secretary, however, has expressly disclaimed&para;<br>any claim of deference to them. See Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 33, n. 8. As a result, the ARB’s&para;<br>understanding of §1514A’s coverage in Spinner was not an&para;<br>“exercise of [the Secretary’s] authority” to make rules&para;<br>carrying the force of law, Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227, but&para;<br>rather the ARB’s necessary compliance with a regulation&para;<br>that no one claims is deserving of deference in the first&para;<br>place. See Spinner, ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, at 10 (recognizing that “the ARB is bound by the [Department of&para;<br>Labor] regulations”).&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>LAWSON v.

But the ARB’s&para;<br>decision is unpersuasive, for the many reasons already&para;<br>discussed.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Court’s interpretation of §1514A undeniably serves&para;<br>a laudatory purpose. By covering employees of every officer, employee, and contractor of every public company,&para;<br>the majority’s interpretation extends §1514A’s protections&para;<br>to the outside lawyers and accountants who could have&para;<br>helped prevent the Enron fraud.&para;<br>But that is not the statute Congress wrote. Congress&para;<br>envisioned a system in which public company employees&para;<br>would be covered by §1514A, and in which outside lawyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be&para;<br>regulated by the SEC and PCAOB. Congress did not&para;<br>envision a system in which employees of other private&para;<br>businesses—such as cleaning and construction company&para;<br>workers who have little interaction with investor-related&para;<br>activities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting&para;<br>fraud against shareholders—would fall within §1514A.&para;<br>Nor, needless to say, did it envision §1514A applying to&para;<br>the household employees of millions of individuals who&para;<br>happen to work for public companies—housekeepers,&para;<br>gardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned&para;<br>to prevent fraud against public company investors. And to&para;<br>the extent §1514A may have been underinclusive as first&para;<br>drafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any&para;<br>gaps. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, §§922, 929A, 124 Stat. 1848, 1852&para;<br>(extending §1514A to credit rating agencies and public&para;<br>company subsidiaries); §922, id., at 1841–1848 (codifying&para;<br>additional whistleblower incentive and protection program&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.
