THOMAS, WARDEN&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–5201. Argued March 30, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010&para;<br>The federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a “prisoner . . .&para;<br>serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year . . . may receive&para;<br>credit toward the service of [that] sentence . . . of up to 54 days at the&para;<br>end of each year” subject to the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) “determina&para;<br>tion . . . that, during that year, the prisoner” has behaved in an ex&para;<br>emplary fashion. 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)(1). Credit “for the last year or&para;<br>portion of a year of the term of imprisonment [is] prorated . . . .” Ibid.&para;<br>The BOP applies this statute using a methodology that awards 54&para;<br>days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets&para;<br>those days to the side. When the difference between the time re&para;<br>maining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less&para;<br>than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that&para;<br>final year proportional to the awards in other years.&para;<br>Petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation method is unlawful&para;<br>because §3624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the&para;<br>term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the&para;<br>length of time that the prisoner actually serves. The District Court&para;<br>rejected this challenge in each of petitioner’s cases, and the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Because the BOP’s method for calculating good time credit re&para;<br>flects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful. Pp. 5–17.&para;<br>(a) The statute’s language and purpose, taken together, support the&para;<br>BOP’s method. That method tracks §3624(b)’s language by providing&para;<br>a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of impris&para;<br>onment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any addi&para;<br>tional time served that is less than a full year. As §3624(b) directs,&para;<br>the BOP awards the credit “at the end of each year” of imprisonment.&para;<br>Petitioners’ approach cannot be reconciled with the statute. Because&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much&para;<br>time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that&para;<br>he does not spend in prison. Moreover the calculation of credit for&para;<br>such a year would not be made “at the end of” that year. Nor could&para;<br>the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior&para;<br>“during that year.” This language did not find its way into the stat&para;<br>ute by accident. The differences between the prior provision (re&para;<br>pealed in 1984)—which granted the prisoner a deduction at the out&para;<br>set of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules—&para;<br>and the present statute—under which “credit” is “earned” “at the end&para;<br>of” the year based on an evaluation of behavior “during that year”—&para;<br>show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospec&para;<br>tive award. The BOP’s method also furthers the basic purpose of the&para;<br>statute. Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Re&para;<br>form Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing&para;<br>uniformity and greater honesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically&para;<br>determinate.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. There&para;<br>after, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender&para;<br>actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.&para;<br>Ibid. Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide&para;<br>an incentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional disciplinary&para;<br>regulations.” The exception is limited and tailored to its purpose—&para;<br>credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institu&para;<br>tional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a&para;<br>readily identifiable period of good behavior. The BOP’s approach fur&para;<br>thers §3624’s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior&para;<br>during the preceding year. In contrast, petitioners’ approach would&para;<br>allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence&para;<br>that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would&para;<br>loosen the statute’s connection between good behavior and the good&para;<br>time award. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. Context indicates&para;<br>that the phrase “term of imprisonment” as used in the portion of&para;<br>§3624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as pe&para;<br>titioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge. Petitioners’&para;<br>reliance on legislative history is misplaced. A U. S. Sentencing Com&para;<br>mission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because&para;<br>there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the&para;<br>Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular ques&para;<br>tion whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence&para;<br>imposed. Nor, in light of the statute’s text, structure, history, and&para;<br>purpose, is this a case in which there is a “grievous ambiguity or un&para;<br>certainty in the statute,” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125,&para;<br>139, permitting application of the rule of lenity. Because the BOP’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>calculation system applies the statute as its language is most natu&para;<br>rally read, and in accordance with the statute’s basic purpose, this&para;<br>Court need not determine the extent to which Congress has granted&para;<br>the BOP authority to interpret the statute more broadly, or differ&para;<br>ently than it has done here. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re&para;<br>sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844–845. And because&para;<br>the BOP’s approach reflects the statute’s most natural reading and is&para;<br>the most consistent with its purpose, it is also preferable to the dis&para;<br>sent’s alternative interpretation.

Petition&para;<br>ers, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the&para;<br>Federal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this “good&para;<br>time credit.” We conclude that the Bureau’s method re&para;<br>flects the most natural reading of the statute, and we&para;<br>reject petitioners’ legal challenge.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>A federal sentencing statute provides: &para;<br>&para;<br>“[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of&para;<br>more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the&para;<br>service of the prisoner’s sentence, beyond the time&para;<br>served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the&para;<br>prisoner’s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end&para;<br>of the first year of the term . . . . [C]redit for the last&para;<br>year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment&para;<br>shall be prorated and credited within the last six&para;<br>weeks of the sentence.” §3624(b)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) applies this statute using a&para;<br>methodology that petitioners in this case challenge as&para;<br>unlawful. In order to explain the BOP method, we shall&para;<br>use a simplified example that captures its essential ele&para;<br>ments. The unsimplified calculations described by the&para;<br>BOP in its policy statement, see App. 96–100, will reach&para;<br>approximately the same results as, and are essentially the&para;<br>mathematical equivalent of, the simplified system we&para;<br>describe (there may be other ways to describe the calcula&para;<br>tion as well). To the extent that there are any differences&para;<br>between the methodology employed by the BOP and that&para;<br>reflected in our example, they are of no consequence to the&para;<br>resolution of petitioners’ challenge and are therefore not&para;<br>before us. Similarly, although petitioners committed their&para;<br>crimes before the current version of §3624 was enacted&para;<br>and are therefore subject to a previous version that dif&para;<br>fered slightly in certain details, see 18 U. S. C. §3624&para;<br>(1988 ed.), the differences between the two versions are&para;<br>immaterial to the questions presented by this case. The&para;<br>parties refer to the current version as the relevant provi&para;<br>sion of law, see Brief for Petitioners 2–3; Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 8, n. 2, and we shall do the same.&para;<br>In our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has&para;<br>received a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. We shall&para;<br>assume that his behavior throughout his confinement is&para;<br>exemplary and that prison authorities will consequently&para;<br>consider him to merit the maximum good time credit that&para;<br>the statute will allow. And we shall ignore leap years.&para;<br>Thus, at the end of the first year (Year 1) that prisoner&para;<br>would earn the statute’s maximum credit of 54 days. The&para;<br>relevant official (whom we shall call the “good time calcu&para;<br>lator”) would note that fact and, in effect, preliminarily&para;<br>put the 54 days to the side. At the end of Year 2 the pris&para;<br>oner would earn an additional 54 days of good time credit.&para;<br>The good time calculator would add this 54 days to the&para;<br>first 54 days, note the provisional total of 108 days, and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>again put the 108 days’ credit to the side. By the end of&para;<br>Year 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days&para;<br>of good time credit (8 years times 54 days). At that time,&para;<br>the good time calculator would note that the difference&para;<br>between the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or&para;<br>730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit&para;<br>(432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298&para;<br>days, which is less than 365). The 432 days of good time&para;<br>credit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8&para;<br>are sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year&para;<br>prison term and to shorten the prisoner’s 9th year of im&para;<br>prisonment by 67 days.&para;<br>Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the&para;<br>prisoner’s last year of imprisonment. Further, because the&para;<br>prisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that&para;<br>year (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to&para;<br>Year 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner&para;<br>will have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.&para;<br>Now the good time calculator will have to work out just&para;<br>how much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit&para;<br>against, these remaining 298 days.&para;<br>As we said, the statute provides that “good time” for this&para;<br>“last year or portion” thereof shall be “prorated.” Thus,&para;<br>the good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two&para;<br>parts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in&para;<br>prison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will&para;<br>earn during the days served in Year 9. In other words, the&para;<br>number of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of&para;<br>good time credit days earned will be equal to the number&para;<br>of days left in the sentence, namely, 298. And to keep the&para;<br>award of credit in the last year proportional to awards in&para;<br>other years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (i.e., the&para;<br>number of good time days divided by the number of days&para;<br>served) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP&para;<br>applies to full years served. We can use some elementary&para;<br>algebra, described in the Appendix, infra, to work out the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rest. The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he&para;<br>can earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.&para;<br>That is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence,&para;<br>the prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement,&para;<br>after which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for&para;<br>(given the additional 38 days’ credit earned), and he will&para;<br>be released. In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year&para;<br>(3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of&para;<br>days the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confine&para;<br>ment and receive 470 days of “good time” credit, about&para;<br>15% of the prison time actually served.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In this case petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation&para;<br>method is unlawful. They say that §3624(b)(1) (2006 ed.)&para;<br>requires a straightforward calculation based upon the&para;<br>length of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing&para;<br>judge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner&para;<br>actually serves. Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a&para;<br>prison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in peti&para;<br>tioners’ view, the statute permits a maximum good time&para;<br>award of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470&para;<br>days that the method described above would allow. And if&para;<br>the judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months,&para;<br>then the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10&para;<br>years plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494&para;<br>days that the method above would allow. According to&para;<br>petitioners, the BOP’s method causes model prisoners to&para;<br>lose seven days of good time credit per year of imprison&para;<br>ment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one,&para;<br>Michael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months;&para;<br>the other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years&para;<br>and 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to&para;<br>several months of additional prison time.&para;<br>The District Court in each of these cases rejected the&para;<br>prisoner’s challenge. Civ. No. 08–226 MO (D Ore., Oct. 27,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2008), App. 13; Jihad-Black v. Thomas, Civ. No. 08–227&para;<br>MO (D Ore., Oct. 27, 2008), App. 25. And in each instance&para;<br>the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court. Tablada&para;<br>v. Thomas, No. 07–35538 (CA9, Apr. 10, 2009), App. 11;&para;<br>see also Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800 (CA9 2008).&para;<br>Because the BOP’s administration of good time credits&para;<br>affects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners,&para;<br>we granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to con&para;<br>sider petitioners’ challenge.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Having now considered petitioners’ arguments, we&para;<br>conclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.&para;<br>The statute’s language and its purpose, taken together,&para;<br>convince us that the BOP’s calculation method is lawful.&para;<br>For one thing, that method tracks the language of&para;<br>§3624(b). That provision says that a prisoner (serving a&para;<br>sentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less&para;<br>than life) “may receive credit . . . of up to 54 days at the&para;<br>end of each year” subject to the “determination by the&para;<br>Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner” has&para;<br>behaved in an exemplary fashion. Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>And it says that credit for the “last year or portion of a&para;<br>year . . . shall be prorated and credited within the last six&para;<br>weeks of the sentence.” Ibid. As the example in Part I&para;<br>makes clear, the BOP’s interpretation provides a prisoner&para;<br>entitled to a maximum annual credit with 54 days of good&para;<br>time credit for each full year of imprisonment that he&para;<br>serves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for&para;<br>any additional time served that is less than a full year.&para;<br>And, as §3624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit at the&para;<br>end of each year of imprisonment (except, of course, for&para;<br>Year 9, which is subject to the statute’s special instruction&para;<br>requiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks&para;<br>of the sentence).&para;<br>We are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners’ ap&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>proach with the statute. Their system awards credit for&para;<br>the sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is&para;<br>actually served. Thus, a prisoner under petitioners’ sys&para;<br>tem could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the&para;<br>fact that he would be released after less than 81⁄2 years in&para;<br>prison. The good time calculation for Year 10 would not be&para;<br>made “at the end of” Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks&para;<br>of a sentence ending during that year). Neither could the&para;<br>BOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in&para;<br>exemplary fashion “during that year.” 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)&para;<br>(emphasis added); see also White v. Scibana, 390 F. 3d&para;<br>997, 1001 (CA7 2004) (“The Bureau cannot evaluate a&para;<br>prisoner’s behavior and award credit for good conduct if&para;<br>the prisoner is not still in prison”); cf. McGinnis v. Royster,&para;<br>410 U. S. 263, 273 (1973) (“Where there is no evaluation&para;<br>by state officials and little or no rehabilitative participa&para;<br>tion for anyone to evaluate, there is a rational justification&para;<br>for declining to give good-time credit”).&para;<br>We cannot say that this language (“at the end of,” “dur&para;<br>ing that year”) found its way into the statute by accident.&para;<br>Under the previous good time provision, a prisoner was&para;<br>“entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence&para;<br>beginning with the day on which the sentence commences&para;<br>to run.” 18 U. S. C. §4161 (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984). This&para;<br>deduction, granted at the outset of a prisoner’s sentence,&para;<br>was then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner “com&para;<br>mit[ted] any offense or violate[d] the rules of the institu&para;<br>tion.” §4165 (repealed 1984). The present statute, §3624&para;<br>(2006 ed.), in contrast, creates a system under which&para;<br>“credit” is “earned” “at the end of” the year based on an&para;<br>evaluation of behavior “during that year.” We agree with&para;<br>the Government that “[t]he textual differences between&para;<br>the two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of&para;<br>prospective entitlement to a system of retrospective&para;<br>award.” Brief for Respondent 33; see also White, supra, at&para;<br>1002, n. 3.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>For another thing, the BOP’s method better furthers the&para;<br>statute’s basic purpose. The “good time” provision in&para;<br>§3624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98&para;<br>Stat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. §3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. §§991–&para;<br>998, a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentenc&para;<br>ing practice and directed the newly created United States&para;<br>Sentencing Commission “to devise guidelines to be used&para;<br>for sentencing” in district courts, Mistretta v. United&para;<br>States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989). Under the previous&para;<br>regime, the United States Parole Commission, “as a gen&para;<br>eral rule, [could] conditionally release a prisoner any time&para;<br>after he serve[d] one-third of the judicially fixed term.”&para;<br>United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 47 (1978). If, for&para;<br>example, a judge imposed a prison term of 15 years, the&para;<br>Parole Commission might have released the prisoner after&para;<br>only 5 years. And it routinely did so. See United States&para;<br>Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A3, p. s., p.&para;<br>1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (“[D]efendants often serv[ed] only&para;<br>about one-third of the sentence handed down by the&para;<br>court”). The result was “confusion and implicit deception.”&para;<br>Ibid. With the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress sought to&para;<br>achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater&para;<br>honesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically determinate,”&para;<br>Mistretta, supra, at 367. See USSG §1A3, p. s., at 1.2&para;<br>(statutory objectives included “honesty in sentencing,”&para;<br>“uniformity,” and “proportionality” (emphasis deleted)).&para;<br>Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the&para;<br>sentence the offender actually served, with a sole statutory&para;<br>exception for good time credits. Mistretta, supra, at 367 (a&para;<br>“prisoner is to be released at the completion of his sen&para;<br>tence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior&para;<br>while in custody” (citing §3624(b)). The reason for this&para;<br>exception is provided in §3624(b) itself: to provide an&para;<br>incentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional&para;<br>disciplinary regulations.” The good time exception is&para;<br>limited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose—&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance&para;<br>with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby&para;<br>rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good&para;<br>behavior.&para;<br>The BOP’s approach furthers the objective of §3624. It&para;<br>ties the award of good time credits directly to good behav&para;<br>ior during the preceding year of imprisonment. By con&para;<br>trast, petitioners’ approach, insofar is it would award up to&para;<br>54 days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time&para;<br>served, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion&para;<br>of his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sen&para;<br>tence that he offsets with earned good time credit. In&para;<br>other words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award&para;<br>good time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in&para;<br>prison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that&para;<br>he will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our&para;<br>example. By doing so, it loosens the statute’s connection&para;<br>between good behavior and the award of good time and&para;<br>transforms the nature of the exception to the basic sen&para;<br>tence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule. And to that extent,&para;<br>it is inconsistent with the statute’s basic purpose.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We are not convinced by petitioners’ several arguments&para;<br>against the BOP’s methodology. First, petitioners point to&para;<br>the statement in §3624(b) that a prisoner “may receive&para;<br>credit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner’s term of&para;<br>imprisonment.” (Emphasis added.) The words “term of&para;<br>imprisonment,” they say, must refer to the years of the&para;<br>term that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our&para;<br>example), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the&para;<br>prisoner actually served once good time credits were taken&para;<br>into account. After all, the very first phrase of that provi&para;<br>sion makes eligible for good time credits “a prisoner who is&para;<br>serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the pris&para;<br>oner’s life.” Ibid. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The&para;<br>words “term of imprisonment” in this phrase almost cer&para;<br>tainly refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actu&para;<br>ally served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a&para;<br>day would become ineligible for credit as soon as they&para;<br>earned it). And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recog&para;<br>nized a “presumption that a given term is used to mean&para;<br>the same thing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner,&para;<br>513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).&para;<br>The problem for petitioners, however, is that this pre&para;<br>sumption is not absolute. It yields readily to indications&para;<br>that the same phrase used in different parts of the same&para;<br>statute means different things, particularly where the&para;<br>phrase is one that speakers can easily use in different&para;<br>ways without risk of confusion. Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers,&para;<br>Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932); General&para;<br>Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–&para;<br>596 (2004). See, e.g., id., at 596–597 (“age” has different&para;<br>meanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of&para;<br>1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,&para;<br>532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) (same for “ ‘wages paid’ ” in the&para;<br>Internal Revenue Code); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519&para;<br>U. S. 337, 343–344 (1997) (same for “employee” in Title&para;<br>VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).&para;<br>The phrase “term of imprisonment” is just such a&para;<br>phrase. It can refer to the sentence that the judge im&para;<br>poses, see, e.g., §3624(a) (“A prisoner shall be released” at&para;<br>the end of “the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, less any&para;<br>time credited” for good behavior), but it also can refer to&para;<br>the time that the prisoner actually serves. Thus, §3624(d)&para;<br>of the statute before us requires BOP to “furnish [a] pris&para;<br>oner with . . . suitable clothing[,] . . . money, . . . and . . .&para;<br>transportation” “[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the&para;<br>expiration of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” (Em&para;<br>phasis added.) The statute here means to assure that the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>prisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of&para;<br>his actual release from prison (sometime during Year 9 in&para;<br>our example), not at the end of the term that the judge&para;<br>imposed (which would be over a year later). Since the&para;<br>statute uses the same phrase “term of imprisonment” in&para;<br>two different ways, the presumption cannot help petition&para;<br>ers here. And, for the reasons we have given, see Part II,&para;<br>supra, context here indicates that the particular instance&para;<br>of the phrase “term of imprisonment” at issue refers to&para;<br>prison time actually served rather than the sentence&para;<br>imposed by the judge.&para;<br>Second, petitioners seek to draw support from the stat&para;<br>ute’s legislative history. But those who consider legisla&para;<br>tive history significant cannot find that history helpful to&para;<br>petitioners here. Petitioners point, for example, to a&para;<br>statement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sen&para;<br>tencing Reform Act, which says that the “method of calcu&para;<br>lation” of good time “will be considerably less complicated&para;<br>than under current law in many respects,” and that “credit&para;<br>toward early release is earned at a steady and easily&para;<br>determined rate that will have an obvious impact on the&para;<br>prisoner’s release date.” S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 146–147&para;<br>(1983); see Brief for Petitioners 31–32. But these state&para;<br>ments are consistent with the BOP’s interpretation of the&para;<br>statute. Its method, as we understand it, is not particu&para;<br>larly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than&para;<br>prior law, which provided for the accumulation of two&para;<br>different kinds of good time credit (general and industrial),&para;<br>calculated in different manners (prospectively and retro&para;<br>spectively), and awarded at different rates, depending on&para;<br>the length of sentence imposed on the prisoner (5 to 10&para;<br>days per month for general) or the year of employment (3&para;<br>or 5 days per month for industrial). See 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§4161, 4162 (1982 ed.).&para;<br>Petitioners also point to various statements contained in&para;<br>the Act’s Conference Report and made by individual legis&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lators that describe good time credit as providing sentence&para;<br>reductions of 15%. See Brief for Petitioners 34–36 (citing,&para;<br>e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–1159, p. 415 (1984); 131&para;<br>Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)). But&para;<br>there is nothing in the context of these statements to&para;<br>suggest that they amounted to anything other than rough&para;<br>approximations or that they were made with the present&para;<br>controversy in mind. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–&para;<br>1159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount&para;<br>of maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days “in&para;<br>creases ‘good time’ that accrues from 10 percent to 15&para;<br>percent”); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (statement of Rep.&para;<br>Hamilton) (“Under [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about&para;<br>80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of&para;<br>their time. Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for&para;<br>good behavior”). And whatever interpretive force one&para;<br>attaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives&para;<br>little weight to statements, such as those of the individual&para;<br>legislators, made after the bill in question has become law.&para;<br>See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995).&para;<br>Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United&para;<br>States Sentencing Commission’s Supplementary Report on&para;<br>the Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements&para;<br>issued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report). In&para;<br>that Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of&para;<br>recent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had&para;<br>used to help draft the Guidelines. The results of the&para;<br>analysis were presented in a table that permits compari&para;<br>son of the likely prison-time consequences of the new&para;<br>Guidelines with prison time actually served under preGuidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guide&para;<br>lines “offense level that is closest to the average time . . .&para;<br>served by first-time offenders” convicted of a particular&para;<br>crime, Supplementary Report 23). Because the Guidelines&para;<br>“refer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time” (i.e.,&para;<br>because a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months’ impris&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>onment does not necessarily mean that the offender will&para;<br>serve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission&para;<br>adjusted the average time served “by dividing by 0.85 good&para;<br>time when the term exceeded 12 months.” Ibid. This&para;<br>adjustment, the Commission explained, “made sentences&para;<br>in the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later&para;<br>editions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of “ap&para;<br>proximately fifteen percent for good behavior,” see, e.g.,&para;<br>USSG §1A3, p. s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain&para;<br>that the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the&para;<br>expectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive&para;<br>good time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not&para;<br>15% of the time actually served. They add that, in setting&para;<br>the Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exer&para;<br>cised congressionally delegated power to interpret the&para;<br>Sentencing Reform Act, see Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371–&para;<br>379 (approving Congress’ delegation of the power to prom&para;<br>ulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that&para;<br>interpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it. See&para;<br>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun&para;<br>cil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844 (1984).&para;<br>Again, however, we can find no indication that the&para;<br>Commission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in&para;<br>the Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the&para;<br>particular question here before us, that is whether good&para;<br>time credit is to be based on time served or the sentence&para;<br>imposed. The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authorita&para;<br>tive account of the Commission’s interpretive views than&para;<br>the Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that&para;<br>subject. Moreover, with respect to comparisons between&para;<br>Guidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the&para;<br>original 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did&para;<br>not “simply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as re&para;<br>vealed by the data,” but rather “departed from the data at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>different points for various important reasons.” USSG&para;<br>§1A3, p. s., at 1.4; see also id., §1A4(g), p. s., at 1.11&para;<br>(while “Guideline sentences in many instances will ap&para;<br>proximate existing [i.e., pre-Guidelines] practice,” the&para;<br>Commission did “not conside[r] itself bound by existing&para;<br>sentencing practice” (emphasis added)). Because the&para;<br>Commission has expressed no view on the question before&para;<br>us, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to&para;<br>deference had it done so. If it turns out that the calcula&para;<br>tion of good time credit based on prison time served rather&para;<br>than the sentence imposed produces results that are more&para;<br>severe than the Commission finds appropriate, the Com&para;<br>mission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accord&para;<br>ingly. See id., §1A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that “the&para;<br>guideline-writing process is evolutionary” and that the&para;<br>Commission functions “as a permanent agency to monitor&para;<br>sentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the&para;<br>nation”).&para;<br>Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity&para;<br>and construe §3624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a&para;<br>way that will maximize the amount of available good time&para;<br>credit. We may assume for present purposes that §3624(b)&para;<br>can be construed as imposing a criminal penalty. See&para;<br>Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (rule of&para;<br>lenity applies to “interpretations of . . . the penalties”&para;<br>imposed by “criminal prohibitions”); but see Sash v. Zenk,&para;<br>428 F. 3d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding&para;<br>that §3624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of&para;<br>the rule of lenity). Even so, the rule of lenity only applies&para;<br>if, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose,&para;<br>there remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the&para;<br>statute,” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139&para;<br>(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the&para;<br>Court must simply “ ‘guess as to what Congress intended.’ ”&para;<br>Bifulco, supra, at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States,&para;<br>358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). See United States v. Hayes,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); United States v.&para;<br>R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305–306 (1992) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Having so considered the statute, we do not believe that&para;<br>there remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty” in the&para;<br>statutory provision before us. Nor need we now simply&para;<br>“guess” what the statute means.&para;<br>Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to&para;<br>the BOP’s implementation of §3624(b). In our view, the&para;<br>BOP’s calculation system applies that statute as its lan&para;<br>guage is most naturally read, and in accordance with what&para;<br>that language makes clear is its basic purpose. No one&para;<br>doubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the&para;<br>statute in accordance with its language and purposes;&para;<br>hence we need not determine the extent to which Congress&para;<br>has granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute&para;<br>more broadly, or differently than it has done here. Cf.&para;<br>Chevron, supra, at 844–845.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Acknowledging that petitioners’ arguments cannot carry&para;<br>the day, the dissent has proposed a “third possibility,”&para;<br>post, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), not raised by either&para;<br>party nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Crimi&para;<br>nal Code. The dissent reads the statutory phrase “term of&para;<br>imprisonment” to refer to “the administrative period along&para;<br>which progress toward eventual freedom is marked.” Post,&para;<br>at 3. It derives from this reading the following method of&para;<br>calculation as applied to our 10-year example. First, “[t]he&para;<br>sentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.” Ibid. At&para;<br>the end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to&para;<br>54 days of credit for good behavior. These credits immedi&para;<br>ately “go toward completion of the next year” so that the&para;<br>prisoner need only serve “another 311 days behind bars&para;<br>before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an&para;<br>end.” Ibid. This process repeats itself until the “10th&para;<br>segment,” in which a prisoner receives an unspecified&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“credit in a prorated amount.” Ibid. In the end, the pris&para;<br>oner will have served 10 “administrative segments,” ibid.,&para;<br>collectively comprising 3,117 days in prison and 533 days&para;<br>of credit.&para;<br>The dissent claims “[r]eading ‘term of imprisonment’&para;<br>this way is consistent with all parts of the statute.” Post,&para;<br>at 4. We see at least four problems. First, the opening&para;<br>sentence of §3624(a) instructs that “[a] prisoner shall be&para;<br>released” upon “the expiration of the prisoner’s term of&para;<br>imprisonment, less any time credited” for good behavior.&para;<br>But if a prisoner’s “term of imprisonment” is the “period&para;<br>that a prisoner must complete in order to earn his free&para;<br>dom,” post, at 4, and it is “accounted for through a combi&para;<br>nation of prison time and credits,” post, at 3, then a pris&para;<br>oner should be released exactly at the end of his term of&para;<br>imprisonment (without any further adjustment). Because&para;<br>the dissent’s approach would require us to read words out&para;<br>of the statute, or give prisoners double credit, its definition&para;<br>cannot be used here.&para;<br>Second, §3624(b)(1) tells us that a prisoner receives&para;<br>credit “at the end of each year” based on behavior “during&para;<br>that year.” Under the dissent’s approach, however, a&para;<br>prisoner may receive credit at the end of each “administra&para;<br>tive segmen[t]” presumably based on his behavior during&para;<br>that segment. And because an “administrative segmen[t]”&para;<br>is made up of some “combination of service and credits,”&para;<br>post, at 4, each one lasts less than a calendar year. We do&para;<br>not see how a system in which “a prisoner may complete a&para;<br>particular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days,”&para;<br>ibid., and receive full good time credit for doing so, can&para;<br>possibly represent the most natural reading of this statu&para;<br>tory language. Nor do we know, because the BOP has not&para;<br>had an opportunity to tell us, whether a system in which a&para;<br>“year” lasts anywhere from 311 to 365 calendar days (and&para;<br>in which the “years” of a single prisoner’s sentence may all&para;<br>be of different lengths), is easily administrable. (We doubt&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners&para;<br>than one, like the BOP’s, that provides credit for actual&para;<br>years.)&para;<br>Third, under the dissent’s approach, credit is earned at&para;<br>different rates during a single sentence. For the first&para;<br>“administrative segmen[t]” in its 10-year example, the&para;<br>prisoner serves 365 days and earns 54 days of credit. The&para;<br>ratio of credit earned to days served is .148. For the sec&para;<br>ond “administrative segmen[t],” the prisoner serves 311&para;<br>days and earns 54 days of credit. This time, the ratio of&para;<br>credit earned to days served is .174. (For the last “admin&para;<br>istrative segmen[t],” the dissent tells us the prisoner will&para;<br>receive “credit in a prorated amount,” but it does not tell&para;<br>us which ratio should be used for the proration. Post, at&para;<br>3.) The use of different rates finds no support in the stat&para;<br>ute. The dissent objects that the statute “prescribes no&para;<br>particular rate,” post, at 7, but in fact it does—54 days of&para;<br>credit per year of good behavior—and it further requires&para;<br>that credit for the last year be “prorated” using the same&para;<br>proportion. Moreover, the dissent’s application of different&para;<br>rates leads to odd results. For example, a model prisoner&para;<br>sentenced on two separate 5-year terms (with a break in&para;<br>between) will serve a different number of days from one&para;<br>sentenced to a single 10-year term. How can this be if&para;<br>both prisoners are earning 54 days of credit for each of&para;<br>their 10 years in prison?&para;<br>Fourth, §3624(b)(2) provides that good time credit “shall&para;<br>vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.”&para;<br>(This provision does not apply to prisoners, like petition&para;<br>ers, who committed their offenses before it was amended&para;<br>in 1996, but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to&para;<br>apply more broadly. See post, at 9 (noting the effect on&para;<br>“almost 200,000 federal prisoners”).) Yet under the dis&para;<br>sent’s approach, credit appears to vest immediately. See&para;<br>post, at 3 (Days of credit for the first year “go toward&para;<br>completion of the next year” so that the prisoner “would&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>need another 311 days behind bars before the second year&para;<br>of his term of imprisonment is at an end”). And if it does&para;<br>not, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.&para;<br>What happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th “adminis&para;<br>trative segmen[t]” (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a&para;<br>prisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him&para;<br>by taking away all of his previously earned credit? Cf. 28&para;<br>CFR §541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited&para;<br>acts). Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of&para;<br>all of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the&para;<br>prisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th “ad&para;<br>ministrative segmen[t]”? (Again we do not know if the&para;<br>BOP would find such a system administrable, and we&para;<br>doubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a&para;<br>prisoner.) If so, does the prisoner have a second opportu&para;<br>nity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th “adminis&para;<br>trative segmen[t]” that he had previously completed but&para;<br>now must account for again? Cf. §3624(b)(1) (“Credit that&para;<br>has not been earned may not later be granted”). Or, hav&para;<br>ing previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that&para;<br>segment, are prison authorities left without any incentive&para;<br>to offer for good behavior?&para;<br>Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of&para;<br>lenity to support its interpretation. But, the best efforts of&para;<br>the dissent notwithstanding, we still see no “grievous&para;<br>ambiguity or uncertainty” that would trigger the rule’s&para;<br>application. We remain convinced that the BOP’s ap&para;<br>proach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory&para;<br>language and the most consistent with its purpose. What&para;<br>ever the merits of the dissent’s policy arguments, the&para;<br>statute does not require the BOP to accept them.&para;<br>For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP’s&para;<br>methodology is lawful. The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is&para;<br>Affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>APPENDIX&para;<br>A fuller example of the BOP’s method for calculat&para;<br>ing “credit for the last year or portion of a year of&para;<br>the term of imprisonment”&para;<br>The defendant is sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.&para;<br>As a prisoner he exhibits exemplary behavior and is&para;<br>awarded the maximum credit of 54 days at the end of each&para;<br>year served in prison. At the end of Year 8, the prisoner&para;<br>has 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumu&para;<br>lated 432 days of good time credit. Because the difference&para;<br>between the time remaining in his sentence and the&para;<br>amount of accumulated credit (i.e., 730 - 432) is less than a&para;<br>year (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in&para;<br>prison. (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the&para;<br>432 days of accumulated credit.) Further, Year 9 will be a&para;<br>partial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year&para;<br>being offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).&para;<br>Here is where the elementary algebra comes in. We&para;<br>know that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time&para;<br>served, must add up to 298. This gives us our first equa&para;<br>tion: x + y = 298.&para;<br>We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the&para;<br>portion of the final year to the amount of time served in&para;<br>that year must equal the ratio of a full year’s good time&para;<br>credit to the amount of time served in a full year. The&para;<br>latter ratio is 54/365 or .148. Thus, we know that&para;<br>x/y = .148, or to put it another way, x = .148y. Because we&para;<br>know the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitu&para;<br>tion in our first equation to get .148y + y = 298. We then&para;<br>add the two y terms together (1.148y = 298), and we solve&para;<br>for y, which gives us y = 260. Now we can plug that value&para;<br>into our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).&para;<br>If we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x = 38.&para;<br>The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in&para;<br>Year 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The prisoner’s total good time&para;<br>is 470 days (432 + 38 = 470). His total time served is 3180&para;<br>days.&para;<br>As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing&para;<br>as the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last&para;<br>year to more transparently track the relevant statutory&para;<br>language, we note that the mathematical formula can be&para;<br>used to calculate the amount of maximum available credit&para;<br>for an entire sentence. Using the equations supplied&para;<br>above, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence&para;<br>by 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a&para;<br>defendant must serve in that sentence. If we then sub&para;<br>tract the number of days served from the total number of&para;<br>days in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number&para;<br>of good time credit days the prisoner can earn.

THOMAS&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of&para;<br>more than 1 year[,] other than a term of imprisonment&para;<br>for the duration of the prisoner’s life, may receive&para;<br>credit toward the service of the prisoner’s sentence,&para;<br>beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of&para;<br>each year of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, be&para;<br>ginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject&para;<br>to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, dur&para;<br>ing that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary&para;<br>compliance with institutional disciplinary regula&para;<br>tions. . . . [C]redit for the last year or portion of a year&para;<br>of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and&para;<br>credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.” 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3624(b)(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>According to the Court, the phrase “term of imprisonment”&para;<br>must mean “time actually served” the third time that it&para;<br>appears in this particular subsection. But the Court gives&para;<br>the phrase a different interpretation the first two times it&para;<br>is used in the very same sentence. This in itself indicates&para;<br>that something is quite wrong here.&para;<br>Petitioners invite the Court to read “term of imprison&para;<br>ment” to mean “the sentence imposed.” This, too, seems&para;<br>unworkable. And it can be acknowledged that the Court’s&para;<br>rejection of this interpretation is correct.&para;<br>The choice, however, is not just between the Court’s&para;<br>reading and that offered by petitioners. There is a third&para;<br>possibility, one more consistent with the statute than&para;<br>either of these two alternatives.&para;<br>A fair reading of the statute, and a necessary reading to&para;<br>accomplish its purpose best, is to interpret the phrase&para;<br>“term of imprisonment” to refer to the span of time that a&para;<br>prisoner must account for in order to obtain release. The&para;<br>length of the term is set at the outset by the criminal&para;<br>sentence imposed. The prisoner earns release when that&para;<br>term has been fully completed. Most of the term will be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>satisfied through time spent behind bars. Assuming the&para;<br>prisoner is well behaved, however, he may earn good time&para;<br>credits along the way; and those credits may substitute for&para;<br>actual prison time. Each year of the term comprises a full&para;<br>365 days, which must be accounted for through a combina&para;<br>tion of prison time and credits. Thus conceived, a pris&para;<br>oner’s “term” is the administrative period along which&para;<br>progress toward eventual freedom is marked.&para;<br>Consider the Court’s example of a prisoner subject to a&para;<br>ten-year sentence. See ante, at 2–4. The sentence is&para;<br>divided into ten 365-day segments. Each segment consti&para;<br>tutes a year of the term. The prisoner will spend the first&para;<br>365 days behind bars. In the statute’s words, he has&para;<br>reached “the end of the first year of the term.” Now is the&para;<br>time for credit to be awarded, and he may receive up to 54&para;<br>days if sufficiently well behaved. Because he has already&para;<br>completed a full year of his term, those credits go toward&para;<br>completion of the next year. If, based on good behavior, he&para;<br>has earned the maximum of 54 days, he would need an&para;<br>other 311 days behind bars before the second year of his&para;<br>term of imprisonment is at an end (because 54 + 311 =&para;<br>365). If he has earned fewer than 54 days, a longer incar&para;<br>ceration will be required to reach 365. Regardless, once&para;<br>the prisoner reaches the end of the second year of his&para;<br>term, he will again be eligible to receive good time credits.&para;<br>This process repeats itself for the third year of the term,&para;<br>and so on. In the final year of his term (in this example,&para;<br>the tenth segment into which his term has been divided),&para;<br>the prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount, to be&para;<br>awarded “within the last six weeks of the sentence.” This&para;<br>ensures that the prisoner does not reach the end of year&para;<br>ten, only to find that he has just earned 54 days of credit&para;<br>he no longer needs.&para;<br>The controlling rule is that each year of the prisoner’s&para;<br>term—each of the ten administrative segments—&para;<br>comprises 365 days that must be completed through a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>combination of service and credits. By combining actual&para;<br>prison time with the credits he has earned, a prisoner may&para;<br>complete a particular year of his term in less than 365&para;<br>calendar days. As a result, credits may enable a well&para;<br>behaved prisoner to complete his ten-year sentence before&para;<br>ten calendar years have elapsed. For a ten-year (3,650&para;<br>day) sentence, a prisoner will serve 3,117 days behind bars&para;<br>if he earns a maximum of approximately 533 credits. This&para;<br>is 63 more days of credit than under the Court’s reading—&para;<br>more than 6 additional credit days for every year of the&para;<br>sentence imposed.&para;<br>Reading “term of imprisonment” this way is consistent&para;<br>with all parts of the statute. The prisoner receives his&para;<br>credit “at the end of each year of [his] term of imprison&para;<br>ment,” a process that “begin[s] at the end of the first year&para;<br>of the term.” Credit is only awarded if the prisoner has&para;<br>proven well behaved “during that year.” This interpreta&para;<br>tion fulfills the “objective of §3624”—rewarding a prisoner&para;<br>for exemplary conduct during the preceding year. See&para;<br>ante, at 8.&para;<br>This approach also has a textual integrity that the&para;<br>Court’s reading does not: It gives “term of imprisonment”&para;<br>the same meaning each time it is used by the statute.&para;<br>Every time it appears in §3624(b)(1), “term of imprison&para;<br>ment” refers to the administrative period that a prisoner&para;<br>must complete in order to earn his freedom. The Court, by&para;<br>contrast, would read this phrase to mean “time actually&para;<br>served” the third time it is used, but “the sentence im&para;<br>posed” the first two times it is used (“ ‘a prisoner who is&para;<br>serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year[,]&para;<br>other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the&para;<br>prisoner’s life’ ”). See ante, at 8–9. The Court’s interpreta&para;<br>tion thus runs afoul of the “ ‘presumption that a given&para;<br>term is used to mean the same thing throughout a stat&para;<br>ute.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.&para;<br>115, 118 (1994)). The inconsistency here is particularly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>egregious because all three uses appear in the same sen&para;<br>tence. See id., at 118 (“[The] presumption [is] surely at its&para;<br>most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given&para;<br>sentence”).&para;<br>The Court responds by noting another part of the stat&para;<br>ute, a provision stating that prisoners shall receive cloth&para;<br>ing, money, and transportation “[u]pon the release of [the]&para;<br>prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner’s term of impris&para;<br>onment.” §3624(d). A prisoner is released at the end of&para;<br>his actual time behind bars, says the Court, and so “term&para;<br>of imprisonment” must here refer to time actually served.&para;<br>Yet release also comes at the end of a prisoner’s “term” in&para;<br>the sense described above—that is, when the balance of&para;<br>the sentence has been reduced to zero through a combina&para;<br>tion of prison time and good time credits. Indeed, this&para;<br>administrative use of the phrase fits well with the word&para;<br>“expiration,” which in its most natural sense in this con&para;<br>text refers to the close of a formal accounting period. See&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 2004) (“A coming to&para;<br>an end; esp., a formal termination on a closing date”). By&para;<br>contrast, it is awkward at best to say, as the Court would&para;<br>have it, that a prisoner’s actual time behind bars is some&para;<br>thing that “expires.”&para;<br>The Court’s approach produces yet another oddity. The&para;<br>statute requires that prorated credit be awarded for “the&para;<br>last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.”&para;<br>One might naturally assume that the last year of a ten&para;<br>year term would be year ten. That is how things work&para;<br>under the approach described above, in which a ten-year&para;<br>sentence is subdivided into ten administrative segments.&para;<br>But under the Court’s reading, a prisoner serving a ten&para;<br>year sentence will never reach year ten of his term; year&para;<br>ten simply does not exist. According to the Court, year&para;<br>nine is the final year, and even year nine is not a full year:&para;<br>It lasts “no more than 298 days.” Ante, at 3. If this&para;<br>sounds confusing, it will be all the more so to the prisoner&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>who has just received his sentence and turns to the statute&para;<br>books to figure out when to expect his freedom.&para;<br>The Court does not even attempt to defend these flaws.&para;<br>Instead, it points to four supposed defects in the approach&para;<br>described above. None withstands examination.&para;<br>First, the Court notes that the statute requires the&para;<br>release of a prisoner “upon ‘the expiration of the prisoner’s&para;<br>term of imprisonment, less any time credited’ for good&para;<br>behavior.” Ante, at 15 (quoting §3624(a)). But if “term of&para;<br>imprisonment” truly refers to the entire span that a pris&para;<br>oner must complete to earn his freedom—a period that&para;<br>accounts both for actual time and for good time credits—&para;<br>then why would the “less any time credited” language be&para;<br>appropriate? The answer is that this provision—which&para;<br>appears at the very beginning of the section entitled “Re&para;<br>lease of a prisoner”—announces to a prisoner when release&para;<br>may be expected: when the prisoner’s term expires, taking&para;<br>into account credit days “as provided in subsection (b).”&para;<br>§3624(a) (bold face deleted). This use of language is com&para;<br>mon. A debtor who says “I will write a check for what I&para;<br>owe you, less what you owe me” is simply saying “I will&para;<br>pay what I owe, taking into account your debts to me.”&para;<br>Perhaps the same meaning could have been conveyed&para;<br>using different words, but this is hardly probative.&para;<br>Second, the Court alleges that the above approach con&para;<br>flicts with the statute’s requirement that credit be&para;<br>awarded “at the end of each year” based upon behavior&para;<br>“during that year.” After all, if a year of the term can be&para;<br>satisfied in part through credit, then it may last less than&para;<br>a full calendar year. Yet the statute does not require that&para;<br>credit be awarded at the end of a calendar year for good&para;<br>behavior during a calendar year. What it requires is that&para;<br>credit be awarded “at the end of each year of the prisoner’s&para;<br>term of imprisonment” for good behavior “during that&para;<br>year.” And this is precisely what the above approach does.&para;<br>Third, the Court frets that, under the approach above,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>prisoners will earn credit at different rates during a single&para;<br>sentence. It admonishes that “[t]he use of different rates&para;<br>finds no support in the statute.” Ante, at 16. This re&para;<br>sponse is telling. The statute, in fact, prescribes no par&para;<br>ticular rate—and certainly no formula based on a rate—&para;<br>except as embodied in one clear directive: Prisoners are&para;<br>eligible to earn “up to 54 days at the end of each year of&para;<br>the prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” As to that com&para;<br>mand, the above approach is perfectly faithful.&para;<br>Fourth, the Court suggests that the above approach&para;<br>causes credit to vest immediately, contrary to the statute.&para;<br>Again, this is not true. As per the statute, credit only&para;<br>vests “on the date the prisoner is released from custody,”&para;<br>§3624(b)(2), meaning that it can be revoked at any time&para;<br>before that date. This gives prisoners approaching their&para;<br>release date an extra incentive to behave.&para;<br>As a fallback, the Court wonders what would happen if&para;<br>a prisoner misbehaved on the final day of his ten-year&para;<br>sentence. Would the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) be forced to&para;<br>“retroactively adjust the duration of all of his [term years]&para;<br>to 365 days”? Ante, at 17. The answer is what one might&para;<br>suppose: A prisoner whose credits are revoked will find&para;<br>himself precisely where he would have been if those cred&para;<br>its had never been earned. All years of the term remain&para;<br>365 days, as they always have. But a misbehaving pris&para;<br>oner who had formerly earned, say, 500 credits will find&para;<br>himself without the benefit of those 500 days. That will&para;<br>leave him with more of his term to complete—500 days&para;<br>more, to be precise. If he behaves well again, he can re&para;<br>sume earning credit for the remainder of his term, but he&para;<br>has lost the opportunity to earn credits for any prior years.&para;<br>See §3624(b)(1). This is not at all confusing for a prisoner;&para;<br>and certainly it is as straightforward, if not more so, than&para;<br>the Court’s approach. The Court’s view causes a prisoner’s&para;<br>“term of imprisonment” to shrink over time according to&para;<br>an algebraic formula, only to expand again if he misbe&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>haves.&para;<br>Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the&para;<br>above approach difficult to administer. The Court identi&para;<br>fies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist. The infor&para;<br>mation used to calculate a prisoner’s term under the above&para;<br>approach is the same as it is under the Court’s approach.&para;<br>True, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit&para;<br>on different calendar days during the course of his term.&para;<br>But under the Court’s approach, this also happens when&para;<br>awarding credit in the final year. And, it goes without&para;<br>saying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on&para;<br>different calendar days anyway, so that under any ap&para;<br>proach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners through&para;<br>out the calendar year.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court’s reading of §3624(b)(1), therefore, is less&para;<br>consistent with the text than the reading explained above.&para;<br>But even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under&para;<br>any fair application the rule of lenity should tip the bal&para;<br>ance in petitioners’ favor. When a penal statute is suscep&para;<br>tible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the&para;<br>defendant must be chosen unless “text, structure, and&para;<br>history . . . establish that the [harsher] position is unam&para;<br>biguously correct.” United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.&para;<br>39, 54 (1994). Resolving ambiguity in favor of lenity en&para;<br>sures that statutes provide “fair warning[,] . . . in language&para;<br>that the common world will understand, of what the law&para;<br>intends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States v.&para;<br>Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The rule thus applies “not only to interpreta&para;<br>tions of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but&para;<br>also to the penalties they impose.” Bifulco v. United&para;<br>States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980).&para;<br>The Court assumes without deciding that §3624(b) is&para;<br>penal in nature. See ante, at 13. No assumption is neces&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sary: The statutory provision awarding good time credits&para;<br>“in fact is one determinant of [a] prison term,” so that a&para;<br>prisoner’s “effective sentence is altered once this determi&para;<br>nant is changed.” Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32&para;<br>(1981). In Weaver, the Court considered whether an&para;<br>amendment to Florida’s statutory formula for calculating&para;<br>good time credits implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.&para;<br>The Court concluded that it did, as the new statute “sub&para;<br>stantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime&para;<br>already completed, and therefore change[d] ‘the quantum&para;<br>of punishment.’ ” Id., at 33 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida,&para;<br>432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)). For the same reason, the penal&para;<br>effect of §3624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the&para;<br>rule of lenity. We should not disadvantage almost 200,000&para;<br>federal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them&para;<br>they would face that harsh result.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Government—although not the Court—argues that&para;<br>we should embrace its interpretation out of deference to&para;<br>BOP. BOP has been charged by the Attorney General&para;<br>with responsibility for “[a]pproving inmate disciplinary&para;<br>and good time regulations.” 28 CFR §0.96(s) (2009). BOP&para;<br>has long followed the same credit-calculation method now&para;<br>advocated by the Court. The Government argues that we&para;<br>should defer to BOP’s choice as a permissible exercise of&para;<br>its delegated responsibility.&para;<br>This argument fails on multiple levels. There is no&para;<br>indication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive&para;<br>authority that would merit deference under Chevron&para;<br>U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&para;<br>467 U. S. 837 (1984). The statute does not create a legis&para;<br>lative gap for BOP to fill. To the contrary, the procedures&para;<br>that govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in&para;<br>great detail. Cf. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241–242&para;<br>(2001) (where statute says that BOP “may” grant early&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BARBER v. THOMAS&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>release to certain prisoners, without specifying further&para;<br>criteria, Congress deliberately created a “statutory gap”).&para;<br>The statute even goes so far as to explain what to do “[i]f&para;<br>the date for a prisoner’s release falls on a Saturday, a&para;<br>Sunday, or a legal holiday.” §3624(a). This legislative&para;<br>specificity as to timing contrasts with other provisions&para;<br>that do delegate authority to BOP. E.g., §3624(b)(1)&para;<br>(awarding of credit is “subject to determination” by BOP&para;<br>that the prisoner “has displayed exemplary compliance&para;<br>with institutional disciplinary regulations”).&para;<br>BOP has not claimed that its view is the product of any&para;<br>“formal administrative procedure tending to foster the&para;<br>fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pro&para;<br>nouncement” with the force of law. United States v. Mead&para;<br>Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 230 (2001). In 2005, BOP made final&para;<br>an administrative rule adopting its preferred methodology.&para;<br>70 Fed. Reg. 66752 (adopting 28 CFR §523.20). But when&para;<br>pressed during an earlier stage of this litigation, BOP&para;<br>conceded that it had “failed to articulate in the adminis&para;<br>trative record the rationale upon which it relied when it&para;<br>promulgated” the rule. Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800,&para;<br>805 (CA9 2008). The Court of Appeals accepted BOP’s&para;<br>concession, ibid., and that aspect of its ruling has not been&para;<br>appealed.&para;<br>As a fallback position, the Government argues that&para;<br>BOP’s interpretation should receive at least some defer&para;<br>ence under Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).&para;<br>But under Skidmore, an agency decision only merits “re&para;<br>spect proportional to its ‘power to persuade.’ ” Mead,&para;<br>supra, at 235 (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140). BOP’s&para;<br>position is of long standing, but the administrative record&para;<br>is noteworthy for what it does not contain—namely, any&para;<br>reasoned justification for preferring BOP’s methodology&para;<br>over statutorily permissible alternatives. BOP has consis&para;<br>tently adhered to its mistaken belief that its approach is&para;<br>the only one that can be squared with the text. See 62&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Reg. 50786 (1997) (explanation to interim rule assert&para;<br>ing that the correct methodology “had been clearly stated&para;<br>by statute since the implementation of the Sentencing&para;<br>Reform Act of 1984”). For example, at no point did BOP&para;<br>consider, much less consciously reject, the interpretation&para;<br>outlined here. Cf. Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 60–61&para;<br>(1995) (deferring to BOP’s reasoned decision to reject one&para;<br>interpretation in favor of another). An agency need not&para;<br>consider all possible alternatives.

In place&para;<br>of that simple calculation, of clear meaning, of a calendar&para;<br>that can be marked, the Court insists on something differ&para;<br>ent.
