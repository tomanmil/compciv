HARRIS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA&para;<br>No. 11–817.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 31, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Officer Wheetley pulled over respondent Harris for a routine traffic&para;<br>stop. Observing Harris’s nervousness and an open beer can, Wheetley sought consent to search Harris’s truck. When Harris refused,&para;<br>Wheetley executed a sniff test with his trained narcotics dog, Aldo.&para;<br>The dog alerted at the driver’s-side door handle, leading Wheetley to&para;<br>conclude that he had probable cause for a search. That search turned&para;<br>up nothing Aldo was trained to detect, but did reveal pseudoephedrine and other ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine.&para;<br>Harris was arrested and charged with illegal possession of those ingredients. In a subsequent stop while Harris was out on bail, Aldo&para;<br>again alerted on Harris’s truck but nothing of interest was found. At&para;<br>a suppression hearing, Wheetley testified about his and Aldo’s extensive training in drug detection. Harris’s attorney did not contest the&para;<br>quality of that training, focusing instead on Aldo’s certification and&para;<br>performance in the field, particularly in the two stops of Harris’s&para;<br>truck. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, but the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court reversed. It held that a wide array of evidence was&para;<br>always necessary to establish probable cause, including fieldperformance records showing how many times the dog has falsely&para;<br>alerted. If an officer like Wheetley failed to keep such records, he&para;<br>could never have probable cause to think the dog a reliable indicator&para;<br>of drugs.&para;<br>Held: Because training and testing records supported Aldo’s reliability&para;<br>in detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that evidence,&para;<br>Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris’s truck. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(a) In testing whether an officer has probable cause to conduct a&para;<br>search, all that is required is the kind of “fair probability” on which&para;<br>“reasonable and prudent [people] act.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.&para;<br>213, 235. To evaluate whether the State has met this practical and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. HARRIS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>common-sensical standard, this Court has consistently looked to the&para;<br>totality of the circumstances and rejected rigid rules, bright-line&para;<br>tests, and mechanistic inquiries. Ibid.&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established approach by&para;<br>creating a strict evidentiary checklist to assess a drug-detection dog’s&para;<br>reliability. Requiring the State to introduce comprehensive documentation of the dog’s prior hits and misses in the field, and holding&para;<br>that absent field records will preclude a finding of probable cause no&para;<br>matter how much other proof the State offers, is the antithesis of a&para;<br>totality-of-the-circumstances approach. This is made worse by the&para;<br>State Supreme Court’s treatment of field-performance records as the&para;<br>evidentiary gold standard when, in fact, such data may not capture a&para;<br>dog’s false negatives or may markedly overstate a dog’s false positives. Such inaccuracies do not taint records of a dog’s performance&para;<br>in standard training and certification settings, making that performance a better measure of a dog’s reliability. Field records may&para;<br>sometimes be relevant, but the court should evaluate all the evidence, and should not prescribe an inflexible set of requirements.&para;<br>Under the correct approach, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a&para;<br>dog’s alert should proceed much like any other, with the court allowing the parties to make their best case and evaluating the totality of&para;<br>the circumstances. If the State has produced proof from controlled&para;<br>settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, the court should find probable cause. But a defendant must have an opportunity to challenge&para;<br>such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by cross-examining the&para;<br>testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.&para;<br>The defendant may contest training or testing standards as flawed or&para;<br>too lax, or raise an issue regarding the particular alert. The court&para;<br>should then consider all the evidence and apply the usual test for&para;<br>probable cause—whether all the facts surrounding the alert, viewed&para;<br>through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent&para;<br>person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a&para;<br>crime. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(b) The record in this case amply supported the trial court’s determination that Aldo’s alert gave Wheetley probable cause to search&para;<br>the truck. The State introduced substantial evidence of Aldo’s training and his proficiency in finding drugs. Harris declined to challenge&para;<br>any aspect of that training or testing in the trial court, and the Court&para;<br>does not consider such arguments when they are presented for this&para;<br>first time in this Court. Harris principally relied below on Wheetley’s&para;<br>failure to find any substance that Aldo was trained to detect. That&para;<br>infers too much from the failure of a particular alert to lead to drugs,&para;<br>and did not rebut the State’s evidence from recent training and test-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

The Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court held that the State must in every case&para;<br>present an exhaustive set of records, including a log of the&para;<br>dog’s performance in the field, to establish the dog’s reliability. See 71 So. 3d 756, 775 (2011). We think that demand inconsistent with the “flexible, common-sense&para;<br>standard” of probable cause. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.&para;<br>213, 239 (1983).&para;<br>I&para;<br>William Wheetley is a K–9 Officer in the Liberty County,&para;<br>Florida Sheriff ’s Office. On June 24, 2006, he was on a&para;<br>routine patrol with Aldo, a German shepherd trained to&para;<br>detect certain narcotics (methamphetamine, marijuana,&para;<br>cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy). Wheetley pulled over respondent Clayton Harris’s truck because it had an expired&para;<br>license plate. On approaching the driver’s-side door,&para;<br>Wheetley saw that Harris was “visibly nervous,” unable to&para;<br>sit still, shaking, and breathing rapidly. Wheetley also&para;<br>noticed an open can of beer in the truck’s cup holder. App.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>62. Wheetley asked Harris for consent to search the truck,&para;<br>but Harris refused. At that point, Wheetley retrieved Aldo&para;<br>from the patrol car and walked him around Harris’s truck&para;<br>for a “free air sniff.” Id., at 63. Aldo alerted at the&para;<br>driver’s-side door handle—signaling, through a distinctive&para;<br>set of behaviors, that he smelled drugs there.&para;<br>Wheetley concluded, based principally on Aldo’s alert,&para;<br>that he had probable cause to search the truck. His search&para;<br>did not turn up any of the drugs Aldo was trained to detect. But it did reveal 200 loose pseudoephedrine pills,&para;<br>8,000 matches, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, two containers of antifreeze, and a coffee filter full of iodine crystals—&para;<br>all ingredients for making methamphetamine. Wheetley&para;<br>accordingly arrested Harris, who admitted after proper&para;<br>Miranda warnings that he routinely “cooked” methamphetamine at his house and could not go “more than a few&para;<br>days without using” it. Id., at 68. The State charged&para;<br>Harris with possessing pseudoephedrine for use in manufacturing methamphetamine.&para;<br>While out on bail, Harris had another run-in with&para;<br>Wheetley and Aldo. This time, Wheetley pulled Harris&para;<br>over for a broken brake light. Aldo again sniffed the&para;<br>truck’s exterior, and again alerted at the driver’s-side door&para;<br>handle. Wheetley once more searched the truck, but on&para;<br>this occasion discovered nothing of interest.&para;<br>Harris moved to suppress the evidence found in his&para;<br>truck on the ground that Aldo’s alert had not given Wheetley probable cause for a search. At the hearing on that&para;<br>motion, Wheetley testified about both his and Aldo’s training in drug detection. See id., at 52–82. In 2004, Wheetley (and a different dog) completed a 160-hour course in&para;<br>narcotics detection offered by the Dothan, Alabama Police&para;<br>Department, while Aldo (and a different handler) completed&para;<br>a similar, 120-hour course given by the Apopka, Florida&para;<br>Police Department. That same year, Aldo received a oneyear certification from Drug Beat, a private company that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>specializes in testing and certifying K–9 dogs. Wheetley&para;<br>and Aldo teamed up in 2005 and went through another,&para;<br>40-hour refresher course in Dothan together. They also&para;<br>did four hours of training exercises each week to maintain&para;<br>their skills. Wheetley would hide drugs in certain vehicles or buildings while leaving others “blank” to determine whether Aldo alerted at the right places. Id., at 57.&para;<br>According to Wheetley, Aldo’s performance in those exercises was “really good.” Id., at 60. The State introduced&para;<br>“Monthly Canine Detection Training Logs” consistent with&para;<br>that testimony: They showed that Aldo always found&para;<br>hidden drugs and that he performed “satisfactorily” (the&para;<br>higher of two possible assessments) on each day of training. Id., at 109–116.&para;<br>On cross-examination, Harris’s attorney chose not to&para;<br>contest the quality of Aldo’s or Wheetley’s training. She&para;<br>focused instead on Aldo’s certification and his performance&para;<br>in the field, particularly the two stops of Harris’s truck.&para;<br>Wheetley conceded that the certification (which, he noted,&para;<br>Florida law did not require) had expired the year before&para;<br>he pulled Harris over. See id., at 70–71. Wheetley also&para;<br>acknowledged that he did not keep complete records of&para;<br>Aldo’s performance in traffic stops or other field work;&para;<br>instead, he maintained records only of alerts resulting in&para;<br>arrests. See id., at 71–72, 74. But Wheetley defended&para;<br>Aldo’s two alerts to Harris’s seemingly narcotics-free&para;<br>truck: According to Wheetley, Harris probably transferred&para;<br>the odor of methamphetamine to the door handle, and&para;<br>Aldo responded to that “residual odor.” Id., at 80.&para;<br>The trial court concluded that Wheetley had probable&para;<br>cause to search Harris’s truck and so denied the motion to&para;<br>suppress. Harris then entered a no-contest plea while&para;<br>reserving the right to appeal the trial court’s ruling. An&para;<br>intermediate state court summarily affirmed. See 989&para;<br>So. 2d 1214, 1215 (2008) (per curiam).&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Wheetley lacked probable cause to search Harris’s vehicle&para;<br>under the Fourth Amendment. “[W]hen a dog alerts,” the&para;<br>court wrote, “the fact that the dog has been trained and&para;<br>certified is simply not enough to establish probable cause.”&para;<br>71 So. 3d, at 767. To demonstrate a dog’s reliability, the&para;<br>State needed to produce a wider array of evidence:&para;<br>“[T]he State must present . . . the dog’s training and&para;<br>certification records, an explanation of the meaning of&para;<br>the particular training and certification, field performance records (including any unverified alerts), and&para;<br>evidence concerning the experience and training of the&para;<br>officer handling the dog, as well as any other objective&para;<br>evidence known to the officer about the dog’s reliability.” Id., at 775.&para;<br>The court particularly stressed the need for “evidence of&para;<br>the dog’s performance history,” including records showing&para;<br>“how often the dog has alerted in the field without illegal&para;<br>contraband having been found.” Id., at 769. That data,&para;<br>the court stated, could help to expose such problems as a&para;<br>handler’s tendency (conscious or not) to “cue [a] dog to&para;<br>alert” and “a dog’s inability to distinguish between residual odors and actual drugs.” Id., at 769, 774. Accordingly,&para;<br>an officer like Wheetley who did not keep full records of&para;<br>his dog’s field performance could never have the requisite&para;<br>cause to think “that the dog is a reliable indicator of&para;<br>drugs.” Id., at 773.&para;<br>Judge Canady dissented, maintaining that the majority’s “elaborate and inflexible evidentiary requirements”&para;<br>went beyond the demands of probable cause. Id., at 775.&para;<br>He would have affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the&para;<br>strength of Aldo’s training history and Harris’s “fail[ure]&para;<br>to present any evidence challenging” it.

Texas v. Brown, 460&para;<br>U. S. 730, 742 (1983) (plurality opinion) (quoting Carroll v.&para;<br>United States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)); see Safford&para;<br>Unified School Dist. #1 v.

S., at 235. All we have required&para;<br>is the kind of “fair probability” on which “reasonable and&para;<br>prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.” Id., at 238,&para;<br>231 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>In evaluating whether the State has met this practical&para;<br>and common-sensical standard, we have consistently&para;<br>looked to the totality of the circumstances. See, e.g., Pringle, 540 U. S., at 371; Gates, 462 U. S., at 232; Brinegar v.&para;<br>United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949). We have rejected&para;<br>rigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries in&para;<br>favor of a more flexible, all-things-considered approach. In&para;<br>Gates, for example, we abandoned our old test for assessing the reliability of informants’ tips because it had&para;<br>devolved into a “complex superstructure of evidentiary&para;<br>and analytical rules,” any one of which, if not complied&para;<br>with, would derail a finding of probable cause. 462 U. S.,&para;<br>at 235. We lamented the development of a list of “inflexible, independent requirements applicable in every case.”&para;<br>Id., at 230, n. 6. Probable cause, we emphasized, is “a&para;<br>fluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities&para;<br>in particular factual contexts—not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.” Id., at 232.&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>approach to determining probable cause. To assess the&para;<br>reliability of a drug-detection dog, the court created a&para;<br>strict evidentiary checklist, whose every item the State&para;<br>must tick off.1 Most prominently, an alert cannot establish probable cause under the Florida court’s decision&para;<br>unless the State introduces comprehensive documentation&para;<br>of the dog’s prior “hits” and “misses” in the field. (One&para;<br>wonders how the court would apply its test to a rookie&para;<br>dog.) No matter how much other proof the State offers of&para;<br>the dog’s reliability, the absent field performance records&para;<br>will preclude a finding of probable cause. That is the&para;<br>antithesis of a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. It&para;<br>is, indeed, the very thing we criticized in Gates when we&para;<br>overhauled our method for assessing the trustworthiness&para;<br>of an informant’s tip. A gap as to any one matter, we&para;<br>explained, should not sink the State’s case; rather, that&para;<br>“deficiency . . . may be compensated for, in determining&para;<br>the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to . . .&para;<br>other indicia of reliability.” Id., at 233. So too here, a&para;<br>finding of a drug-detection dog’s reliability cannot depend&para;<br>on the State’s satisfaction of multiple, independent evidentiary requirements. No more for dogs than for human&para;<br>informants is such an inflexible checklist the way to prove&para;<br>reliability, and thus establish probable cause.&para;<br>Making matters worse, the decision below treats records&para;<br>of a dog’s field performance as the gold standard in evi——————&para;<br>1 By&para;<br>&para;<br>the time of oral argument in this case, even Harris declined to&para;<br>defend the idea that the Fourth Amendment compels the State to&para;<br>produce each item of evidence the Florida Supreme Court enumerated.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30 (“I don’t believe the Constitution requires&para;<br>[that list]”). Harris instead argued that the court’s decision, although&para;<br>“look[ing] rather didactic,” in fact did not impose any such requirement.&para;<br>Id., at 29; see id., at 31 (“[I]t’s not a specific recipe that can’t be deviated from”). But in reading the decision below as establishing a mandatory checklist, we do no more than take the court at its (oft-repeated)&para;<br>word. See, e.g., 71 So. 3d 756, 758, 759, 771, 775 (Fla. 2011) (holding&para;<br>that the State “must” present the itemized evidence).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Errors may abound in such records. If a dog&para;<br>on patrol fails to alert to a car containing drugs, the mistake usually will go undetected because the officer will not&para;<br>initiate a search. Field data thus may not capture a dog’s&para;<br>false negatives. Conversely (and more relevant here), if&para;<br>the dog alerts to a car in which the officer finds no narcotics, the dog may not have made a mistake at all. The dog&para;<br>may have detected substances that were too well hidden or&para;<br>present in quantities too small for the officer to locate. Or&para;<br>the dog may have smelled the residual odor of drugs previously in the vehicle or on the driver’s person.2 Field data&para;<br>thus may markedly overstate a dog’s real false positives.&para;<br>By contrast, those inaccuracies—in either direction—do&para;<br>not taint records of a dog’s performance in standard training and certification settings.

Therefore, when a detector dog responds and no drug&para;<br>or explosive is found, do not assume the dog has made an error”);&para;<br>S. Bryson, Police Dog Tactics 257 (2d ed. 2000) (“Four skiers toke up in&para;<br>the parking lot before going up the mountain. Five minutes later a&para;<br>narcotic detector dog alerts to the car.

The Florida Supreme Court&para;<br>treated a dog’s response to residual odor as an error, referring to the&para;<br>“inability to distinguish between [such] odors and actual drugs” as a&para;<br>“facto[r] that call[s] into question Aldo’s reliability.” 71 So. 3d, at 773–&para;<br>774; see supra, at 4. But that statement reflects a misunderstanding.&para;<br>A detection dog recognizes an odor, not a drug, and should alert whenever the scent is present, even if the substance is gone (just as a police&para;<br>officer’s much inferior nose detects the odor of marijuana for some time&para;<br>after a joint has been smoked). In the usual case, the mere chance that&para;<br>the substance might no longer be at the location does not matter; a&para;<br>well-trained dog’s alert establishes a fair probability—all that is required for probable cause—that either drugs or evidence of a drug&para;<br>crime (like the precursor chemicals in Harris’s truck) will be found.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>should not. The better measure of a dog’s reliability&para;<br>thus comes away from the field, in controlled testing&para;<br>environments.3&para;<br>For that reason, evidence of a dog’s satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can itself&para;<br>provide sufficient reason to trust his alert. If a bona fide&para;<br>organization has certified a dog after testing his reliability&para;<br>in a controlled setting, a court can presume (subject to any&para;<br>conflicting evidence offered) that the dog’s alert provides&para;<br>probable cause to search. The same is true, even in the&para;<br>absence of formal certification, if the dog has recently and&para;<br>successfully completed a training program that evaluated&para;<br>his proficiency in locating drugs. After all, law enforcement units have their own strong incentive to use effective&para;<br>training and certification programs, because only accurate&para;<br>drug-detection dogs enable officers to locate contraband&para;<br>without incurring unnecessary risks or wasting limited&para;<br>time and resources.&para;<br>A defendant, however, must have an opportunity to&para;<br>challenge such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by&para;<br>cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his&para;<br>own fact or expert witnesses. The defendant, for example,&para;<br>may contest the adequacy of a certification or training&para;<br>program, perhaps asserting that its standards are too lax&para;<br>or its methods faulty. So too, the defendant may examine&para;<br>how the dog (or handler) performed in the assessments&para;<br>made in those settings. Indeed, evidence of the dog’s (or&para;<br>handler’s) history in the field, although susceptible to the&para;<br>kind of misinterpretation we have discussed, may sometimes be relevant, as the Solicitor General acknowledged&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See K.

And&para;<br>even assuming a dog is generally reliable, circumstances&para;<br>surrounding a particular alert may undermine the case&para;<br>for probable cause—if, say, the officer cued the dog (consciously or not), or if the team was working under unfamiliar conditions.&para;<br>In short, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog’s&para;<br>alert should proceed much like any other. The court&para;<br>should allow the parties to make their best case, consistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure.

HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>evidence of Aldo’s training and his proficiency in finding&para;<br>drugs. See supra, at 2–3. The State showed that two&para;<br>years before alerting to Harris’s truck, Aldo had successfully completed a 120-hour program in narcotics detection,&para;<br>and separately obtained a certification from an independent company. And although the certification expired after&para;<br>a year, the Sheriff ’s Office required continuing training&para;<br>for Aldo and Wheetley. The two satisfied the requirements of another, 40-hour training program one year prior&para;<br>to the search at issue. And Wheetley worked with Aldo&para;<br>for four hours each week on exercises designed to keep&para;<br>their skills sharp. Wheetley testified, and written records&para;<br>confirmed, that in those settings Aldo always performed at&para;<br>the highest level.&para;<br>Harris, as also noted above, declined to challenge in the&para;<br>trial court any aspect of Aldo’s training. See supra, at 3.&para;<br>To be sure, Harris’s briefs in this Court raise questions&para;<br>about that training’s adequacy—for example, whether the&para;<br>programs simulated sufficiently diverse environments and&para;<br>whether they used enough blind testing (in which the&para;<br>handler does not know the location of drugs and so cannot&para;<br>cue the dog). See Brief for Respondent 57–58. Similarly,&para;<br>Harris here queries just how well Aldo performed in controlled testing. See id., at 58. But Harris never voiced&para;<br>those doubts in the trial court, and cannot do so for the&para;<br>first time here. See, e.g., Rugendorf v. United States, 376&para;<br>U. S. 528, 534 (1964). As the case came to the trial court,&para;<br>Aldo had successfully completed two recent drug-detection&para;<br>courses and maintained his proficiency through weekly&para;<br>training exercises. Viewed alone, that training record—&para;<br>with or without the prior certification—sufficed to establish Aldo’s reliability. See supra, at 8–9.&para;<br>And Harris’s cross-examination of Wheetley, which&para;<br>focused on Aldo’s field performance, failed to rebut the&para;<br>State’s case. Harris principally contended in the trial&para;<br>court that because Wheetley did not find any of the sub-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stances Aldo was trained to detect, Aldo’s two alerts must&para;<br>have been false. See Brief for Respondent 1; App. 77–80.&para;<br>But we have already described the hazards of inferring too&para;<br>much from the failure of a dog’s alert to lead to drugs, see&para;<br>supra, at 7; and here we doubt that Harris’s logic does&para;<br>justice to Aldo’s skills. Harris cooked and used methamphetamine on a regular basis; so as Wheetley later surmised, Aldo likely responded to odors that Harris had&para;<br>transferred to the driver’s-side door handle of his truck.&para;<br>See supra, at 3. A well-trained drug-detection dog should&para;<br>alert to such odors; his response to them might appear&para;<br>a mistake, but in fact is not. See n. 2, supra. And still&para;<br>more fundamentally, we do not evaluate probable cause in&para;<br>hindsight, based on what a search does or does not turn&para;<br>up. See United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948).&para;<br>For the reasons already stated, Wheetley had good cause&para;<br>to view Aldo as a reliable detector of drugs. And no special&para;<br>circumstance here gave Wheetley reason to discount Aldo’s&para;<br>usual dependability or distrust his response to Harris’s&para;<br>truck.&para;<br>Because training records established Aldo’s reliability in&para;<br>detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that showing, we agree with the trial court that Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris’s truck. We accordingly&para;<br>reverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
