Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 245. Thus,&para;<br>this Court has endorsed a “fraud-on-the-market” theory, which permits securities-fraud plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of&para;<br>reliance on public, material misrepresentations regarding securities&para;<br>traded in an efficient market. Id., at 241–249. The fraud-on-themarket theory facilitates the certification of securities-fraud class actions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.&para;<br>Invoking the fraud-on-the-market theory, respondent Connecticut&para;<br>Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut Retirement) sought&para;<br>certification of a securities-fraud class action under Federal Rule of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) against biotechnology company Amgen Inc.&para;<br>and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen). The District Court&para;<br>certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>rejected Amgen’s argument that Connecticut Retirement was required to prove the materiality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3)’s requirement that “questions of law or fact common to class&para;<br>members predominate over any questions affecting only individual&para;<br>members.” The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did&para;<br>not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had pre-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>sented on the issue of materiality at the class-certification stage.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Proof of materiality is not a prerequisite to certification of a securities-fraud class action seeking money damages for alleged violations&para;<br>of §10(b) and Rule 10b–5. Pp. 9–26.&para;<br>(a) The pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality&para;<br>is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the&para;<br>class will “predominate over any questions affecting only individual&para;<br>members” as the litigation progresses. For two reasons, the answer&para;<br>to this question is “no.” First, because materiality is judged according to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence common to the class. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S.&para;<br>438, 445. Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.&para;<br>Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality&para;<br>would not result in individual questions predominating. Instead, it&para;<br>would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a securities-fraud claim. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(b) Amgen’s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 14–&para;<br>24.&para;<br>(1) Amgen points to the Court’s statement in Erica P. John&para;<br>Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___, that “securities&para;<br>fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basic’s&para;<br>rebuttable presumption of reliance,” including “that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known . . . , that the stock traded in an&para;<br>efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place ‘between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the&para;<br>truth was revealed.’ ” If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must&para;<br>be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materiality—&para;<br>another fraud-on-the-market predicate—should be treated no differently. The Court disagrees. The requirement that a putative class&para;<br>representative establish that it executed trades “between the time&para;<br>the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed” relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into&para;<br>typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)&para;<br>predominance inquiry. And unlike materiality, market efficiency and&para;<br>the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispensable elements of a Rule 10–5 claim. While the failure of common,&para;<br>classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof&para;<br>on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.&para;<br>Pp. 15–18.&para;<br>(2) Amgen also contends that “policy considerations” militate in&para;<br>favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality. Because class&para;<br>certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle&para;<br>rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at&para;<br>the class-certification stage. In this regard, however, materiality&para;<br>does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim,&para;<br>notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which&para;<br>the plaintiff ’s claims are based were false or misleading and that the&para;<br>alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer economic loss. Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected&para;<br>calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory. And contrary to&para;<br>Amgen’s argument that requiring proof of materiality before class&para;<br>certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgen’s position&para;<br>would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materiality at the class-certification stage. Pp. 18–22.&para;<br>(c) Also unavailing is Amgen’s claim that the District Court erred&para;<br>by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence Amgen proffered in opposing Connecticut Retirement’s class-certification motion. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen’s&para;<br>rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and&para;<br>omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement’s complaint were immaterial. The potential immateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common&para;<br>questions predominate. Just as a plaintiff class’s inability to prove&para;<br>materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predominate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988), and recognized most recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011). The fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>premise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient&para;<br>market will reflect all publicly available information about&para;<br>a company; accordingly, a buyer of the security may be&para;<br>presumed to have relied on that information in purchasing&para;<br>the security.&para;<br>Amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for&para;<br>the securities at issue and has not contested the public&para;<br>character of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which&para;<br>Connecticut Retirement’s complaint is based. Nor does&para;<br>Amgen here dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>all of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23(a):&para;<br>(1) the alleged class “is so numerous that joinder of all&para;<br>members is impracticable”; (2) “there are questions of law&para;<br>or fact common to the class”; (3) Connecticut Retirement’s&para;<br>claims are “typical of the claims . . . of the class”; and (4)&para;<br>Connecticut Retirement will “fairly and adequately protect&para;<br>the interests of the class.”&para;<br>The issue presented concerns the requirement stated in&para;<br>Rule 23(b)(3) that “the questions of law or fact common to&para;<br>class members predominate over any questions affecting&para;<br>only individual members.” Amgen contends that to meet&para;<br>the predominance requirement, Connecticut Retirement&para;<br>must do more than plausibly plead that Amgen’s alleged&para;<br>misrepresentations and misleading omissions materially&para;<br>affected Amgen’s stock price. According to Amgen, certifi­&para;<br>cation must be denied unless Connecticut Retirement&para;<br>proves materiality, for immaterial misrepresentations or&para;<br>omissions, by definition, would have no impact on Amgen’s&para;<br>stock price in an efficient market.&para;<br>While Connecticut Retirement certainly must prove&para;<br>materiality to prevail on the merits, we hold that such&para;<br>proof is not a prerequisite to class certification. Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions common to the&para;<br>class predominate, not that those questions will be an­&para;<br>swered, on the merits, in favor of the class. Because mate­&para;<br>riality is judged according to an objective standard, the&para;<br>materiality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and&para;<br>omissions is a question common to all members of the&para;<br>class Connecticut Retirement would represent. The al­&para;<br>leged misrepresentations and omissions, whether material&para;<br>or immaterial, would be so equally for all investors com­&para;<br>posing the class. As vital, the plaintiff class’s inability to&para;<br>prove materiality would not result in individual questions&para;<br>predominating. Instead, a failure of proof on the issue&para;<br>of materiality would end the case, given that materiality&para;<br>is an essential element of the class members’ securities­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fraud claims. As to materiality, therefore, the class is&para;<br>entirely cohesive: It will prevail or fail in unison. In no&para;<br>event will the individual circumstances of particular class&para;<br>members bear on the inquiry.&para;<br>Essentially, Amgen, also the dissenters from today’s&para;<br>decision, would have us put the cart before the horse. To&para;<br>gain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Amgen and the&para;<br>dissenters urge, Connecticut Retirement must first estab­&para;<br>lish that it will win the fray. But the office of a Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case;&para;<br>rather, it is to select the “metho[d]” best suited to adjudi­&para;<br>cation of the controversy “fairly and efficiently.”&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>This case involves the interaction between federal&para;<br>securities-fraud laws and Rule 23’s requirements for&para;<br>class certification. To obtain certification of a class action for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff&para;<br>must satisfy Rule 23(a)’s above-mentioned prerequisites&para;<br>of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of&para;<br>representation, see supra, at 1–2, and must also establish&para;<br>that “the questions of law or fact common to class mem­&para;<br>bers predominate over any questions affecting only indi­&para;<br>vidual members, and that a class action is superior to&para;<br>other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudi­&para;<br>cating the controversy.” To recover damages in a private&para;<br>securities-fraud action under §10(b) of the Securities&para;<br>Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15&para;<br>U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). “The traditional (and most&para;<br>direct) way” for a plaintiff to demonstrate reliance “is by&para;<br>showing that he was aware of a company’s statement and&para;<br>engaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on that specific&para;<br>misrepresentation.” Ibid. We have recognized, however,&para;<br>that requiring proof of direct reliance “would place an&para;<br>unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on [a] plain­&para;<br>tiff who has traded on an impersonal market.” Basic, 485&para;<br>U.

Accordingly, in Basic the Court endorsed the&para;<br>“fraud-on-the-market” theory, which permits certain Rule&para;<br>10b–5 plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of&para;<br>reliance on material misrepresentations aired to the gen­&para;<br>eral public. Id., at 241–249.1&para;<br>The fraud-on-the-market theory rests on the premise&para;<br>that certain well developed markets are efficient proces­&para;<br>sors of public information. In such markets, the “market&para;<br>price of shares” will “reflec[t] all publicly available infor­&para;<br>mation.” Id., at 246.

See R.&para;<br>Brealey, S. Myers, &amp; F. Allen, Principles of Corporate&para;<br>Finance 330 (10th ed. 2011) (“[I]n an efficient market,&para;<br>there is no way for most investors to achieve consistently&para;<br>superior rates of return.”).&para;<br>In Basic, we held that if a market is shown to be effi­&para;<br>cient, courts may presume that investors who traded&para;<br>securities in that market relied on public, material mis­&para;<br>representations regarding those securities. See 485 U. S.,&para;<br>at 245–247. This presumption springs from the very&para;<br>concept of market efficiency. If a market is generally&para;<br>efficient in incorporating publicly available information&para;<br>into a security’s market price, it is reasonable to presume&para;<br>that a particular public, material misrepresentation will&para;<br>be reflected in the security’s price. Furthermore, it is&para;<br>reasonable to presume that most investors—knowing that&para;<br>they have little hope of outperforming the market in the&para;<br>long run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa­&para;<br>ble information—will rely on the security’s market price as&para;<br>an unbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of&para;<br>all public information. Thus, courts may presume that&para;<br>investors trading in efficient markets indirectly rely on&para;<br>public, material misrepresentations through their “reli­&para;<br>ance on the integrity of the price set by the market.” Id.,&para;<br>at 245. “[T]he presumption,” however, is “just that, and&para;<br>[can] be rebutted by appropriate evidence.” Halliburton,&para;<br>563 U.

S.,&para;<br>at 248–249 (providing examples of showings that would&para;<br>rebut the fraud-on-the-market presumption).&para;<br>Although fraud on the market is a substantive doctrine&para;<br>of federal securities-fraud law that can be invoked by any&para;<br>Rule 10b–5 plaintiff, see, e.g., Black v. Finantra Capital,&para;<br>Inc., 418 F. 3d 203, 209 (CA2 2005); Blackie v.

See Basic, 485 U. S., at&para;<br>242. The fraud-on-the-market theory, however, facilitates&para;<br>class certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption&para;<br>of classwide reliance on public, material misrepresenta­&para;<br>tions when shares are traded in an efficient market.

Proc. 23(f), the Court of Appeals affirmed. See&para;<br>660 F. 3d 1170 (CA9 2011).&para;<br>Amgen raised two arguments on appeal. First, Amgen&para;<br>contended that the District Court erred by certifying the&para;<br>proposed class without first requiring Connecticut Retire­&para;<br>ment to prove that Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations&para;<br>and omissions were material. Second, Amgen argued that&para;<br>the District Court erred by refusing to consider certain&para;<br>rebuttal evidence that Amgen had proffered in opposition&para;<br>to Connecticut Retirement’s class-certification motion.&para;<br>This evidence, in Amgen’s view, demonstrated that the&para;<br>market was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged&para;<br>misrepresentations and omissions at the time the class&para;<br>members purchased their shares.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals rejected both contentions.&para;<br>Amgen’s first argument, the Court of Appeals noted, made&para;<br>the uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresenta­&para;<br>tions and omissions “by definition [do] not affect . . . stock&para;<br>price[s] in an efficient market.” Id., at 1175. Thus,&para;<br>where misrepresentations and omissions are not material,&para;<br>there is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on&para;<br>those misrepresentations and omissions through the&para;<br>information-processing mechanism of the market price.&para;<br>“The problem with that argument,” the Court of Appeals ob­&para;<br>served, is evident: “[B]ecause materiality is an element of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the merits of their securities fraud claim, the plaintiffs&para;<br>cannot both fail to prove materiality yet still have a viable&para;<br>claim for which they would need to prove reliance individ­&para;<br>ually.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that&para;<br>“proof of materiality is not necessary” to ensure compli­&para;<br>ance with Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that common ques­&para;<br>tions predominate. Id., at 1177.&para;<br>With respect to Amgen’s second argument, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals determined that Amgen’s proffered rebuttal&para;<br>evidence was merely “a method of refuting [the] materiality” of the misrepresentations and omissions alleged&para;<br>in Connecticut Retirement’s complaint. Ibid. Having already concluded that a securities-fraud plaintiff does not&para;<br>need to prove materiality before class certification, the&para;<br>court similarly held that “the district court correctly re­&para;<br>fused to consider” Amgen’s rebuttal evidence “at the class&para;<br>certification stage.” Ibid.&para;<br>We granted Amgen’s petition for certiorari, 567 U.

See id., at ___, n. 6 (slip op., at 10, n. 6) (a&para;<br>district court has no “ ‘authority to conduct a preliminary&para;<br>inquiry into the merits of a suit’ ” at class certification&para;<br>unless it is necessary “to determine the propriety of certi­&para;<br>fication” (quoting Eisen v.

See Basic, 485 U. S., at&para;<br>247 (“[W]here materially misleading statements have been&para;<br>disseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the&para;<br>integrity of the market price may be presumed.” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). That theory, Amgen correctly observes, is prem­&para;<br>ised on the understanding that in an efficient market,&para;<br>all publicly available information is rapidly incorporated&para;<br>into, and thus transmitted to investors through, the mar­&para;<br>ket price. See id., at 246–247. Because immaterial information, by definition, does not affect market price,&para;<br>it cannot be relied upon indirectly by investors who, as&para;<br>the fraud-on-the-market theory presumes, rely on the mar­&para;<br>ket price’s integrity. Therefore, the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>theory cannot apply absent a material misrepresentation&para;<br>or omission. And without the fraud-on-the-market theory,&para;<br>the element of reliance cannot be proved on a classwide&para;<br>basis through evidence common to the class. See id., at&para;<br>242. It thus follows, Amgen contends, that materiality&para;<br>must be proved before a securities-fraud class action can&para;<br>be certified.&para;<br>Contrary to Amgen’s argument, the key question in this&para;<br>case is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of&para;<br>the fraud-on-the-market theory; indisputably it is.4 In­&para;<br>stead, the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is&para;<br>needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common&para;<br>to the class will “predominate over any questions affecting&para;<br>only individual members” as the litigation progresses.&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). For two reasons, the answer&para;<br>to this question is clearly “no.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 We agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that “[m]ateriality was central to&para;<br>the development, analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>theory both before Basic and in Basic itself.” Post, at 18. We disagree,&para;<br>however, that the history of the fraud-on-the-market theory’s develop­&para;<br>ment “confirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the&para;<br>theory is invoked—i.e., at certification.” Ibid. As explained below, see&para;<br>infra this page and 11–13, proof of materiality is not required prior to&para;<br>class certification because such proof is not necessary to ensure satis­&para;<br>faction of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>First, because “[t]he question of materiality . . . is an&para;<br>objective one, involving the significance of an omitted or&para;<br>misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,” materiality&para;<br>can be proved through evidence common to the class. TSC&para;<br>Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 445&para;<br>(1976). Consequently, materiality is a “common ques­&para;<br>tio[n]” for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Basic, 485 U. S., at&para;<br>242 (listing “materiality” as one of the questions common&para;<br>to the Basic class members).&para;<br>Second, there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof&para;<br>on the common question of materiality will result in indi­&para;<br>vidual questions predominating. Because materiality is&para;<br>an essential element of a Rule 10b–5 claim, see Matrixx&para;<br>Initiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Connecticut&para;<br>Retirement’s failure to present sufficient evidence of mate­&para;<br>riality to defeat a summary-judgment motion or to prevail&para;<br>at trial would not cause individual reliance questions to&para;<br>overwhelm the questions common to the class. Instead,&para;<br>the failure of proof on the element of materiality would&para;<br>end the case for one and for all; no claim would re­&para;<br>main in which individual reliance issues could potentially&para;<br>predominate.&para;<br>Totally misapprehending our essential point, JUSTICE&para;<br>THOMAS’ dissent asserts that our “entire argument is&para;<br>based on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>presumption need not be shown at certification because it&para;<br>will be proved later on the merits.” Post, at 11, n. 9. Our&para;<br>position is not so based. We rest, instead, entirely on the&para;<br>text of Rule 23(b)(3), which provides for class certification&para;<br>if “the questions of law or fact common to class members&para;<br>predominate over any questions affecting only individual&para;<br>members.” A failure of proof on the common question of&para;<br>materiality ends the litigation and thus will never cause&para;<br>individual questions of reliance or anything else to over­&para;<br>whelm questions common to the class. Therefore, under&para;<br>the plain language of Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs are not&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>required to prove materiality at the class-certification&para;<br>stage. In other words, they need not, at that threshold,&para;<br>prove that the predominating question will be answered in&para;<br>their favor.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS urges that a plaintiff seeking class&para;<br>certification “must show that the elements of [her] claim&para;<br>are susceptible to classwide proof.” Post, at 7. See also&para;<br>post, at 11 (criticizing the Court for failing to focus its&para;<br>analysis on “whether the element of reliance is susceptible&para;<br>to classwide proof ”). From this premise, JUSTICE THOMAS&para;<br>concludes that Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs must prove materiality before class certification because (1) “materiality is a&para;<br>necessary component of fraud on the market,” and (2)&para;<br>without fraud on the market, the Rule 10b–5 element of&para;<br>reliance is not “susceptible of a classwide answer.” Post,&para;<br>at 6, 10–11. See also post, at 12 (“[I]f a plaintiff wishes to&para;<br>use Basic’s presumption to prove that reliance is a com­&para;<br>mon question, he must establish the entire presumption,&para;<br>including materiality, at the class certification stage.”).&para;<br>Rule 23(b)(3), however, does not require a plaintiff&para;<br>seeking class certification to prove that each “elemen[t] of&para;<br>[her] claim [is] susceptible to classwide proof.” Post, at 7.&para;<br>What the rule does require is that common questions&para;<br>“predominate over any questions affecting only individual&para;<br>[class] members.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3) (emphasis&para;<br>added). Nowhere does JUSTICE THOMAS explain how, in&para;<br>an action invoking the Basic presumption, a plaintiff&para;<br>class’s failure to prove an essential element of its claim for&para;<br>relief will result in individual questions predominating&para;<br>over common ones. Absent proof of materiality, the claim&para;<br>of the Rule 10b–5 class will fail in its entirety; there will&para;<br>be no remaining individual questions to adjudicate.&para;<br>Consequently, proof of materiality is not required to&para;<br>establish that a proposed class is “sufficiently cohesive&para;<br>to warrant adjudication by representation”—the focus of&para;<br>the predominance inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3).

No&para;<br>doubt a clever mind could conjure up fantastic scenarios in&para;<br>which an individual investor might rely on immaterial&para;<br>information (think of the superstitious investor who sells&para;<br>her securities based on a CEO’s statement that a black cat&para;<br>crossed the CEO’s path that morning). But such objectively&para;<br>unreasonable reliance does not give rise to a Rule 10b–5&para;<br>claim. See TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 445 (materiality&para;<br>is judged by an objective standard). Thus, “the individual­&para;<br>ized questions of reliance,” post, at 9, n. 8, that hypotheti­&para;<br>cally might arise when a failure of proof on the issue of&para;<br>materiality dooms the fraud-on-the-market class are far&para;<br>more imaginative than real. Such “individualized ques­&para;<br>tions” do not undermine class cohesion and thus cannot be&para;<br>said to “predominate” for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).5&para;<br>Because the question of materiality is common to the&para;<br>class, and because a failure of proof on that issue would&para;<br>not result in questions “affecting only individual members”&para;<br>predominating, Fed.

L. Rev. 151, 167).&para;<br>Instead, this research suggests, differences in efficiency can exist&para;<br>within a single market. For example, a market may more readily&para;<br>process certain forms of widely disseminated and easily digestible&para;<br>information, such as public merger announcements, than information&para;<br>more difficult to acquire and understand, such as obscure technical&para;<br>data buried in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&para;<br>See, e.g., Macey &amp; Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of&para;<br>the Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 Stan.

Amgen,&para;<br>however, never clearly explains how this research on market efficiency&para;<br>bolsters its argument that courts should require precertification proof&para;<br>of materiality. In any event, this case is a poor vehicle for exploring&para;<br>whatever implications the research Amgen cites may have for the&para;<br>fraud-on-the-market presumption recognized in Basic. As noted above,&para;<br>see supra, at 6–7, Amgen conceded in its answer that the market for its&para;<br>securities is “efficient” and thus “promptly digest[s] current information&para;<br>regarding Amgen from all publicly available sources and reflect[s] such&para;<br>information in Amgen’s stock price.” Consolidated Amended Class&para;<br>Action Complaint ¶¶199–200; Answer ¶¶199–200.

System v. Southworth,&para;<br>529 U. S. 217, 226 (2000))). We thus find nothing in the cited research&para;<br>that would support requiring precertification proof of materiality in this&para;<br>case.&para;<br>7 As earlier noted, see supra, at 1–2, Amgen does not here contest&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>security’s market price cannot be affected by a misrepre­&para;<br>sentation not yet made, and in an efficient market, a&para;<br>misrepresentation’s impact on market price is quickly&para;<br>nullified once the truth comes to light.

The litigation,&para;<br>therefore, could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) as a&para;<br>class action, but the initiating plaintiff ’s claim would&para;<br>remain live; it would not be “dead on arrival.” 660 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1175.&para;<br>A failure of proof on the issue of materiality, in contrast,&para;<br>not only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on­&para;<br>the-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also&para;<br>establishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot&para;<br>prevail on the merits of her Rule 10b–5 claim. Materiality&para;<br>thus differs from the market-efficiency and publicity pred­&para;<br>icates in this critical respect: While the failure of common,&para;<br>classwide proof on the issues of market efficiency and&para;<br>publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof&para;<br>of reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of&para;<br>materiality ends the case for the class and for all indi­&para;<br>viduals alleged to compose the class.

Absent&para;<br>a requirement to evaluate materiality at the class­&para;<br>certification stage, Amgen contends, the issue may never&para;<br>be addressed by a court, for the defendant will surrender&para;<br>and settle soon after a class is certified.

No. 104–369, pp. 31–32 (1995).&para;<br>The PSLRA’s response to the perceived abuses was, inter&para;<br>alia, to “impos[e] heightened pleading requirements” for&para;<br>securities-fraud actions, “limit recoverable damages and&para;<br>attorney’s fees, provide a ‘safe harbor’ for forward-looking&para;<br>statements, impose new restrictions on the selection of&para;<br>(and compensation awarded to) lead plaintiffs, mandate&para;<br>imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation, and author­&para;<br>ize a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to&para;<br>dismiss.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN INC. v.

Congress later fortified&para;<br>the PSLRA by enacting the Securities Litigation Uniform&para;<br>Standards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227, which curtailed&para;<br>plaintiffs’ ability to evade the PSLRA’s limitations on&para;<br>federal securities-fraud litigation by bringing class-action&para;<br>suits under state rather than federal law. See 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§78bb(f)(1) (2006 ed.).&para;<br>While taking these steps to curb abusive securities­&para;<br>fraud lawsuits, Congress rejected calls to undo the fraud­&para;<br>on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance endorsed&para;<br>in Basic.

Nor did Congress decree that securities-fraud&para;<br>plaintiffs prove each element of their claim before obtain­&para;<br>ing class certification. Because Congress has homed in on&para;<br>the precise policy concerns raised in Amgen’s brief, “[w]e&para;<br>do not think it appropriate for the judiciary to make its&para;<br>own further adjustments by reinterpreting Rule 23 to&para;<br>make likely success on the merits essential to class certifi­&para;<br>cation in securities-fraud suits.” Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at&para;<br>686; cf.

See&para;<br>also Reply Brief 17 (Amgen’s evidence was offered to rebut&para;<br>the “materiality predicate” of the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>theory). As explained above, however, the potential im­&para;<br>materiality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and&para;<br>omissions is no barrier to finding that common questions&para;<br>predominate. See Part II, supra.

Therefore, just as a plaintiff class’s&para;<br>inability to prove materiality creates no risk that individ­&para;<br>ual questions will predominate, so even a definitive rebut­&para;<br>tal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the&para;<br>predominance of questions common to the class.&para;<br>We recognized as much in Basic itself.

This rule is to be found nowhere in the United&para;<br>States Code or in the common law of fraud or deception; it&para;<br>was invented by the Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485&para;<br>U. S. 224 (1988). Today’s Court applies to that rule the&para;<br>principles of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and&para;<br>thereby concludes (logically enough) that commonality is&para;<br>established at the certification stage even when materiality has not been shown. That would be a correct procedure&para;<br>if Basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the&para;<br>question of substantive liability—what must be shown in&para;<br>order to prevail. If that were so, the new substantive rule,&para;<br>like the more general substantive rule that reliance must&para;<br>be proved, would be subject, at the certification stage, to&para;<br>the commonality analysis of Rule 23(b)(3). In my view,&para;<br>however, the Basic rule of fraud-on-the-market—a well&para;<br>functioning market plus purchase or sale in the market&para;<br>plus material misrepresentation known to the market&para;<br>establishes a necessary showing of reliance—governs not&para;<br>only the question of substantive liability, but also the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>question whether certification is proper. All of the elements of that rule, including materiality, must be established if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.&para;<br>The answer to the question before us today is to be found&para;<br>not in Rule 23(b)(3), but in the opinion of Basic.&para;<br>Basic established a presumption that the misrepresentation was relied upon, not a mere presumption that the&para;<br>plaintiffs relied on the market price. And it established&para;<br>that presumption not just for the question of substantive&para;<br>liability but also for the question of certification. “We&para;<br>granted certiorari . . . to determine whether the courts&para;<br>below properly applied a presumption of reliance in certifying the class, rather than requiring each class member to&para;<br>show direct reliance on Basic’s statements.” 485 U. S., at&para;<br>230 (emphasis added). Of course it makes no sense to&para;<br>“presume reliance” on the misrepresentation merely because the plaintiff relied on the market price, unless the&para;<br>alleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the&para;<br>market price—that is, unless it was material. Thus, as&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent shows, the Basic opinion is shot&para;<br>through with references to the necessary materiality. The&para;<br>presumption of reliance does not apply, and hence neither&para;<br>substantive liability will attach nor will certification be&para;<br>proper, unless materiality is shown. The necessity of&para;<br>materiality for certification is demonstrated by the last&para;<br>sentence of the Basic opinion, which comes after the Court&para;<br>has decided to remand the case for reconsideration of&para;<br>materiality under the appropriate legal standard: “The&para;<br>District Court’s certification of the class here was appropriate when made but is subject on remand to such adjustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand.”&para;<br>Id., at 250. Those circumstances are the establishment of&para;<br>facts that rebut the presumption, including of facts that&para;<br>show the misrepresentation was not material, or was not&para;<br>known to the market.&para;<br>The Court argues that if materiality were a predicate to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>certification on a fraud-on-the-market theory, the Basic&para;<br>Court would not have approved the class certification&para;<br>order while remanding for reconsideration of “whether&para;<br>the plaintiffs had mustered sufficient evidence to satisfy&para;<br>the relatively lenient standard for avoiding summary judgment.” See ante, at 23–24. The Court manufactures an&para;<br>inconsistency on the basis of doctrine that did not govern&para;<br>class certification at the time of Basic. We recently clarified that “Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading&para;<br>standard.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). But review of the Basic certification order shows that the District Court’s fraud-on-themarket analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings:&para;<br>“[T]he allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to&para;<br>bring this section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) claim within the&para;<br>so-called ‘fraud on the market’ theory.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86–279,&para;<br>p. 115a (emphasis added); see also ibid. (citing complaint&para;<br>paragraphs as establishing fraud on the market). Under a&para;<br>pleadings standard, the District Court found that the&para;<br>plaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) with regard to fraud&para;<br>on the market, including its materiality predicate. See id.,&para;<br>at 133a (denial of reconsideration) (“This court ruled on&para;<br>December 10 that transaction causation [i.e., reliance]&para;<br>could be established by the following: proof of a material&para;<br>misrepresentation which affected the market price of the&para;<br>stocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). Thus, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded&para;<br>materiality that the certification order “was appropriate&para;<br>when made,” Basic, supra, at 250, the defendants retained&para;<br>an opportunity on remand to rebut the pleading in order to&para;<br>defeat certification.*&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* As for the Court’s contention that I have “[s]cour[ed] the Court’s&para;<br>decision in Basic” to find “some semblance of support” for my reading of&para;<br>the case, ante, at 23, n. 9: It does not take much scouring to come across&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN, INC. v.

Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d 741, 750&para;<br>(CA6 1986). The Basic Court cited the formulation approvingly, 485&para;<br>U. S., at 248, n. 27, and recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v.

Unless the timing of the misrepresentation and&para;<br>truth is established at certification, there is no framework within which&para;<br>to determine whether fraud on the market renders reliance a common&para;<br>question. Thus, insofar as the majority recognizes that timing is a&para;<br>factor of the fraud-on-the-market theory, ante, at 16, n. 8, I agree. It&para;<br>would be incorrect to suggest that timing solely relates to Rules 23(a)(3)&para;<br>and (4). It is equally important to establish the timing range at certification for Rule 23(b)(3) reliance purposes.

Notably, the Court and the Ninth Circuit both&para;<br>acknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the&para;<br>presumption, plaintiffs must establish two of the fraud-onthe-market predicates at class certification: (1) that the&para;<br>market was generally efficient, and (2) that the alleged&para;<br>misstatement was public. See ante, at 16 (acknowledging&para;<br>“that market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged&para;<br>misrepresentations must be proved before a securitiesfraud class action can be certified”); 660 F. 3d 1170, 1175&para;<br>(CA9 2011) (same).

The Court is correct insofar as its statements&para;<br>recognize that fraud on the market is a condition precedent to showing that there are common questions of reliance at the time of class certification.&para;<br>Nevertheless, the Court asserts that materiality—by its&para;<br>own admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud&para;<br>on the market—need not be established at certification&para;<br>because it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

In the Court’s second scenario, fraud&para;<br>on the market was never established, reliance for each&para;<br>class member was inherently individualized, and Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3) in fact should have barred certification long ago.8&para;<br>The Court suggests that the problem created by the second&para;<br>scenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose anyway on alternative merits grounds, and the case will be&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The majority ignores this explanation of the fundamental flaw in&para;<br>its position, asserting that I never “explain how . . . a plaintiff class’s&para;<br>failure to prove an essential element of its claim for relief will result in&para;<br>individual questions predominating over common ones.” Ante, at 12.&para;<br>But a plaintiff, who is excused from his burden of showing, at certification that reliance is a common question, fails to demonstrate that&para;<br>common questions predominate over the individualized questions of reliance that are inherent in a securities fraud claim. A plaintiff must&para;<br>carry this burden at certification for certification to be proper. The&para;<br>majority does not respond to the inherent timing problem in its position. It does not explain how ignoring questions of reliance—that&para;<br>undeniably will be individualized in some cases—at certification is&para;<br>justified by the fact that those questions will be resolved months or&para;<br>years later on the merits in a way that indicates reliance was indeed an&para;<br>individualized question all along. Far from obeying the dictates of Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3) as it claims, ante, at 12–13, the majority unjustifiably puts off a&para;<br>critical part of the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry until the merits. The only way&para;<br>the majority can purport to follow Rule 23(b)(3) is by ignoring the fact&para;<br>that, under its own analysis, reliance may be an individualized question that predominates over common questions at certification.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN, INC. v.

But nothing in logic or precedent&para;<br>justifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is susceptible to Rule 23(b)(3) classwide proof simply because&para;<br>one predicate of reliance—materiality—will be resolved, if&para;<br>at all, much later in the litigation on an independent&para;<br>merits element.&para;<br>It is the Court, not Amgen, that “would have us put the&para;<br>cart before the horse,” ante, at 3, by jumping chronologically to the §10(b) merits element of materiality. But Rule&para;<br>23, as well as common sense, requires class certification&para;<br>issues to be addressed first. See Rule 23(c)(1)(A) (“At an&para;<br>early practicable time after a person sues or is sued . . .&para;<br>the court must determine by order whether to certify the&para;<br>action as a class action”).

Without materiality, there is no fraudon-the-market presumption, questions of reliance remain&para;<br>individualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) certification is impossible. And the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both&para;<br>fraud on the market at certification and an independent&para;<br>merits element is no issue; Wal-Mart expressly held that a&para;<br>court at certification may inquire into questions that also&para;<br>have later relevance on the merits. See 564 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 10–11). The Court reverses that inquiry,&para;<br>effectively saying that certification may be put off until&para;<br>later because an adverse merits determination will retroactively wipe out the entire class.

Ante, at 10 (“[T]he pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to&para;<br>ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the&para;<br>class will ‘predominate’ ”). The result is that the Court&para;<br>effectively equates §10(b) materiality with fraud-on-themarket materiality and elides reliance as a §10(b) element.

But the fact that Congress has enacted legislation to curb excesses in securities litigation while leaving Basic intact,&para;<br>see ante, at 19–20, says nothing about the proper interpretation of&para;<br>Basic at issue here.

The&para;<br>Court’s entire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-onthe-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it&para;<br>will be proved later on the merits; insofar as certification makes that&para;<br>later determination unlikely to occur, it at least counsels against the&para;<br>certitude with which the Court assures us that its gloss on Basic is&para;<br>correct.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMGEN, INC. v.

Basic is a judicially invented doctrine&para;<br>based on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden&para;<br>on plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of&para;<br>action.

Its shortcomings are further highlighted by&para;<br>the role that materiality played in the pre-Basic development of the fraud-on-the-market theory as a condition&para;<br>precedent to showing that there are common questions of&para;<br>reliance in the class-action context. Materiality, at the&para;<br>time of certification, has been a driving force behind&para;<br>the theory from the outset. This fact further supports the&para;<br>need to prove materiality at the time the fraud-on-themarket theory is invoked to show that questions of reliance can be answered on a classwide basis.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Before Basic, two signposts marked the way for courts&para;<br>applying the fraud-on-the-market theory. Both demonstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not&para;<br>a mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons&para;<br>for allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed&para;<br>aside at certification. This fact weighs strongly in favor of&para;<br>the conclusion that materiality must be resolved at certification when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is&para;<br>invoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide&para;<br>basis.&para;<br>The first signpost was the Ninth Circuit’s 1975 opinion&para;<br>in Blackie, termed by one pre-Basic court the “seminal&para;<br>fraud on the market case.” Peil, 806 F. 2d, at 1163, n. 16.&para;<br>See also Basic, supra, at 251, n. 1 (White, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(“The earliest Court of Appeals case adopting this theory&para;<br>cited by the Court is Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891&para;<br>(CA9 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.

CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS&para;<br>AND TRUST FUNDS&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not only refused to certify the 1972 annual report but also&para;<br>withdrew certification of all 1971 financial statements&para;<br>“because of doubts that the loss reported for 1972 was in&para;<br>fact suffered in that year.” Ibid. In resultant class actions, the defendants argued that reliance stood in the&para;<br>way of class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because it&para;<br>was not a common question.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Instead, it relieved plaintiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance, explaining that “causation is adequately established in the&para;<br>impersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and&para;<br>of the materiality of misrepresentations, without direct proof&para;<br>of reliance.” Id., at 906 (emphasis added). The court left&para;<br>no doubt that the materiality of the $90 million shortfall&para;<br>in Ampex’s financial statements was central to its determination that reliance could be presumed. It asserted&para;<br>that “[m]ateriality circumstantially establishes the reliance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the&para;<br>stock price—when the purchase is made[,] the causational&para;<br>chain between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff ’s loss is&para;<br>sufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.”&para;<br>Ibid. Materiality was not merely an important factor that&para;<br>allowed reliance to be presumed at certification; materiality was the factor. It demonstrated that the defendants&para;<br>had committed a fraud on the market, that all putative&para;<br>class plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock, and,&para;<br>therefore, that questions of reliance would be susceptible&para;<br>to common answers.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>A. &amp; P.

The Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic&para;<br>termed the Note “[t]he clearest statement of the theory of&para;<br>presumption of reliance.” Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d&para;<br>741, 750 (1986). Indeed, in the briefing for Basic itself,&para;<br>the plaintiffs, the United States, and plaintiffs’ amicus cited&para;<br>the article repeatedly as an authoritative statement on the&para;<br>subject. See Brief for Respondent 43, n. 18, 46, n. 20 (cited&para;<br>in Peil, supra, at 1160), Brief for Securities and Exchange&para;<br>Commission as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 25, 24, n. 30, 26, n.&para;<br>32, and Brief for Joseph Harris et al. as Amicus Curiae 4,&para;<br>n. 2, in Basic Inc. v.

Note 1161 (“In developed markets, which&para;<br>are apparently efficient, reliance should be presumed from&para;<br>the materiality of the deception” (emphasis added)). Ultimately, in language that will be familiar to anyone who&para;<br>has read Basic, the Note formulated a “pivotal assumption” underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory as the&para;<br>belief that:&para;<br>“market prices respond to information disseminated&para;<br>(or not disseminated) concerning the companies whose&para;<br>securities are traded.

L. Rev. Note&para;<br>1154 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>Again, the materiality of the alleged misstatement was&para;<br>a key component, without which the market could not be&para;<br>presumed to move. As a result, without materiality it is&para;<br>impossible to say that there has been a fraud on the market at all, and if that is not the case there is no reason to&para;<br>believe that the market price at which stock transactions&para;<br>occurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or, by&para;<br>extension, that any market participants relied on it.&para;<br>Materiality should thus be proved when the fraud-on-themarket presumption is invoked, or there is no commonality with respect to questions of reliance.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Nor did the importance of materiality diminish in the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic. Rather, the court&para;<br>followed the path marked by the signposts discussed&para;<br>above. It excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evidence of reliance, so long as “a defendant is shown to have&para;<br>made a material public misrepresentation that, if relied&para;<br>on directly, would fraudulently induce an individual to misjudge the value of the stock.” Levinson, 786 F. 2d, at 750&para;<br>(emphasis added). The court’s analysis made clear that&para;<br>materiality should be demonstrated at the time the presumption was invoked: “In order to invoke the presumption of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory,&para;<br>a plaintiff must allege and prove . . . that the misrepresentations were material . . . .” Ibid. (citing Blackie,&para;<br>524 F. 2d, at 906).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Finally, the briefing before this Court in Basic itself&para;<br>built upon this framework and the foundational principle&para;<br>that materiality is an integral part of the theory.

They “contrast[ed] the likely market&para;<br>impact of disclosure of the [$90 million Blackie loss] . . .&para;<br>with the disclosure of the information which respondents&para;<br>contend[ed] rendered Basic’s statements materially misleading.” See Brief for Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86–&para;<br>279, p. 42. The Basic defendants concluded that “the&para;<br>differences between a company’s $90 million loss and a&para;<br>company’s sporadic contacts with a friendly suitor are substantial. . . . [T]he fraud on the market theory, if it has&para;<br>vitality, should not be applied in a case such as this.” Id.,&para;<br>at 43.&para;<br>In response, the plaintiffs in Basic did not argue that&para;<br>the defendants misunderstood the role of materiality in&para;<br>the fraud-on-the-market theory. They instead advanced a&para;<br>now-foreclosed interpretation of dicta from Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974):&para;<br>“Petitioners’ final argument—that respondents will be&para;<br>unable to establish that Basic’s repeated false and&para;<br>misleading statements impacted the price of Basic&para;<br>stock over a fourteen month period—represents an effort to litigate the merits of this case on the motion for&para;<br>class certification. . . . As this Court held in Eisen v.&para;<br>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 417 U.

The Basic defendants’ reply is consistent with Wal-Mart:&para;<br>“Putative class representatives, such as respondents,&para;<br>should not be permitted to invoke the fraud on the&para;<br>market theory while, at the same time, arguing that&para;<br>courts may not make any preliminary inquiry into the&para;<br>claimed impact on the market. See, e.g., Resp. Br.,&para;<br>p. 54. By seeking the benefit of the presumption, respondents necessarily invite judicial scrutiny of the&para;<br>circumstances in which it is invoked.” Reply Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86–279, p. 18.&para;<br>Well said. The history of Basic is worth the volume of&para;<br>argument offered by the majority. Cf. New York Trust Co.&para;<br>v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921) (majority opinion of&para;<br>Holmes, J.). Materiality was central to the development,&para;<br>analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market theory&para;<br>both before Basic and in Basic itself. Materiality, therefore, must be demonstrated to prove fraud on the market,&para;<br>and until materiality of an alleged misstatement is shown&para;<br>there is no reason to believe that all market participants&para;<br>have relied equally on it. Otherwise individualized questions of reliance remain. This history confirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the theory is&para;<br>invoked—i.e., at certification.&para;<br>III&para;<br>I, thus, would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>and hold that a plaintiff invoking the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>presumption bears the burden to establish all the elements of fraud on the market at certification, including&para;<br>the materiality of the alleged misstatement.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
