The&para;<br>version of the regulation in effect at the time this dispute arose&para;<br>obliges issuers to provide to cardholders an “[i]nitial disclosure&para;<br>statement,” 12 CFR §226.6, specifying “each periodic rate that may&para;<br>be used to compute the finance charge,” §226.6(a)(2). It also imposes&para;<br>“[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,” §226.9, including notice to&para;<br>cardholders “[w]henever any term required to be disclosed under&para;<br>§226.6 is changed,” §226.9(c)(1). When “a periodic rate or other fi&para;<br>nance charge is increased because of the consumer’s delinquency or&para;<br>default,” notice must be given “before the effective date of the&para;<br>change.” Ibid.&para;<br>At the time respondent McCoy filed suit, he was the holder of a&para;<br>credit card issued by petitioner Chase Bank. The cardholder agree&para;<br>ment provided, in relevant part, that McCoy was eligible for “Pre&para;<br>ferred rates” as long as he met certain conditions. If any of those&para;<br>conditions were not met, Chase reserved the right to raise the rate,&para;<br>up to a pre-set maximum, and to apply the change to both existing&para;<br>and new balances. McCoy alleges that Chase increased his interest&para;<br>rate due to his delinquency or default and applied that increase ret&para;<br>roactively, and that this action violated Regulation Z because Chase&para;<br>did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect. The&para;<br>District Court dismissed his complaint, holding that because the in&para;<br>crease did not constitute a “change in terms” under §226.9(c), Chase&para;<br>was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding that Regulation&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Z requires issuers to provide notice of an interest-rate increase prior&para;<br>to its effective date.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: At the time of the transactions at issue, Regulation Z did not re&para;<br>quire Chase to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice before&para;<br>implementing the agreement term allowing it to raise his interest&para;<br>rate, up to a pre-set maximum, following delinquency or default.&para;<br>Pp. 7–19.&para;<br>(a) This case requires the Court to determine the meaning of a&para;<br>regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory authority.&para;<br>However, Regulation Z’s text is unclear with respect to the crucial in&para;<br>terpretive question at issue: whether a change to an interest rate,&para;<br>pursuant to previously-disclosed contractual provision, constitutes a&para;<br>change to a “term required to be disclosed under §226.6” requiring a&para;<br>subsequent disclosure under §226.9(c)(1). Because of this ambiguity,&para;<br>the Court must look to the Board’s own interpretation of the regula&para;<br>tion for guidance in deciding this case. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(b) The Board has made clear in its amicus brief to this Court that,&para;<br>in its view, Chase was not required to give McCoy notice of the inter&para;<br>est rate increase under the applicable version of Regulation Z. This&para;<br>Court defers to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation, ad&para;<br>vanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is “plainly errone&para;<br>ous or inconsistent with the regulation.” Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.&para;<br>452, 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Auer, the Court de&para;<br>ferred to the Secretary of Labor’s interpretation of his own regula&para;<br>tion, presented in an amicus brief submitted by the agency at the&para;<br>Court’s invitation. The Court held that the fact that the interpreta&para;<br>tion came in a legal brief did not, “in the circumstances of th[at] case,&para;<br>make it unworthy of deference.” Id., at 462. The interpretation was&para;<br>“in no sense a post hoc rationalization advanced by an agency seeking&para;<br>to defend past agency action against attack,” ibid. (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and alteration omitted), and there was “no reason to suspect&para;<br>that the interpretation [did] not reflect the agency’s fair and consid&para;<br>ered judgment on the matter in question,” ibid. The brief submitted&para;<br>by the Board here, at the Court’s invitation, is no different. As in&para;<br>Auer, there is no reason to believe that the Board’s interpretation is a&para;<br>“post hoc rationalization” taken as a litigation position, for the Board&para;<br>is not a party to this case. And its interpretation is neither “plainly&para;<br>erroneous” nor “inconsistent with” the indeterminate text of Regula&para;<br>tion Z. Thus, there is no reason to suspect that the Board’s position&para;<br>in its amicus brief reflects anything other than its fair and considered&para;<br>judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute&para;<br>arose. That Congress and the Board may currently hold a different&para;<br>view does not mean that deference is not warranted to the Board’s&para;<br>understanding of what the applicable version of Regulation Z re&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>quired. Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the inter&para;<br>pretation in the agency amicus brief is warranted. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(c) McCoy errs in arguing that deference to a legal brief is inappro&para;<br>priate because the interpretation of Regulation Z in the Official Staff&para;<br>Commentary commands a different result. While Commentary&para;<br>promulgated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z may&para;<br>warrant deference as a general matter, the Commentary explaining&para;<br>the requirements at issue in this case largely replicates the ambigu&para;<br>ity present in the regulatory text, and therefore offers no reason to&para;<br>disregard the interpretation advanced in the Board’s amicus brief.&para;<br>Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>559 F. 3d 963, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

S. C. §1601 et&para;<br>seq.—requires that issuers of credit cards provide card­&para;<br>holders with an “[i]nitial disclosure statement” specifying,&para;<br>inter alia, “each periodic rate” associated with the account.&para;<br>12 CFR §226.6(a)(2) (2008). The regulation also imposes&para;<br>“[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,” including notice to&para;<br>cardholders “[w]henever any term required to be disclosed&para;<br>under §226.6 is changed.” §226.9(c)(1). This case presents&para;<br>the question whether Regulation Z requires an issuer to&para;<br>notify a cardholder of an interest-rate increase instituted&para;<br>pursuant to a provision of the cardholder agreement giv­&para;<br>ing the issuer discretion to increase the rate, up to a&para;<br>stated maximum, in the event of the cardholder’s delin­&para;<br>quency or default. We conclude that the version of Regulation Z applicable in this case does not require such&para;<br>notice.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress passed TILA to promote consumers’ “informed&para;<br>use of credit” by requiring “meaningful disclosure of credit&para;<br>terms,” 15 U. S. C. §1601(a), and granted the Board the&para;<br>authority to issue regulations to achieve TILA’s purposes,&para;<br>§1604(a). Pursuant to this authority, the Board promul­&para;<br>gated Regulation Z, which requires credit card issuers to&para;<br>disclose certain information to consumers.1 Two provi­&para;<br>sions of Regulation Z are at issue in this case. The first,&para;<br>12 CFR §226.6, explains what information credit card&para;<br>issuers are obliged to provide to cardholders in the&para;<br>“[i]nitial disclosure statement,” including “each periodic&para;<br>rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.”&para;<br>§226.6(a)(2). The second, §226.9, imposes upon issuers&para;<br>certain “[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,” including&para;<br>a requirement to provide notice “[w]henever any term&para;<br>required to be disclosed under §226.6 is changed.”&para;<br>§226.9(c)(1). As a general matter, notice of a change in&para;<br>terms has to be provided 15 days in advance of the effec­&para;<br>tive date of the change. Ibid. When “a periodic rate or&para;<br>other finance charge is increased because of the con­&para;<br>sumer’s delinquency or default,” however, notice only need&para;<br>be given “before the effective date of the change.” Ibid.&para;<br>Regulation Z also explains that no notice is required under&para;<br>§226.9 when the change in terms “results from . . . the&para;<br>consumer’s default or delinquency (other than an increase&para;<br>in the periodic rate or other finance charge).” §226.9(c)(2).&para;<br>The official interpretation of Regulation Z (Official Staff&para;<br>Commentary or Commentary) promulgated by the Board&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 As discussed more fully below, see infra, at 4–5, in 2009 the Board&para;<br>amended Regulation Z, such that the provisions discussed in this&para;<br>opinion are no longer in effect. However, because the pre-2009 provi­&para;<br>sions are the ones applicable to the case before us, we will refer to them&para;<br>in the present tense.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>explains these requirements further: Section 226.9(c)(1)’s&para;<br>notice-of-change requirement does not apply “if the spe­&para;<br>cific change is set forth initially, such as . . . an increase&para;<br>that occurs when the consumer has been under an agree­&para;<br>ment to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in&para;<br>order to keep a particular rate and the account balance&para;<br>falls below the specified minimum.” 12 CFR pt. 226, Supp.&para;<br>I, Comment 9(c)–1, p. 506 (2008) (hereinafter Comment&para;<br>9(c)–1). On the other hand, the Commentary explains,&para;<br>“notice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to&para;<br>increase the rate at its discretion but does not include&para;<br>specific terms for an increase (for example, when an in­&para;<br>crease may occur under the creditor’s contract reservation&para;<br>right to increase the periodic rate).” Ibid. As to the timing&para;<br>requirements, the Commentary states: “[A] notice of&para;<br>change in terms is required, but it may be mailed or deliv­&para;<br>ered as late as the effective date of the change . . . [i]f&para;<br>there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance&para;<br>charge attributable to the consumer’s delinquency or&para;<br>default.” Id., Comment 9(c)(1)–3, at 507 (hereinafter&para;<br>Comment 9(c)(1)–3).&para;<br>At least as early as 2004, the Board began considering&para;<br>revisions to Regulation Z. The new regulations the Board&para;<br>eventually issued do not apply to the present case, but the&para;<br>details of their promulgation provide useful background&para;<br>in considering the parties’ arguments with respect to the&para;<br>version of Regulation Z we address here. In 2004 the&para;<br>Board issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking&para;<br>announcing its intent to consider revisions. 69 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>70925 (2004). In so doing, the Board described how it&para;<br>understood the notice requirements to function at that&para;<br>time:&para;<br>“[A]dvance notice is not required in all cases. For ex­&para;<br>ample, if the interest rate or other finance charge in­&para;<br>creases due to a consumer’s default or delinquency,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v.

Comment 9(c)–1. For example, some credit&para;<br>card account agreements permit the card issuer to in­&para;<br>crease the interest rate if the consumer pays late . . . .&para;<br>Under Regulation Z, because the circumstances are&para;<br>specified in advance in the account agreement, the&para;<br>creditor need not provide a change-in-terms notice 15&para;<br>days in advance of the increase; the new rate will ap­&para;<br>pear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which&para;<br>the increase occurs.” Id., at 70931–70932.&para;<br>The Board asked for public comment on whether these&para;<br>“existing disclosure rules” were “adequate to enable con­&para;<br>sumers to make timely decisions about how to manage&para;<br>their accounts.” Id., at 70932.&para;<br>Subsequently, in 2007, the Board published proposed&para;<br>amendments to Regulation Z and the Commentary. 72&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 32948. One amendment would have required 45&para;<br>days’ advance written notice when “(i) [a] rate is increased&para;<br>due to the consumer’s delinquency or default; or (ii) [a]&para;<br>rate is increased as a penalty for one or more events spec­&para;<br>ified in the account agreement, such as making a late&para;<br>payment or obtaining an extension of credit that exceeds&para;<br>the credit limit.”&para;<br>Id., at 33058 (proposed 12 CFR&para;<br>§226.9(g)). The Board explained that, under the amend­&para;<br>ments, “creditors would no longer be permitted to provide&para;<br>for the immediate application of penalty pricing upon the&para;<br>occurrence of certain events specified in the contract.” 72&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 33012.&para;<br>In January 2009, the Board promulgated a final rule&para;<br>implementing many of the proposed changes, scheduled to&para;<br>be effective July 1, 2010. 74 Fed. Reg. 5244.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ently, the Board included a new provision, §226.9(g),&para;<br>which requires 45 days’ advance notice of increases in&para;<br>rates due to cardholder delinquency or default, or as a&para;<br>penalty, including penalties for “events specified in the&para;<br>account agreement, such as making a late payment . . . .”&para;<br>12 CFR §226.9(g) (2010). In May 2009, Congress en­&para;<br>acted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and&para;<br>Disclosure Act (Credit CARD Act or Act), 123 Stat. 1734.&para;<br>The Act amended TILA, in relevant part, to require 45&para;<br>days’ advance notice of most increases in credit card an­&para;<br>nual percentage rates. 15 U. S. C. §1637(i) (2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. III). Because the Credit CARD Act’s notice re­&para;<br>quirements with respect to interest-rate increases largely&para;<br>mirror the requirements in the new version of the regulation, the Board changed the effective date of those&para;<br>requirements to August 20, 2009, to coincide with the&para;<br>statutory schedule. See 74 Fed. Reg. 36077–36079. The&para;<br>transactions giving rise to the dispute at issue in this case,&para;<br>however, arose prior to enactment of the Act and the&para;<br>promulgation of the new regulatory provisions.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondent James A. McCoy brought this action in the&para;<br>Superior Court of Orange County, California on behalf of&para;<br>himself and others similarly situated against petitioner&para;<br>Chase Bank USA, N. A.; Chase removed the action to the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Central District of&para;<br>California under 28 U. S. C. §1441. At the time of the&para;<br>transactions at issue, McCoy was the holder of a credit&para;<br>card issued by Chase. The cardholder agreement between&para;<br>the parties (Agreement) provides, in relevant part, that&para;<br>McCoy is eligible for “Preferred rates,” but that to keep&para;<br>such rates he has to meet certain conditions, including&para;<br>making “at least the required minimum payments when&para;<br>due on [his] Account and on all other loans or accounts&para;<br>with [Chase] and [his] other creditors.” Brief for Respon­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N.

If any of the conditions in the&para;<br>Agreement are not met, Chase reserves the right to&para;<br>“change [McCoy’s] interest rate and impose a NonPreferred rate up to the maximum Non-Preferred rate&para;<br>described in the Pricing Schedule” and to apply any&para;<br>changes “to existing as well as new balances . . . effective&para;<br>with the billing cycle ending on the review date.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 8, n. 2.&para;<br>McCoy’s complaint alleges that Chase increased his&para;<br>interest rate due to his delinquency or default, and applied&para;<br>that increase retroactively. McCoy asserts that the rate&para;<br>increase violates Regulation Z because, pursuant to the&para;<br>Agreement, Chase did not notify him of the increase until&para;<br>after it had taken effect.2 The District Court dismissed&para;<br>McCoy’s complaint, holding that because the increase did&para;<br>not constitute a “change in terms” as contemplated by&para;<br>§226.9(c), Chase was not required to notify him of the&para;<br>increase before implementing it. See App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>37a–47a.&para;<br>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding&para;<br>that Regulation Z requires issuers to provide notice of an&para;<br>interest-rate increase prior to its effective date. See 559&para;<br>F. 3d, at 969. Concluding that the text of Regulation Z is&para;<br>ambiguous and that the agency commentary accompany­&para;<br>ing the 2004 request for comments and the 2007 proposed&para;<br>amendments favors neither party’s interpretation, the&para;<br>court relied primarily on the Official Staff Commentary; in&para;<br>particular, the court noted that Comment 9(c)–1 requires&para;<br>no notice of a change in terms if the “specific change” at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 McCoy also asserted various state-law claims that are not before us.&para;<br>We note that McCoy’s complaint provides little detail regarding the&para;<br>transactions at issue in this case.

The court found, however, that because the Agree­&para;<br>ment vests Chase with discretion to impose any NonPreferred rate it chooses (up to the specified maximum)&para;<br>upon McCoy’s default, the Agreement “provides McCoy&para;<br>with no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive&para;<br>interest rate Chase will choose to charge him if he de­&para;<br>faults.” Id., at 967. Accordingly, the court held that be­&para;<br>cause the Agreement does not alert McCoy to the “specific&para;<br>change” that will occur if he defaults, Chase was obliged to&para;<br>give notice of that change prior to its effective date. Ibid.&para;<br>Relying primarily on the 2004 notice of proposed rulemak­&para;<br>ing and the 2007 proposed amendments, the dissenting&para;<br>judge concluded that Regulation Z does not require notice&para;<br>of an interest-rate increase in the circumstances of this&para;<br>case. See id., at 972–979 (opinion of Cudahy, J.).&para;<br>After the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, the United States Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the First Circuit decided the same question&para;<br>in Chase’s favor.

MCCOY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issuer to increase the rate, up to a stated maximum, in the&para;<br>event of the cardholder’s delinquency or default. Accord­&para;<br>ingly, this case calls upon us to determine the meaning of&para;<br>a regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory&para;<br>authority. The parties dispute the proper interpretation of&para;<br>the regulation itself, as well as whether we should accord&para;<br>deference to the Board’s interpretation of its regulation.&para;<br>As explained below, we conclude that the text of the regu­&para;<br>lation is ambiguous, and that deference is warranted to&para;<br>the interpretation of that text advanced by the Board in&para;<br>its amicus brief.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Our analysis begins with the text of Regulation Z in&para;<br>effect at the time this dispute arose. First, §226.6 requires&para;<br>an “[i]nitial disclosure statement”:&para;<br>“The creditor shall disclose to the consumer, in ter­&para;<br>minology consistent with that to be used on the peri­&para;<br>odic statement, each of the following items, to the&para;<br>extent applicable:&para;<br>“(a) Finance charge.&para;<br>The circumstances under&para;<br>which a finance charge will be imposed and an expla­&para;<br>nation of how it will be determined, as follows:&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“(2) A disclosure of each periodic rate that may be&para;<br>used to compute the finance charge, the range of bal­&para;<br>ances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding&para;<br>annual percentage rate. When different periodic rates&para;<br>apply to different types of transactions, the types of&para;<br>transactions to which the periodic rates apply shall&para;<br>also be disclosed.” (Footnotes omitted.)&para;<br>Second, §226.9(c) requires certain “[s]ubsequent disclosure&para;<br>requirements”:&para;<br>“Change in terms—(1) Written notice required.&para;<br>Whenever any term required to be disclosed under&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§226.6 is changed or the required minimum periodic&para;<br>payment is increased, the creditor shall mail or de­&para;<br>liver written notice of the change to each consumer&para;<br>who may be affected. The notice shall be mailed or&para;<br>delivered at least 15 days prior to the effective date of&para;<br>the change. The 15-day timing requirement does not&para;<br>apply if the change has been agreed to by the con­&para;<br>sumer, or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is&para;<br>increased because of the consumer’s delinquency or&para;<br>default; the notice shall be given, however, before the&para;<br>effective date of the change.&para;<br>“(2) Notice not required. No notice under this sec­&para;<br>tion is required when the change . . . results from . . .&para;<br>the consumer’s default or delinquency (other than an&para;<br>increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge).”&para;<br>The question is whether the increase in McCoy’s inter­&para;<br>est rate constitutes a change to a “term required to be&para;<br>disclosed under §226.6,” requiring a subsequent disclosure&para;<br>under §226.9(c)(1). One of the initial terms that must be&para;<br>disclosed under §226.6 is “each periodic rate that may be&para;<br>used to compute the finance charge . . . and the corre­&para;<br>sponding annual percentage rate.” §226.6(a)(2). McCoy&para;<br>argues that, because an increase in the interest rate in­&para;<br>creases the “periodic rate” applicable to his account, such&para;<br>an increase constitutes a change in terms within the&para;<br>meaning of §226.9(c)(1). As further support, McCoy points&para;<br>to two provisions in §226.9(c): first, that notice of an in­&para;<br>crease in the interest rate must be provided “before the&para;<br>effective date of the change” when the increase is due to&para;<br>“the consumer’s delinquency or default,” §226.9(c)(1); and&para;<br>second, that no notice is required of a change resulting&para;<br>“from the consumer’s default or delinquency (other than&para;<br>an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge),”&para;<br>§226.9(c)(2).&para;<br>Accordingly, because §226.9(c) includes&para;<br>interest-rate increases due to delinquency or default,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>McCoy argues that the plain text of the regulation indi­&para;<br>cates that a change in the periodic rate due to such default&para;<br>is a “change in terms” requiring notice under §226.9(c)(1).&para;<br>We recognize that McCoy’s argument has some force;&para;<br>read in isolation, the language quoted above certainly&para;<br>suggests that credit card issuers must provide notice of an&para;<br>interest-rate increase imposed pursuant to cardholder&para;<br>delinquency or default. But McCoy’s analysis begs the key&para;<br>question: whether the increase actually changed a “term”&para;<br>of the Agreement that was “required to be disclosed under&para;<br>§226.6.” If not, §226.9(c)’s subsequent notice requirement&para;<br>with respect to a “change in terms” does not apply. Chase&para;<br>argues precisely this: The increase did not change a term&para;<br>in the Agreement, but merely implemented one that had&para;<br>been initially disclosed, as required. This interpretation,&para;<br>though not commanded by the text of the regulation, is&para;<br>reasonable. Section 226.6(a)(2) requires initial disclosure&para;<br>of “each periodic rate that may be used to compute the&para;<br>finance charge.” The Agreement itself discloses both the&para;<br>initial rate (Preferred rate) and the maximum rate to be&para;<br>imposed in the event of default (Non-Preferred rate). See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 8, n. 2; Brief for Petitioner 13–14.4&para;<br>Accordingly, it is plausible to understand the Agreement&para;<br>to initially disclose “each periodic rate” to be applied to the&para;<br>account, and Chase arguably did not “change” those rates&para;<br>as a result of McCoy’s default. Instead, Chase merely&para;<br>implemented the previously disclosed term specifying the&para;<br>Non-Preferred rate.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Pricing Schedule referred to in the Agreement is not contained&para;<br>in the case record, nor are its contents apparent from the parties’ briefs,&para;<br>but neither side disputes that it specified a maximum Non-Preferred&para;<br>rate applicable to the Agreement.&para;<br>5 We are not persuaded by McCoy’s argument that, although Chase&para;<br>did not change a “contract term” when it raised his interest rate pursu­&para;<br>ant to the terms of the Agreement, it changed a “credit term,” thereby&para;<br>triggering §226.9(c)’s notice requirement.

For&para;<br>example, credit card agreements routinely include a “res­&para;<br>ervation of rights” provision giving the issuer discretion to&para;<br>change the terms of the contract, often as a means of&para;<br>responding to events that raise doubts about the card­&para;<br>holder’s creditworthiness. An issuer may exercise this&para;<br>general contract-modification authority and raise the&para;<br>interest rate applicable to the account to address any&para;<br>heightened risk. See Brief for Petitioner 6. In such a case,&para;<br>§226.9(c)(1) is best read to require that notice must be&para;<br>given prior to the effective date of the increase, because&para;<br>the unilateral increase instituted by the issuer actually&para;<br>changed a term—the interest rate—in a manner not spe­&para;<br>cifically contemplated by the agreement.6 See Comment&para;<br>9(c)–1 (providing that notice is required if the agreement&para;<br>“does not include specific terms for an increase (for exam­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>tion Z does not refer to, let alone distinguish between, “contract terms”&para;<br>and “credit terms,” and McCoy’s repeated citations to TILA’s broad&para;<br>policy statement do not convince us that such a distinction is war­&para;<br>ranted. See 15 U. S. C. §1601(a) (“It is the purpose of this subchapter&para;<br>to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer&para;<br>will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available&para;<br>to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit”).&para;<br>6 The Government offers an alternative example. Assume that the&para;<br>agreement is similar to the one at issue here, with a specified maxi­&para;<br>mum level to which the interest rate can be increased if the cardholder&para;<br>defaults. If default occurs but the issuer raises the rate above the&para;<br>contractual maximum, notice must be given prior to the effective date&para;<br>because the issuer actually changed the term of the contract initially&para;<br>specifying the maximum rate possible.

We need not decide which party’s&para;<br>interpretation is more persuasive, however; both are&para;<br>plausible, and the text alone does not permit a more de­&para;<br>finitive reading. Accordingly, we find Regulation Z to be&para;<br>ambiguous as to the question presented, and must there­&para;<br>fore look to the Board’s own interpretation of the regula­&para;<br>tion for guidance in deciding this case.

Responding to the petitioners’ objection that the&para;<br>agency’s interpretation came in a legal brief, we held that&para;<br>this fact did not, “in the circumstances of this case, make&para;<br>it unworthy of deference.” Id., at 462. We observed that&para;<br>“[t]he Secretary’s position is in no sense a ‘post hoc ration­&para;<br>alizatio[n]’ advanced by an agency seeking to defend past&para;<br>agency action against attack.” Ibid. (quoting Bowen v.&para;<br>Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988)). We&para;<br>added: “There is simply no reason to suspect that the&para;<br>interpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and con­&para;<br>sidered judgment on the matter in question.” Auer, 519&para;<br>U. S., at 462.&para;<br>The brief submitted by the Board in the present case, at&para;<br>our invitation, is no different. As in Auer, there is no&para;<br>reason to believe that the interpretation advanced by the&para;<br>Board is a “post hoc rationalization” taken as a litigation&para;<br>position. The Board is not a party to this case. And as is&para;<br>evident from our discussion of Regulation Z itself, see Part&para;<br>II–A, supra, the Board’s interpretation is neither “plainly&para;<br>erroneous” nor “inconsistent with” the indeterminate text&para;<br>of the regulation. In short, there is no reason to suspect&para;<br>that the position the Board takes in its amicus brief re­&para;<br>flects anything other than the agency’s fair and considered&para;<br>judgment as to what the regulation required at the time&para;<br>this dispute arose.&para;<br>McCoy may well be correct in asserting that it is better&para;<br>policy to oblige credit-card issuers to give advance notice&para;<br>of a rate increase; after all, both Congress and the Board&para;<br>have recently indicated that such a requirement is war­&para;<br>ranted. See Credit CARD Act, §101(a)(1), 123 Stat. 1735–&para;<br>1736; 12 CFR §226.9(g) (2009). That Congress and the&para;<br>Board may currently hold such views does not mean,&para;<br>however, that deference is not warranted to the Board’s&para;<br>different understanding of what the pre-2009 version of&para;<br>Regulation Z required. To the contrary, the interpretation&para;<br>the Board advances in its amicus brief is entirely consis­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tent with its past views. The 2004 notice of rulemaking&para;<br>and the 2007 proposed amendments to Regulation Z make&para;<br>clear that, prior to 2009, the Board’s fair and considered&para;<br>judgment was that “no change-in-terms notice is required&para;<br>if the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances&para;<br>under which an increase . . . will occur,” 69 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>70931, and “immediate application of penalty pricing upon&para;<br>the occurrence of certain events specified in the contract”&para;<br>was permissible, 72 Fed. Reg. 33012.&para;<br>Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the&para;<br>interpretation in the Board’s amicus brief is warranted.&para;<br>The cases McCoy cites in which we declined to apply Auer&para;<br>do not suggest that deference is unwarranted here. In&para;<br>Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), we declined to&para;<br>defer because—in sharp contrast to the present case—&para;<br>the regulation in question did “little more than restate the&para;<br>terms of the statute” pursuant to which the regulation was&para;<br>promulgated. Id., at 257. Accordingly, no deference was&para;<br>warranted to an agency interpretation of what were, in&para;<br>fact, Congress’ words. Ibid. In contrast, at the time of the&para;<br>transactions in this case, TILA itself included no require­&para;<br>ments with respect to the disclosure of a change in credit&para;<br>terms. In Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576&para;<br>(2000), we declined to apply Auer deference because the&para;<br>regulation in question was unambiguous, and adopting the&para;<br>agency’s contrary interpretation would “permit the agency,&para;<br>under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create de&para;<br>facto a new regulation.” 529 U. S., at 588. In light of&para;<br>Regulation Z’s ambiguity, there is no such danger here.&para;<br>And our statement in Christensen that “deference is war­&para;<br>ranted only when the language of the regulation is am­&para;<br>biguous,” ibid., is perfectly consonant with Auer itself; if&para;<br>the text of a regulation is unambiguous, a conflicting&para;<br>agency interpretation advanced in an amicus brief will&para;<br>necessarily be “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the&para;<br>regulation” in question. Auer, 519 U. S., at 461 (internal&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, under our prece­&para;<br>dent deference to the Board’s interpretation of its own&para;<br>regulation, as presented in the agency’s amicus brief, is&para;<br>wholly appropriate.&para;<br>C&para;<br>McCoy further argues that deference to a legal brief is&para;<br>inappropriate because the interpretation of Regulation Z&para;<br>in the Official Staff Commentary commands a different&para;<br>result. To be sure, the Official Staff Commentary promul­&para;<br>gated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z&para;<br>may warrant deference as a general matter. See Anderson&para;<br>Bros. Ford v. Valencia, 452 U. S. 205, 219 (1981) (holding&para;<br>that “the Board’s interpretation of its own regulation”&para;<br>should generally “be accepted by the courts”); Milhollin,&para;<br>444 U. S., at 565 (“Unless demonstrably irrational, Fed­&para;<br>eral Reserve Board staff opinions construing [TILA] or&para;<br>Regulation [Z] should be dispositive”). We find, however,&para;<br>that the Commentary at issue here largely replicates the&para;<br>ambiguity present in the regulatory text, and therefore it&para;<br>offers us nothing to which we can defer with respect to the&para;<br>precise interpretive question before us.9 Cf.

[i]f there is an&para;<br>increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attri­&para;<br>butable to the consumer’s delinquency or default.” This&para;<br>exposition of the regulation does not add any clarity to the&para;<br>regulatory text, which expresses the same requirement.&para;<br>See §226.9(c)(1) (2008) (“[I]f a periodic rate or other fi­&para;<br>nance charge is increased because of the consumer’s delin­&para;<br>quency or default . . . notice shall be given . . . before the&para;<br>effective date of the change”). And like §226.9(c), Com­&para;<br>ment 9(c) is entitled “Change in terms.” Accordingly,&para;<br>Chase’s plausible interpretation of §226.9(c)(1) is equally&para;<br>applicable to Comment 9(c)(1)–3: On Chase’s view, be­&para;<br>cause the interest-rate increase at issue in this case did&para;<br>not constitute a “change in terms,” the disclosure require­&para;<br>ments in the regulation and Commentary simply do not&para;<br>come into play. See supra, at 10–11.&para;<br>Comment 9(c)–1 is also ambiguous, though the most&para;<br>plausible reading supports Chase’s position more than it&para;<br>does McCoy’s. The Comment begins: “No notice of a&para;<br>change in terms need be given if the specific change is set&para;<br>forth initially” in the agreement. We do not find that the&para;<br>Comment’s addition of the modifier “specific” to the word&para;<br>“change” enables us to determine, any more than we could&para;<br>in light of the text of the regulation, see supra, at 12,&para;<br>whether the interest-rate increase at issue in this case&para;<br>was a “change in terms” requiring notice. According to&para;<br>Chase, as long as the agreement explains that delinquency&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>issue authoritative interpretations for other purposes. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CHASE BANK USA, N.

McCoy argues to the contrary:&para;<br>Under Comment 9(c)–1, any new rate imposed after delin­&para;<br>quency or default must be disclosed prior to the effective&para;<br>date, if the particular rate (rather than the maximum&para;<br>rate) was not specifically mentioned in the agreement. On&para;<br>the whole, then, the Official Staff Commentary’s explana­&para;<br>tion of Regulation Z does not resolve the uncertainty in the&para;<br>regulatory text, and offers us no reason to disregard&para;<br>the interpretation advanced in the Board’s amicus brief.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit focused on the examples&para;<br>Comment 9(c)–1 provides of changes that, if set forth initially, require&para;<br>no further disclosure when put into effect:&para;<br>“No notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is&para;<br>set forth initially, such as: Rate increases under a properly disclosed&para;<br>variable-rate plan, a rate increase that occurs when an employee has&para;<br>been under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment,&para;<br>or an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an&para;<br>agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order&para;<br>to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the&para;<br>specified minimum.”&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit concluded that, in contrast to each of these three&para;<br>examples, “the increase here occurs at Chase’s discretion.” 559 F. 3d&para;<br>963, 966 (2009). That is, once the triggering event—McCoy’s default—&para;<br>occurred, Chase had the latitude to increase the interest rate as it saw&para;<br>fit (up to the limit specified in the Pricing Schedule).&para;<br>We are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning. Certainly,&para;<br>under a “variable-rate” plan the interest rate fluctuates according to an&para;<br>external variable easily discernable by the cardholder (like the Federal&para;<br>Prime rate), and the issuer has no discretion. See ibid. But the Com­&para;<br>ment’s second and third examples do not appear to be significantly&para;<br>different from this case: The agreement contains a preset rate, but it&para;<br>also provides that, on the occurrence of a predefined event (terminating&para;<br>employment or a low account balance), the rate will increase.&para;<br>Moreover, Comment 9(c)–1 further states that notice is needed “if the&para;<br>contract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but&para;<br>does not include specific terms for an increase”—for example, “when an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

In short, analogizing to&para;<br>the Comment’s examples suggests that Chase’s action in setting a new&para;<br>rate was most likely a “specific change” that the Agreement itself&para;<br>contemplated, and subsequent disclosure was not clearly required.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
