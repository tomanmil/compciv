MONTANA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA&para;<br>No. 10–218.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 7, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric&para;<br>facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds&para;<br>underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Rivers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along&para;<br>the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and&para;<br>PPL’s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons&para;<br>on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The&para;<br>Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both&para;<br>projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.&para;<br>PPL’s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a century. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects’ existence,&para;<br>sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of&para;<br>PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United&para;<br>States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal&para;<br>suit, claiming that PPL’s facilities were on riverbeds that were state&para;<br>owned and part of Montana’s school trust lands. The State joined the&para;<br>suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the&para;<br>riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power companies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred&para;<br>from seeking compensation for PPL’s riverbed use. Montana counterclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns&para;<br>the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court&para;<br>granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes&para;<br>of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41&para;<br>million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Montana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the&para;<br>navigability test, it discounted this Court’s approach of considering&para;<br>the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of deter-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>mining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying&para;<br>those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court&para;<br>declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of&para;<br>navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.&para;<br>Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison&para;<br>River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the&para;<br>time of statehood.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana owns and&para;<br>may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm&para;<br>legal understanding of this Court’s rules of navigability for title under the equal-footing doctrine. Pp. 10–26.&para;<br>(a) The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold&para;<br>“title in the soil of rivers really navigable,” Shively v. Bowlby, 152&para;<br>U. S. 1, 31, has federal constitutional significance under the equalfooting doctrine. Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of statehood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then&para;<br>navigable. It may allocate and govern those lands according to state&para;<br>law subject only to the United States’ power “to control such waters&para;<br>for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.” United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14. The United States retains title&para;<br>vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then navigable. To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine, rivers must be “navigable in fact,” meaning “they are used, or&para;<br>are susceptible of being used, . . . as highways for commerce, over&para;<br>which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary&para;<br>modes of trade and travel on water.” The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557,&para;<br>563. This formulation has been used to determine questions of waterbed title under the equal-footing doctrine. See United States v.&para;<br>Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 76. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(b) The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the question of river segments and portage. To determine riverbed title under&para;<br>the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river,&para;<br>under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not. See,&para;<br>e.g., Utah, supra, at 77. The State Supreme Court erred in discounting this well-settled approach. A key justification for sovereign ownership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that&para;<br>could interfere with the public’s right to use the waters as a highway&para;<br>for commerce. Because commerce could not have occurred on segments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to&para;<br>deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing&para;<br>doctrine. Practical considerations also support segmentation. Physi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cal conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river&para;<br>and provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end&para;<br>points for disputed segments. A segment approach is also consistent&para;<br>with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed&para;<br>title. Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable&para;<br>when the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds&para;<br>for purposes of determining their value and PPL’s corresponding&para;<br>rents. The State Supreme Court’s view that the segment-by-segment&para;<br>approach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not&para;<br>supported by this Court’s Utah decision. Even if the law might find&para;<br>some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment&para;<br>as part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments&para;<br>in this case would meet that standard. Applying its “short interruptions” approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls&para;<br>reach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route&para;<br>portage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day&para;<br>would demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.&para;<br>Thus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect&para;<br>to the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages&para;<br>were insufficient to defeat a navigability finding. In most cases, they&para;<br>are, because they require transportation over land rather than over&para;<br>the water. This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach. In&para;<br>reaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied&para;<br>The Montello, 20 Wall. 430. There, portage was considered in determining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce&para;<br>for federal regulatory purposes. The Montello does not control the&para;<br>outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title context apply. Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and&para;<br>do so with respect to the Great Falls reach. Montana does not dispute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and&para;<br>the trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The&para;<br>Great Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the&para;<br>foot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under&para;<br>the equal-footing doctrine. There is also a significant likelihood that&para;<br>some of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigability test. The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river&para;<br>stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana&para;<br>courts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light&para;<br>of the principles discussed here. Pp. 14–21.&para;<br>(c) The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in&para;<br>relying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the&para;<br>Madison River. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of&para;<br>statehood, and it concerns a river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade and travel.’ ” Utah, 283 U. S., at 75–76. River segments are navigable if they&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“ ‘[were]’ ” used and if they “ ‘[were] susceptible of being used’ ” as&para;<br>highways of commerce at the time of statehood. Id., at 76. Evidence&para;<br>of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on susceptibility of commercial use at the time of statehood. See id., at 82–83.&para;<br>In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at&para;<br>statehood, (1) the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in&para;<br>customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and&para;<br>(2) the river’s poststatehood condition may not be materially different&para;<br>from its physical condition at statehood. The State Supreme Court&para;<br>offered no indication that it made these necessary findings. Pp. 21–&para;<br>24.&para;<br>(d) Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the&para;<br>Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred&para;<br>as to the burden of proof regarding navigability. P. 24.&para;<br>(e) Montana’s suggestion that denying the State title to the disputed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrine—which concerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation,&para;<br>fishing, and other recreational uses—underscores its misapprehension of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines. Unlike the equalfooting doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters&para;<br>within the State’s borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal&para;<br>regulatory power. Pp. 24–25.&para;<br>(f) This Court does not reach the question whether, by virtue of&para;<br>Montana’s sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar&para;<br>the State’s claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in title on the State’s long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some&para;<br>evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over&para;<br>those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doctrine.

The question is&para;<br>whether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in&para;<br>Montana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that&para;<br>concept for purposes of determining whether the State&para;<br>acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,&para;<br>when the State entered the Union in 1889. Montana&para;<br>contends that the rivers must be found navigable at the&para;<br>disputed locations. From this premise, the State asserts&para;<br>that in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under&para;<br>the constitutional equal-footing doctrine. Based on its&para;<br>title claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL&para;<br>Montana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riv­&para;<br>erbeds for hydroelectric projects. The Montana courts&para;<br>granted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding&para;<br>it $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from&para;<br>2000 to 2007 alone. That judgment must be reversed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The three rivers in question are the Missouri River, the&para;<br>Madison River, and the Clark Fork River.

The&para;<br>United States as amicus is in substantial agreement with&para;<br>PPL’s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis­&para;<br>cussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea­&para;<br>tional use. Brief for United States 27–33.&para;<br>It is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the&para;<br>legal principles that control the case.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns,&para;<br>hold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins&para;<br>in English common law. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.&para;<br>1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between&para;<br>waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)&para;<br>and nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to&para;<br>royal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the&para;<br>riverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of&para;<br>passage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect&para;<br>to public highways, as the name suggests, the public also&para;<br>retained the right of water passage; but title to the riv­&para;<br>erbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private&para;<br>ownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each&para;<br>owning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as&para;<br>well as the exclusive right to fish there. See Idaho v.&para;<br>Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 285 (1997)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(summarizing J.

Kent,&para;<br>Commentaries on American Law 528–529 (9th ed. 1858).&para;<br>While the tide-based distinction for bed title was the&para;<br>initial rule in the 13 Colonies, after the Revolution Ameri­&para;<br>can law moved to a different standard. Some state courts&para;<br>came early to the conclusion that a State holds presump­&para;<br>tive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters&para;<br>are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. See, e.g., Carson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475 (Pa. 1810); Executors of Cates v.&para;<br>Wadlington, 12 S. C. L. 580 (1822); Wilson v. Forbes, 13&para;<br>N. C. 30 (1828); Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835);&para;<br>Elder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358 (1845). The tidal rule of&para;<br>“navigability” for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while&para;<br>perhaps appropriate for England’s dominant coastal geog­&para;<br>raphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast&para;<br>number of major inland rivers upon which navigation&para;<br>could be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv­&para;<br>ers 26–27, 31–35 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,&para;<br>667–669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had&para;<br>recognized “the now prevailing doctrine” of state sovereign&para;<br>“title in the soil of rivers really navigable.” Shively, supra,&para;<br>at 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 336 (1877) (“In&para;<br>this country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed&para;<br>navigable which are really so”). This title rule became&para;<br>known as “navigability in fact.”&para;<br>The rule for state riverbed title assumed federal consti­&para;<br>tutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine. In&para;<br>1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States,&para;<br>the people of each State, based on principles of sovereign­&para;<br>ty, “hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters&para;<br>and the soils under them,” subject only to rights surren­&para;<br>dered and powers granted by the Constitution to the&para;<br>Federal Government. Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet.&para;<br>367, 410 (1842). In a series of 19th-century cases, the&para;<br>Court determined that the same principle applied to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States later admitted to the Union, because the States in&para;<br>the Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.&para;<br>See, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228–229&para;<br>(1845); Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161,&para;<br>183 (1891); Shively, supra, at 26–31; see United States v.&para;<br>Texas, 339 U. S. 707, 716 (1950). These precedents are the&para;<br>basis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State’s&para;<br>title to these lands was “conferred not by Congress but by&para;<br>the Constitution itself.” Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.&para;<br>Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). It&para;<br>follows that any ensuing questions of navigability for determining state riverbed title are governed by federal&para;<br>law. See, e.g., United States v. Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 75&para;<br>(1931); United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14 (1935).&para;<br>The title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can&para;<br>be stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State&para;<br>gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then&para;<br>navigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co.&para;<br>v. Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not&para;<br>relevant in this case). It may allocate and govern those&para;<br>lands according to state law subject only to “the para­&para;<br>mount power of the United States to control such waters&para;<br>for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign com­&para;<br>merce.” Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United&para;<br>States, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981); United States v. Holt&para;<br>State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54 (1926). The United States&para;<br>retains any title vested in it before statehood to any land&para;<br>beneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influ­&para;<br>enced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.&para;<br>See Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.&para;<br>Returning to the “navigability in fact” rule, the Court&para;<br>has explained the elements of this test. A basic formula­&para;<br>tion of the rule was set forth in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall.&para;<br>557 (1871), a case concerning federal power to regulate&para;<br>navigation:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable&para;<br>rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they&para;<br>are navigable in fact when they are used, or are sus­&para;<br>ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as&para;<br>highways for commerce, over which trade and travel&para;<br>are or may be conducted in the customary modes of&para;<br>trade and travel on water.” Id., at 563.&para;<br>The Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in con­&para;<br>sidering the navigability of waters for purposes of as­&para;<br>sessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitu­&para;<br>tion, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to&para;<br>the waters and their beds. See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello,&para;<br>20 Wall. 430, 439 (1874); United States v. Appalachian&para;<br>Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 406, and n. 21 (1940) (Fed­&para;<br>eral Power Act); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715,&para;<br>730–731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id.,&para;<br>at 761 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It&para;<br>has been used as well to determine questions of title to&para;<br>water beds under the equal-footing doctrine. See Utah,&para;<br>supra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 586&para;<br>(1922); Holt State Bank, supra, at 56. It should be noted,&para;<br>however, that the test for navigability is not applied in the&para;<br>same way in these distinct types of cases.&para;<br>Among the differences in application are the following.&para;<br>For state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga­&para;<br>bility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,&para;<br>supra, at 75, and based on the “natural and ordinary condition” of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In&para;<br>contrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes&para;<br>made navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte&para;<br>Boyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631–632 (1884) (artificial canal); and&para;<br>federal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only&para;<br>recently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.&para;<br>v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634–635 (1912), were once&para;<br>navigable but are no longer, see Economy Light &amp; Power&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Co. v. United States, 256 U.

With respect to the federal com­&para;<br>merce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically&para;<br>focused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,&para;<br>supra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex­&para;<br>tends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United&para;<br>States, 444 U. S. 164, 173–174 (1979). In contrast, for title&para;<br>purposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not&para;<br>on interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of&para;<br>differences is not exhaustive. Indeed, “[e]ach application&para;<br>of [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations&para;<br>and refinements which require further elaboration.” Appalachian Elec. Power Co., supra, at 406.&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The primary flaw in the reasoning of the Montana Su­&para;<br>preme Court lies in its treatment of the question of river&para;<br>segments and overland portage.&para;<br>To determine title to a riverbed under the equal-footing&para;<br>doctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment­&para;<br>by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the&para;<br>river, under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable&para;<br>or not. In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court&para;<br>noted,&para;<br>“the controversy relates only to the sections of the riv­&para;<br>ers which are described in the complaint, and the&para;<br>Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to&para;<br>navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,&para;<br>in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,&para;<br>is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,&para;<br>speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,&para;<br>and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,&para;<br>it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dence, how far navigability extends.” 283 U. S., at 77.&para;<br>The Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as­&para;<br>sessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga­&para;<br>ble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the&para;<br>next roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain­&para;<br>ing 149 miles. Id., at 73–74, 79–81, 89. The Court noted&para;<br>the importance of determining “the exact point at which&para;<br>navigability may be deemed to end.” Id., at 90.&para;<br>Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the&para;<br>segment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage&para;<br>Indian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River&para;<br>was “navigable in fact at the locus in quo.” The Court&para;<br>concluded that the United States originally, and the Osag­&para;<br>es as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds&para;<br>because the Arkansas River “is and was not navigable at&para;<br>the place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,&para;<br>are.” Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river&para;<br>along the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a&para;<br>segment of the river that began further downstream was&para;<br>navigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,&para;<br>587–588, 589–591 (noting that “how far up the streams&para;<br>navigability extended was not known”; assessing separate­&para;<br>ly the segments of the Red River above and below its&para;<br>confluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma’s&para;<br>borders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence&para;<br>“no part of the river within Oklahoma,” was navigable).&para;<br>The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment­&para;<br>by-segment approach of this Court’s cases, calling it&para;<br>“a piecemeal classification of navigability—with some&para;<br>stretches declared navigable, and others declared non­&para;<br>navigable.” 355 Mont., at 440–442, 229 P. 3d, at 448–449.&para;<br>This was error. The segment-by-segment approach to&para;<br>navigability for title is well settled, and it should not be&para;<br>disregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow&para;<br>private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the&para;<br>riverbeds that could interfere with the public’s right to use&para;<br>the waters as a highway for commerce. While the Federal&para;<br>Government and States retain regulatory power to protect&para;<br>public navigation, allocation to the State of the beds un­&para;<br>derlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict&para;<br>between private and public interests. See Utah, supra, at&para;<br>82–83; Packer, 137 U. S., at 667. By contrast, segments&para;<br>that are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those&para;<br>over which commerce could not then occur. Thus, there is&para;<br>no reason that these segments also should be deemed&para;<br>owned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.&para;<br>Practical considerations also support segmentation.&para;<br>Physical conditions that affect navigability often vary&para;<br>significantly over the length of a river. This is particularly&para;<br>true with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different&para;<br>terrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying&para;<br>local climates. The Missouri River provides an excellent&para;<br>example: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for&para;<br>over 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons&para;<br>and upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and&para;<br>across sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and&para;<br>farmland rains alike. These shifts in physical conditions&para;<br>provide a means to determine appropriate start points and&para;<br>end points for the segment in question. Topographical and&para;<br>geographical indicators may assist. See, e.g., Utah, supra,&para;<br>at 77–80 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U. S., at 589&para;<br>(location of tributary providing additional flow).&para;<br>A segment approach to riverbed title allocation under&para;<br>the equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in&para;<br>which private parties seek to establish riverbed title. For&para;<br>centuries, where title to the riverbed was not in the sover­&para;<br>eign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title&para;<br>among riparian landowners involved apportionment de­&para;<br>fined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>along the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each&para;<br>landowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).&para;<br>See J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses&para;<br>18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, 24 F. Cas. 472, 474&para;<br>(No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.). Montana, moreover,&para;<br>cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when&para;<br>the state courts managed to divide up and apportion the&para;<br>underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their&para;<br>value and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.&para;<br>The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, decided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable&para;<br>here because it “does not apply to ‘short interruption[s] of&para;<br>navigability in a stream otherwise navigable.’ ” 355 Mont.,&para;<br>at 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).&para;<br>This was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass­&para;<br>ing that the facts of the case concerned “long reaches&para;<br>with particular characteristics of navigability or non­&para;<br>navigability” rather than “short interruption[s].” Id., at&para;<br>77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a&para;<br>different outcome if a “short interruption” were concerned.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments&para;<br>so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,&para;<br>navigable reach for purposes of title under the equal­&para;<br>footing doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in&para;<br>this case would meet that standard, and one—the Great&para;<br>Falls reach—certainly would not. As an initial matter, the&para;<br>kinds of considerations that would define a de minimis&para;<br>exception to the segment-by-segment approach would be&para;<br>those related to principles of ownership and title, such as&para;<br>inadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,&para;<br>or worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See&para;<br>Heller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.&para;<br>Rev. 621, 682–684 (1998) (explaining that dividing property into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervailing legal mechanisms, “paralyze the alienability of scarce&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>resources . . . or diminish their value too drastically”). An&para;<br>analysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied. A&para;<br>comparison of the nonnavigable segment’s length to the&para;<br>overall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply&para;<br>irrelevant to the issue at hand.&para;<br>A number of the segments at issue here are both dis­&para;<br>crete, as defined by physical features characteristic of&para;<br>navigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a&para;<br>matter of administrability for title purposes. This is best&para;<br>illustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long&para;<br>and has distinct drops including five waterfalls and con­&para;<br>tinuous rapids in between. There is plenty of reason to&para;<br>doubt that reach’s navigability based on the presence of&para;<br>the series of falls. There is also reason to think that title&para;<br>to that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadmin­&para;<br>istrable. Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent&para;<br>in the amount of $41 million for PPL’s various hydroelec­&para;<br>tric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are&para;<br>along the Great Falls reach.&para;<br>Applying its “short interruptions” approach, the Mon­&para;<br>tana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach&para;<br>was navigable because it could be managed by way of land&para;<br>route portage. 355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 447,&para;<br>449. The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis&para;<br>and Clark’s expedition. Ibid. Yet that very portage re­&para;<br>veals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court’s&para;<br>analysis. Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and&para;<br>Clark transported their supplies and some small canoes&para;<br>about 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and&para;<br>probably more. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126–152;&para;<br>9 Journals of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition 173; Dear&para;<br>Brother 109. Even if portage were to take travelers only&para;<br>one day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the&para;<br>need to bypass the river segment, all because that part of&para;<br>the river is nonnavigable. Thus, the Montana Supreme&para;<br>Court was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reach and other stretches of the rivers in question, that&para;<br>portages “are not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigabil­&para;<br>ity.” 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. In most cases,&para;<br>they are, because they require transportation over land&para;<br>rather than over the water. This is such a case, at least as&para;<br>to the Great Falls reach.&para;<br>In reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage&para;<br>does not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme&para;<br>Court misapplied this Court’s decision in The Montello, 20&para;<br>Wall. 430. See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. The&para;<br>consideration of portage in The Montello was for a differ­&para;<br>ent purpose. The Court did not seek to determine whether&para;<br>the river in question was navigable for title purposes but&para;<br>instead whether it was navigable for purposes of deter­&para;<br>mining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the&para;<br>Federal Government. 20 Wall., at 439, 445. The primary&para;<br>focus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact&para;<br>but upon whether the river was a “navigable water of the&para;<br>United States.” Id., at 439, 443. The latter inquiry is&para;<br>doctrinally distinct. It turns upon whether the river&para;<br>“forms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a&para;<br>continued highway over which commerce is, or may be,&para;<br>carried with other States or foreign countries in the cus­&para;<br>tomary modes in which such commerce is conducted by&para;<br>water.” Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557).&para;<br>It is language similar to “continued highway” that Mon­&para;<br>tana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu&para;<br>of the Court’s established segmentation approach. Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 42–43, n. 16.&para;<br>The Montello reasonably concluded that the portages&para;<br>required in that case did not prevent the river from being&para;<br>part of a channel of interstate commerce. Portages con­&para;<br>tinued that channel because goods could be successfully&para;<br>transported interstate, in part upon the waters in ques­&para;<br>tion. This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats&para;<br>at places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>portions of the river. 20 Wall., at 445. Here, by contrast,&para;<br>the question regards ownership of the bed under river&para;<br>segments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling&para;<br>them “interruptions in the navigation,” 355 Mont., at 442,&para;<br>229 P. 3d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable. The&para;<br>reasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control&para;<br>the outcome where the quite different concerns of the&para;<br>riverbed title context apply.&para;<br>Having clarified that portages may defeat navigability&para;<br>for title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls&para;<br>reach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could&para;<br>demonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.&para;<br>Montana does not dispute that overland portage was&para;<br>necessary to traverse that reach. Indeed, the State admits&para;<br>“the falls themselves were not passable by boat at state­&para;<br>hood.” Brief for Respondent 10. And the trial court noted&para;<br>the falls had never been navigated. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 137. Based on these statements, this Court now con­&para;<br>cludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court’s decision,&para;<br>that the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head&para;<br>of the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable&para;<br>for purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing&para;<br>doctrine.&para;<br>This Court also determines, based on evidence in the&para;<br>record, that there is a significant likelihood that some of&para;<br>the other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal&para;<br>test of navigability for the purpose of determining title.&para;<br>For example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork&para;<br>River, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the&para;<br>sole evidence for nonnavigability “consists of conclusory&para;<br>statements . . . without any specific factual support.” 355&para;<br>Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. In fact, PPL introduced a&para;<br>report of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1891,&para;<br>two years after Montana’s date of statehood, documenting&para;<br>that the portion of the Clark Fork river between Missoula&para;<br>and Lake Pend Oreille (which includes the location of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL’s Thompson Falls facility) had a fall of about 1,100&para;<br>feet in 250 miles and “is a mountain torrential stream, full&para;<br>of rocks, rapids, and falls, . . . utterly unnavigable, and incapable of being made navigable except at an enormous&para;<br>cost.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379–380&para;<br>(Docket No. 169). The report based its conclusions on&para;<br>various failed attempts to navigate the river. It found the&para;<br>Thompson Falls “a complete obstruction to navigation”&para;<br>and the river around that area “exceedingly rapid, rough,&para;<br>and full of rocks.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This&para;<br>was consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.&para;<br>The decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private&para;<br>parties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls&para;<br>and declared the river at that place “was and is a non­&para;<br>navigable stream incapable of carrying the products of&para;<br>the country in the usual manner of water transportation.”&para;<br>Steele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,&para;<br>1910), p. 1; see App. 380–381 (Docket No. 169). While the&para;<br>ultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river&para;<br>stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the&para;<br>Montana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence&para;<br>should be assessed in light of the principles discussed in&para;<br>this opinion.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter&para;<br>of law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,&para;<br>primarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is&para;<br>not inherent in a court’s consideration of such evidence,&para;<br>but the evidence must be confined to that which shows the&para;<br>river could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a&para;<br>realistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state­&para;<br>hood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of&para;<br>statehood, and it concerns the river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade&para;<br>and travel,’ ” rather than for other purposes. See Utah,&para;<br>283 U. S., at 75–76. Mere use by initial explorers or trap­&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL MONTANA, LLC v.

See Oregon, 295 U. S., at&para;<br>20–21 (evidence that “trappers appear to have waded or&para;<br>walked” through the river, dragging their boats rather&para;<br>than floating them, had “no bearing on navigability”).&para;<br>True, river segments are navigable not only if they&para;<br>“[were] used,” but also if they “[were] susceptible of being&para;<br>used,” as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.&para;<br>Utah, supra, at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Evidence of recreational use, depending on its nature, may&para;<br>bear upon susceptibility of commercial use at the time of&para;<br>statehood. See Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S., at&para;<br>416 (“[P]ersonal or private use by boats demonstrates the&para;<br>availability of the stream for the simpler types of commer­&para;<br>cial navigation”); Utah, 283 U. S., at 82 (fact that actual&para;<br>use has “been more of a private nature than of a public,&para;<br>commercial sort . . . cannot be regarded as controlling”).&para;<br>Similarly, poststatehood evidence, depending on its na­&para;<br>ture, may show susceptibility of use at the time of state­&para;<br>hood. See id., at 82–83 (“[E]xtensive and continued&para;<br>[historical] use for commercial purposes” may be the “most&para;<br>persuasive” form of evidence, but the “crucial question” is&para;<br>the potential for such use at the time of statehood, rather&para;<br>than “the mere manner or extent of actual use”).&para;<br>Evidence of present-day use may be considered to the&para;<br>extent it informs the historical determination whether the&para;<br>river segment was susceptible of use for commercial navi­&para;<br>gation at the time of statehood. For the susceptibility&para;<br>analysis, it must be determined whether trade and travel&para;<br>could have been conducted “in the customary modes of&para;<br>trade and travel on water,” over the relevant river seg­&para;<br>ment “in [its] natural and ordinary condition.” Id., at 76&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). At a minimum, there­&para;<br>fore, the party seeking to use present-day evidence for title&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>purposes must show: (1) the watercraft are meaningfully&para;<br>similar to those in customary use for trade and travel&para;<br>at the time of statehood; and (2) the river’s poststatehood&para;<br>condition is not materially different from its physical condition at statehood. See also Oregon, supra, at 18 (finding that scientific and historical evidence showed that&para;<br>the physical condition of particular water bodies had not&para;<br>varied substantially since statehood in a way that might&para;<br>affect navigation). If modern watercraft permit navigabil­&para;<br>ity where the historical watercraft would not, or if the&para;<br>river has changed in ways that substantially improve its&para;<br>navigability, then the evidence of present-day use has&para;<br>little or no bearing on navigability at statehood.&para;<br>The Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indica­&para;<br>tion that it made these necessary findings. The court&para;<br>concluded the evidence of present-day use of the Madison&para;<br>was probative of its susceptibility of use at statehood, but&para;<br>there is no apparent basis for its conclusion. 355 Mont., at&para;<br>442–443, 438–439, 229 P. 3d, at 449, 446–447. The court&para;<br>did not find the watercraft similar to those used at the&para;<br>time of statehood, and the State’s evidence of present-day&para;<br>use for recreational fishing did not indicate what types of&para;<br>boats are now used. App. 46–48. Modern recreational&para;<br>fishing boats, including inflatable rafts and lightweight&para;<br>canoes or kayaks, may be able to navigate waters much&para;<br>more shallow or with rockier beds than the boats custom­&para;<br>arily used for trade and travel at statehood.&para;<br>As to the river’s physical condition, the Montana Su­&para;<br>preme Court did not assess with care PPL’s evidence&para;<br>about changes to the river’s flow and the location and&para;<br>pattern of its channel since statehood. The affidavit of&para;<br>PPL’s expert in fluvial geomorphology—the study of river­&para;<br>related landforms—at least suggests that as a result of&para;<br>PPL’s dams, the river has become “less torrential” in high&para;<br>flow periods and less shallow in low flow periods.

Its roots&para;<br>trace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in&para;<br>the English common law on public navigation and fishing&para;<br>rights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this coun­&para;<br>try. See Coeur d’Alene, 521 U. S., at 284–286; Illinois&para;<br>Central R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 458 (1892);&para;<br>D.

Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which&para;<br>is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of&para;<br>riverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter&para;<br>of state law, see Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois&para;<br>Central, a Supreme Court public trust case, was “ ‘neces­&para;<br>sarily a statement of Illinois law’ ”); Appleby v.

While equal­&para;<br>footing cases have noted that the State takes title to the&para;<br>navigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see&para;<br>Shively, 152 U.
