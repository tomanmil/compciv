Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN&para;<br>No. 09–150.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 5, 2010—Decided February 28, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Michigan police dispatched to a gas station parking lot found Anthony&para;<br>Covington mortally wounded. Covington told them that he had been&para;<br>shot by respondent Bryant outside Bryant’s house and had then&para;<br>driven himself to the lot. At trial, which occurred before Crawford v.&para;<br>Washington, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813,&para;<br>were decided, the officers testified about what Covington said. Bry&para;<br>ant was found guilty of, inter alia, second-degree murder. Ulti&para;<br>mately, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding&para;<br>that the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause, as explained in&para;<br>Crawford and Davis, rendered Covington’s statements inadmissible&para;<br>testimonial hearsay.&para;<br>Held: Covington’s identification and description of the shooter and the&para;<br>location of the shooting were not testimonial statements because they&para;<br>had a “primary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an on&para;<br>going emergency.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. Therefore, their admis&para;<br>sion at Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Pp. 5–&para;<br>32.&para;<br>(a) In Crawford, this Court held that in order for testimonial evi&para;<br>dence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment “demands . . . unavail&para;<br>ability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.” 541 U. S., at&para;<br>68. Crawford did not “spell out a comprehensive definition of ‘testi&para;<br>monial,’ ” but it noted that testimonial evidence includes, among&para;<br>other things, “police interrogations.” Ibid. Thus, Sylvia Crawford’s&para;<br>statements during a station-house interrogation about a stabbing&para;<br>were testimonial, and their admission when her husband, the ac&para;<br>cused, had “no opportunity” for cross-examination due to spousal&para;<br>privilege made out a Sixth Amendment violation. In Davis and&para;<br>Hammon, both domestic violence cases, the Court explained that&para;<br>“[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the [in&para;<br>terrogation’s] primary purpose . . . is to enable police assistance to&para;<br>meet an ongoing emergency,” but they “are testimonial when the cir&para;<br>cumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emer&para;<br>gency, and that the [interrogation’s] primary purpose is to establish&para;<br>or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecu&para;<br>tion.” 547 U. S., at 822. Thus, a recording of a 911 call describing an&para;<br>ongoing domestic disturbance was nontestimonial in Davis, where&para;<br>the victim’s “elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve&para;<br>[the ongoing] emergency,” and the statements were not formal. Id.,&para;<br>at 827. But the statements in Hammon were testimonial, where the&para;<br>victim was interviewed after the event in a room separate from her&para;<br>husband and “deliberately recounted, in response to police question&para;<br>ing” the past events. Id., at 830. Here, the context is a nondomestic&para;<br>dispute, with the “ongoing emergency” extending beyond an initial&para;<br>victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public.&para;<br>This context requires additional clarification of what Davis meant by&para;<br>“the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assis&para;<br>tance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(b) To make the “primary purpose” determination, the Court must&para;<br>objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter be&para;<br>tween the individual and the police occurs and the parties’ state&para;<br>ments and actions. Pp. 12–23.&para;<br>(1) The primary purpose inquiry is objective. The circumstances&para;<br>in which an encounter occurs—e.g., at or near a crime scene versus at&para;<br>a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards—are&para;<br>clearly matters of objective fact. And the relevant inquiry into the&para;<br>parties’ statements and actions is not the subjective or actual purpose&para;<br>of the particular parties, but the purpose that reasonable partici&para;<br>pants would have had, as ascertained from the parties’ statements&para;<br>and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.&para;<br>P. 13.&para;<br>(2) The existence of an “ongoing emergency” at the time of the&para;<br>encounter is among the most important circumstances informing the&para;<br>interrogation’s “primary purpose.” See, e.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 828–&para;<br>830. An emergency focuses the participants not on “prov[ing] past&para;<br>events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,” id., at 822,&para;<br>but on “end[ing] a threatening situation,” id., at 832. The Michigan&para;<br>Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists&para;<br>and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry. An assessment&para;<br>of whether an emergency threatening the police and public is ongoing&para;<br>cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat to the first victim has&para;<br>been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public&para;<br>may continue. The State Supreme Court also did not appreciate that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>an emergency’s duration and scope may depend in part on the type of&para;<br>weapon involved; the court below relied on Davis and Hammon,&para;<br>where the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of an&para;<br>emergency involving a gun. A victim’s medical condition is important&para;<br>to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the&para;<br>victim’s ability to have any purpose at all in responding to police&para;<br>questions and on the likelihood that any such purpose would be a tes&para;<br>timonial one. It also provides important context for first responders&para;<br>to judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the&para;<br>victim, themselves, and the public. This does not mean that an&para;<br>emergency lasts the entire time that a perpetrator is on the loose, but&para;<br>trial courts can determine in the first instance when an interrogation&para;<br>transitions from nontestimonial to testimonial. Finally, whether an&para;<br>ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor informing the ultimate&para;<br>inquiry regarding an interrogation’s “primary purpose.” Another is&para;<br>the encounter’s informality. Formality suggests the absence of an&para;<br>emergency, but informality does not necessarily indicate the presence&para;<br>of an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent. The facts here—&para;<br>the questioning occurred in an exposed, public area, before emer&para;<br>gency medical services arrived, and in a disorganized fashion—&para;<br>distinguish this case from Crawford’s formal station-house interroga&para;<br>tion. Pp. 14–20.&para;<br>(3) The statements and actions of both the declarant and interro&para;<br>gators also provide objective evidence of the interrogation’s primary&para;<br>purpose. Looking to the contents of both the questions and the an&para;<br>swers ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to&para;<br>one participant, since both interrogators and declarants may have&para;<br>mixed motives. Police officers’ dual responsibilities as both first re&para;<br>sponders and criminal investigators may lead them to act with differ&para;<br>ent motives simultaneously or in quick succession. And during an&para;<br>ongoing emergency, victims may want the threat to end, but may not&para;<br>envision prosecution. Alternatively, a severely injured victim may&para;<br>have no purpose at all in answering questions. Taking into account&para;<br>such injuries does not make the inquiry subjective. The inquiry still&para;<br>focuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in&para;<br>the actual victim’s circumstances, which prominently include the vic&para;<br>tim’s physical state. Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of&para;<br>the interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all par&para;<br>ticipants is also consistent with this Court’s prior holdings. E.g.,&para;<br>Davis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1. Pp. 20–23.&para;<br>(c) Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the state&para;<br>ments and actions of Covington and the police objectively indicate&para;<br>that the interrogation’s “primary purpose” was “to enable police as&para;<br>sistance to meet an ongoing emergency,” 547 U. S., at 822. The cir&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cumstances of the interrogation involved an armed shooter, whose&para;<br>motive for and location after the shooting were unknown and who&para;<br>had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few min&para;<br>utes of the location where police found Covington. Unlike the emer&para;<br>gencies in Davis and Hammon, this dispute’s potential scope and&para;<br>thus the emergency encompassed a potential threat to the police and&para;<br>the public. And since this case involved a gun, the physical separa&para;<br>tion that was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was not&para;<br>necessarily sufficient to end the threat here. Informed by the circum&para;<br>stances of the ongoing emergency, the Court now turns to determin&para;<br>ing the “primary purpose of the interrogation” as evidenced by the&para;<br>statements and actions of Covington and the police. The circum&para;<br>stances of the encounter provide important context for understanding&para;<br>Covington’s statements to the police. When he responded to their&para;<br>questions, he was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a&para;<br>mortal gunshot wound, and his answers were punctuated with ques&para;<br>tions about when emergency medical services would arrive. Thus,&para;<br>this Court cannot say that a person in his situation would have had a&para;<br>“primary purpose” “to establish or prove past events potentially rele&para;<br>vant to later criminal prosecution.” Ibid. For their part, the police&para;<br>responded to a call that a man had been shot. They did not know&para;<br>why, where, or when the shooting had occurred; the shooter’s loca&para;<br>tion; or anything else about the crime. They asked exactly the type of&para;<br>questions necessary to enable them “to meet an ongoing emergency.”&para;<br>Ibid. Nothing in Covington’s responses indicated to the police that&para;<br>there was no emergency or that the emergency had ended. Finally,&para;<br>this situation is more similar to the informal, harried 911 call in&para;<br>Davis than to the structured, station-house interview in Crawford.&para;<br>The officers all arrived at different times; asked, upon arrival, what&para;<br>had happened; and generally did not conduct a structured interroga&para;<br>tion. The informality suggests that their primary purpose was to ad&para;<br>dress what they considered to be an ongoing emergency, and the cir&para;<br>cumstances lacked a formality that would have alerted Covington to&para;<br>or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his state&para;<br>ments.

RICHARD PERRY &para;<br>&para;<br>BRYANT &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT&para;<br>&para;<br>OF MICHIGAN&para;<br>&para;<br>[February 28, 2011] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>At respondent Richard Bryant’s trial, the court admitted&para;<br>statements that the victim, Anthony Covington, made to&para;<br>police officers who discovered him mortally wounded in a&para;<br>gas station parking lot. A jury convicted Bryant of, inter&para;<br>alia, second-degree murder. 483 Mich. 132, 137, 768&para;<br>N. W. 2d 65, 67–68 (2009). On appeal, the Supreme Court&para;<br>of Michigan held that the Sixth Amendment’s Confronta&para;<br>tion Clause, as explained in our decisions in Crawford v.&para;<br>Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), and Davis v. Washington,&para;<br>547 U. S. 813 (2006), rendered Covington’s statements&para;<br>inadmissible testimonial hearsay, and the court reversed&para;<br>Bryant’s conviction. 483 Mich., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at&para;<br>79. We granted the State’s petition for a writ of certiorari&para;<br>to consider whether the Confrontation Clause barred the&para;<br>admission at trial of Covington’s statements to the police.&para;<br>We hold that the circumstances of the interaction between&para;<br>Covington and the police objectively indicate that the&para;<br>“primary purpose of the interrogation” was “to enable&para;<br>police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Davis,&para;<br>547 U. S., at 822. Therefore, Covington’s identification&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and description of the shooter and the location of the&para;<br>shooting were not testimonial statements, and their ad&para;<br>mission at Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause. We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of&para;<br>Michigan and remand.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Around 3:25 a.m. on April 29, 2001, Detroit, Michigan&para;<br>police officers responded to a radio dispatch indicating&para;<br>that a man had been shot. At the scene, they found the&para;<br>victim, Anthony Covington, lying on the ground next to his&para;<br>car in a gas station parking lot. Covington had a gunshot&para;<br>wound to his abdomen, appeared to be in great pain, and&para;<br>spoke with difficulty.&para;<br>The police asked him “what had happened, who had&para;<br>shot him, and where the shooting had occurred.” 483&para;<br>Mich., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Covington stated that&para;<br>“Rick” shot him at around 3 a.m. Id., at 136, and n. 1, 768&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 67, and n. 1. He also indicated that he had a&para;<br>conversation with Bryant, whom he recognized based on&para;<br>his voice, through the back door of Bryant’s house. Cov&para;<br>ington explained that when he turned to leave, he was&para;<br>shot through the door and then drove to the gas station,&para;<br>where police found him.&para;<br>Covington’s conversation with the police ended within 5&para;<br>to 10 minutes when emergency medical services arrived.&para;<br>Covington was transported to a hospital and died within&para;<br>hours. The police left the gas station after speaking with&para;<br>Covington, called for backup, and traveled to Bryant’s&para;<br>house. They did not find Bryant there but did find blood&para;<br>and a bullet on the back porch and an apparent bullet hole&para;<br>in the back door. Police also found Covington’s wallet and&para;<br>identification outside the house.&para;<br>At trial, which occurred prior to our decisions in Craw&para;<br>ford, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis, 547 U. S. 813, the police&para;<br>officers who spoke with Covington at the gas station testi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fied about what Covington had told them. The jury re&para;<br>turned a guilty verdict on charges of second-degree&para;<br>murder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and pos&para;<br>session of a firearm during the commission of a felony.&para;<br>Bryant appealed, and the Michigan Court of Appeals&para;<br>affirmed his conviction. No. 247039, 2004 WL 1882661&para;<br>(Aug. 24, 2004) (per curiam). Bryant then appealed to the&para;<br>Supreme Court of Michigan, arguing that the trial court&para;<br>erred in admitting Covington’s statements to the police.&para;<br>The Supreme Court of Michigan eventually remanded the&para;<br>case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of&para;<br>our 2006 decision in Davis. 477 Mich. 902, 722 N. W. 2d&para;<br>797 (2006). On remand, the Court of Appeals again af&para;<br>firmed, holding that Covington’s statements were properly&para;<br>admitted because they were not testimonial. No. 247039,&para;<br>2007 WL 675471 (Mar. 6, 2007) (per curiam). Bryant&para;<br>again appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, which&para;<br>reversed his conviction. 483 Mich. 132, 768 N. W. 2d 65.&para;<br>Before the Supreme Court of Michigan, Bryant argued&para;<br>that Covington’s statements to the police were testimonial&para;<br>under Crawford and Davis and were therefore inadmissi&para;<br>ble. The State, on the other hand, argued that the state&para;<br>ments were admissible as “excited utterances” under the&para;<br>Michigan Rules of Evidence. 483 Mich., at 142, and n. 6,&para;<br>768 N. W. 2d, at 70, and n. 6. There was no dispute that&para;<br>Covington was unavailable at trial and Bryant had no&para;<br>prior opportunity to cross-examine him. The court there&para;<br>fore assessed whether Covington’s statements to the police&para;<br>identifying and describing the shooter and the time and&para;<br>location of the shooting were testimonial hearsay for&para;<br>purposes of the Confrontation Clause. The court con&para;<br>cluded that the circumstances “clearly indicate that the&para;<br>‘primary purpose’ of the questioning was to establish the&para;<br>facts of an event that had already occurred; the ‘primary&para;<br>purpose’ was not to enable police assistance to meet an&para;<br>ongoing emergency.” Id., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. The&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>court explained that, in its view, Covington was describing&para;<br>past events and as such, his “primary purpose in making&para;<br>these statements to the police . . . was . . . to tell the police&para;<br>who had committed the crime against him, where the&para;<br>crime had been committed, and where the police could find&para;<br>the criminal.” Id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Noting&para;<br>that the officers’ actions did not suggest that they per&para;<br>ceived an ongoing emergency at the gas station, the court&para;<br>held that there was in fact no ongoing emergency. Id., at&para;<br>145–147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–73. The court distinguished&para;<br>the facts of this case from those in Davis, where we held a&para;<br>declarant’s statements in a 911 call to be nontestimonial.&para;<br>It instead analogized this case to Hammon v. Indiana,&para;<br>which we decided jointly with Davis and in which we&para;<br>found testimonial a declarant’s statements to police just&para;<br>after an assault. See 547 U. S., at 829–832. Based on this&para;<br>analysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the&para;<br>admission of Covington’s statements constituted prejudi&para;<br>cial plain error warranting reversal and ordered a new&para;<br>trial. 483 Mich., at 151–153, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75–76. The&para;<br>court did not address whether, absent a Confrontation&para;<br>Clause bar, the statements’ admission would have been&para;<br>otherwise consistent with Michigan’s hearsay rules or due&para;<br>process.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the question whether the&para;<br>victim’s statements would have been admissible as “dying declarations”&para;<br>was not properly before it because at the preliminary examination, the&para;<br>prosecution, after first invoking both the dying declaration and excited&para;<br>utterance hearsay exceptions, established the factual foundation only&para;<br>for admission of the statements as excited utterances. The trial court&para;<br>ruled that the statements were admissible as excited utterances and&para;<br>did not address their admissibility as dying declarations. 483 Mich., at&para;<br>153–154, 768 N. W. 2d, at 76–77. This occurred prior to our 2004&para;<br>decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, where we first&para;<br>suggested that dying declarations, even if testimonial, might be admis&para;<br>sible as a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 56,&para;<br>n. 6; see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358–359 (2008). We&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Id., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at 79&para;<br>(opinion of Weaver, J.); id., at 157–158, 768 N. W. 2d, at&para;<br>79 (opinion of Corrigan, J.). Justice Corrigan’s dissent&para;<br>explained that the time and space between “the onset of&para;<br>an emergency and statements about that emergency&para;<br>clearly must be considered in context.” Id., at 161, 768&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 80. Justice Corrigan concluded that the&para;<br>objective circumstances of Covington’s interaction with&para;<br>police rendered this case more similar to the nontestimo&para;<br>nial statements in Davis than to the testimonial state&para;<br>ments in Crawford. 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N. W. 2d,&para;<br>at 82.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to determine whether the Con&para;<br>frontation Clause barred admission of Covington’s state&para;<br>ments. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>states: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall&para;<br>enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses&para;<br>against him.” The Fourteenth Amendment renders the&para;<br>Clause binding on the States. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S.&para;<br>400, 403 (1965). In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66&para;<br>(1980), we explained that the confrontation right does not&para;<br>bar admission of statements of an unavailable witness if&para;<br>the statements “bea[r] adequate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>noted in Crawford that we “need not decide in this case whether the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying&para;<br>declarations.” 541 U. S., at 56, n. 6. Because of the State’s failure to&para;<br>preserve its argument with regard to dying declarations, we similarly&para;<br>need not decide that question here. See also post, p. __ (GINSBURG, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We held that reliability can be established if “the evidence&para;<br>falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,” or if it does&para;<br>not fall within such an exception, then if it bears “particu&para;<br>larized guarantees of trustworthiness.” Ibid.&para;<br>Nearly a quarter century later, we decided Crawford v.&para;<br>Washington, 541 U. S. 36. Petitioner Michael Crawford&para;<br>was prosecuted for stabbing a man who had allegedly&para;<br>attempted to rape his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia witnessed the&para;<br>stabbing, and later that night, after she and her husband&para;<br>were both arrested, police interrogated her about the&para;<br>incident. At trial, Sylvia Crawford claimed spousal privi&para;<br>lege and did not testify, but the State introduced a tape&para;<br>recording of Sylvia’s statement to the police in an effort to&para;<br>prove that the stabbing was not in self-defense, as Michael&para;<br>Crawford claimed. The Washington Supreme Court af&para;<br>firmed Crawford’s conviction because it found Sylvia’s&para;<br>statement to be reliable, as required under Ohio v. Rob&para;<br>erts. We reversed, overruling Ohio v. Roberts. 541 U. S.,&para;<br>at 60–68; see also Davis, 547 U. S., at 825, n. 4.&para;<br>Crawford examined the common-law history of the&para;<br>confrontation right and explained that “the principal evil&para;<br>at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the&para;<br>civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its&para;<br>use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the ac&para;<br>cused.” 541 U. S., at 50. We noted that in England, pre&para;<br>trial examinations of suspects and witnesses by govern&para;<br>ment officials “were sometimes read in court in lieu of live&para;<br>testimony.” Id., at 43. In light of this history, we empha&para;<br>sized the word “witnesses” in the Sixth Amendment, defin&para;<br>ing it as “those who ‘bear testimony.’ ” Id., at 51 (quoting&para;<br>2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English&para;<br>Language (1828)). We defined “testimony” as “ ‘ [a] solemn&para;<br>declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of estab&para;<br>lishing or proving some fact.’ ” 541 U. S., at 51 (quoting&para;<br>Webster). We noted that “[a]n accuser who makes a for&para;<br>mal statement to government officers bears testimony in a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an&para;<br>acquaintance does not.” Ibid. We therefore limited the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause’s reach to testimonial statements&para;<br>and held that in order for testimonial evidence to be ad&para;<br>missible, the Sixth Amendment “demands what the com&para;<br>mon law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity&para;<br>for cross-examination.” Id., at 68. Although “leav[ing] for&para;<br>another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive defini&para;<br>tion of ‘testimonial,’ ” Crawford noted that “at a minimum”&para;<br>it includes “prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,&para;<br>before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and . . . police&para;<br>interrogations.” Ibid. Under this reasoning, we held that&para;<br>Sylvia Crawford’s statements in the course of police ques&para;<br>tioning were testimonial and that their admission when&para;<br>Michael Crawford “had no opportunity to cross-examine&para;<br>her” due to spousal privilege was “sufficient to make out a&para;<br>violation of the Sixth Amendment.” Ibid.&para;<br>In 2006, the Court in Davis v. Washington and Hammon&para;<br>v. Indiana, 547 U. S. 813, took a further step to “deter&para;<br>mine more precisely which police interrogations produce&para;<br>testimony” and therefore implicate a Confrontation Clause&para;<br>bar. Id., at 822. We explained that when Crawford said&para;<br>that&para;<br>“ ‘interrogations by law enforcement officers fall&para;<br>squarely within [the] class’ of testimonial hearsay, we&para;<br>had immediately in mind (for that was the case before&para;<br>us) interrogations solely directed at establishing the&para;<br>facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide&para;<br>evidence to convict) the perpetrator. The product of&para;<br>such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing&para;<br>signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory&para;<br>(and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is tes&para;<br>timonial.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 826.&para;<br>We thus made clear in Davis that not all those questioned&para;<br>by the police are witnesses and not all “interrogations by&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law enforcement officers,” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 53, are&para;<br>subject to the Confrontation Clause.2&para;<br>Davis and Hammon were both domestic violence cases.&para;<br>In Davis, Michelle McCottry made the statements at issue&para;<br>to a 911 operator during a domestic disturbance with&para;<br>Adrian Davis, her former boyfriend. McCottry told the&para;<br>operator, “ ‘He’s here jumpin’ on me again,’ ” and, “ ‘He’s&para;<br>usin’ his fists.’ ” 547 U. S., at 817. The operator then&para;<br>asked McCottry for Davis’ first and last names and middle&para;<br>initial, and at that point in the conversation McCottry&para;<br>reported that Davis had fled in a car. Id., at 818.&para;<br>McCottry did not appear at Davis’ trial, and the State&para;<br>introduced the recording of her conversation with the 911&para;<br>operator. Id., at 819.&para;<br>In Hammon, decided along with Davis, police responded&para;<br>to a domestic disturbance call at the home of Amy and&para;<br>Hershel Hammon, where they found Amy alone on the&para;<br>front porch. Ibid. She appeared “ ‘somewhat frightened,’ ”&para;<br>but told them “ ‘nothing was the matter.’ ” Ibid. (quoting&para;<br>Hammon v. State, 829 N. E. 2d 444, 446–447 (Ind. 2005)).&para;<br>She gave the police permission to enter the house, where&para;<br>they saw a gas heating unit with the glass front shattered&para;<br>on the floor. One officer remained in the kitchen with&para;<br>Hershel, while another officer talked to Amy in the living&para;<br>room about what had happened. Hershel tried several&para;<br>times to participate in Amy’s conversation with the police&para;<br>and became angry when the police required him to stay&para;<br>separated from Amy. 547 U. S., at 819–820. The police&para;<br>asked Amy to fill out and sign a battery affidavit. She&para;<br>wrote: “ ‘Broke our Furnace &amp; shoved me down on the floor&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 We noted in Crawford that “[w]e use the term ‘interrogation’ in its&para;<br>colloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense,” and that “[j]ust as&para;<br>various definitions of ‘testimonial’ exist, one can imagine various&para;<br>definitions of ‘interrogation,’ and we need not select among them in this&para;<br>case.” 541 U. S., at 53, n. 4. Davis did not abandon those qualifica&para;<br>tions; nor do we do so here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Amy did not appear at Hershel’s trial, so the police&para;<br>officers who spoke with her testified as to her statements&para;<br>and authenticated the affidavit. Ibid. The trial court&para;<br>admitted the affidavit as a present sense impression and&para;<br>admitted the oral statements as excited utterances under&para;<br>state hearsay rules. Ibid. The Indiana Supreme Court&para;<br>affirmed Hammon’s conviction, holding that Amy’s oral&para;<br>statements were not testimonial and that the admission of&para;<br>the affidavit, although erroneous because the affidavit was&para;<br>testimonial, was harmless. Hammon v. State, 829 N. E.&para;<br>2d, at 458–459.&para;<br>To address the facts of both cases, we expanded upon&para;<br>the meaning of “testimonial” that we first employed in&para;<br>Crawford and discussed the concept of an ongoing emer&para;<br>gency. We explained:&para;<br>“Statements are nontestimonial when made in the&para;<br>course of police interrogation under circumstances ob&para;<br>jectively indicating that the primary purpose of the&para;<br>interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an&para;<br>ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the&para;<br>circumstances objectively indicate that there is no&para;<br>such ongoing emergency, and that the primary pur&para;<br>pose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past&para;<br>events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecu&para;<br>tion.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822.&para;<br>Examining the Davis and Hammon statements in light of&para;<br>those definitions, we held that the statements at issue&para;<br>in Davis were nontestimonial and the statements in&para;<br>Hammon were testimonial. We distinguished the state&para;<br>ments in Davis from the testimonial statements in Craw&para;<br>ford on several grounds, including that the victim in Davis&para;<br>was “speaking about events as they were actually happen&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing, rather than ‘describ[ing] past events,’ ” that there was&para;<br>an ongoing emergency, that the “elicited statements were&para;<br>necessary to be able to resolve the present emergency,”&para;<br>and that the statements were not formal. 547 U. S., at&para;<br>827. In Hammon, on the other hand, we held that, “[i]t is&para;<br>entirely clear from the circumstances that the interroga&para;<br>tion was part of an investigation into possibly criminal&para;<br>past conduct.” Id., at 829. There was “no emergency in&para;<br>progress.” Ibid. The officer questioning Amy “was not&para;<br>seeking to determine . . . ‘what is happening,’ but rather&para;<br>‘what happened.’ ” Id., at 830. It was “formal enough”&para;<br>that the police interrogated Amy in a room separate from&para;<br>her husband where, “some time after the events described&para;<br>were over,” she “deliberately recounted, in response to&para;<br>police questioning, how potentially criminal past events&para;<br>began and progressed.” Ibid. Because her statements&para;<br>“were neither a cry for help nor the provision of informa&para;<br>tion enabling officers immediately to end a threatening&para;<br>situation,” id., at 832, we held that they were testimonial.&para;<br>Davis did not “attemp[t] to produce an exhaustive classi&para;<br>fication of all conceivable statements—or even all conceiv&para;<br>able statements in response to police interrogation—as&para;<br>either testimonial or nontestimonial.” Id., at 822.3 The&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Davis&para;<br>&para;<br>explained that 911 operators “may at least be agents of&para;<br>law enforcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers,” and&para;<br>therefore “consider[ed] their acts to be acts of the police” for purposes of&para;<br>the opinion. 547 U. S., at 823, n. 2. Davis explicitly reserved the&para;<br>question of “whether and when statements made to someone other than&para;<br>law enforcement personnel are ‘testimonial.’ ” Ibid. We have no need to&para;<br>decide that question in this case either because Covington’s statements&para;<br>were made to police officers. The dissent also claims to reserve this&para;<br>question, see post, at 3, n. 1 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), but supports one of&para;<br>its arguments by relying on King v. Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng.&para;<br>Rep. 202, 202–203 (K. B. 1779), which involved statements made by a&para;<br>child to her mother—a private citizen—just after the child had been&para;<br>sexually assaulted. See also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 69–&para;<br>70 (2004) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment) (citing King v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Crawford, 541 U.

Even where such an interroga&para;<br>tion is conducted with all good faith, introduction of the&para;<br>resulting statements at trial can be unfair to the accused&para;<br>if they are untested by cross-examination. Whether for&para;<br>mal or informal, out-of-court statements can evade the&para;<br>basic objective of the Confrontation Clause, which is to&para;<br>prevent the accused from being deprived of the opportu&para;<br>nity to cross-examine the declarant about statements&para;<br>taken for use at trial. When, as in Davis, the primary&para;<br>purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an “ongoing&para;<br>emergency,” its purpose is not to create a record for trial&para;<br>and thus is not within the scope of the Clause. But there&para;<br>may be other circumstances, aside from ongoing emergen&para;<br>cies, when a statement is not procured with a primary&para;<br>purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial&para;<br>testimony. In making the primary purpose determination,&para;<br>standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some state&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Brasier for the different proposition that “out-of-court statements made&para;<br>by someone other than the accused and not taken under oath, unlike ex&para;<br>parte depositions or affidavits, were generally not considered substan&para;<br>tive evidence upon which a conviction could be based”).&para;<br>4 Contrary to the dissent’s excited suggestion, nothing in this opinion&para;<br>casts “favorable light,” post, at 11 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), on the conduct&para;<br>of Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial or other 16th- and 17th-century English&para;<br>treason trials. The dissent is correct that such trials are “unquestiona&para;<br>bly infamous,” ibid., and our decision here confirms, rather than un&para;<br>dermines, that assessment. See also n. 17, infra. For all of the&para;<br>reasons discussed in JUSTICE THOMAS’ opinion concurring in the judg&para;<br>ment, the situation presented in this case is nothing like the circum&para;<br>stances presented by Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial. See post, p. __.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ments as reliable, will be relevant. Where no such pri&para;<br>mary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is&para;<br>the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause.5&para;<br>Deciding this case also requires further explanation of&para;<br>the “ongoing emergency” circumstance addressed in Davis.&para;<br>Because Davis and Hammon arose in the domestic vio&para;<br>lence context, that was the situation “we had immediately&para;<br>in mind (for that was the case before us).” 547 U.

We now face a new context: a nondomestic dispute,&para;<br>involving a victim found in a public location, suffering&para;<br>from a fatal gunshot wound, and a perpetrator whose&para;<br>location was unknown at the time the police located the&para;<br>victim. Thus, we confront for the first time circumstances&para;<br>in which the “ongoing emergency” discussed in Davis&para;<br>extends beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to&para;<br>the responding police and the public at large.

Id., at 822.&para;<br>An objective analysis of the circumstances of an encoun&para;<br>ter and the statements and actions of the parties to it&para;<br>provides the most accurate assessment of the “primary&para;<br>purpose of the interrogation.” The circumstances in which&para;<br>an encounter occurs—e.g., at or near the scene of the crime&para;<br>versus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency&para;<br>or afterwards—are clearly matters of objective fact. The&para;<br>statements and actions of the parties must also be objec&para;<br>tively evaluated. That is, the relevant inquiry is not the&para;<br>subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in&para;<br>a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that rea&para;<br>sonable participants would have had, as ascertained from&para;<br>the individuals’ statements and actions and the circum&para;<br>stances in which the encounter occurred.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Bryant&para;<br>&para;<br>suggests that Michigan is arguing for “a subjective analysis&para;<br>of the intent of the interrogator’s questioning.” Brief for Respondent&para;<br>12. We do not read Michigan’s brief to be arguing for a subjective&para;<br>inquiry, and any such argument would be in error. We do not under&para;<br>stand the dissent to disagree that the inquiry is objective.&para;<br>7 This approach is consistent with our rejection of subjective inquiries&para;<br>in other areas of criminal law. See, e.g., Whren v. United States, 517&para;<br>U. S. 806, 813 (1996) (refusing to evaluate Fourth Amendment reason&para;<br>ableness subjectively in light of the officers’ actual motivations); New&para;<br>York v. Quarles, 467 U.

BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>As our recent Confrontation Clause cases have ex&para;<br>plained, the existence of an “ongoing emergency” at the&para;<br>time of an encounter between an individual and the police&para;<br>is among the most important circumstances informing the&para;<br>“primary purpose” of an interrogation. See Davis, 547&para;<br>U. S., at 828–830; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 65. The exis&para;<br>tence of an ongoing emergency is relevant to determining&para;<br>the primary purpose of the interrogation because an&para;<br>emergency focuses the participants on something other&para;<br>than “prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later&para;<br>criminal prosecution.”8 Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. Rather,&para;<br>it focuses them on “end[ing] a threatening situation.” Id.,&para;<br>at 832. Implicit in Davis is the idea that because the&para;<br>prospect of fabrication in statements given for the primary&para;<br>purpose of resolving that emergency is presumably signifi&para;<br>cantly diminished, the Confrontation Clause does not&para;<br>require such statements to be subject to the crucible of&para;<br>cross-examination.&para;<br>This logic is not unlike that justifying the excited utter&para;<br>ance exception in hearsay law.

If the information the parties knew at&para;<br>the time of the encounter would lead a reasonable person to believe&para;<br>that there was an emergency, even if that belief was later proved&para;<br>incorrect, that is sufficient for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.&para;<br>The emergency is relevant to the “primary purpose of the interrogation”&para;<br>because of the effect it has on the parties’ purpose, not because of its&para;<br>actual existence.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

W. 2d, at 73; see also&para;<br>id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–72. In fact, Davis did not&para;<br>even define the extent of the emergency in that case. The&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court erroneously read Davis as decid&para;<br>ing that “the statements made after the defendant stopped&para;<br>assaulting the victim and left the premises did not occur&para;<br>during an ‘ongoing emergency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 150, n. 15,&para;<br>768 N.

We explicitly explained in&para;<br>Davis, however, that we were asked to review only the&para;<br>testimonial nature of Michelle McCottry’s initial state&para;<br>ments during the 911 call; we therefore merely assumed&para;<br>the correctness of the Washington Supreme Court’s hold&para;<br>ing that admission of her other statements was harmless,&para;<br>without deciding whether those subsequent statements&para;<br>were also made for the primary purpose of resolving an&para;<br>ongoing emergency. 547 U.

The court relied&para;<br>on Davis and Hammon, in which the assailants used their&para;<br>fists, as controlling the scope of the emergency here, which&para;<br>involved the use of a gun. The problem with that reason&para;<br>ing is clear when considered in light of the assault on Amy&para;<br>Hammon.

BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Taking into account the victim’s medical state does not,&para;<br>as the Michigan Supreme Court below thought, “rende[r]&para;<br>non-testimonial” “all statements made while the police are&para;<br>questioning a seriously injured complainant.” 483 Mich.,&para;<br>at 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74. The medical condition of the&para;<br>victim is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the&para;<br>extent that it sheds light on the ability of the victim to&para;<br>have any purpose at all in responding to police questions&para;<br>and on the likelihood that any purpose formed would&para;<br>necessarily be a testimonial one. The victim’s medical&para;<br>state also provides important context for first responders&para;<br>to judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing&para;<br>threat to the victim, themselves, and the public.&para;<br>As the Solicitor General’s brief observes, Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 20, and contrary to the&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court’s claims, 483 Mich., at 147, 768&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 73, none of this suggests that an emergency is&para;<br>ongoing in every place or even just surrounding the victim&para;<br>for the entire time that the perpetrator of a violent crime&para;<br>is on the loose. As we recognized in Davis, “a conversation&para;<br>which begins as an interrogation to determine the need for&para;<br>emergency assistance” can “evolve into testimonial state&para;<br>ments.” 547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted). This evolution may occur if, for example, a declarant&para;<br>provides police with information that makes clear that&para;<br>what appeared to be an emergency is not or is no longer an&para;<br>emergency or that what appeared to be a public threat is&para;<br>actually a private dispute. It could also occur if a perpe&para;<br>trator is disarmed, surrenders, is apprehended, or, as in&para;<br>Davis, flees with little prospect of posing a threat to the&para;<br>public. Trial courts can determine in the first instance&para;<br>when any transition from nontestimonial to testimonial&para;<br>occurs,10 and exclude “the portions of any statement that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Recognizing the evolutionary potential of a situation in criminal&para;<br>law is not unique to the Confrontation Clause context.

As Davis made clear, whether an ongoing&para;<br>emergency exists is simply one factor—albeit an important&para;<br>factor—that informs the ultimate inquiry regarding the&para;<br>“primary purpose” of an interrogation. Another factor the&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court did not sufficiently account for is&para;<br>the importance of informality in an encounter between a&para;<br>victim and police. Formality is not the sole touchstone of&para;<br>our primary purpose inquiry because, although formality&para;<br>suggests the absence of an emergency and therefore an&para;<br>increased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation&para;<br>is to “establish or prove past events potentially relevant to&para;<br>later criminal prosecution,” id., at 822, informality does&para;<br>not necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or&para;<br>the lack of testimonial intent. Cf. id., at 826 (explaining&para;<br>that Confrontation Clause requirements cannot “readily&para;<br>be evaded” by the parties deliberately keeping the written&para;<br>product of an interrogation informal “instead of having the&para;<br>declarant sign a deposition”). The court below, however,&para;<br>too readily dismissed the informality of the circumstances&para;<br>in this case in a single brief footnote and in fact seems to&para;<br>have suggested that the encounter in this case was formal.&para;<br>483 Mich., at 150, n. 16, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 16. As we&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Davis that “[j]ust as, for Fifth Amendment purposes, ‘police officers can&para;<br>and will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary&para;<br>to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions&para;<br>designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect, . . . trial&para;<br>courts will recognize the point at which, for Sixth Amendment pur&para;<br>poses, statements in response to interrogations become testimonial.”&para;<br>547 U.

BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>explain further below, the questioning in this case oc&para;<br>curred in an exposed, public area, prior to the arrival of&para;<br>emergency medical services, and in a disorganized fashion.&para;<br>All of those facts make this case distinguishable from&para;<br>the formal station-house interrogation in Crawford. See&para;<br>Davis, 547 U. S., at 827.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In addition to the circumstances in which an encounter&para;<br>occurs, the statements and actions of both the declarant&para;<br>and interrogators provide objective evidence of the pri&para;<br>mary purpose of the interrogation. See, e.g., Davis, 547&para;<br>U. S., at 827 (“[T]he nature of what was asked and an&para;<br>swered in Davis, again viewed objectively, was such that&para;<br>the elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve&para;<br>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in&para;<br>Crawford) what had happened in the past” (first emphasis&para;<br>added)). The Michigan Supreme Court did, at least&para;<br>briefly, conduct this inquiry. 483 Mich., at 144–147, 768&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 71–73.&para;<br>As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly recognized,&para;<br>id., at 140, n. 5, 768 N. W. 2d, at 69, n. 5, Davis requires a&para;<br>combined inquiry that accounts for both the declarant and&para;<br>the interrogator.11 In many instances, the primary pur&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Some&para;<br>&para;<br>portions of Davis, however, have caused confusion about&para;<br>whether the inquiry prescribes examination of one participant to the&para;<br>exclusion of the other. Davis’ language indicating that a statement’s&para;<br>testimonial or nontestimonial nature derives from “the primary pur&para;<br>pose of the interrogation,” 547 U. S., at 822 (emphasis added), could be&para;<br>read to suggest that the relevant purpose is that of the interrogator. In&para;<br>contrast, footnote 1 in Davis explains, “it is in the final analysis the&para;<br>declarant’s statements, not the interrogator’s questions, that the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.” Id., at 822–823, n. 1.&para;<br>Bryant draws on the footnote to argue that the primary purpose inquiry&para;<br>must be conducted solely from the perspective of the declarant, and&para;<br>argues against adoption of a purpose-of-the-interrogator perspective.&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 10–13; see also Brief for Richard D. Friedman as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 5–15. But this statement in footnote 1 of Davis merely&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pose of the interrogation will be most accurately ascer&para;<br>tained by looking to the contents of both the questions and&para;<br>the answers. To give an extreme example, if the police say&para;<br>to a victim, “Tell us who did this to you so that we can&para;<br>arrest and prosecute them,” the victim’s response that&para;<br>“Rick did it,” appears purely accusatory because by virtue&para;<br>of the phrasing of the question, the victim necessarily has&para;<br>prosecution in mind when she answers.&para;<br>The combined approach also ameliorates problems that&para;<br>could arise from looking solely to one participant. Pre&para;<br>dominant among these is the problem of mixed motives&para;<br>on the part of both interrogators and declarants. Police&para;<br>officers in our society function as both first responders and&para;<br>criminal investigators. Their dual responsibilities may&para;<br>mean that they act with different motives simultaneously&para;<br>or in quick succession. See New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.&para;<br>649, 656 (1984) (“Undoubtedly most police officers [decid&para;<br>ing whether to give Miranda warnings in a possible emer&para;<br>gency situation] would act out of a host of different, in&para;<br>stinctive, and largely unverifiable motives—their own&para;<br>safety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire&para;<br>to obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect”); see&para;<br>also Davis, 547 U.

The language in the footnote was not meant to determine&para;<br>how the courts are to assess the nature of the declarant’s purpose, but&para;<br>merely to remind readers that it is the statements, and not the ques&para;<br>tions, that must be evaluated under the Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gency situation and to gather evidence”).&para;<br>Victims are also likely to have mixed motives when they&para;<br>make statements to the police. During an ongoing emer&para;<br>gency, a victim is most likely to want the threat to her and&para;<br>to other potential victims to end, but that does not neces&para;<br>sarily mean that the victim wants or envisions prosecution&para;<br>of the assailant. A victim may want the attacker to be&para;<br>incapacitated temporarily or rehabilitated. Alternatively,&para;<br>a severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in&para;<br>answering questions posed; the answers may be simply&para;<br>reflexive. The victim’s injuries could be so debilitating&para;<br>as to prevent her from thinking sufficiently clearly to un&para;<br>derstand whether her statements are for the purpose of&para;<br>addressing an ongoing emergency or for the purpose of fu&para;<br>ture prosecution.12 Taking into account a victim’s injuries&para;<br>does not transform this objective inquiry into a subjective&para;<br>one. The inquiry is still objective because it focuses on the&para;<br>understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the&para;<br>circumstances of the actual victim—circumstances that&para;<br>prominently include the victim’s physical state.&para;<br>The dissent suggests, post, at 3–4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.),&para;<br>that we intend to give controlling weight to the “intentions&para;<br>of the police,” post, at 4. That is a misreading of our opin&para;<br>ion. At trial, the declarant’s statements, not the interro&para;<br>gator’s questions, will be introduced to “establis[h] the&para;<br>truth of the matter asserted,” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 60,&para;<br>n. 9, and must therefore pass the Sixth Amendment test.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 In such a situation, the severe injuries of the victim would un&para;<br>doubtedly also weigh on the credibility and reliability that the trier of&para;<br>fact would afford to the statements. Cf. Advisory Committee’s Notes on&para;<br>Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2), 28 U. S. C. App., p. 371 (noting that although&para;<br>the “theory” of the excited utterance exception “has been criticized on&para;<br>the ground that excitement impairs [the] accuracy of observation as&para;<br>well as eliminating conscious fabrication,” it “finds support in cases&para;<br>without number” (citing 6 J.

In determining whether a declarant’s&para;<br>statements are testimonial, courts should look to all of the&para;<br>relevant circumstances. Even JUSTICE SCALIA concedes&para;<br>that the interrogator is relevant to this evaluation, post,&para;<br>at 3, and we agree that “[t]he identity of an interrogator,&para;<br>and the content and tenor of his questions,” ibid., can illu&para;<br>minate the “primary purpose of the interrogation.” The&para;<br>dissent, see post, at 3–5 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), criticizes&para;<br>the complexity of our approach, but we, at least, are un&para;<br>willing to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. Simpler is not&para;<br>always better, and courts making a “primary purpose”&para;<br>assessment should not be unjustifiably restrained from&para;<br>consulting all relevant information, including the state&para;<br>ments and actions of interrogators.&para;<br>Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the&para;<br>interrogation by examining the statements and actions of&para;<br>all participants is also the approach most consistent with&para;<br>our past holdings. E.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1&para;<br>(noting that “volunteered testimony” is still testimony and&para;<br>remains subject to the requirements of the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>As we suggested in Davis, when a court must determine&para;<br>whether the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a&para;<br>statement at trial, it should determine the “primary pur&para;<br>pose of the interrogation” by objectively evaluating the&para;<br>statements and actions of the parties to the encounter, in&para;<br>light of the circumstances in which the interrogation&para;<br>occurs. The existence of an emergency or the parties’&para;<br>perception that an emergency is ongoing is among the&para;<br>most important circumstances that courts must take into&para;<br>account in determining whether an interrogation is tes&para;<br>timonial because statements made to assist police in&para;<br>addressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the&para;<br>testimonial purpose that would subject them to the&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>requirement of confrontation.13 As the context of this case&para;<br>brings into sharp relief, the existence and duration of an&para;<br>emergency depend on the type and scope of danger posed&para;<br>to the victim, the police, and the public.&para;<br>Applying this analysis to the facts of this case is more&para;<br>difficult than in Davis because we do not have the luxury&para;<br>of reviewing a transcript of the conversation between the&para;<br>victim and the police officers. Further complicating our&para;<br>task is the fact that the trial in this case occurred before&para;<br>our decisions in Crawford and Davis. We therefore review&para;<br>a record that was not developed to ascertain the “primary&para;<br>purpose of the interrogation.”&para;<br>We first examine the circumstances in which the inter&para;<br>rogation occurred. The parties disagree over whether&para;<br>there was an emergency when the police arrived at the gas&para;<br>station. Bryant argues, and the Michigan Supreme Court&para;<br>accepted, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 73, that there&para;<br>was no ongoing emergency because “there . . . was no&para;<br>criminal conduct occurring. No shots were being fired, no&para;<br>one was seen in possession of a firearm, nor were any&para;<br>witnesses seen cowering in fear or running from the&para;<br>scene.” Brief for Respondent 27. Bryant, while conceding&para;<br>that “a serious or life-threatening injury creates a medical&para;<br>emergency for a victim,” id., at 30, further argues that a&para;<br>declarant’s medical emergency is not relevant to the ongo&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Of course the Confrontation Clause is not the only bar to admissi&para;<br>bility of hearsay statements at trial.

Bryant’s argument that there was no ongoing&para;<br>emergency because “[n]o shots were being fired,” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 27, surely construes ongoing emergency too&para;<br>narrowly. An emergency does not last only for the time&para;<br>between when the assailant pulls the trigger and the&para;<br>bullet hits the victim.

In response to further questions,&para;<br>Covington explained that the shooting occurred through&para;<br>the back door of Bryant’s house and provided a physical&para;<br>description of the shooter. When he made the statements,&para;<br>Covington was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding&para;<br>from a mortal gunshot wound to his abdomen. His an&para;<br>swers to the police officers’ questions were punctuated&para;<br>with questions about when emergency medical services&para;<br>would arrive.

From this description of his&para;<br>condition and report of his statements, we cannot say that&para;<br>a person in Covington’s situation would have had a “pri&para;<br>mary purpose” “to establish or prove past events poten&para;<br>tially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” Davis, 547&para;<br>U. S., at 822.&para;<br>For their part, the police responded to a call that a man&para;<br>had been shot. As discussed above, they did not know&para;<br>why, where, or when the shooting had occurred. Nor did&para;<br>they know the location of the shooter or anything else&para;<br>about the circumstances in which the crime occurred.19&para;<br>——————&para;<br>19 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA,&para;<br>J.), and despite the fact that the record was developed prior to Davis’&para;<br>focus on the existence of an “ongoing emergency,” the record contains&para;<br>some testimony to support the idea that the police officers were con&para;<br>cerned about the location of the shooter when they arrived on the scene&para;<br>and thus to suggest that the purpose of the questioning of Covington&para;<br>was to determine the shooter’s location. See App. 136 (testimony of&para;<br>Officer Stuglin) (stating that upon arrival officers questioned the gas&para;<br>station clerk about whether the shooting occurred in the gas station&para;<br>parking lot and about concern for safety); see also ibid.

S., at&para;<br>832 (quoting Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev.,&para;<br>Humboldt Cty., 542 U. S. 177, 186 (2004)), including to&para;<br>allow them to ascertain “whether they would be encoun&para;<br>tering a violent felon,”20 Davis, 547 U. S., at 827. In other&para;<br>words, they solicited the information necessary to enable&para;<br>them “to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822.&para;<br>Nothing in Covington’s responses indicated to the police&para;<br>that, contrary to their expectation upon responding to a&para;<br>call reporting a shooting, there was no emergency or that&para;<br>a prior emergency had ended. Covington did indicate that&para;<br>he had been shot at another location about 25 minutes&para;<br>earlier, but he did not know the location of the shooter at&para;<br>the time the police arrived and, as far as we can tell from&para;<br>the record, he gave no indication that the shooter, having&para;<br>shot at him twice, would be satisfied that Covington was&para;<br>only wounded. In fact, Covington did not indicate any&para;<br>possible motive for the shooting, and thereby gave no&para;<br>reason to think that the shooter would not shoot again if&para;<br>he arrived on the scene. As we noted in Davis, “initial&para;<br>inquiries” may “often . . . produce nontestimonial state&para;<br>——————&para;<br>A Correct. Q For your safety as well as everyone else?

The initial inquiries in this case&para;<br>resulted in the type of nontestimonial statements we&para;<br>contemplated in Davis.&para;<br>Finally, we consider the informality of the situation and&para;<br>the interrogation. This situation is more similar, though&para;<br>not identical, to the informal, harried 911 call in Davis&para;<br>than to the structured, station-house interview in Craw&para;<br>ford. As the officers’ trial testimony reflects, the situation&para;<br>was fluid and somewhat confused: the officers arrived at&para;<br>different times; apparently each, upon arrival, asked&para;<br>Covington “what happened?”; and, contrary to the dis&para;<br>sent’s portrayal, post, at 7–9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), they&para;<br>did not conduct a structured interrogation. App. 84 (tes&para;<br>timony of Officer McCallister) (explaining duplicate ques&para;<br>tioning, especially as to “what happened?”); id., at 101–102&para;<br>(testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) (same); id., at 126–127&para;<br>(testimony of Officer Stuglin) (same). The informality&para;<br>suggests that the interrogators’ primary purpose was&para;<br>simply to address what they perceived to be an ongoing&para;<br>emergency, and the circumstances lacked any formality&para;<br>that would have alerted Covington to or focused him on&para;<br>the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.&para;<br>Because the circumstances of the encounter as well as&para;<br>the statements and actions of Covington and the police&para;<br>objectively indicate that the “primary purpose of the inter&para;<br>rogation” was “to enable police assistance to meet an&para;<br>ongoing emergency,” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822, Covington’s&para;<br>identification and description of the shooter and the lo&para;<br>cation of the shooting were not testimonial hearsay.&para;<br>The Confrontation Clause did not bar their admission at&para;<br>Bryant’s trial.&para;<br>*&para;<br>&para;<br>*&para;<br>&para;<br>*&para;<br>&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Covington’s&para;<br>statements were not testimonial and that their admission&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v.

As the majority notes, Covington&para;<br>interacted with the police under highly informal circum&para;<br>stances, while he bled from a fatal gunshot wound. Ante,&para;<br>at 19–20, 31. The police questioning was not “a formalized&para;<br>dialogue,” did not result in “formalized testimonial ma&para;<br>terials” such as a deposition or affidavit, and bore no “indicia of solemnity.” Davis, supra, at 840, 837 (opinion of&para;<br>THOMAS, J.); see also Giles v.

In its vain attempt&para;<br>to make the incredible plausible, however—or perhaps as&para;<br>an intended second goal—today’s opinion distorts our&para;<br>Confrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a&para;<br>shambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the Court makes&para;<br>itself the obfuscator of last resort. Because I continue to&para;<br>adhere to the Confrontation Clause that the People&para;<br>adopted, as described in Crawford v. Washington, 541&para;<br>U. S. 36 (2004), I dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment,&para;<br>made binding on the States by the Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ment, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965), provides&para;<br>that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against&para;<br>him.” In Crawford, we held that this provision guarantees&para;<br>a defendant his common-law right to confront those “who&para;<br>‘bear testimony’ ” against him. 541 U. S., at 51. A witness&para;<br>must deliver his testimony against the defendant in per&para;<br>son, or the prosecution must prove that the witness is&para;<br>unavailable to appear at trial and that the defendant&para;<br>has had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Id., at&para;<br>53–54.&para;<br>Not all hearsay falls within the Confrontation Clause’s&para;<br>grasp. At trial a witness “bears testimony” by providing&para;<br>“ ‘[a] solemn declaration or affirmation . . . for the purpose&para;<br>of establishing or proving some fact.’ ” Id., at 51 (quoting 2&para;<br>N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Lan&para;<br>guage (1828)). The Confrontation Clause protects defen&para;<br>dants only from hearsay statements that do the same.&para;<br>Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823–824 (2006). In&para;<br>Davis, we explained how to identify testimonial hearsay&para;<br>prompted by police questioning in the field. A statement&para;<br>is testimonial “when the circumstances objectively indi&para;<br>cate . . . that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to&para;<br>establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later&para;<br>criminal prosecution.” Id., at 822. When, however, the&para;<br>circumstances objectively indicate that the declarant’s&para;<br>statements were “a cry for help [o]r the provision of infor&para;<br>mation enabling officers immediately to end a threatening&para;<br>situation,” id., at 832, they bear little resemblance to in&para;<br>court testimony. “No ‘witness’ goes into court to proclaim&para;<br>an emergency and seek help.” Id., at 828.&para;<br>Crawford and Davis did not address whose perspective&para;<br>matters—the declarant’s, the interrogator’s, or both—&para;<br>when assessing “the primary purpose of [an] interroga&para;<br>tion.” In those cases the statements were testimonial from&para;<br>any perspective. I think the same is true here, but be&para;<br>cause the Court picks a perspective so will I: The decla&para;<br>rant’s intent is what counts. In-court testimony is more&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>than a narrative of past events; it is a solemn declaration&para;<br>made in the course of a criminal trial. For an out-of-court&para;<br>statement to qualify as testimonial, the declarant must&para;<br>intend the statement to be a solemn declaration rather&para;<br>than an unconsidered or offhand remark; and he must&para;<br>make the statement with the understanding that it may&para;<br>be used to invoke the coercive machinery of the State&para;<br>against the accused.1 See Friedman, Grappling with the&para;<br>Meaning of “Testimonial,” 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 241, 259&para;<br>(2005). That is what distinguishes a narrative told to a&para;<br>friend over dinner from a statement to the police. See&para;<br>Crawford, supra, at 51. The hidden purpose of an interro&para;<br>gator cannot substitute for the declarant’s intentional&para;<br>solemnity or his understanding of how his words may be&para;<br>used.&para;<br>A declarant-focused inquiry is also the only inquiry that&para;<br>would work in every fact pattern implicating the Confron&para;<br>tation Clause. The Clause applies to volunteered testi&para;<br>mony as well as statements solicited through police inter&para;<br>rogation. See Davis, supra, at 822–823, n. 1. An inquiry&para;<br>into an officer’s purposes would make no sense when a&para;<br>declarant blurts out “Rick shot me” as soon as the officer&para;<br>arrives on the scene. I see no reason to adopt a different&para;<br>test—one that accounts for an officer’s intent—when the&para;<br>officer asks “what happened” before the declarant makes&para;<br>his accusation. (This does not mean the interrogator is&para;<br>irrelevant. The identity of an interrogator, and the con&para;<br>tent and tenor of his questions, can bear upon whether a&para;<br>declarant intends to make a solemn statement, and envi&para;<br>sions its use at a criminal trial. But none of this means&para;<br>that the interrogator’s purpose matters.)&para;<br>In an unsuccessful attempt to make its finding of emer&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 I remain agnostic about whether and when statements to nonstate&para;<br>actors are testimonial. See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823,&para;<br>n. 2 (2006).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>gency plausible, the Court instead adopts a test that looks&para;<br>to the purposes of both the police and the declarant. It&para;<br>claims that this is demanded by necessity, fretting that a&para;<br>domestic-violence victim may want her abuser briefly&para;<br>arrested—presumably to teach him a lesson—but not&para;<br>desire prosecution. See ante, at 22. I do not need to probe&para;<br>the purposes of the police to solve that problem. Even if a&para;<br>victim speaks to the police “to establish or prove past&para;<br>events” solely for the purpose of getting her abuser ar&para;<br>rested, she surely knows her account is “potentially rel&para;<br>evant to later criminal prosecution” should one ensue.&para;<br>Davis, supra, at 822.&para;<br>The Court also wrings its hands over the possibility that&para;<br>“a severely injured victim” may lack the capacity to form a&para;<br>purpose, and instead answer questions “reflexive[ly].”&para;<br>Ante, at 22. How to assess whether a declarant with&para;<br>diminished capacity bore testimony is a difficult question,&para;<br>and one I do not need to answer today. But the Court’s&para;<br>proposed answer—to substitute the intentions of the police&para;<br>for the missing intentions of the declarant—cannot be the&para;<br>correct one. When the declarant has diminished capacity,&para;<br>focusing on the interrogators make less sense, not more.&para;<br>The inquiry under Crawford turns in part on the actions&para;<br>and statements of a declarant’s audience only because&para;<br>they shape the declarant’s perception of why his audience&para;<br>is listening and therefore influence his purpose in making&para;<br>the declaration. See 541 U. S., at 51. But a person who&para;<br>cannot perceive his own purposes certainly cannot per&para;<br>ceive why a listener might be interested in what he has to&para;<br>say. As far as I can tell, the Court’s substituted-intent&para;<br>theory “has nothing to be said for it except that it can&para;<br>sometimes make our job easier,” Jerman v. Carlisle,&para;<br>McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring&para;<br>in judgment) (slip op., at 2).&para;<br>The Court claims one affirmative virtue for its focus on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

I am at a loss to know how.&para;<br>Sorting out the primary purpose of a declarant with mixed&para;<br>motives is sometimes difficult. But adding in the mixed&para;<br>motives of the police only compounds the problem. Now&para;<br>courts will have to sort through two sets of mixed motives&para;<br>to determine the primary purpose of an interrogation.&para;<br>And the Court’s solution creates a mixed-motive problem&para;<br>where (under the proper theory) it does not exist—viz.,&para;<br>where the police and the declarant each have one motive,&para;<br>but those motives conflict. The Court does not provide an&para;<br>answer to this glaringly obvious problem, probably be&para;<br>cause it does not have one.&para;<br>The only virtue of the Court’s approach (if it can be&para;<br>misnamed a virtue) is that it leaves judges free to reach&para;<br>the “fairest” result under the totality of the circumstances.&para;<br>If the dastardly police trick a declarant into giving an&para;<br>incriminating statement against a sympathetic defendant,&para;<br>a court can focus on the police’s intent and declare the&para;<br>statement testimonial. If the defendant “deserves” to go to&para;<br>jail, then a court can focus on whatever perspective is&para;<br>necessary to declare damning hearsay nontestimonial.&para;<br>And when all else fails, a court can mix-and-match per&para;<br>spectives to reach its desired outcome. Unfortunately,&para;<br>under this malleable approach “the guarantee of confron&para;<br>tation is no guarantee at all.” Giles v. California, 554&para;<br>U. S. 353, 375 (2008) (plurality).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Looking to the declarant’s purpose (as we should), this is&para;<br>an absurdly easy case. Roughly 25 minutes after Anthony&para;<br>Covington had been shot, Detroit police responded to a 911&para;<br>call reporting that a gunshot victim had appeared at a&para;<br>neighborhood gas station. They quickly arrived at the&para;<br>scene, and in less than 10 minutes five different Detroit&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>police officers questioned Covington about the shooting.&para;<br>Each asked him a similar battery of questions: “what&para;<br>happened” and when, App. 39, 126, “who shot” the victim,”&para;<br>id., at 22, and “where” did the shooting take place, id., at&para;<br>132. See also id., at 113. After Covington would answer,&para;<br>they would ask follow-up questions, such as “how tall is”&para;<br>the shooter, id., at 134, “[h]ow much does he weigh,” ibid.&para;<br>what is the exact address or physical description of the&para;<br>house where the shooting took place, and what chain&para;<br>of events led to the shooting. The battery relented when&para;<br>the paramedics arrived and began tending to Covington’s&para;<br>wounds.&para;<br>From Covington’s perspective, his statements had little&para;<br>value except to ensure the arrest and eventual prosecution&para;<br>of Richard Bryant. He knew the “threatening situation,”&para;<br>Davis, 547 U. S., at 832, had ended six blocks away and 25&para;<br>minutes earlier when he fled from Bryant’s back porch.&para;<br>See 483 Mich. 132, 135–136, 768 N.W. 2d 65, 67 (2009);&para;<br>App. 105. Bryant had not confronted him face-to-face&para;<br>before he was mortally wounded, instead shooting him&para;<br>through a door. See 483 Mich., at 136–137, 768 N.W. 2d,&para;<br>at 67. Even if Bryant had pursued him (unlikely), and&para;<br>after seeing that Covington had ended up at the gas sta&para;<br>tion was unable to confront him there before the police&para;<br>arrived (doubly unlikely), it was entirely beyond imagina&para;<br>tion that Bryant would again open fire while Covington&para;<br>was surrounded by five armed police officers. And Coving&para;<br>ton knew the shooting was the work of a drug dealer, not a&para;<br>spree killer who might randomly threaten others. Id., at&para;<br>135, 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.&para;<br>Covington’s knowledge that he had nothing to fear&para;<br>differs significantly from Michelle McCottry’s state of&para;<br>mind during her “frantic” statements to a 911 operator at&para;<br>issue in Davis, 547 U.

See id., at 831.&para;<br>Covington’s pressing medical needs do not suggest that&para;<br>he was responding to an emergency, but to the contrary&para;<br>reinforce the testimonial character of his statements. He&para;<br>understood the police were focused on investigating a past&para;<br>crime, not his medical needs. None of the officers asked&para;<br>Covington how he was doing, attempted more than super&para;<br>ficially to assess the severity of his wounds, or attempted&para;<br>to administer first aid.2 They instead primarily asked&para;<br>questions with little, if any, relevance to Covington’s dire&para;<br>situation. Police, paramedics, and doctors do not need to&para;<br>know the address where a shooting took place, the name of&para;<br>the shooter, or the shooter’s height and weight to provide&para;<br>proper medical care. Underscoring that Covington under&para;<br>stood the officers’ investigative role, he interrupted their&para;<br>interrogation to ask “when is EMS coming?” App. 57.&para;<br>When, in other words, would the focus shift to his medical&para;<br>needs rather than Bryant’s crime?&para;<br>Neither Covington’s statements nor the colloquy be&para;<br>tween him and the officers would have been out of place at&para;<br>a trial; it would have been a routine direct examination.&para;<br>See Davis, 547 U.

Preventing the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Officer Stuglin’s testimony does not undermine my assessment of&para;<br>the officers’ behavior, although the Court suggests otherwise. See ante,&para;<br>at 28, n. 18. Officer Stuglin first testified that he “asked something like&para;<br>what happened or are you okay, something to that line.” App., 131.&para;<br>When pressed on whether he asked “how are you doing?,” he responded,&para;<br>“Well, basically . . . what’s wrong.” Ibid. Other officers were not so&para;<br>equivocal: They admitted they had no need to “ask him how he was&para;<br>doing. . . . It was very obvious how he was doing.” Id., at 110; see also&para;<br>id., at 19.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v.

Indiana, decided&para;<br>with Davis. Ex parte examinations raise the same consti&para;<br>tutional concerns whether they take place in a gas-station&para;<br>parking lot or in a police interrogation room.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Worse still for the repute of today’s opinion, this is an&para;<br>absurdly easy case even if one (erroneously) takes the&para;<br>interrogating officers’ purpose into account. The five&para;<br>officers interrogated Covington primarily to investigate&para;<br>past criminal events. None—absolutely none—of their&para;<br>actions indicated that they perceived an imminent threat.&para;<br>They did not draw their weapons, and indeed did not&para;<br>immediately search the gas station for potential shooters.3&para;<br>To the contrary, all five testified that they questioned&para;<br>Covington before conducting any investigation at the scene.&para;<br>Would this have made any sense if they feared the pres&para;<br>ence of a shooter? Most tellingly, none of the officers&para;<br>started his interrogation by asking what would have been&para;<br>the obvious first question if any hint of such a fear existed:&para;<br>Where is the shooter?&para;<br>But do not rely solely on my word about the officers’&para;<br>primary purpose.

Id., at 135–136. But the point is not whether they&para;<br>did both; it is whether they moved to secure the area first. No officer’s&para;<br>testimony suggests this. Pellerito testified that he, Stuglin, and Brown&para;<br>arrived at the scene at roughly the same time and all three immedi&para;<br>ately went to Covington. See id., at 17–18. The testimony of Brown&para;<br>and McCallister corroborate that account. See id., at 34–36, 79–82.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

In&para;<br>short, he needed to interrogate Covington to solve a crime.&para;<br>Wenturine never mentioned an interest in ending an&para;<br>ongoing emergency.&para;<br>At the very least, the officers’ intentions turned investi&para;<br>gative during their 10-minute encounter with Covington,&para;<br>and the conversation “evolve[d] into testimonial state&para;<br>ments.” Davis, 547 U.

The fifth officer to arrive at the scene did&para;<br>not need to run straight to Covington and ask a battery of&para;<br>questions “to determine the need for emergency assis&para;<br>tance,” Ibid. He could have asked his fellow officers, who&para;<br>presumably had a better sense of that than Covington—&para;<br>and a better sense of what he could do to assist. No, the&para;<br>value of asking the same battery of questions a fifth time&para;<br>was to ensure that Covington told a consistent story and&para;<br>to see if any new details helpful to the investigation and&para;<br>eventual prosecution would emerge. Having the testimony&para;<br>of five officers to recount Covington’s consistent story&para;<br>undoubtedly helped obtain Bryant’s conviction. (Which&para;<br>came, I may note, after the first jury could not reach a&para;<br>verdict. See 483 Mich., at 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.)&para;<br>D&para;<br>A final word about the Court’s active imagination. The&para;<br>Court invents a world where an ongoing emergency exists&para;<br>whenever “an armed shooter, whose motive for and lo&para;<br>cation after the shooting [are] unknown, . . . mortally&para;<br>wound[s]” one individual “within a few blocks and [25]&para;<br>minutes of the location where the police” ultimately find&para;<br>that victim. Ante, at 27. Breathlessly, it worries that a&para;<br>shooter could leave the scene armed and ready to pull the&para;<br>trigger again. See ante, at 17–18, 27, 30. Nothing sug&para;<br>gests the five officers in this case shared the Court’s&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dystopian4 view of Detroit, where drug dealers hunt their&para;<br>shooting victim down and fire into a crowd of police offi&para;<br>cers to finish him off, see ante, at 30, or where spree kill&para;<br>ers shoot through a door and then roam the streets leaving&para;<br>a trail of bodies behind. Because almost 90 percent of&para;<br>murders involve a single victim,5 it is much more likely—&para;<br>indeed, I think it certain—that the officers viewed their&para;<br>encounter with Covington for what it was: an investi&para;<br>gation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate&para;<br>consequences.&para;<br>The Court’s distorted view creates an expansive excep&para;<br>tion to the Confrontation Clause for violent crimes. Be&para;<br>cause Bryant posed a continuing threat to public safety in&para;<br>the Court’s imagination, the emergency persisted for&para;<br>confrontation purposes at least until the police learned his&para;<br>“motive for and location after the shooting.” Ante, at 27.&para;<br>It may have persisted in this case until the police “secured&para;<br>the scene of the shooting” two-and-a-half hours later.&para;<br>Ante, at 28. (The relevance of securing the scene is un&para;<br>clear so long as the killer is still at large—especially if, as&para;<br>the Court speculates, he may be a spree-killer.) This is a&para;<br>dangerous definition of emergency. Many individuals who&para;<br>testify against a defendant at trial first offer their ac&para;<br>counts to police in the hours after a violent act.

No framing-era confrontation&para;<br>case that I know of, neither here nor in England, took such&para;<br>an enfeebled view of the right to confrontation. For exam&para;<br>ple, King v. Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202,&para;<br>202–203 (K. B. 1779), held inadmissible a mother’s ac&para;<br>count of her young daughter’s statements “immediately on&para;<br>her coming home” after being sexually assaulted. The&para;<br>daughter needed to testify herself. But today’s majority&para;<br>presumably would hold the daughter’s account to her&para;<br>mother a nontestimonial statement made during an ongo&para;<br>ing emergency. She could not have known whether her&para;<br>attacker might reappear to attack again or attempt to&para;<br>silence the lone witness against him.

Cf. ante, at 29–30. Utter&para;<br>nonsense.&para;<br>The 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials that&para;<br>helped inspire the Confrontation Clause show that today’s&para;<br>decision is a mistake. The Court’s expansive definition of&para;<br>an “ongoing emergency” and its willingness to consider the&para;<br>perspective of the interrogator and the declarant cast a&para;<br>more favorable light on those trials than history or our&para;<br>past decisions suggest they deserve. Royal officials con&para;<br>ducted many of the ex parte examinations introduced&para;<br>against Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir John Fenwick while&para;<br>investigating alleged treasonous conspiracies of unknown&para;<br>scope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the King.

Social stability in&para;<br>16th- and 17th-century England depended mainly on the&para;<br>continuity of the ruling monarch, cf. 1 J. Stephen, A His&para;<br>tory of the Criminal Law of England 354 (1883), so such a&para;<br>conspiracy posed the most pressing emergency imaginable.&para;<br>Presumably, the royal officials investigating it would have&para;<br>understood the gravity of the situation and would have&para;<br>focused their interrogations primarily on ending the&para;<br>threat, not on generating testimony for trial. I therefore&para;<br>doubt that under the Court’s test English officials acted&para;<br>improperly by denying Raleigh and Fenwick the opportu&para;<br>nity to confront their accusers “face to face,” id., at 326.&para;<br>Under my approach, in contrast, those English trials&para;<br>remain unquestionably infamous. Lord Cobham did not&para;<br>speak with royal officials to end an ongoing emergency.&para;<br>He was a traitor! He spoke, as Raleigh correctly observed,&para;<br>to establish Raleigh’s guilt and to save his own life. See 1&para;<br>D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Cobham’s state&para;<br>ments, when assessed from his perspective, had only a&para;<br>testimonial purpose.

S., at 822, is not aimed at&para;<br>answering whether the declarant acted as a witness.&para;<br>Instead, the Davis inquiry probes the reliability of a decla&para;<br>rant’s statements, “[i]mplicit[ly]” importing the excited&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

A statement during an ongoing emergency is&para;<br>sufficiently reliable, the Court says, “because the prospect&para;<br>of fabrication . . . is presumably significantly diminished,”&para;<br>so it “does not [need] to be subject to the crucible of cross&para;<br>examination.” Id., at 14.&para;<br>Compare that with the holding of Crawford: “Where&para;<br>testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of&para;<br>reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is&para;<br>the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confronta&para;<br>tion.” 541 U. S., at 68–69. Today’s opinion adopts, for&para;<br>emergencies and faux emergencies at least, the discredited&para;<br>logic of White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 355–356, and n. 8&para;<br>(1992), and Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 819–820&para;<br>(1990). White is, of course, the decision that both Craw&para;<br>ford and Davis found most incompatible with the text and&para;<br>history of the Confrontation Clause. See Davis, supra, at&para;<br>825; Crawford, supra, at 58, n. 8. (This is not to say that&para;<br>that “reliability” logic can actually justify today’s result:&para;<br>Twenty-five minutes is plenty of time for a shooting victim&para;<br>to reflect and fabricate a false story.)&para;<br>The Court announces that in future cases it will look to&para;<br>“standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some&para;<br>statements as reliable,” when deciding whether a state&para;<br>ment is testimonial. Ante, at 11–12. Ohio v. Roberts, 448&para;<br>U. S. 56 (1980) said something remarkably similar: An&para;<br>out-of-court statement is admissible if it “falls within a&para;<br>firmly rooted hearsay exception” or otherwise “bears ade&para;<br>quate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ” Id., at 66. We tried that&para;<br>approach to the Confrontation Clause for nearly 25 years&para;<br>before Crawford rejected it as an unworkable standard&para;<br>unmoored from the text and the historical roots of the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause. See 541 U. S., at 54, 60, 63–65, 67–&para;<br>68. The arguments in Raleigh’s infamous 17th-century&para;<br>treason trial contained full debate about the reliability of&para;<br>Lord Cobham’s ex parte accusations, see Raleigh’s Case,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>2 How. St. Tr. 1, 14, 17, 19–20, 22–23, 29 (1603); that&para;<br>case remains the canonical example of a Confrontation&para;<br>Clause violation, not because Raleigh should have won the&para;<br>debate but because he should have been allowed&para;<br>cross-examination.&para;<br>The Court attempts to fit its resurrected interest in&para;<br>reliability into the Crawford framework, but the result is&para;<br>incoherent. Reliability, the Court tells us, is a good indi&para;<br>cator of whether “a statement is . . . an out-of-court substi&para;<br>tute for trial testimony.” Ante, at 11. That is patently&para;<br>false. Reliability tells us nothing about whether a state&para;<br>ment is testimonial. Testimonial and nontestimonial&para;<br>statements alike come in varying degrees of reliability.&para;<br>An eyewitness’s statements to the police after a fender&para;<br>bender, for example, are both reliable and testimonial.&para;<br>Statements to the police from one driver attempting to&para;<br>blame the other would be similarly testimonial but rarely&para;<br>reliable.&para;<br>The Court suggests otherwise because it “misunder&para;<br>stands the relationship” between qualification for one of&para;<br>the standard hearsay exceptions and exemption from the&para;<br>confrontation requirement. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu&para;<br>setts, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18). That rela&para;<br>tionship is not a causal one. Hearsay law exempts busi&para;<br>ness records, for example, because businesses have a&para;<br>financial incentive to keep reliable records. See Fed. Rule&para;<br>Evid. 803(6). The Sixth Amendment also generally admits&para;<br>business records into evidence, but not because the records&para;<br>are reliable or because hearsay law says so. It admits&para;<br>them “because—having been created for the administra&para;<br>tion of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of estab&para;<br>lishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not” weaker&para;<br>substitutes for live testimony. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 18). Moreover, the scope of the exemp&para;<br>tion from confrontation and that of the hearsay exceptions&para;<br>also are not always coextensive. The reliability logic of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>business-record exception would extend to records main&para;<br>tained by neutral parties providing litigation-support&para;<br>services, such as evidence testing. The Confrontation&para;<br>Clause is not so forgiving. Business records prepared&para;<br>specifically for use at a criminal trial are testimonial and&para;<br>require confrontation. See ibid.&para;<br>Is it possible that the Court does not recognize the&para;<br>contradiction between its focus on reliable statements and&para;<br>Crawford’s focus on testimonial ones? Does it not realize&para;<br>that the two cannot coexist? Or does it intend, by follow&para;<br>ing today’s illogical roadmap, to resurrect Roberts by a&para;<br>thousand unprincipled distinctions without ever explicitly&para;<br>overruling Crawford? After all, honestly overruling Craw&para;<br>ford would destroy the illusion of judicial minimalism and&para;<br>restraint. And it would force the Court to explain how&para;<br>the Justices’ preference comports with the meaning of the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause that the People adopted—or to&para;<br>confess that only the Justices’ preference really matters.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court recedes from Crawford in a second significant&para;<br>way. It requires judges to conduct “open-ended balancing&para;<br>tests” and “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,” inquir&para;<br>ies into the totality of the circumstances bearing upon&para;<br>reliability. 541 U. S., at 63, 68. Where the prosecution&para;<br>cries “emergency,” the admissibility of a statement now&para;<br>turns on “a highly context-dependent inquiry,” ante, at 16,&para;<br>into the type of weapon the defendant wielded, see ante, at&para;<br>17; the type of crime the defendant committed, see ante, at&para;<br>12, 16–17; the medical condition of the declarant, see ante,&para;<br>at 17–18; if the declarant is injured, whether paramedics&para;<br>have arrived on the scene, see ante, at 20; whether the&para;<br>encounter takes place in an “exposed public area,” ibid.;&para;<br>whether the encounter appears disorganized, see ibid.;&para;<br>whether the declarant is capable of forming a purpose, see&para;<br>ante, at 22; whether the police have secured the scene of&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. BRYANT&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the crime, see ante, at 28; the formality of the statement,&para;<br>see ante, at 19; and finally, whether the statement strikes&para;<br>us as reliable, see ante, at 11–12, 14–15. This is no better&para;<br>than the nine-factor balancing test we rejected in Craw&para;<br>ford, 541 U. S., at 63. I do not look forward to resolving&para;<br>conflicts in the future over whether knives and poison are&para;<br>more like guns or fists for Confrontation Clause purposes,&para;<br>or whether rape and armed robbery are more like murder&para;<br>or domestic violence.&para;<br>It can be said, of course, that under Crawford analysis&para;<br>of whether a statement is testimonial requires considera&para;<br>tion of all the circumstances, and so is also something of a&para;<br>multifactor balancing test. But the “reliability” test does&para;<br>not replace that analysis; it supplements it. As I under&para;<br>stand the Court’s opinion, even when it is determined that&para;<br>no emergency exists (or perhaps before that determination&para;<br>is made) the statement would be found admissible as far&para;<br>as the Confrontation Clause is concerned if it is not&para;<br>testimonial.&para;<br>In any case, we did not disavow multifactor balancing&para;<br>for reliability in Crawford out of a preference for rules&para;<br>over standards. We did so because it “d[id] violence to” the&para;<br>Framers’ design. Id., at 68. It was judges’ open-ended&para;<br>determination of what was reliable that violated the trial&para;<br>rights of Englishmen in the political trials of the 16th and&para;<br>17th centuries. See, e.g., Throckmorton’s Case, 1 How. St.&para;<br>Tr. 869, 875–876 (1554); Raleigh’s Case, 2 How. St. Tr., at&para;<br>15–16, 24. The Framers placed the Confrontation Clause&para;<br>in the Bill of Rights to ensure that those abuses (and the&para;<br>abuses by the Admiralty courts in colonial America) would&para;<br>not be repeated in this country. Not even the least dan&para;<br>gerous branch can be trusted to assess the reliability of&para;<br>uncross-examined testimony in politically charged trials or&para;<br>trials implicating threats to national security. See Craw&para;<br>ford, supra, at 67–68; cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.&para;<br>507, 576–578 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.
