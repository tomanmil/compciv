MUCHNICK ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–103.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 7, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>The Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register&para;<br>their works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A.&para;<br>§411(a). The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright in&para;<br>fringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least&para;<br>one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper&para;<br>or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with §411(a).&para;<br>The class, however, included both authors who had registered their&para;<br>works and authors who had not. The parties moved the District&para;<br>Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agree&para;<br>ment. The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance&para;<br>authors. On appeal, the Second Circuit sua sponte raised the ques&para;<br>tion whether §411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter juris&para;<br>diction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights,&para;<br>concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the&para;<br>class or approve the settlement.&para;<br>Held: Section 411(a)’s registration requirement is a precondition to fil&para;<br>ing a copyright infringement claim. A copyright holder’s failure to&para;<br>comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court’s sub&para;<br>ject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregis&para;<br>tered works. Pp. 5–16.&para;<br>(a) “Jurisdiction” refers to “a court’s adjudicatory authority,” Kon&para;<br>trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Thus, “jurisdictional” properly ap&para;<br>plies only to “prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject&para;<br>matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)” implicat&para;<br>ing that authority. Ibid. Because the distinction between jurisdic&para;<br>tional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in prac&para;<br>tice, federal courts and litigants should use the term “jurisdictional”&para;<br>only when it is apposite. Ibid. A statutory requirement is considered&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>jurisdictional if Congress “clearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdic&para;<br>tional”; a condition “not rank[ed]” as such should be treated “as non&para;<br>jurisdictional in character.” Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,&para;<br>515–516. In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity&para;<br>coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was&para;<br>not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not&para;<br>“clearly stat[e]” that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,&para;<br>this Court’s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that&para;<br>the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement’s loca&para;<br>tion in a provision separate from Title VII’s jurisdiction-granting sec&para;<br>tion indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdic&para;<br>tional. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, §411(a)&para;<br>does not “clearly stat[e]” that its registration requirement is “jurisdic&para;<br>tional.” 546 U. S., at 515. Although §411(a)’s last sentence contains&para;<br>the word “jurisdiction,” that sentence speaks to a court’s adjudicatory&para;<br>authority to determine a copyright claim’s registrability and says&para;<br>nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction&para;<br>to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works. More&para;<br>over, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title VII’s employee&para;<br>numerosity requirement, is located in a provision “separate” from&para;<br>those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those&para;<br>respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that §411(a)’s&para;<br>registration requirement can be read to “ ‘speak in jurisdictional&para;<br>terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,’ ”&para;<br>ibid. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee&para;<br>numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a&para;<br>Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit. See&para;<br>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>(c) A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.&para;<br>205. There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2107’s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice&para;<br>of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed §2107’s&para;<br>specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type&para;<br>of limitation. That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh frame&para;<br>work because context is relevant to whether a statute “rank[s]” a re&para;<br>quirement as jurisdictional. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(d) The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Sec&para;<br>ond Circuit’s judgment vacating the settlement. While some of peti&para;<br>tioners’ arguments below are in tension with those made in this&para;<br>Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of “in&para;<br>consistent court determinations” in their favor that estoppel is meant&para;<br>to address. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742. Pp. 14–15.&para;<br>(e) Because §411(a) does not restrict a federal court’s subject&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>matter jurisdiction, this Court need not address the question whether&para;<br>the District Court had authority to approve the settlement under the&para;<br>Second Circuit’s erroneous reading of §411. The Court also declines&para;<br>to decide whether §411(a)’s registration requirement is a mandatory&para;<br>precondition to suit that district courts may or should enforce&para;<br>sua sponte by dismissing copyright infringement claims involving un&para;<br>registered works.

S. C. A. §411(a)&para;<br>(Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Second Circuit held that a copyright holder’s failure to&para;<br>comply with §411(a)’s registration requirement deprives a&para;<br>federal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright&para;<br>infringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)’s regis&para;<br>tration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim&para;<br>that does not restrict a federal court’s subject-matter&para;<br>jurisdiction.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Constitution grants Congress the power “[t]o pro&para;<br>mote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing&para;<br>for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . .&para;<br>their . . . Writings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Exercising this power,&para;<br>Congress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme&para;<br>governing the existence and scope of “[c]opyright protec&para;<br>tion” for “original works of authorship fixed in any tangi&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ble medium of expression.” 17 U. S. C. §102(a). This&para;<br>scheme gives copyright owners “the exclusive rights” (with&para;<br>specified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or&para;<br>publicly perform their works. §106. “Anyone who violates&para;<br>any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as pro&para;<br>vided” in the Act “is an infringer of the copyright.”&para;<br>§501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright&para;<br>owner “is entitled, subject to the requirements of section&para;<br>411, to institute an action” for copyright infringement.&para;<br>§501(b) (emphasis added).&para;<br>This case concerns “the requirements of section 411” to&para;<br>which §501(b) refers. Section 411(a) provides, inter alia&para;<br>and with certain exceptions, that “no civil action for in&para;<br>fringement of the copyright in any United States work&para;<br>shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of&para;<br>the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this&para;<br>title.”1 This provision is part of the Act’s remedial scheme.&para;<br>It establishes a condition—copyright registration—that&para;<br>plaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringe&para;<br>ment claim and invoking the Act’s remedial provisions.&para;<br>We address whether §411(a) also deprives federal courts of&para;<br>subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement&para;<br>claims involving unregistered works.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The relevant proceedings in this case began after we&para;<br>issued our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533&para;<br>U. S. 483 (2001). In Tasini, we agreed with the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of&para;<br>online databases and print publishers had infringed the&para;<br>copyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the&para;<br>authors’ works electronically without first securing their&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Other&para;<br>&para;<br>sections of the Act—principally §§408–410—detail the regis&para;<br>tration process, and establish remedial incentives to encourage copy&para;<br>right holders to register their works, see, e.g., §410(c); 17 U. S. C. A.&para;<br>§412 (2005 ed. and Supp. 2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>permission. See id., at 493. In so holding, we affirmed the&para;<br>principal theory of liability underlying copyright infringe&para;<br>ment suits that other freelance authors had filed after the&para;<br>Court of Appeals had issued its opinion in Tasini. These&para;<br>other suits, which were stayed pending our decision in&para;<br>Tasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were&para;<br>consolidated in the United States District Court for the&para;<br>Southern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on&para;<br>Multidistrict Litigation.&para;<br>The consolidated complaint alleged that the named&para;<br>plaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a&para;<br>freelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,&para;<br>that they had registered in accordance with §411(a). The&para;<br>class, however, included both authors who had registered&para;<br>their copyrighted works and authors who had not. See&para;<br>App. 94.&para;<br>Because of the growing size and complexity of the law&para;<br>suit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.&para;<br>For more than three years, the freelance authors, the&para;<br>publishers (and their insurers), and the electronic data&para;<br>bases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March&para;<br>2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the par&para;<br>ties intended “to achieve a global peace in the publishing&para;<br>industry.” In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases&para;<br>Copyright Litigation, 509 F. 3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).&para;<br>The parties moved the District Court to certify a class&para;<br>for settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.&para;<br>Ten freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (herein&para;<br>after Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court&para;<br>overruled the objections; certified a settlement class of&para;<br>freelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&para;<br>23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reason&para;<br>able, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final&para;<br>judgment. At no time did the Muchnick respondents or&para;<br>any other party urge the District Court to dismiss the&para;<br>case, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settle&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.&para;<br>The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their&para;<br>objections to the settlement on procedural and substantive&para;<br>grounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals sua sponte ordered briefing on the question whether&para;<br>§411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdic&para;<br>tion over infringement claims involving unregistered&para;<br>copyrights. All parties filed briefs asserting that the&para;<br>District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve&para;<br>the settlement agreement even though it included unreg&para;<br>istered works.&para;<br>Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that §411(a)’s&para;<br>registration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 121 (citing Well-Made Toy Mfg.

Busi&para;<br>ness Concepts, Inc., 259 F. 3d 65, 72–73 (CA2 2001)), the&para;<br>Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked&para;<br>jurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the&para;<br>infringement of unregistered works, and also lacked juris&para;<br>diction to approve a settlement with respect to those&para;<br>claims, 509 F. 3d, at 121 (citing “widespread agreement&para;<br>among the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional”).2&para;<br>Judge Walker dissented.

Our recent cases evince a marked&para;<br>desire to curtail such “drive-by jurisdictional rulings,”&para;<br>ibid., which too easily can miss the “critical difference[s]”&para;<br>between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdic&para;<br>tional limitations on causes of action, Kontrick, supra, at&para;<br>456; see also Arbaugh, 546 U.

S., at 515–516 (citation and footnote omitted).&para;<br>The plaintiff in Arbaugh brought a claim under Title VII&para;<br>of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful&para;<br>“for an employer . . . to discriminate,” inter alia, on the&para;<br>basis of sex. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). But employees&para;<br>can bring Title VII claims only against employers that&para;<br>have “fifteen or more employees.” §2000e(b). Arbaugh&para;<br>addressed whether that employee numerosity requirement&para;<br>“affects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, in&para;<br>stead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>claim for relief.” 546 U. S., at 503. We held that it does&para;<br>the latter.&para;<br>Our holding turned principally on our examination of&para;<br>the text of §2000e(b), the section in which Title VII’s nu&para;<br>merosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not&para;<br>“clearly stat[e]” that the employee numerosity threshold&para;<br>on Title VII’s scope “count[s] as jurisdictional.” Id., at&para;<br>515–516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII&para;<br>cases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu&para;<br>merosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it&para;<br>nonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at&para;<br>511–513. Similarly, §2000e(b)’s text and structure did not&para;<br>demonstrate that Congress “rank[ed]” that requirement as&para;<br>jurisdictional. See id., at 513–516. As we observed, the&para;<br>employee numerosity requirement is located in a provision&para;<br>“separate” from §2000e–5(f)(3), Title VII’s jurisdiction&para;<br>granting section, distinguishing it from the “amount-in&para;<br>controversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris&para;<br>diction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1332.” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514–515. Accordingly, the&para;<br>numerosity requirement could not fairly be read to “ ‘speak&para;<br>in jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdic&para;<br>tion of the district courts.’ ” Id., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.&para;<br>Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)). We&para;<br>thus “refrain[ed] from” construing the numerosity re&para;<br>quirement to “constric[t] §1331 or Title VII’s jurisdictional&para;<br>provision.” Arbaugh, supra, at 515 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>We now apply this same approach to §411(a).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Section 411(a) provides:&para;<br>“Except for an action brought for a violation of the&para;<br>rights of the author under section 106A(a), and sub&para;<br>ject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action&para;<br>for infringement of the copyright in any United States&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to&para;<br>the presence of the word “jurisdiction” in the last sentence&para;<br>of §411(a) and contending that the use of the term there&para;<br>indicates the jurisdictional cast of §411(a)’s first sentence&para;<br>as well.

Benrus&para;<br>Watch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640–641 (CA2 1958) (construing&para;<br>§411(a)’s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear&para;<br>that a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to&para;<br>determine “that issue,” §411(a) (emphasis added)—i.e., the&para;<br>issue of registrability—regardless of whether the Register&para;<br>is a party to the infringement suit. The word “jurisdic&para;<br>tion,” as used here, thus says nothing about whether a&para;<br>federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate&para;<br>claims for infringement of unregistered works.&para;<br>Moreover, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title&para;<br>VII’s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision&para;<br>“separate” from those granting federal courts subject&para;<br>matter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See&para;<br>Arbaugh, supra, at 514–515. Federal district courts have&para;<br>subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement&para;<br>actions based on 28 U. S. C. §§1331 and 1338. But neither&para;<br>§1331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over&para;<br>questions of federal law, nor §1338(a), which is specific to&para;<br>copyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on&para;<br>whether copyright holders have registered their works&para;<br>before suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515&para;<br>(“Title VII’s jurisdictional provision” does not “specif[y]&para;<br>any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S.

S., at 515&para;<br>(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi&para;<br>cantly, §411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in&para;<br>fringement claims involving unregistered works in three&para;<br>circumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where&para;<br>the infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and&para;<br>integrity under §106A, or where the holder attempted to&para;<br>register the work and registration was refused. Sepa&para;<br>rately, §411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement&para;<br>actions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the&para;<br>author “declare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the&para;<br>work” and “makes registration for the work, if required by&para;<br>subsection (a), within three months after [the work’s] first&para;<br>transmission.” 17 U.

It would be at&para;<br>least unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a&para;<br>condition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5&para;<br>That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be&para;<br>considered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a&para;<br>prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this&para;<br>conclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates.

Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a&para;<br>footnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it&para;<br>would be improper to characterize the statutory condition&para;<br>as nonjurisdictional because doing so would override “ ‘a&para;<br>century’s worth of precedent’ ” treating §411(a)’s registra&para;<br>tion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot&para;<br>ing Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses&para;<br>on the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we&para;<br>employed.&para;<br>Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid&para;<br>of an express jurisdictional label should be treated as&para;<br>jurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as&para;<br>such. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos&para;<br>ing a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541&para;<br>U. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express&para;<br>statutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor&para;<br>ney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.&para;<br>As we explained, the time limit in Scarborough “concerned ‘a mode of&para;<br>relief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court’ that already had plenary&para;<br>jurisdiction.” 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;&para;<br>(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540&para;<br>U. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per&para;<br>curiam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time&para;<br>limits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that&para;<br>did not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,&para;<br>at 210–211. Kontrick involved “time constraints applicable to objec&para;<br>tions to discharge” in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In&para;<br>that case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(J), the statute&para;<br>“conferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,” and observed that&para;<br>it did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 453.&para;<br>Rather, the “time constraints applicable to objections to discharge”&para;<br>were contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that&para;<br>they “ ‘shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the&para;<br>courts.’ ” See ibid. (quoting Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9030). Eberhart, in&para;<br>turn, treated as nonjurisdictional certain rules that the Court held&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Rather, Bowles stands for the proposition that context,&para;<br>including this Court’s interpretation of similar provisions&para;<br>in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks&para;<br>a requirement as jurisdictional.&para;<br>In Bowles, we considered 28 U. S. C. §2107, which re&para;<br>quires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal&para;<br>within 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4&para;<br>of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which “car&para;<br>ries §2107 into practice.” 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz&para;<br>ing §2107’s specific language and this Court’s historical&para;<br>treatment of the type of limitation §2107 imposes (i.e.,&para;<br>statutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that&para;<br>Congress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic&para;<br>tional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of&para;<br>statutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis&para;<br>tent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em&para;<br>phasized that this Court had long treated such conditions&para;<br>as jurisdictional, including in statutes other than §2107,&para;<br>and specifically in statutes that predated the creation of&para;<br>the courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2.&para;<br>Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques&para;<br>tion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether §411(a) itself&para;<br>has long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type&para;<br>of limitation that §411(a) imposes is one that is properly&para;<br>ranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.&para;<br>The statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we&para;<br>had long held did “speak in jurisdictional terms” even&para;<br>absent a “jurisdictional” label, and nothing about §2107’s&para;<br>text or context, or the historical treatment of that type of&para;<br>limitation, justified a departure from this view. That was&para;<br>not the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes&para;<br>and Arbaugh.&para;<br>Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that&para;<br>§411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction &para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>“closely parallel[ed]” those in Kontrick. 546 U.

Although §411(a)’s historical treatment&para;<br>as “jurisdictional” is a factor in the analysis, it is not&para;<br>dispositive. The other factors discussed above demon&para;<br>strate that §411(a)’s registration requirement is more&para;<br>analogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we consid&para;<br>ered in Zipes and Arbaugh than to the statutory time limit&para;<br>at issue in Bowles.8 We thus conclude that §411(a)’s regis&para;<br>tration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding&para;<br>its prior jurisdictional treatment.9&para;<br>III&para;<br>Amicus argues that even if §411(a) is nonjurisdictional,&para;<br>we should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ judgment vacating the District Court’s&para;<br>order approving the settlement and dismissing the case.&para;<br>According to amicus, petitioners asserted previously in&para;<br>these proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdic&para;<br>tional, and this assertion should estop them from now&para;<br>asserting a right to waive objections to the authors’ failure&para;<br>to register.

We do not agree that a condition should be ranked as&para;<br>jurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional&para;<br>objectives. See Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 504, 515–516&para;<br>(2006) (holding that Title VII’s numerosity requirement is nonjurisdic&para;<br>tional even though it serves the important policy goal of “spar[ing] very&para;<br>small businesses from Title VII liability”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

But we decline to&para;<br>apply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp&para;<br>shire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other&para;<br>things, a “party has succeeded in persuading a court to&para;<br>accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial accep&para;<br>tance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding&para;<br>would create the perception that either the first or the&para;<br>second court was misled.” Id., at 750 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.&para;<br>First, the parties made their prior statements when nego&para;<br>tiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not&para;<br>fault the parties’ lawyers for invoking in the negotiations&para;<br>binding Circuit precedent that supported their clients’&para;<br>positions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the&para;<br>settlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners’&para;<br>interpretation of §411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when&para;<br>the Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether&para;<br>§411(a) restricted the District Court’s subject-matter&para;<br>jurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 3a–5a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners’&para;<br>arguments here thus cannot create “inconsistent court&para;<br>determinations” in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at&para;<br>751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore hold&para;<br>that the District Court had authority to adjudicate the&para;<br>parties’ request to approve their settlement.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Our holding that §411(a) does not restrict a federal&para;<br>court’s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for&para;<br>us to address the parties’ alternative arguments as to&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). After observ&para;<br>ing that “the 15-employee threshold . . . ‘d[id] not speak in&para;<br>jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction&para;<br>of the district courts,’ ” 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.&para;<br>Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.

Section&para;<br>2107’s time limits were “jurisdictional,” Bowles explained,&para;<br>because they were contained in a statute, not merely a&para;<br>rule, id., at 210–213, and because “[t]his Court ha[d] long&para;<br>held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed&para;<br>time is ‘mandatory and jurisdictional,’ ” id., at 209.
