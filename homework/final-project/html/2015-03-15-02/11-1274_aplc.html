Argued January 8, 2013—Decided February 27, 2013&para;<br>The Investment Advisers Act makes it illegal for investment advisers to&para;<br>defraud their clients, 15 U. S. C. §§80b–6(1), (2), and authorizes the&para;<br>Securities and Exchange Commission to bring enforcement actions&para;<br>against investment advisers who violate the Act, or against individuals who aid and abet such violations, §80b–9(d). If the SEC seeks civil penalties as part of those actions, it must file suit “within five years&para;<br>from the date when the claim first accrued,” pursuant to a general&para;<br>statute of limitations that governs many penalty provisions throughout the U. S. Code, 28 U. S. C. §2462.&para;<br>In 2008, the SEC sought civil penalties from petitioners Alpert and&para;<br>Gabelli. The complaint alleged that they aided and abetted investment adviser fraud from 1999 until 2002. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing in part that the civil penalty claim was untimely. Invoking the five-year statute of limitations in §2462, they pointed out&para;<br>that the complaint alleged illegal activity up until August 2002 but&para;<br>was not filed until April 2008. The District Court agreed and dismissed the civil penalty claim as time barred. The Second Circuit reversed, accepting the SEC’s argument that because the underlying&para;<br>violations sounded in fraud, the “discovery rule” applied, meaning&para;<br>that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the SEC discovered or reasonably could have discovered the fraud.&para;<br>Held: The five-year clock in §2462 begins to tick when the fraud occurs,&para;<br>not when it is discovered. Pp. 4–11.&para;<br>(a) This is the most natural reading of the statute. “In common&para;<br>parlance a right accrues when it comes into existence.” United States&para;<br>v. Lindsay, 346 U. S. 568, 569. The “standard rule” is that a claim&para;<br>accrues “when the plaintiff has ‘ “a complete and present cause of ac-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GABELLI v. SEC&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion.” ’ ” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 388. Such an understanding&para;<br>appears in cases and dictionaries from the 19th century, when the&para;<br>predecessor to §2462 was enacted. And this reading sets a fixed date&para;<br>when exposure to the specified Government enforcement efforts ends,&para;<br>advancing “the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose,&para;<br>elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella v.&para;<br>Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The Government nonetheless argues that the discovery rule&para;<br>should apply here. That doctrine is an “exception” to the standard&para;<br>rule, and delays accrual “until a plaintiff has ‘discovered’ ” his cause&para;<br>of action. Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___. It arose from&para;<br>the recognition that “something different was needed in the case of&para;<br>fraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff&para;<br>from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. Thus&para;<br>“where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and ‘remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,&para;<br>the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.’ ” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397. This Court, however, has never applied the discovery rule in this context, where the&para;<br>plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense, but is instead&para;<br>the Government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties.&para;<br>The Government’s case is not saved by Exploration Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 247 U. S. 435. There, the discovery rule was applied in favor&para;<br>of the Government, but the Government was itself a victim; it had&para;<br>been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss. It was not bringing&para;<br>an enforcement action for penalties.&para;<br>There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been&para;<br>extended to Government civil penalty enforcement actions. The discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of parties who have&para;<br>no reason to suspect fraud. The Government is a different kind of&para;<br>plaintiff. The SEC’s very purpose, for example, is to root out fraud,&para;<br>and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit. The Government in these types of cases also seeks a different type of relief.&para;<br>The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recompense, but civil penalties go beyond compensation, are intended to&para;<br>punish, and label defendants wrongdoers. Emphasizing the importance of time limits on penalty actions, Chief Justice Marshall&para;<br>admonished that it “would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our&para;<br>laws” if actions for penalties could “be brought at any distance of&para;<br>time.” Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342. Yet grafting the discovery rule onto §2462 would raise similar concerns. It would leave defendants exposed to Government enforcement action not only for five&para;<br>years after their misdeeds, but for an additional uncertain period into&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

And repose would hinge on speculation about what the&para;<br>Government knew, when it knew it, and when it should have known&para;<br>it. Deciding when the Government knew or reasonably should have&para;<br>known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the&para;<br>courts, such as determining who the relevant actor is in assessing&para;<br>Government knowledge, whether and how to consider agency priorities and resource constraints in deciding when the Government reasonably should have known of a fraud, and so on. Applying a discovery rule to Government penalty actions is far more challenging than&para;<br>applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims, and the Court declines to do so.

Mutual funds are typically valued&para;<br>once a day, at the close of the New York Stock Exchange.&para;<br>Because funds often hold securities traded on different&para;<br>exchanges around the world, their reported valuation may&para;<br>be based on stale information.

Thus the “standard rule” is that a claim accrues&para;<br>“when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of&para;<br>action.” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.

And that definition&para;<br>appears in dictionaries from the 19th century up until&para;<br>today. See, e.g., 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 17 (1850) (“an action accrues when the plaintiff has a&para;<br>right to commence it”); Black’s Law Dictionary 23 (9th ed.&para;<br>2009) (defining “accrue” as “[t]o come into existence as an&para;<br>enforceable claim or right”).&para;<br>This reading sets a fixed date when exposure to the&para;<br>specified Government enforcement efforts ends, advancing&para;<br>“the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose,&para;<br>elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff ’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential&para;<br>liabilities.” Rotella v.

We have deemed them “vital to the&para;<br>welfare of society,” ibid., and concluded that “even wrongdoers are entitled to assume that their sins may be forgotten,” Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.

Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds,&para;<br>559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8). The doctrine arose&para;<br>in 18th-century fraud cases as an “exception” to the standard rule, based on the recognition that “something different was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant’s&para;<br>deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. This Court&para;<br>has held that “where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud&para;<br>and ‘remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want&para;<br>of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does&para;<br>not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.’ ” Holmberg&para;<br>v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946) (quoting Bailey v.&para;<br>Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875)). And we have explained&para;<br>that “fraud is deemed to be discovered when, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been discovered.”&para;<br>Merck &amp; Co., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).&para;<br>But we have never applied the discovery rule in this&para;<br>context, where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim&para;<br>seeking recompense, but is instead the Government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties. Despite the&para;<br>discovery rule’s centuries-old roots, the Government cites&para;<br>no lower court case before 2008 employing a fraud-based&para;<br>discovery rule in a Government enforcement action for&para;<br>civil penalties. See Brief for Respondent 23 (citing SEC v.&para;<br>Tambone, 550 F. 3d 106, 148–149 (CA1 2008); SEC v.&para;<br>Koenig, 557 F. 3d 736, 739 (CA7 2009)). When pressed at&para;<br>oral argument, the Government conceded that it was&para;<br>aware of no such case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. The Government was also unable to point to any example from the&para;<br>first 160 years after enactment of this statute of limitations where it had even asserted that the fraud discovery&para;<br>rule applied in such a context.

United States, 247 U. S. 435 (1918), in an attempt to&para;<br>show that the discovery rule should benefit the Government to the same extent as private parties. See, e.g., Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 10–11, 16, 17, 33–34, 41–45. In that&para;<br>case, a company had fraudulently procured land from the&para;<br>United States, and the United States sued to undo the transaction. The company raised the statute of limitations as a&para;<br>defense, but this Court allowed the case to proceed, concluding that the rule “that statutes of limitations upon&para;<br>suits to set aside fraudulent transactions shall not begin&para;<br>to run until the discovery of the fraud” applied “in favor of&para;<br>the Government as well as a private individual.” Exploration Co., supra, at 449. But in Exploration Co., the Government was itself a victim; it had been defrauded and&para;<br>was suing to recover its loss. The Government was not&para;<br>bringing an enforcement action for penalties. Exploration&para;<br>Co. cannot save the Government’s case here.&para;<br>There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has&para;<br>not been extended to Government enforcement actions for&para;<br>civil penalties. The discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of victims who do not know they are&para;<br>injured and who reasonably do not inquire as to any&para;<br>injury. Usually when a private party is injured, he is immediately aware of that injury and put on notice that his time&para;<br>to sue is running. But when the injury is self-concealing,&para;<br>private parties may be unaware that they have been&para;<br>harmed. Most of us do not live in a state of constant investigation; absent any reason to think we have been&para;<br>injured, we do not typically spend our days looking for&para;<br>evidence that we were lied to or defrauded. And the law&para;<br>does not require that we do so. Instead, courts have developed the discovery rule, providing that the statute of&para;<br>limitations in fraud cases should typically begin to run&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GABELLI v. SEC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>only when the injury is or reasonably could have been&para;<br>discovered.&para;<br>The same conclusion does not follow for the Government&para;<br>in the context of enforcement actions for civil penalties.&para;<br>The SEC, for example, is not like an individual victim who&para;<br>relies on apparent injury to learn of a wrong. Rather, a&para;<br>central “mission” of the Commission is to “investigat[e]&para;<br>potential violations of the federal securities laws.” SEC,&para;<br>Enforcement Manual 1 (2012). Unlike the private party&para;<br>who has no reason to suspect fraud, the SEC’s very purpose is to root it out, and it has many legal tools at hand to&para;<br>aid in that pursuit. It can demand that securities brokers&para;<br>and dealers submit detailed trading information. Id., at&para;<br>44. It can require investment advisers to turn over their&para;<br>comprehensive books and records at any time. 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§80b–4 (2006 ed. and Supp. V).

SEC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>test to Government enforcement actions. See 3M Co. v.&para;<br>Browner, 17 F. 3d 1453, 1461 (CADC 1994) (“An agency&para;<br>may experience problems in detecting statutory violations&para;<br>because its enforcement effort is not sufficiently funded; or&para;<br>because the agency has not devoted an adequate number&para;<br>of trained personnel to the task; or because the agency’s&para;<br>enforcement program is ill-designed or inefficient; or&para;<br>because the nature of the statute makes it difficult to&para;<br>uncover violations; or because of some combination of&para;<br>these factors and others”). And in the midst of any inquiry&para;<br>as to what it knew when, the Government can be expected&para;<br>to assert various privileges, such as law enforcement,&para;<br>attorney-client, work product, or deliberative process,&para;<br>further complicating judicial attempts to apply the discovery rule. See, e.g., App. in No. 10–3581 (CA2), p. 147&para;<br>(Government invoking such privileges in this case, in&para;<br>response to a request for documents relating to the SEC’s&para;<br>investigation of Headstart); see also Rotella, supra, at 559&para;<br>(rejecting a rule in part due to “the controversy inherent in&para;<br>divining when a plaintiff should have discovered” a&para;<br>wrong).&para;<br>To be sure, Congress has expressly required such inquiries in some statutes. But in many of those instances, the&para;<br>Government is itself an injured victim looking for recompense, not a prosecutor seeking penalties. See, e.g., 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §§2415, 2416(c) (Government suits for money damages founded on contracts or torts). Moreover, statutes&para;<br>applying a discovery rule in the context of Government suits often couple that rule with an absolute provision for repose, which a judicially imposed discovery rule&para;<br>would lack. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §335b(b)(3) (limiting&para;<br>certain Government civil penalty actions to “6 years after&para;<br>the date when facts material to the act are known or&para;<br>reasonably should have been known by the Secretary but&para;<br>in no event more than 10 years after the date the act&para;<br>took place”).
