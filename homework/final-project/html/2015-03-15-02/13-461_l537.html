S. C.&para;<br>§106(4). The Act’s Transmit Clause defines that exclusive right to include the right to “transmit or otherwise communicate a performance&para;<br>. . . of the [copyrighted] work . . . to the public, by means of any device&para;<br>or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving&para;<br>the performance . . . receive it in the same place or in separate places&para;<br>and at the same time or at different times.” §101.&para;<br>Respondent Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to&para;<br>watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time&para;<br>as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants&para;<br>to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a&para;<br>menu on Aereo’s website. Aereo’s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized&para;<br>warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna,&para;<br>which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast&para;<br>carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on&para;<br>Aereo’s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber’s&para;<br>screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The&para;<br>streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast,&para;<br>until the subscriber has received the entire show.&para;<br>Petitioners, who are television producers, marketers, distributors,&para;<br>and broadcasters that own the copyrights in many of the programs&para;<br>that Aereo streams, sued Aereo for copyright infringement. They&para;<br>sought a preliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>their right to “perform” their copyrighted works “publicly.” The District Court denied the preliminary injunction, and the Second Circuit&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Aereo performs petitioners’ works publicly within the meaning of&para;<br>the Transmit Clause. Pp. 4–18.&para;<br>(a) Aereo “perform[s].” It does not merely supply equipment that&para;<br>allows others to do so. Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>(1) One of Congress’ primary purposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to overturn this Court’s holdings that the activities of community antenna television (CATV) providers fell outside&para;<br>the Act’s scope. In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television,&para;<br>Inc., 392 U. S. 390, the Court determined that a CATV provider was&para;<br>more like a viewer than a broadcaster, because its system “no more&para;<br>than enhances the viewer’s capacity to receive the broadcaster’s signals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer’s television set.” Id., at 399. Therefore, the Court&para;<br>concluded, a CATV provider did not perform publicly. The Court&para;<br>reached the same determination in respect to a CATV provider that&para;<br>retransmitted signals from hundreds of miles away in Teleprompter&para;<br>Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394. “The reception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the&para;<br>distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer,”&para;<br>the Court said. Id., at 408. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(2) In 1976, Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to&para;<br>reject the Fortnightly and Teleprompter holdings. The Act now clarifies that to “perform” an audiovisual work means “to show its images&para;<br>in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”&para;<br>§101. Thus, both the broadcaster and the viewer “perform,” because&para;<br>they both show a television program’s images and make audible the&para;<br>program’s sounds. Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause,&para;<br>which specifies that an entity performs when it “transmit[s] . . . a&para;<br>performance . . . to the public.” Ibid. The Clause makes clear that an&para;<br>entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even when it&para;<br>simply enhances viewers’ ability to receive broadcast television signals. Congress further created a complex licensing scheme that sets&para;<br>out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under&para;<br>which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts to the public. §111.&para;<br>Congress made all three of these changes to bring cable system activities within the Copyright Act’s scope. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(3) Because Aereo’s activities are substantially similar to those of&para;<br>the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach, Aereo&para;<br>is not simply an equipment provider. Aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>copyrighted, virtually as they are being broadcast. Aereo uses its&para;<br>own equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users’ homes. By means of its technology, Aereo’s system “receive[s]&para;<br>programs that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by&para;<br>private channels to additional viewers.” Fortnightly, supra, at 400.&para;<br>This Court recognizes one particular difference between Aereo’s&para;<br>system and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter: The systems in those cases transmitted constantly, whereas&para;<br>Aereo’s system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she&para;<br>wants to watch a program. In other cases involving different kinds of&para;<br>service or technology providers, a user’s involvement in the operation&para;<br>of the provider’s equipment and selection of the content transmitted&para;<br>may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning&para;<br>of the Act. But given Aereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable&para;<br>companies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological&para;<br>difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not&para;<br>make a critical difference here. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(b) Aereo also performs petitioners’ works “publicly.” Under the&para;<br>Clause, an entity performs a work publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a&para;<br>performance . . . of the work . . . to the public.” §101. What performance, if any, does Aereo transmit? Petitioners say Aereo transmits&para;<br>a prior performance of their works, whereas Aereo says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of&para;<br>transmitting. This Court assumes arguendo that Aereo is correct and&para;<br>thus assumes, for present purposes, that to transmit a performance&para;<br>of an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously&para;<br>visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.&para;<br>Under the Court’s assumed definition, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.&para;<br>What about the Clause’s further requirement that Aereo transmit&para;<br>a performance “to the public”? Aereo claims that because it transmits from user-specific copies, using individually-assigned antennas,&para;<br>and because each transmission is available to only one subscriber, it&para;<br>does not transmit a performance “to the public.” Viewed in terms of&para;<br>Congress’ regulatory objectives, these behind-the-scenes technological&para;<br>differences do not distinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems,&para;<br>which do perform publicly. Congress would as much have intended to&para;<br>protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as&para;<br>from those of cable companies.&para;<br>The text of the Clause effectuates Congress’ intent. Under the&para;<br>Clause, an entity may transmit a performance through multiple&para;<br>transmissions, where the performance is of the same work. Thus&para;<br>when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it “transmit[s] . . . a per-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>formance” to them, irrespective of the number of discrete communications it makes and irrespective of whether it transmits using a single&para;<br>copy of the work or, as Aereo does, using an individual personal copy&para;<br>for each viewer.&para;<br>Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits constitute “the&para;<br>public” under the Act. This is because Aereo communicates the same&para;<br>contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number&para;<br>of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other. In addition,&para;<br>neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo’s subscribers receive&para;<br>performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works. This is relevant because when an entity performs to a&para;<br>set of people, whether they constitute “the public” often depends upon&para;<br>their relationship to the underlying work. Finally, the statute makes&para;<br>clear that the fact that Aereo’s subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations is of no consequence. Aereo&para;<br>transmits a performance of petitioners’ works “to the public.” Pp. 11–&para;<br>15.&para;<br>(c) Given the limited nature of this holding, the Court does not believe its decision will discourage the emergence or use of different&para;<br>kinds of technologies.

The Act’s Transmit Clause&para;<br>defines that exclusive right as including the right to&para;<br>“transmit or otherwise communicate a performance&para;<br>. . . of the [copyrighted] work . . . to the public, by&para;<br>means of any device or process, whether the members&para;<br>of the public capable of receiving the performance . . .&para;<br>receive it in the same place or in separate places and&para;<br>at the same time or at different times.” §101.&para;<br>We must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes&para;<br>this exclusive right by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television&para;<br>programs over the Internet at about the same time as the&para;<br>programs are broadcast over the air. We conclude that it&para;<br>does.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>For a monthly fee, Aereo offers subscribers broadcast&para;<br>television programming over the Internet, virtually as the&para;<br>programming is being broadcast. Much of this programming is made up of copyrighted works. Aereo neither&para;<br>owns the copyright in those works nor holds a license from&para;<br>the copyright owners to perform those works publicly.&para;<br>Aereo’s system is made up of servers, transcoders, and&para;<br>thousands of dime-sized antennas housed in a central&para;<br>warehouse. It works roughly as follows: First, when a&para;<br>subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently being&para;<br>broadcast, he visits Aereo’s website and selects, from a list&para;<br>of the local programming, the show he wishes to see.&para;<br>Second, one of Aereo’s servers selects an antenna, which&para;<br>it dedicates to the use of that subscriber (and that subscriber alone) for the duration of the selected show. A&para;<br>server then tunes the antenna to the over-the-air broadcast carrying the show. The antenna begins to receive the&para;<br>broadcast, and an Aereo transcoder translates the signals received into data that can be transmitted over the&para;<br>Internet.&para;<br>Third, rather than directly send the data to the subscriber, a server saves the data in a subscriber-specific&para;<br>folder on Aereo’s hard drive. In other words, Aereo’s&para;<br>system creates a subscriber-specific copy—that is, a “personal” copy—of the subscriber’s program of choice.&para;<br>Fourth, once several seconds of programming have been&para;<br>saved, Aereo’s server begins to stream the saved copy of&para;<br>the show to the subscriber over the Internet. (The subscriber may instead direct Aereo to stream the program at&para;<br>a later time, but that aspect of Aereo’s service is not before&para;<br>us.) The subscriber can watch the streamed program on&para;<br>the screen of his personal computer, tablet, smart phone,&para;<br>Internet-connected television, or other Internet-connected&para;<br>device. The streaming continues, a mere few seconds&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>behind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber has&para;<br>received the entire show. See A Dictionary of Computing&para;<br>494 (6th ed. 2008) (defining “streaming” as “[t]he process&para;<br>of providing a steady flow of audio or video data so that an&para;<br>Internet user is able to access it as it is transmitted”).&para;<br>Aereo emphasizes that the data that its system streams&para;<br>to each subscriber are the data from his own personal&para;<br>copy, made from the broadcast signals received by the&para;<br>particular antenna allotted to him. Its system does not&para;<br>transmit data saved in one subscriber’s folder to any other&para;<br>subscriber. When two subscribers wish to watch the same&para;<br>program, Aereo’s system activates two separate antennas&para;<br>and saves two separate copies of the program in two separate folders. It then streams the show to the subscribers&para;<br>through two separate transmissions—each from the subscriber’s personal copy.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioners are television producers, marketers, distributors, and broadcasters who own the copyrights in many&para;<br>of the programs that Aereo’s system streams to its subscribers. They brought suit against Aereo for copyright&para;<br>infringement in Federal District Court. They sought a&para;<br>preliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing&para;<br>their right to “perform” their works “publicly,” as the&para;<br>Transmit Clause defines those terms.&para;<br>The District Court denied the preliminary injunction.&para;<br>874 F. Supp. 2d 373 (SDNY 2012). Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed. WNET, Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 712 F. 3d 676&para;<br>(2013) (citing Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F. 3d 121 (2008)). In the Second Circuit’s&para;<br>view, Aereo does not perform publicly within the meaning&para;<br>of the Transmit Clause because it does not transmit “to&para;<br>the public.” Rather, each time Aereo streams a program to&para;<br>a subscriber, it sends a private transmission that is avail-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>able only to that subscriber. The Second Circuit denied&para;<br>rehearing en banc, over the dissent of two judges. WNET,&para;<br>Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 722 F. 3d 500 (2013). We granted&para;<br>certiorari.&para;<br>II&para;<br>This case requires us to answer two questions: First, in&para;<br>operating in the manner described above, does Aereo&para;<br>“perform” at all? And second, if so, does Aereo do so “publicly”? We address these distinct questions in turn.&para;<br>Does Aereo “perform”? See §106(4) (“[T]he owner of [a]&para;<br>copyright . . . has the exclusive righ[t] . . . to perform the&para;<br>copyrighted work publicly” (emphasis added)); §101 (“To&para;<br>perform . . . a work ‘publicly’ means [among other things]&para;<br>to transmit . . . a performance . . . of the work . . . to the&para;<br>public . . . ” (emphasis added)). Phrased another way, does&para;<br>Aereo “transmit . . . a performance” when a subscriber&para;<br>watches a show using Aereo’s system, or is it only the&para;<br>subscriber who transmits? In Aereo’s view, it does not&para;<br>perform. It does no more than supply equipment that&para;<br>“emulate[s] the operation of a home antenna and [digital&para;<br>video recorder (DVR)].” Brief for Respondent 41. Like a&para;<br>home antenna and DVR, Aereo’s equipment simply responds to its subscribers’ directives. So it is only the&para;<br>subscribers who “perform” when they use Aereo’s equipment to stream television programs to themselves.&para;<br>Considered alone, the language of the Act does not&para;<br>clearly indicate when an entity “perform[s]” (or “transmit[s]”) and when it merely supplies equipment that&para;<br>allows others to do so. But when read in light of its purpose, the Act is unmistakable: An entity that engages in&para;<br>activities like Aereo’s performs.&para;<br>A&para;<br>History makes plain that one of Congress’ primary&para;<br>purposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>overturn this Court’s determination that community&para;<br>antenna television (CATV) systems (the precursors of&para;<br>modern cable systems) fell outside the Act’s scope. In&para;<br>Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392&para;<br>U. S. 390 (1968), the Court considered a CATV system&para;<br>that carried local television broadcasting, much of which&para;<br>was copyrighted, to its subscribers in two cities. The&para;<br>CATV provider placed antennas on hills above the cities&para;<br>and used coaxial cables to carry the signals received by the&para;<br>antennas to the home television sets of its subscribers.&para;<br>The system amplified and modulated the signals in order&para;<br>to improve their strength and efficiently transmit them to&para;<br>subscribers. A subscriber “could choose any of the . . .&para;<br>programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on&para;<br>his own television set.” Id., at 392. The CATV provider&para;<br>“neither edited the programs received nor originated any&para;<br>programs of its own.” Ibid.&para;<br>Asked to decide whether the CATV provider infringed&para;<br>copyright holders’ exclusive right to perform their works&para;<br>publicly, the Court held that the provider did not “perform” at all. See 17 U. S. C. §1(c) (1964 ed.) (granting&para;<br>copyright holder the exclusive right to “perform . . . in&para;<br>public for profit” a nondramatic literary work), §1(d)&para;<br>(granting copyright holder the exclusive right to “perform&para;<br>. . . publicly” a dramatic work). The Court drew a line:&para;<br>“Broadcasters perform. Viewers do not perform.” 392&para;<br>U. S., at 398 (footnote omitted). And a CATV provider&para;<br>“falls on the viewer’s side of the line.” Id., at 399.&para;<br>The Court reasoned that CATV providers were unlike&para;<br>broadcasters:&para;<br>“Broadcasters select the programs to be viewed; CATV&para;<br>systems simply carry, without editing, whatever programs they receive. Broadcasters procure programs&para;<br>and propagate them to the public; CATV systems receive programs that have been released to the public&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and carry them by private channels to additional&para;<br>viewers.” Id., at 400.&para;<br>Instead, CATV providers were more like viewers, for “the&para;<br>basic function [their] equipment serves is little different&para;<br>from that served by the equipment generally furnished by”&para;<br>viewers. Id., at 399. “Essentially,” the Court said, “a&para;<br>CATV system no more than enhances the viewer’s capacity to receive the broadcaster’s signals [by] provid[ing] a&para;<br>well-located antenna with an efficient connection to the&para;<br>viewer’s television set.” Ibid. Viewers do not become&para;<br>performers by using “amplifying equipment,” and a CATV&para;<br>provider should not be treated differently for providing&para;<br>viewers the same equipment. Id., at 398–400.&para;<br>In Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974), the Court considered the&para;<br>copyright liability of a CATV provider that carried broadcast television programming into subscribers’ homes from&para;<br>hundreds of miles away. Although the Court recognized&para;<br>that a viewer might not be able to afford amplifying&para;<br>equipment that would provide access to those distant&para;<br>signals, it nonetheless found that the CATV provider was&para;<br>more like a viewer than a broadcaster. Id., at 408–409. It&para;<br>explained: “The reception and rechanneling of [broadcast&para;<br>television signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially&para;<br>a viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the&para;<br>broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.” Id., at 408.&para;<br>The Court also recognized that the CATV system exercised some measure of choice over what to transmit. But&para;<br>that fact did not transform the CATV system into a broadcaster. A broadcaster exercises significant creativity in&para;<br>choosing what to air, the Court reasoned. Id., at 410. In&para;<br>contrast, the CATV provider makes an initial choice about&para;<br>which broadcast stations to retransmit, but then “ ‘simply&para;<br>carr[ies], without editing, whatever programs [it] receive[s].’ ” Ibid. (quoting Fortnightly, supra, at 400 (altera-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions in original)).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 1976 Congress amended the Copyright Act in large&para;<br>part to reject the Court’s holdings in Fortnightly and&para;<br>Teleprompter. See H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, pp. 86–87&para;<br>(1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (The 1976 amendments&para;<br>“completely overturned” this Court’s narrow construction&para;<br>of the Act in Fortnightly and Teleprompter). Congress&para;<br>enacted new language that erased the Court’s line between broadcaster and viewer, in respect to “perform[ing]”&para;<br>a work. The amended statute clarifies that to “perform”&para;<br>an audiovisual work means “to show its images in any&para;<br>sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”&para;<br>§101; see ibid. (defining “[a]udiovisual works” as “works&para;<br>that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines . . . ,&para;<br>together with accompanying sounds”). Under this new&para;<br>language, both the broadcaster and the viewer of a television program “perform,” because they both show the program’s images and make audible the program’s sounds.&para;<br>See H. R. Rep., at 63 (“[A] broadcasting network is performing when it transmits [a singer’s performance of a&para;<br>song] . . . and any individual is performing whenever he or&para;<br>she . . . communicates the performance by turning on a&para;<br>receiving set”).&para;<br>Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which&para;<br>specifies that an entity performs publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a performance . . . to the public.” §101; see ibid.&para;<br>(defining “[t]o ‘transmit’ a performance” as “to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds&para;<br>are received beyond the place from which they are sent”).&para;<br>Cable system activities, like those of the CATV systems in&para;<br>Fortnightly and Teleprompter, lie at the heart of the activities that Congress intended this language to cover. See&para;<br>H. R. Rep., at 63 (“[A] cable television system is perform-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing when it retransmits [a network] broadcast to its subscribers”); see also ibid. (“[T]he concep[t] of public performance . . . cover[s] not only the initial rendition or showing, but also any further act by which that rendition or&para;<br>showing is transmitted or communicated to the public”).&para;<br>The Clause thus makes clear that an entity that acts like&para;<br>a CATV system itself performs, even if when doing so, it&para;<br>simply enhances viewers’ ability to receive broadcast&para;<br>television signals.&para;<br>Congress further created a new section of the Act to&para;<br>regulate cable companies’ public performances of copyrighted works. See §111. Section 111 creates a complex,&para;<br>highly detailed compulsory licensing scheme that sets out&para;<br>the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees,&para;<br>under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts.&para;<br>H. R. Rep., at 88 (Section 111 is primarily “directed at the&para;<br>operation of cable television systems and the terms and&para;<br>conditions of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works”).&para;<br>Congress made these three changes to achieve a similar&para;<br>end: to bring the activities of cable systems within the&para;<br>scope of the Copyright Act.&para;<br>C&para;<br>This history makes clear that Aereo is not simply an&para;<br>equipment provider. Rather, Aereo, and not just its subscribers, “perform[s]” (or “transmit[s]”). Aereo’s activities&para;<br>are substantially similar to those of the CATV companies&para;<br>that Congress amended the Act to reach. See id., at 89&para;<br>(“[C]able systems are commercial enterprises whose basic&para;<br>retransmission operations are based on the carriage of&para;<br>copyrighted program material”). Aereo sells a service that&para;<br>allows subscribers to watch television programs, many of&para;<br>which are copyrighted, almost as they are being broadcast.&para;<br>In providing this service, Aereo uses its own equipment,&para;<br>housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

By means of its technology (antennas, transcoders, and servers), Aereo’s system “receive[s] programs&para;<br>that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by&para;<br>private channels to additional viewers.” Fortnightly, 392&para;<br>U. S., at 400. It “carr[ies] . . . whatever programs [it]&para;<br>receive[s],” and it offers “all the programming” of each&para;<br>over-the-air station it carries. Id., at 392, 400.&para;<br>Aereo’s equipment may serve a “viewer function”; it may&para;<br>enhance the viewer’s ability to receive a broadcaster’s&para;<br>programs. It may even emulate equipment a viewer could&para;<br>use at home. But the same was true of the equipment that&para;<br>was before the Court, and ultimately before Congress, in&para;<br>Fortnightly and Teleprompter.&para;<br>We recognize, and Aereo and the dissent emphasize,&para;<br>one particular difference between Aereo’s system and the&para;<br>cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.&para;<br>The systems in those cases transmitted constantly; they&para;<br>sent continuous programming to each subscriber’s television set. In contrast, Aereo’s system remains inert until a&para;<br>subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.&para;<br>Only at that moment, in automatic response to the subscriber’s request, does Aereo’s system activate an antenna&para;<br>and begin to transmit the requested program.&para;<br>This is a critical difference, says the dissent. It means&para;<br>that Aereo’s subscribers, not Aereo, “selec[t] the copyrighted content” that is “perform[ed],” post, at 4 (opinion of&para;<br>SCALIA, J.), and for that reason they, not Aereo, “transmit”&para;<br>the performance. Aereo is thus like “a copy shop that&para;<br>provides its patrons with a library card.” Post, at 5. A&para;<br>copy shop is not directly liable whenever a patron uses the&para;<br>shop’s machines to “reproduce” copyrighted materials&para;<br>found in that library. See §106(1) (“exclusive righ[t] . . . to&para;<br>reproduce the copyrighted work”). And by the same token,&para;<br>Aereo should not be directly liable whenever its patrons&para;<br>use its equipment to “transmit” copyrighted television&para;<br>programs to their screens.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In our view, however, the dissent’s copy shop argument,&para;<br>in whatever form, makes too much out of too little. Given&para;<br>Aereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable companies&para;<br>targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological&para;<br>difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies&para;<br>does not make a critical difference here. The subscribers&para;<br>of the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cable systems also&para;<br>selected what programs to display on their receiving sets.&para;<br>Indeed, as we explained in Fortnightly, such a subscriber&para;<br>“could choose any of the . . . programs he wished to view by&para;<br>simply turning the knob on his own television set.” 392&para;<br>U. S., at 392. The same is true of an Aereo subscriber. Of&para;<br>course, in Fortnightly the television signals, in a sense,&para;<br>lurked behind the screen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob. Here the signals pursue their&para;<br>ordinary course of travel through the universe until today’s “turn of the knob”—a click on a website—activates&para;<br>machinery that intercepts and reroutes them to Aereo’s&para;<br>subscribers over the Internet. But this difference means&para;<br>nothing to the subscriber. It means nothing to the broadcaster. We do not see how this single difference, invisible&para;<br>to subscriber and broadcaster alike, could transform a&para;<br>system that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable&para;<br>system into “a copy shop that provides its patrons with a&para;<br>library card.”&para;<br>In other cases involving different kinds of service or&para;<br>technology providers, a user’s involvement in the operation of the provider’s equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider&para;<br>performs within the meaning of the Act. But the many&para;<br>similarities between Aereo and cable companies, considered in light of Congress’ basic purposes in amending the&para;<br>Copyright Act, convince us that this difference is not&para;<br>critical here. We conclude that Aereo is not just an&para;<br>equipment supplier and that Aereo “perform[s].”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>Next, we must consider whether Aereo performs petitioners’ works “publicly,” within the meaning of the&para;<br>Transmit Clause. Under the Clause, an entity performs a&para;<br>work publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a performance . . . of&para;<br>the work . . . to the public.” §101. Aereo denies that it&para;<br>satisfies this definition. It reasons as follows: First, the&para;<br>“performance” it “transmit[s]” is the performance created&para;<br>by its act of transmitting. And second, because each of&para;<br>these performances is capable of being received by one and&para;<br>only one subscriber, Aereo transmits privately, not publicly. Even assuming Aereo’s first argument is correct, its&para;<br>second does not follow.&para;<br>We begin with Aereo’s first argument. What performance does Aereo transmit? Under the Act, “[t]o ‘transmit’ a performance . . . is to communicate it by any device&para;<br>or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond&para;<br>the place from which they are sent.” Ibid. And “[t]o ‘perform’ ” an audiovisual work means “to show its images in&para;<br>any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it&para;<br>audible.” Ibid.&para;<br>Petitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of&para;<br>their works. Thus when Aereo retransmits a network’s&para;<br>prior broadcast, the underlying broadcast (itself a performance) is the performance that Aereo transmits. Aereo,&para;<br>as discussed above, says the performance it transmits is&para;<br>the new performance created by its act of transmitting.&para;<br>That performance comes into existence when Aereo&para;<br>streams the sounds and images of a broadcast program to&para;<br>a subscriber’s screen.&para;<br>We assume arguendo that Aereo’s first argument is&para;<br>correct. Thus, for present purposes, to transmit a performance of (at least) an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work. Cf. United States&para;<br>v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>627 F. 3d 64, 73 (CA2 2010) (holding that a download of a&para;<br>work is not a performance because the data transmitted&para;<br>are not “contemporaneously perceptible”). When an Aereo&para;<br>subscriber selects a program to watch, Aereo streams the&para;<br>program over the Internet to that subscriber. Aereo&para;<br>thereby “communicate[s]” to the subscriber, by means of a&para;<br>“device or process,” the work’s images and sounds. §101.&para;<br>And those images and sounds are contemporaneously&para;<br>visible and audible on the subscriber’s computer (or other&para;<br>Internet-connected device). So under our assumed definition, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.&para;<br>But what about the Clause’s further requirement that&para;<br>Aereo transmit a performance “to the public”? As we have&para;<br>said, an Aereo subscriber receives broadcast television&para;<br>signals with an antenna dedicated to him alone. Aereo’s&para;<br>system makes from those signals a personal copy of the&para;<br>selected program. It streams the content of the copy to the&para;<br>same subscriber and to no one else. One and only one&para;<br>subscriber has the ability to see and hear each Aereo&para;<br>transmission. The fact that each transmission is to only&para;<br>one subscriber, in Aereo’s view, means that it does not&para;<br>transmit a performance “to the public.”&para;<br>In terms of the Act’s purposes, these differences do not&para;<br>distinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems, which do&para;<br>perform “publicly.” Viewed in terms of Congress’ regulatory objectives, why should any of these technological differences matter? They concern the behind-the-scenes way in&para;<br>which Aereo delivers television programming to its viewers’ screens. They do not render Aereo’s commercial objective any different from that of cable companies. Nor do&para;<br>they significantly alter the viewing experience of Aereo’s&para;<br>subscribers. Why would a subscriber who wishes to watch&para;<br>a television show care much whether images and sounds&para;<br>are delivered to his screen via a large multisubscriber&para;<br>antenna or one small dedicated antenna, whether they&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>arrive instantaneously or after a few seconds’ delay, or&para;<br>whether they are transmitted directly or after a personal&para;<br>copy is made? And why, if Aereo is right, could not modern CATV systems simply continue the same commercial&para;<br>and consumer-oriented activities, free of copyright restrictions, provided they substitute such new technologies&para;<br>for old? Congress would as much have intended to protect&para;<br>a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo&para;<br>as from those of cable companies.&para;<br>The text of the Clause effectuates Congress’ intent.&para;<br>Aereo’s argument to the contrary relies on the premise&para;<br>that “to transmit . . . a performance” means to make a&para;<br>single transmission. But the Clause suggests that an&para;<br>entity may transmit a performance through multiple,&para;<br>discrete transmissions. That is because one can “transmit” or “communicate” something through a set of actions.&para;<br>Thus one can transmit a message to one’s friends, irrespective of whether one sends separate identical e-mails to&para;<br>each friend or a single e-mail to all at once. So can an&para;<br>elected official communicate an idea, slogan, or speech to&para;<br>her constituents, regardless of whether she communicates&para;<br>that idea, slogan, or speech during individual phone calls&para;<br>to each constituent or in a public square.&para;<br>The fact that a singular noun (“a performance”) follows&para;<br>the words “to transmit” does not suggest the contrary.&para;<br>One can sing a song to his family, whether he sings the&para;<br>same song one-on-one or in front of all together. Similarly,&para;<br>one’s colleagues may watch a performance of a particular&para;<br>play—say, this season’s modern-dress version of “Measure&para;<br>for Measure”—whether they do so at separate or at the&para;<br>same showings. By the same principle, an entity may&para;<br>transmit a performance through one or several transmissions, where the performance is of the same work.&para;<br>The Transmit Clause must permit this interpretation,&para;<br>for it provides that one may transmit a performance to the&para;<br>public “whether the members of the public capable of&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>receiving the performance . . . receive it . . . at the same&para;<br>time or at different times.” §101. Were the words “to&para;<br>transmit . . . a performance” limited to a single act of&para;<br>communication, members of the public could not receive&para;<br>the performance communicated “at different times.”&para;<br>Therefore, in light of the purpose and text of the Clause,&para;<br>we conclude that when an entity communicates the same&para;<br>contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to&para;<br>multiple people, it transmits a performance to them regardless of the number of discrete communications it&para;<br>makes.&para;<br>We do not see how the fact that Aereo transmits via&para;<br>personal copies of programs could make a difference. The&para;<br>Act applies to transmissions “by means of any device or&para;<br>process.” Ibid. And retransmitting a television program&para;<br>using user-specific copies is a “process” of transmitting a&para;<br>performance. A “cop[y]” of a work is simply a “material&para;<br>objec[t] . . . in which a work is fixed . . . and from which the&para;<br>work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.” Ibid. So whether Aereo transmits from the same&para;<br>or separate copies, it performs the same work; it shows the&para;<br>same images and makes audible the same sounds. Therefore, when Aereo streams the same television program to&para;<br>multiple subscribers, it “transmit[s] . . . a performance” to&para;<br>all of them.&para;<br>Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits&para;<br>television programs constitute “the public.” Aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images&para;<br>and sounds to a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other. This matters because,&para;<br>although the Act does not define “the public,” it specifies&para;<br>that an entity performs publicly when it performs at “any&para;<br>place where a substantial number of persons outside of a&para;<br>normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is&para;<br>gathered.” Ibid. The Act thereby suggests that “the public” consists of a large group of people outside of a family&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and friends.&para;<br>Neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo’s&para;<br>subscribers receive performances in their capacities as&para;<br>owners or possessors of the underlying works. This is&para;<br>relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people, whether they constitute “the public” often depends&para;<br>upon their relationship to the underlying work. When, for&para;<br>example, a valet parking attendant returns cars to their&para;<br>drivers, we would not say that the parking service provides cars “to the public.” We would say that it provides&para;<br>the cars to their owners. We would say that a car dealership, on the other hand, does provide cars to the public, for&para;<br>it sells cars to individuals who lack a pre-existing relationship to the cars. Similarly, an entity that transmits a&para;<br>performance to individuals in their capacities as owners or&para;<br>possessors does not perform to “the public,” whereas an&para;<br>entity like Aereo that transmits to large numbers of paying subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the&para;<br>works does so perform.&para;<br>Finally, we note that Aereo’s subscribers may receive&para;<br>the same programs at different times and locations. This&para;<br>fact does not help Aereo, however, for the Transmit Clause&para;<br>expressly provides that an entity may perform publicly&para;<br>“whether the members of the public capable of receiving&para;<br>the performance . . . receive it in the same place or in&para;<br>separate places and at the same time or at different&para;<br>times.” Ibid. In other words, “the public” need not be&para;<br>situated together, spatially or temporally. For these&para;<br>reasons, we conclude that Aereo transmits a performance&para;<br>of petitioners’ copyrighted works to the public, within the&para;<br>meaning of the Transmit Clause.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Aereo and many of its supporting amici argue that to&para;<br>apply the Transmit Clause to Aereo’s conduct will impose&para;<br>copyright liability on other technologies, including new&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>technologies, that Congress could not possibly have wanted&para;<br>to reach. We agree that Congress, while intending the&para;<br>Transmit Clause to apply broadly to cable companies and&para;<br>their equivalents, did not intend to discourage or to control&para;<br>the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.&para;<br>But we do not believe that our limited holding today will&para;<br>have that effect.&para;<br>For one thing, the history of cable broadcast transmissions that led to the enactment of the Transmit Clause&para;<br>informs our conclusion that Aereo “perform[s],” but it does&para;<br>not determine whether different kinds of providers in&para;<br>different contexts also “perform.” For another, an entity&para;<br>only transmits a performance when it communicates&para;<br>contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds of a&para;<br>work. See Brief for Respondent 31 (“[I]f a distributor . . .&para;<br>sells [multiple copies of a digital video disc] by mail to&para;<br>consumers, . . . [its] distribution of the DVDs merely&para;<br>makes it possible for the recipients to perform the work&para;<br>themselves—it is not a ‘device or process’ by which the&para;<br>distributor publicly performs the work” (emphasis in&para;<br>original)).&para;<br>Further, we have interpreted the term “the public” to&para;<br>apply to a group of individuals acting as ordinary members of the public who pay primarily to watch broadcast&para;<br>television programs, many of which are copyrighted. We&para;<br>have said that it does not extend to those who act as owners or possessors of the relevant product. And we have not&para;<br>considered whether the public performance right is infringed when the user of a service pays primarily for&para;<br>something other than the transmission of copyrighted&para;<br>works, such as the remote storage of content. See Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (distinguishing cloudbased storage services because they “offer consumers more&para;<br>numerous and convenient means of playing back copies&para;<br>that the consumers have already lawfully acquired” (emphasis in original)).

Universal City Studios, Inc.,&para;<br>464 U. S. 417 (1984).&para;<br>We cannot now answer more precisely how the Transmit&para;<br>Clause or other provisions of the Copyright Act will apply&para;<br>to technologies not before us. We agree with the Solicitor&para;<br>General that “[q]uestions involving cloud computing,&para;<br>[remote storage] DVRs, and other novel issues not before&para;<br>the Court, as to which ‘Congress has not plainly marked&para;<br>[the] course,’ should await a case in which they are&para;<br>squarely presented.” Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 34 (quoting Sony, supra, at 431 (alteration in&para;<br>original)). And we note that, to the extent commercial&para;<br>actors or other interested entities may be concerned with&para;<br>the relationship between the development and use of such&para;<br>technologies and the Copyright Act, they are of course free&para;<br>to seek action from Congress. Cf. Digital Millennium&para;<br>Copyright Act, 17 U. S. C. §512.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In sum, having considered the details of Aereo’s practices,&para;<br>we find them highly similar to those of the CATV systems&para;<br>in Fortnightly and Teleprompter. And those are activities&para;<br>that the 1976 amendments sought to bring within the&para;<br>scope of the Copyright Act. Insofar as there are differences, those differences concern not the nature of the&para;<br>service that Aereo provides so much as the technological&para;<br>manner in which it provides the service. We conclude that&para;<br>those differences are not adequate to place Aereo’s activities outside the scope of the Act.&para;<br>For these reasons, we conclude that Aereo “perform[s]”&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v.

The Court manages to reach the&para;<br>opposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted&para;<br>rules for service-provider liability and adopting in their&para;<br>place an improvised standard (“looks-like-cable-TV”) that&para;<br>will sow confusion for years to come.&para;<br>I. Legal Standard&para;<br>There are two types of liability for copyright infringement: direct and secondary. As its name suggests, the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>former applies when an actor personally engages in infringing conduct. See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal&para;<br>City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 433 (1984). Secondary&para;<br>liability, by contrast, is a means of holding defendants&para;<br>responsible for infringement by third parties, even when&para;<br>the defendants “have not themselves engaged in the infringing activity.” Id., at 435. It applies when a defendant&para;<br>“intentionally induc[es] or encourag[es]” infringing acts by&para;<br>others or profits from such acts “while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit [them].” Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&para;<br>Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U. S. 913, 930 (2005).&para;<br>Most suits against equipment manufacturers and service providers involve secondary-liability claims. For example, when movie studios sued to block the sale of&para;<br>Sony’s Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR), they argued&para;<br>that Sony was liable because its customers were making&para;<br>unauthorized copies. See Sony, supra, at 434–435. Record&para;<br>labels and movie studios relied on a similar theory when&para;<br>they sued Grokster and StreamCast, two providers of&para;<br>peer-to-peer file-sharing software. See Grokster, supra, at&para;<br>920–921, 927.&para;<br>This suit, or rather the portion of it before us here, is&para;<br>fundamentally different. The Networks claim that Aereo&para;<br>directly infringes their public-performance right. Accordingly, the Networks must prove that Aereo “perform[s]”&para;<br>copyrighted works, §106(4), when its subscribers log in,&para;<br>select a channel, and push the “watch” button. That process undoubtedly results in a performance; the question is&para;<br>who does the performing. See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP&para;<br>v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F. 3d 121, 130 (CA2 2008). If&para;<br>Aereo’s subscribers perform but Aereo does not, the claim&para;<br>necessarily fails.&para;<br>The Networks’ claim is governed by a simple but profoundly important rule: A defendant may be held directly&para;<br>liable only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that&para;<br>violates the Act. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright §9:5.50 (2013).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>This requirement is firmly grounded in the Act’s text,&para;<br>which defines “perform” in active, affirmative terms: One&para;<br>“perform[s]” a copyrighted “audiovisual work,” such as a&para;<br>movie or news broadcast, by “show[ing] its images in any&para;<br>sequence” or “mak[ing] the sounds accompanying it audible.” §101. And since the Act makes it unlawful to copy or&para;<br>perform copyrighted works, not to copy or perform in&para;<br>general, see §501(a), the volitional-act requirement demands conduct directed to the plaintiff ’s copyrighted&para;<br>material, see Sony, supra, at 434. Every Court of Appeals&para;<br>to have considered an automated-service provider’s direct&para;<br>liability for copyright infringement has adopted that rule.&para;<br>See Fox Broadcasting Co. v.

LoopNet, Inc.,&para;<br>373 F. 3d 544, 549–550 (CA4 2004).1 Although we have&para;<br>not opined on the issue, our cases are fully consistent with&para;<br>a volitional-conduct requirement. For example, we gave&para;<br>several examples of direct infringement in Sony, each of&para;<br>which involved a volitional act directed to the plaintiff ’s&para;<br>copyrighted material. See 464 U. S., at 437, n. 18.&para;<br>The volitional-conduct requirement is not at issue in&para;<br>most direct-infringement cases; the usual point of dispute&para;<br>is whether the defendant’s conduct is infringing (e.g., Does&para;<br>the defendant’s design copy the plaintiff ’s?), rather than&para;<br>whether the defendant has acted at all (e.g., Did this&para;<br>defendant create the infringing design?). But it comes&para;<br>right to the fore when a direct-infringement claim is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 An&para;<br>&para;<br>unpublished decision of the Third Circuit is to the same effect.&para;<br>Parker v.

See Cartoon Network, supra, at&para;<br>131–132.&para;<br>A comparison between copy shops and video-on-demand&para;<br>services illustrates the point. A copy shop rents out photocopiers on a per-use basis. One customer might copy his&para;<br>10-year-old’s drawings—a perfectly lawful thing to do—&para;<br>while another might duplicate a famous artist’s copyrighted&para;<br>photographs—a use clearly prohibited by §106(1). Either&para;<br>way, the customer chooses the content and activates the&para;<br>copying function; the photocopier does nothing except in&para;<br>response to the customer’s commands. Because the shop&para;<br>plays no role in selecting the content, it cannot be held&para;<br>directly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy.&para;<br>See CoStar, supra, at 550.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>has enacted several safe-harbor provisions applicable to&para;<br>automated network processes, see, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §512(a)–(b), but&para;<br>those provisions do not foreclose “any other defense,” §512(l), including&para;<br>a volitional-conduct defense.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Video-on-demand services, like photocopiers, respond&para;<br>automatically to user input, but they differ in one crucial&para;<br>respect: They choose the content. When a user signs in to&para;<br>Netflix, for example, “thousands of . . . movies [and] TV&para;<br>episodes” carefully curated by Netflix are “available to&para;<br>watch instantly.” See How [D]oes Netflix [W]ork?, online&para;<br>at http://help.netflix.com/en/node/412 (as visited June 20,&para;<br>2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). That&para;<br>selection and arrangement by the service provider constitutes a volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works&para;<br>and thus serves as a basis for direct liability.&para;<br>The distinction between direct and secondary liability&para;<br>would collapse if there were not a clear rule for determining whether the defendant committed the infringing&para;<br>act. See Cartoon Network, 536 F. 3d, at 132–133. The&para;<br>volitional-conduct requirement supplies that rule; its&para;<br>purpose is not to excuse defendants from accountability,&para;<br>but to channel the claims against them into the correct&para;<br>analytical track. See Brief for 36 Intellectual Property&para;<br>and Copyright Law Professors as Amici Curiae 7. Thus, in&para;<br>the example given above, the fact that the copy shop does&para;<br>not choose the content simply means that its culpability&para;<br>will be assessed using secondary-liability rules rather&para;<br>than direct-liability rules. See Sony, supra, at 434–442;&para;<br>Cartoon Network, supra, at 132–133.&para;<br>II. Application to Aereo&para;<br>So which is Aereo: the copy shop or the video-on-demand&para;<br>service? In truth, it is neither. Rather, it is akin to a copy&para;<br>shop that provides its patrons with a library card. Aereo&para;<br>offers access to an automated system consisting of routers,&para;<br>servers, transcoders, and dime-sized antennae. Like a&para;<br>photocopier or VCR, that system lies dormant until a&para;<br>subscriber activates it. When a subscriber selects a program, Aereo’s system picks up the relevant broadcast&para;<br>signal, translates its audio and video components into&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>digital data, stores the data in a user-specific file, and&para;<br>transmits that file’s contents to the subscriber via the&para;<br>Internet—at which point the subscriber’s laptop, tablet, or&para;<br>other device displays the broadcast just as an ordinary&para;<br>television would. The result of that process fits the statutory definition of a performance to a tee: The subscriber’s&para;<br>device “show[s]” the broadcast’s “images” and “make[s] the&para;<br>sounds accompanying” the broadcast “audible.” §101. The&para;<br>only question is whether those performances are the product of Aereo’s volitional conduct.&para;<br>They are not. Unlike video-on-demand services, Aereo&para;<br>does not provide a prearranged assortment of movies and&para;<br>television shows. Rather, it assigns each subscriber an&para;<br>antenna that—like a library card—can be used to obtain&para;<br>whatever broadcasts are freely available. Some of those&para;<br>broadcasts are copyrighted; others are in the public domain. The key point is that subscribers call all the shots:&para;<br>Aereo’s automated system does not relay any program,&para;<br>copyrighted or not, until a subscriber selects the program&para;<br>and tells Aereo to relay it. Aereo’s operation of that system is a volitional act and a but-for cause of the resulting&para;<br>performances, but, as in the case of the copy shop, that&para;<br>degree of involvement is not enough for direct liability.&para;<br>See Grokster, 545 U. S., at 960 (BREYER, J., concurring)&para;<br>(“[T]he producer of a technology which permits unlawful&para;<br>copying does not himself engage in unlawful copying”).&para;<br>In sum, Aereo does not “perform” for the sole and simple&para;<br>reason that it does not make the choice of content. And&para;<br>because Aereo does not perform, it cannot be held directly&para;<br>liable for infringing the Networks’ public-performance&para;<br>right.3 That conclusion does not necessarily mean that&para;<br>Aereo’s service complies with the Copyright Act. Quite the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Because I conclude that Aereo does not perform at all, I do not reach&para;<br>the question whether the performances in this case are to the public.&para;<br>See ante, at 10–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>contrary. The Networks’ complaint alleges that Aereo is&para;<br>directly and secondarily liable for infringing their publicperformance rights (§106(4)) and also their reproduction&para;<br>rights (§106(1)). Their request for a preliminary injunction—the only issue before this Court—is based exclusively&para;<br>on the direct-liability portion of the public-performance&para;<br>claim (and further limited to Aereo’s “watch” function, as&para;<br>opposed to its “record” function). See App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>60a–61a. Affirming the judgment below would merely&para;<br>return this case to the lower courts for consideration of the&para;<br>Networks’ remaining claims.&para;<br>III. Guilt By Resemblance&para;<br>The Court’s conclusion that Aereo performs boils down&para;<br>to the following syllogism: (1) Congress amended the Act&para;<br>to overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not&para;<br>perform when they retransmit over-the-air broadcasts;4 (2)&para;<br>Aereo looks a lot like a cable system; therefore (3) Aereo&para;<br>performs. Ante, at 4–10. That reasoning suffers from a&para;<br>trio of defects.&para;<br>First, it is built on the shakiest of foundations. Perceiving the text to be ambiguous, ante, at 4, the Court reaches&para;<br>out to decide the case based on a few isolated snippets of&para;<br>legislative history, ante, at 7–8 (citing H. R. Rep. No. 94–&para;<br>1476 (1976)). The Court treats those snippets as authoritative evidence of congressional intent even though they&para;<br>come from a single report issued by a committee whose&para;<br>members make up a small fraction of one of the two Houses&para;<br>of Congress. Little else need be said here about the severe&para;<br>shortcomings of that interpretative methodology. See&para;<br>Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>concurring in principal part and concurring in judgment)&para;<br>(slip op., at 1–2).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415&para;<br>U. S. 394 (1974); Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.,&para;<br>392 U. S. 390 (1968).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Second, the Court’s reasoning fails on its own terms&para;<br>because there are material differences between the cable&para;<br>systems at issue in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia&para;<br>Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974), and Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U. S.&para;<br>390 (1968), on the one hand and Aereo on the other. The&para;<br>former (which were then known as community-antenna&para;<br>television systems) captured the full range of broadcast&para;<br>signals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all times,&para;<br>whereas Aereo transmits only specific programs selected&para;<br>by the user, at specific times selected by the user. The&para;<br>Court acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes&para;<br>that it “does not make a critical difference.” Ante, at 10.&para;<br>Even if that were true, the Court fails to account for other&para;<br>salient differences between the two technologies.5 Though&para;<br>cable systems started out essentially as dumb pipes that&para;<br>routed signals from point A to point B, see ante, at 5, by&para;<br>the 1970’s, that kind of service “ ‘no longer exist[ed],’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners in Columbia Broadcasting System,&para;<br>Inc. v. Teleprompter Corp., O. T. 1973, No. 72–1633, p. 22.&para;<br>At the time of our Teleprompter decision, cable companies&para;<br>“perform[ed] the same functions as ‘broadcasters’ by deliberately selecting and importing distant signals, originating programs, [and] selling commercials,” id., at 20, thus&para;<br>making them curators of content—more akin to video-ondemand services than copy shops. So far as the record&para;<br>reveals, Aereo does none of those things.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The Court observes that “[t]he subscribers of the Fortnightly and&para;<br>Teleprompter cable systems . . . selected what programs to display on&para;<br>their receiving sets,” but acknowledges that those choices were possible&para;<br>only because “the television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the&para;<br>screen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.” Ante, at&para;<br>10. The latter point is dispositive: The signals were “ready to emerge”&para;<br>because the cable system—much like a video-on-demand provider—&para;<br>took affirmative, volitional steps to put them there. As discussed&para;<br>above, the same cannot be said of the programs available through&para;<br>Aereo’s automated system.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Third, and most importantly, even accepting that the&para;<br>1976 amendments had as their purpose the overruling of&para;<br>our cable-TV cases, what they were meant to do and how&para;<br>they did it are two different questions—and it is the latter&para;<br>that governs the case before us here. The injury claimed&para;<br>is not violation of a law that says operations similar to&para;<br>cable TV are subject to copyright liability, but violation of&para;<br>§106(4) of the Copyright Act. And whatever soothing&para;<br>reasoning the Court uses to reach its result (“this looks&para;<br>like cable TV”), the consequence of its holding is that&para;<br>someone who implements this technology “perform[s]”&para;<br>under that provision. That greatly disrupts settled jurisprudence which, before today, applied the straightforward,&para;<br>bright-line test of volitional conduct directed at the copyrighted work. If that test is not outcome determinative in&para;<br>this case, presumably it is not outcome determinative&para;<br>elsewhere as well. And it is not clear what the Court&para;<br>proposes to replace it. Perhaps the Court means to adopt&para;<br>(invent, really) a two-tier version of the Copyright Act, one&para;<br>part of which applies to “cable companies and their equivalents” while the other governs everyone else. Ante, at 9–&para;<br>10, 16.&para;<br>The rationale for the Court’s ad hoc rule for cablesystem lookalikes is so broad that it renders nearly a third&para;<br>of the Court’s opinion superfluous. Part II of the opinion&para;<br>concludes that Aereo performs because it resembles a&para;<br>cable company, and Congress amended the Act in 1976 “to&para;<br>bring the activities of cable systems within [its] scope.”&para;<br>Ante, at 8. Part III of the opinion purports to address&para;<br>separately the question whether Aereo performs “publicly.” Ante, at 10–15. Trouble is, that question cannot&para;<br>remain open if Congress’s supposed intent to regulate&para;<br>whatever looks like a cable company must be given legal&para;<br>effect (as the Court says in Part II). The Act reaches only&para;<br>public performances, see §106(4), so Congress could not&para;<br>have regulated “the activities of cable systems” without&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>deeming their retransmissions public performances. The&para;<br>upshot is this: If Aereo’s similarity to a cable company&para;<br>means that it performs, then by necessity that same characteristic means that it does so publicly, and Part III of&para;<br>the Court’s opinion discusses an issue that is no longer&para;<br>relevant—though discussing it certainly gives the opinion&para;<br>the “feel” of real textual analysis.&para;<br>Making matters worse, the Court provides no criteria&para;<br>for determining when its cable-TV-lookalike rule applies.&para;<br>Must a defendant offer access to live television to qualify?&para;<br>If similarity to cable-television service is the measure,&para;<br>then the answer must be yes. But consider the implications of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly&para;<br>what it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory&para;<br>time shifting into its “watch” function.6 Aereo would not&para;<br>be providing live television if it made subscribers wait to&para;<br>tune in until after a show’s live broadcast ended. A subscriber could watch the 7 p.m. airing of a 1-hour program&para;<br>any time after 8 p.m. Assuming the Court does not intend&para;<br>to adopt such a do-nothing rule (though it very well may),&para;<br>there must be some other means of identifying who is and&para;<br>is not subject to its guilt-by-resemblance regime.&para;<br>Two other criteria come to mind. One would cover any&para;<br>automated service that captures and stores live television&para;<br>broadcasts at a user’s direction. That can’t be right, since&para;<br>it is exactly what remote storage digital video recorders&para;<br>(RS–DVRs) do, see Cartoon Network, 536 F. 3d, at 124–&para;<br>125, and the Court insists that its “limited holding” does&para;<br>not decide the fate of those devices, ante, at 16–17. The&para;<br>other potential benchmark is the one offered by the Government: The cable-TV-lookalike rule embraces any entity&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Broadcasts accessible through the “watch” function are technically&para;<br>not live because Aereo’s servers take anywhere from a few seconds to a&para;<br>few minutes to begin transmitting data to a subscriber’s device. But&para;<br>the resulting delay is so brief that it cannot reasonably be classified as&para;<br>time shifting.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that “operates an integrated system, substantially dependent on physical equipment that is used in common by&para;<br>[its] subscribers.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>20. The Court sensibly avoids that approach because it&para;<br>would sweep in Internet service providers and a host of&para;<br>other entities that quite obviously do not perform.&para;<br>That leaves as the criterion of cable-TV-resemblance&para;<br>nothing but th’ol’ totality-of-the-circumstances test (which&para;<br>is not a test at all but merely assertion of an intent to&para;<br>perform test-free, ad hoc, case-by-case evaluation). It will&para;<br>take years, perhaps decades, to determine which automated&para;<br>systems now in existence are governed by the traditional volitional-conduct test and which get the Aereo&para;<br>treatment. (And automated systems now in contemplation&para;<br>will have to take their chances.) The Court vows that its&para;<br>ruling will not affect cloud-storage providers and cabletelevision systems, see ante, at 16–17, but it cannot deliver&para;<br>on that promise given the imprecision of its result-driven&para;<br>rule. Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the Court’s&para;<br>makeshift approach will become apparent in this very&para;<br>case. Today’s decision addresses the legality of Aereo’s&para;<br>“watch” function, which provides nearly contemporaneous&para;<br>access to live broadcasts. On remand, one of the first&para;<br>questions the lower courts will face is whether Aereo’s&para;<br>“record” function, which allows subscribers to save a program while it is airing and watch it later, infringes the&para;<br>Networks’ public-performance right.&para;<br>The volitionalconduct rule provides a clear answer to that question:&para;<br>Because Aereo does not select the programs viewed by its&para;<br>users, it does not perform. But it is impossible to say how&para;<br>the issue will come out under the Court’s analysis, since&para;<br>cable companies did not offer remote recording and playback services when Congress amended the Copyright Act&para;<br>in 1976.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v.

As discussed at the outset, Aereo’s secondary liability for performance infringement is yet to be determined, as is its&para;<br>primary and secondary liability for reproduction infringement.
