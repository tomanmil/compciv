Argued December 1, 2014—Decided March 9, 2015*&para;<br>The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes the procedures&para;<br>federal administrative agencies use for “rule making,” defined as the&para;<br>process of “formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§551(5). The APA distinguishes between two types of rules: So-called&para;<br>“legislative rules” are issued through notice-and-comment rulemaking, see §§553(b), (c), and have the “force and effect of law,” Chrysler&para;<br>Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 302–303. “Interpretive rules,” by contrast, are “issued . . . to advise the public of the agency’s construction&para;<br>of the statutes and rules which it administers,” Shalala v. Guernsey&para;<br>Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, 99, do not require notice-andcomment rulemaking, and “do not have the force and effect of law,”&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>In 1999 and 2001, the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division issued letters opining that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify&para;<br>for the administrative exemption to overtime pay requirements under&para;<br>the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In 2004, the Department issued new regulations regarding the exemption. Respondent Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) requested a new interpretation of&para;<br>the revised regulations as they applied to mortgage-loan officers, and&para;<br>in 2006, the Wage and Hour Division issued an opinion letter finding&para;<br>that mortgage-loan officers fell within the administrative exemption&para;<br>under the 2004 regulations. In 2010, the Department again altered&para;<br>its interpretation of the administrative exemption. Without notice or&para;<br>an opportunity for comment, the Department withdrew the 2006&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 13–1052, Nickols et al. v.

MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>opinion letter and issued an Administrator’s Interpretation concluding that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify for the administrative&para;<br>exemption.&para;<br>MBA filed suit contending, as relevant here, that the Administrator’s Interpretation was procedurally invalid under the D. C. Circuit’s&para;<br>decision in Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d&para;<br>579. The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine holds that an agency must use&para;<br>the APA’s notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a&para;<br>new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from a&para;<br>previously adopted interpretation. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Department, but the D. C. Circuit applied Paralyzed Veterans and reversed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear text of&para;<br>the APA’s rulemaking provisions and improperly imposes on agencies&para;<br>an obligation beyond the APA’s maximum procedural requirements.&para;<br>Pp. 6–14.&para;<br>(a) The APA’s categorical exemption of interpretive rules from&para;<br>the notice-and-comment process is fatal to the Paralyzed Veterans&para;<br>doctrine. The D. C. Circuit’s reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes of §§1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 requires agencies to&para;<br>use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they&para;<br>used to issue the rule, see 5 U. S. C. §551(5), but it does not say what&para;<br>procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That&para;<br>is the purpose of §4. And §4 specifically exempts interpretive rules&para;<br>from notice-and-comment requirements. Because an agency is not&para;<br>required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures to&para;<br>amend or repeal that rule. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) This straightforward reading of the APA harmonizes with&para;<br>longstanding principles of this Court’s administrative law jurisprudence, which has consistently held that the APA “sets forth the full&para;<br>extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for procedural correctness,” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S.&para;<br>502, 513. The APA’s rulemaking provisions are no exception: §4 establishes “the maximum procedural requirements” that courts may&para;<br>impose upon agencies engaged in rulemaking. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435&para;<br>U. S. 519, 524. By mandating notice-and-comment procedures when&para;<br>an agency changes its interpretation of one of the regulations it enforces, Paralyzed Veterans creates a judge-made procedural right that&para;<br>is inconsistent with Congress’ standards. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>(c) MBA’s reasons for upholding the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine&para;<br>are unpersuasive. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(1) MBA asserts that an agency interpretation of a regulation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that significantly alters the agency’s prior interpretation effectively&para;<br>amends the underlying regulation. That assertion conflicts with the&para;<br>ordinary meaning of the words “amend” and “interpret,” and it is impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law. MBA’s theory is&para;<br>particularly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veterans&para;<br>doctrine, which applies only when an agency has previously adopted&para;<br>an interpretation of its regulation. MBA fails to explain why its argument regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to&para;<br>the agency’s first interpretation. Christensen v. Harris County, 529&para;<br>U. S. 576, and Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87,&para;<br>distinguished. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>(2) MBA also contends that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine reinforces the APA’s goal of procedural fairness. But the APA already&para;<br>provides recourse to regulated entities from agency decisions that&para;<br>skirt notice-and-comment provisions by placing a variety of constraints on agency decisionmaking, e.g., the arbitrary and capricious&para;<br>standard. In addition, Congress may include safe-harbor provisions&para;<br>in legislation to shelter regulated entities from liability when they rely on previous agency interpretations. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §§259(a),&para;<br>(b)(1). Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>(3) MBA has waived its argument that the 2010 Administrator’s Interpretation should be classified as a legislative rule. From&para;<br>the beginning, this suit has been litigated on the understanding that&para;<br>the Administrator’s Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Neither&para;<br>the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed this argument&para;<br>below, and MBA did not raise it here in opposing certiorari.

See 5 U. S. C. §553(b)(A). The United States Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has nevertheless held, in a line of cases beginning with Paralyzed&para;<br>Veterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d 579 (1997),&para;<br>that an agency must use the APA’s notice-and-comment&para;<br>procedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of&para;<br>a regulation that deviates significantly from one the agency&para;<br>has previously adopted. The question in these cases is&para;<br>whether the rule announced in Paralyzed Veterans is&para;<br>consistent with the APA. We hold that it is not.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>The APA establishes the procedures federal administrative agencies use for “rule making,” defined as the process&para;<br>of “formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” §551(5).&para;<br>“Rule,” in turn, is defined broadly to include “statement[s]&para;<br>of general or particular applicability and future effect”&para;<br>that are designed to “implement, interpret, or prescribe&para;<br>law or policy.” §551(4).&para;<br>Section 4 of the APA, 5 U. S. C. §553, prescribes a threestep procedure for so-called “notice-and-comment rulemaking.” First, the agency must issue a “[g]eneral notice of&para;<br>proposed rule making,” ordinarily by publication in the&para;<br>Federal Register. §553(b). Second, if “notice [is] required,” the agency must “give interested persons an&para;<br>opportunity to participate in the rule making through&para;<br>submission of written data, views, or arguments.” §553(c).&para;<br>An agency must consider and respond to significant comments received during the period for public comment. See&para;<br>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S.&para;<br>402, 416 (1971); Thompson v. Clark, 741 F. 2d 401, 408&para;<br>(CADC 1984). Third, when the agency promulgates the&para;<br>final rule, it must include in the rule’s text “a concise&para;<br>general statement of [its] basis and purpose.” §553(c).&para;<br>Rules issued through the notice-and-comment process are&para;<br>often referred to as “legislative rules” because they have&para;<br>the “force and effect of law.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,&para;<br>441 U. S. 281, 302–303 (1979) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Not all “rules” must be issued through the notice-andcomment process. Section 4(b)(A) of the APA provides&para;<br>that, unless another statute states otherwise, the noticeand-comment requirement “does not apply” to “interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency&para;<br>organization, procedure, or practice.”&para;<br>5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§553(b)(A). The term “interpretative rule,” or “interpre-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tive rule,”1 is not further defined by the APA, and its&para;<br>precise meaning is the source of much scholarly and judicial debate. See generally Pierce, Distinguishing Legislative Rules From Interpretative Rules, 52 Admin. L. Rev.&para;<br>547 (2000); Manning, Nonlegislative Rules, 72 Geo. Wash.&para;<br>L. Rev. 893 (2004). We need not, and do not, wade into&para;<br>that debate here. For our purposes, it suffices to say that&para;<br>the critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are&para;<br>“issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s&para;<br>construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.” Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S.&para;<br>87, 99 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The&para;<br>absence of a notice-and-comment obligation makes the&para;<br>process of issuing interpretive rules comparatively easier&para;<br>for agencies than issuing legislative rules. But that convenience comes at a price: Interpretive rules “do not have&para;<br>the force and effect of law and are not accorded that&para;<br>weight in the adjudicatory process.” Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>These cases began as a dispute over efforts by the Department of Labor to determine whether mortgage-loan&para;<br>officers are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of&para;<br>1938 (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §201&para;<br>et seq. The FLSA “establishe[s] a minimum wage and&para;<br>overtime compensation for each hour worked in excess of&para;<br>40 hours in each workweek” for many employees. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk, 574 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2014) (slip op., at 3). Certain classes of employees, however, are exempt from these provisions. Among these&para;<br>exempt individuals are those “employed in a bona fide&para;<br>executive, administrative, or professional capacity . . . or&para;<br>in the capacity of outside salesman . . . .” §213(a)(1). The&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The latter is the more common phrasing today, and the one we use&para;<br>throughout this opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exemption for such employees is known as the “administrative” exemption.&para;<br>The FLSA grants the Secretary of Labor authority to&para;<br>“defin[e]” and “delimi[t]” the categories of exempt administrative employees. Ibid. The Secretary’s current regulations regarding the administrative exemption were&para;<br>promulgated in 2004 through a notice-and-comment&para;<br>rulemaking. As relevant here, the 2004 regulations differed from the previous regulations in that they contained&para;<br>a new section providing several examples of exempt administrative employees. See 29 CFR §541.203. One of the&para;<br>examples is “[e]mployees in the financial services industry,” who, depending on the nature of their day-to-day&para;<br>work, “generally meet the duties requirements for the&para;<br>administrative exception.” §541.203(b). The financial&para;<br>services example ends with a caveat, noting that “an&para;<br>employee whose primary duty is selling financial products&para;<br>does not qualify for the administrative exemption.” Ibid.&para;<br>In 1999 and again in 2001, the Department’s Wage and&para;<br>Hour Division issued letters opining that mortgage-loan&para;<br>officers do not qualify for the administrative exemption.&para;<br>See Opinion Letter, Loan Officers/Exempt Status, 6A&para;<br>LRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8351 (Feb. 16, 2001);&para;<br>Opinion Letter, Mortgage Loan Officers/Exempt Status,&para;<br>id., at 99:8249. (May 17, 1999). In other words, the Department concluded that the FLSA’s minimum wage and&para;<br>maximum hour requirements applied to mortgage-loan&para;<br>officers. When the Department promulgated its current&para;<br>FLSA regulations in 2004, respondent Mortgage Bankers&para;<br>Association (MBA), a national trade association representing real estate finance companies, requested a new opinion&para;<br>interpreting the revised regulations. In 2006, the Department issued an opinion letter finding that mortgageloan officers fell within the administrative exemption&para;<br>under the 2004 regulations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in&para;<br>No. 13–1041, pp. 70a–84a. Four years later, however, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Wage and Hour Division again altered its interpretation of&para;<br>the FLSA’s administrative exemption as it applied to&para;<br>mortgage-loan officers. Id., at 49a–69a. Reviewing the&para;<br>provisions of the 2004 regulations and judicial decisions&para;<br>addressing the administrative exemption, the Department’s 2010 Administrator’s Interpretation concluded that&para;<br>mortgage-loan officers “have a primary duty of making&para;<br>sales for their employers, and, therefore, do not qualify”&para;<br>for the administrative exemption. Id., at 49a, 69a. The&para;<br>Department accordingly withdrew its 2006 opinion letter,&para;<br>which it now viewed as relying on “misleading assumption[s] and selective and narrow analysis” of the exemption example in §541.203(b). Id., at 68a. Like the 1999,&para;<br>2001, and 2006 opinion letters, the 2010 Administrator’s&para;<br>Interpretation was issued without notice or an opportunity&para;<br>for comment.&para;<br>C&para;<br>MBA filed a complaint in Federal District Court challenging the Administrator’s Interpretation. MBA contended that the document was inconsistent with the 2004&para;<br>regulation it purported to interpret, and thus arbitrary&para;<br>and capricious in violation of §10 of the APA, 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§706. More pertinent to this case, MBA also argued that&para;<br>the Administrator’s Interpretation was procedurally invalid in light of the D. C. Circuit’s decision in Paralyzed&para;<br>Veterans, 117 F. 3d 579. Under the Paralyzed Veterans&para;<br>doctrine, if “an agency has given its regulation a definitive&para;<br>interpretation, and later significantly revises that interpretation, the agency has in effect amended its rule, something it may not accomplish” under the APA “without&para;<br>notice and comment.” Alaska Professional Hunters Assn.,&para;<br>Inc. v. FAA, 177 F. 3d 1030, 1034 (CADC 1999). Three&para;<br>former mortgage-loan officers—Beverly Buck, Ryan Henry,&para;<br>and Jerome Nickols—subsequently intervened in the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>case to defend the Administrator’s Interpretation.2&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment to the&para;<br>Department.&para;<br>Mortgage Bankers Assn. v. Solis, 864&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 193 (DC 2012). Though it accepted the parties’ characterization of the Administrator’s Interpretation&para;<br>as an interpretive rule, id., at 203, n. 7, the District Court&para;<br>determined that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine was&para;<br>inapplicable because MBA had failed to establish its reliance on the contrary interpretation expressed in the Department’s 2006 opinion letter. The Administrator’s Interpretation, the District Court further determined, was&para;<br>fully supported by the text of the 2004 FLSA regulations.&para;<br>The court accordingly held that the 2010 interpretation&para;<br>was not arbitrary or capricious.3&para;<br>The D. C. Circuit reversed. Mortgage Bankers Assn. v.&para;<br>Harris, 720 F. 3d 966 (2013). Bound to the rule of Paralyzed Veterans by precedent, the Court of Appeals rejected&para;<br>the Government’s call to abandon the doctrine. 720 F. 3d.,&para;<br>at 967, n. 1. In the court’s view, “[t]he only question”&para;<br>properly before it was whether the District Court had&para;<br>erred in requiring MBA to prove that it relied on the&para;<br>Department’s prior interpretation. Id., at 967. Explaining&para;<br>that reliance was not a required element of the Paralyzed&para;<br>Veterans doctrine, and noting the Department’s concession&para;<br>that a prior, conflicting interpretation of the 2004 regulations existed, the D. C. Circuit concluded that the 2010&para;<br>Administrator’s Interpretation had to be vacated.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 573 U. S. __ (2014), and now&para;<br>reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Buck,&para;<br>&para;<br>Henry, and Nickols are petitioners in No. 13–1052 and respondents in No. 13–1041.&para;<br>3 MBA did not challenge this aspect of the District Court’s decision on&para;<br>appeal.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>text of the APA’s rulemaking provisions, and it improperly&para;<br>imposes on agencies an obligation beyond the “maximum&para;<br>procedural requirements” specified in the APA, Vermont&para;<br>Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense&para;<br>Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 524 (1978).&para;<br>A&para;<br>The text of the APA answers the question presented.&para;<br>Section 4 of the APA provides that “notice of proposed rule&para;<br>making shall be published in the Federal Register.” 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §553(b). When such notice is required by the&para;<br>APA, “the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making.” §553(c). But §4&para;<br>further states that unless “notice or hearing is required by&para;<br>statute,” the Act’s notice-and-comment requirement “does&para;<br>not apply . . . to interpretative rules.” §553(b)(A). This&para;<br>exemption of interpretive rules from the notice-andcomment process is categorical, and it is fatal to the rule&para;<br>announced in Paralyzed Veterans.&para;<br>Rather than examining the exemption for interpretive&para;<br>rules contained in §4(b)(A) of the APA, the D. C. Circuit in&para;<br>Paralyzed Veterans focused its attention on §1 of the Act.&para;<br>That section defines “rule making” to include not only the&para;<br>initial issuance of new rules, but also “repeal[s]” or&para;<br>“amend[ments]” of existing rules. See §551(5). Because&para;<br>notice-and-comment requirements may apply even to&para;<br>these later agency actions, the court reasoned, “allow[ing]&para;<br>an agency to make a fundamental change in its interpretation of a substantive regulation without notice and&para;<br>comment” would undermine the APA’s procedural framework. 117 F. 3d, at 586.&para;<br>This reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes&para;<br>of §§1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 defines what a rulemaking is. It does not, however, say what procedures an&para;<br>agency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That is&para;<br>the purpose of §4. And §4 specifically exempts interpretive&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rules from the notice-and-comment requirements that&para;<br>apply to legislative rules. So, the D. C. Circuit correctly&para;<br>read §1 of the APA to mandate that agencies use the same&para;<br>procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used&para;<br>to issue the rule in the first instance. See FCC v. Fox&para;<br>Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 515 (2009) (the&para;<br>APA “make[s] no distinction . . . between initial agency&para;<br>action and subsequent agency action undoing or revising&para;<br>that action”). Where the court went wrong was in failing&para;<br>to apply that accurate understanding of §1 to the exemption for interpretive rules contained in §4: Because an&para;<br>agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not&para;<br>required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals that interpretive rule.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The straightforward reading of the APA we now adopt&para;<br>harmonizes with longstanding principles of our administrative law jurisprudence. Time and again, we have reiterated that the APA “sets forth the full extent of judicial&para;<br>authority to review executive agency action for procedural&para;<br>correctness.” Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S., at&para;<br>513. Beyond the APA’s minimum requirements, courts&para;<br>lack authority “to impose upon [an] agency its own notion&para;<br>of which procedures are ‘best’ or most likely to further&para;<br>some vague, undefined public good.” Vermont Yankee, 435&para;<br>U. S., at 549. To do otherwise would violate “the very&para;<br>basic tenet of administrative law that agencies should be&para;<br>free to fashion their own rules of procedure.” Id., at 544.&para;<br>These foundational principles apply with equal force to&para;<br>the APA’s procedures for rulemaking. We explained in&para;<br>Vermont Yankee that §4 of the Act “established the maximum procedural requirements which Congress was willing&para;<br>to have the courts impose upon agencies in conducting&para;<br>rulemaking procedures.” Id., at 524. “Agencies are free to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>grant additional procedural rights in the exercise of their&para;<br>discretion, but reviewing courts are generally not free to&para;<br>impose them if the agencies have not chosen to grant&para;<br>them.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine creates just such a&para;<br>judge-made procedural right: the right to notice and an&para;<br>opportunity to comment when an agency changes its&para;<br>interpretation of one of the regulations it enforces. That&para;<br>requirement may be wise policy. Or it may not. Regardless, imposing such an obligation is the responsibility of&para;<br>Congress or the administrative agencies, not the courts.&para;<br>We trust that Congress weighed the costs and benefits of&para;<br>placing more rigorous procedural restrictions on the issuance of interpretive rules. See id., at 523 (when Congress&para;<br>enacted the APA, it “settled long-continued and hardfought contentions, and enact[ed] a formula upon which&para;<br>opposing social and political forces have come to rest”&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the end, Congress&para;<br>decided to adopt standards that permit agencies to promulgate freely such rules—whether or not they are consistent with earlier interpretations. That the D. C. Circuit&para;<br>would have struck the balance differently does not permit&para;<br>that court or this one to overturn Congress’ contrary&para;<br>judgment. Cf. Law v. Siegel, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip&para;<br>op., at 11).&para;<br>III&para;<br>MBA offers several reasons why the Paralyzed Veterans&para;<br>doctrine should be upheld. They are not persuasive.&para;<br>A&para;<br>MBA begins its defense of the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine by attempting to bolster the D. C. Circuit’s reading of&para;<br>the APA. “Paralyzed Veterans,” MBA contends, “simply&para;<br>acknowledges the reality that where an agency significantly&para;<br>alters a prior, definitive interpretation of a regulation, it&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>has effectively amended the regulation itself,” something&para;<br>that under the APA requires use of notice-and-comment&para;<br>procedures. Brief for Respondent 20–21.&para;<br>The act of “amending,” however, in both ordinary parlance and legal usage, has its own meaning separate and&para;<br>apart from the act of “interpreting.” Compare Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 98 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “amend” as “[t]o&para;<br>change the wording of ” or “formally alter . . . by striking&para;<br>out, inserting, or substituting words”), with id., at 943&para;<br>(defining “interpret” as “[t]o ascertain the meaning and&para;<br>significance of thoughts expressed in words”). One would&para;<br>not normally say that a court “amends” a statute when it&para;<br>interprets its text. So too can an agency “interpret” a&para;<br>regulation without “effectively amend[ing]” the underlying&para;<br>source of law. MBA does not explain how, precisely, an&para;<br>interpretive rule changes the regulation it interprets, and&para;<br>its assertion is impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rules do not have the&para;<br>force and effect of law. See Chrysler Corp., 441 U. S., at&para;<br>302, n. 31 (citing Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 30, n. 3 (1947)); Skidmore v.&para;<br>Swift &amp; Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).&para;<br>MBA’s “interpretation-as-amendment” theory is particularly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine. Recall that the rule of Paralyzed Veterans&para;<br>applies only when an agency has previously adopted an&para;<br>interpretation of its regulation. Yet in that initial interpretation as much as all that come after, the agency is&para;<br>giving a definite meaning to an ambiguous text—the very&para;<br>act MBA insists requires notice and comment. MBA is&para;<br>unable to say why its arguments regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to the agency’s first&para;<br>interpretation.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 MBA alternatively suggests that interpretive rules have the force of&para;<br>law because an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations may be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Relying on Christensen v. Harris&para;<br>County, 529 U. S. 576 (2000), and Shalala v. Guernsey&para;<br>Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, MBA contends that we&para;<br>have already recognized that an agency may not “avoid&para;<br>notice-and-comment procedures by cloaking its actions in&para;<br>the mantle of mere ‘interpretation.’ ” Brief for Respondent&para;<br>23–24.&para;<br>Neither of the cases MBA cites supports its argument.&para;<br>Our decision in Christensen did not address a change in&para;<br>agency interpretation. Instead, we there refused to give&para;<br>deference to an agency’s interpretation of an unambiguous&para;<br>regulation, observing that to defer in such a case would&para;<br>allow the agency “to create de facto a new regulation.” 529&para;<br>U. S., at 588. Put differently, Christensen held that the&para;<br>agency interpretation at issue was substantively invalid&para;<br>because it conflicted with the text of the regulation the&para;<br>agency purported to interpret. That holding is irrelevant&para;<br>to this suit and to the Paralyzed Veterans rule, which&para;<br>assesses whether an agency interpretation is procedurally&para;<br>invalid.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>entitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997), and&para;<br>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). Even in&para;<br>cases where an agency’s interpretation receives Auer deference, however, it is the court that ultimately decides whether a given regulation&para;<br>means what the agency says. Moreover, Auer deference is not an&para;<br>inexorable command in all cases. See Christopher v. SmithKline&para;<br>Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10) (Auer deference is inappropriate “when the agency’s interpretation is plainly&para;<br>erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation” or “when there is reason&para;<br>to suspect that the agency’s interpretation does not reflect the agency’s&para;<br>fair and considered judgment” (internal quotation marks omitted));&para;<br>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.

Sidestepping this inconvenient language,&para;<br>MBA instead quotes a portion of the Court’s opinion stating that “APA rulemaking would still be required if [an&para;<br>agency] adopted a new position inconsistent with . . .&para;<br>existing regulations.” Id., at 100. But the statement on&para;<br>which MBA relies is dictum. Worse, it is dictum taken out&para;<br>of context. The “regulations” to which the Court referred&para;<br>were two provisions of the Medicare reimbursement&para;<br>scheme. And it is apparent from the Court’s description of&para;<br>these regulations in Part II of the opinion that they were&para;<br>legislative rules, issued through the notice-and-comment&para;<br>process. See id., at 91–92 (noting that the disputed regulations were codified in the Code of Federal Regulations).&para;<br>Read properly, then, the cited passage from Guernsey&para;<br>merely means that “an agency may only change its interpretation if the revised interpretation is consistent with&para;<br>the underlying regulations.” Brief for Petitioners in No.&para;<br>13–1052, p. 44.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In the main, MBA attempts to justify the Paralyzed&para;<br>Veterans doctrine on practical and policy grounds. MBA&para;<br>contends that the doctrine reinforces the APA’s goal of&para;<br>“procedural fairness” by preventing agencies from unilaterally and unexpectedly altering their interpretation of&para;<br>important regulations. Brief for Respondent 16.&para;<br>There may be times when an agency’s decision to issue&para;<br>an interpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is&para;<br>driven primarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment&para;<br>provisions. But regulated entities are not without recourse in such situations. Quite the opposite. The APA&para;<br>contains a variety of constraints on agency decisionmaking—the arbitrary and capricious standard being among&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

As we held in Fox Television Stations,&para;<br>and underscore again today, the APA requires an agency&para;<br>to provide more substantial justification when “its new&para;<br>policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those&para;<br>which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy&para;<br>has engendered serious reliance interests that must be&para;<br>taken into account. It would be arbitrary and capricious&para;<br>to ignore such matters.” 556 U. S., at 515 (citation omitted); see also id., at 535 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part&para;<br>and concurring in judgment).&para;<br>In addition, Congress is aware that agencies sometimes&para;<br>alter their views in ways that upset settled reliance interests. For that reason, Congress sometimes includes in the&para;<br>statutes it drafts safe-harbor provisions that shelter regulated entities from liability when they act in conformance&para;<br>with previous agency interpretations. The FLSA includes&para;<br>one such provision: As amended by the Portal-to-Portal&para;<br>Act of 1947, 29 U. S. C. §251 et seq., the FLSA provides&para;<br>that “no employer shall be subject to any liability” for&para;<br>failing “to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation”&para;<br>if it demonstrates that the “act or omission complained of&para;<br>was in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on&para;<br>any written administrative regulation, order, ruling,&para;<br>approval, or interpretation” of the Administrator of the&para;<br>Department’s Wage and Hour Division, even when the&para;<br>guidance is later “modified or rescinded.” §§259(a), (b)(1).&para;<br>These safe harbors will often protect parties from liability&para;<br>when an agency adopts an interpretation that conflicts&para;<br>with its previous position.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The United States acknowledged at argument that even in situations where a statute does not contain a safe-harbor provision similar&para;<br>to the one included in the FLSA, an agency’s ability to pursue enforcement actions against regulated entities for conduct in conformance with&para;<br>prior agency interpretations may be limited by principles of retroactivity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. We have no occasion to consider how&para;<br>such principles might apply here.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>MBA changes direction in the second half of its brief,&para;<br>contending that if the Court overturns the Paralyzed&para;<br>Veterans rule, the D. C. Circuit’s judgment should nonetheless be affirmed. That is so, MBA says, because the&para;<br>agency interpretation at issue—the 2010 Administrator’s&para;<br>Interpretation—should in fact be classified as a legislative&para;<br>rule.&para;<br>We will not address this argument. From the beginning, the parties litigated this suit on the understanding&para;<br>that the Administrator’s Interpretation was—as its name&para;<br>suggests—an interpretive rule. Indeed, if MBA did not&para;<br>think the Administrator’s Interpretation was an interpretive rule, then its decision to invoke the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine in attacking the rule is passing strange.&para;<br>After all, Paralyzed Veterans applied only to interpretive&para;<br>rules. Consequently, neither the District Court nor the&para;<br>D. C. Circuit considered MBA’s current claim that the&para;<br>Administrator’s Interpretation is actually a legislative&para;<br>rule. Beyond that, and more important still, MBA’s brief&para;<br>in opposition to certiorari did not dispute petitioners’&para;<br>assertions—in their framing of the question presented and&para;<br>in the substance of their petitions—that the Administrator’s Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Thus, even&para;<br>assuming MBA did not waive the argument below, it has&para;<br>done so in this Court. See this Court’s Rule 15.2; Carcieri&para;<br>v. Salazar, 555 U. S. 379, 395–396 (2009).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United&para;<br>States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reversed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

That&para;<br>depiction is accurate enough if one looks at this case in&para;<br>isolation. Considered alongside our law of deference to&para;<br>administrative determinations, however, today’s decision&para;<br>produces a balance between power and procedure quite&para;<br>different from the one Congress chose when it enacted the&para;<br>APA.&para;<br>“The [APA] was framed against a background of rapid&para;<br>expansion of the administrative process as a check upon&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>administrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried&para;<br>them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating&para;<br>their offices.” United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S.&para;<br>632, 644 (1950). The Act guards against excesses in rulemaking by requiring notice and comment. Before an&para;<br>agency makes a rule, it normally must notify the public of&para;<br>the proposal, invite them to comment on its shortcomings,&para;<br>consider and respond to their arguments, and explain its&para;<br>final decision in a statement of the rule’s basis and purpose. 5 U. S. C. §553(b)–(c); ante, at 2.&para;<br>The APA exempts interpretive rules from these requirements. §553(b)(A). But this concession to agencies&para;<br>was meant to be more modest in its effects than it is today.&para;<br>For despite exempting interpretive rules from notice and&para;<br>comment, the Act provides that “the reviewing court&para;<br>shall . . . interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,&para;<br>and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of&para;<br>an agency action.” §706 (emphasis added). The Act thus&para;<br>contemplates that courts, not agencies, will authoritatively&para;<br>resolve ambiguities in statutes and regulations. In such&para;<br>a regime, the exemption for interpretive rules does not add&para;<br>much to agency power. An agency may use interpretive&para;<br>rules to advise the public by explaining its interpretation&para;<br>of the law. But an agency may not use interpretive rules&para;<br>to bind the public by making law, because it remains the&para;<br>responsibility of the court to decide whether the law&para;<br>means what the agency says it means.&para;<br>Heedless of the original design of the APA, we have&para;<br>developed an elaborate law of deference to agencies’ interpretations of statutes and regulations. Never mentioning&para;<br>§706’s directive that the “reviewing court . . . interpret . . .&para;<br>statutory provisions,” we have held that agencies may&para;<br>authoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes. Chevron&para;<br>U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&para;<br>467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984). And never mentioning&para;<br>§706’s directive that the “reviewing court . . . determine&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410&para;<br>(1945)—held that agencies may authoritatively resolve&para;<br>ambiguities in regulations. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.&para;<br>452, 461 (1997).&para;<br>By supplementing the APA with judge-made doctrines&para;<br>of deference, we have revolutionized the import of interpretive rules’ exemption from notice-and-comment rulemaking. Agencies may now use these rules not just to&para;<br>advise the public, but also to bind them. After all, if an&para;<br>interpretive rule gets deference, the people are bound to&para;<br>obey it on pain of sanction, no less surely than they are&para;<br>bound to obey substantive rules, which are accorded similar deference. Interpretive rules that command deference&para;<br>do have the force of law.&para;<br>The Court’s reasons for resisting this obvious point&para;<br>would not withstand a gentle breeze. Even when an agency’s interpretation gets deference, the Court argues, “it is&para;<br>the court that ultimately decides whether [the text] means&para;<br>what the agency says.” Ante, at 10–11, n. 4. That is not&para;<br>quite so. So long as the agency does not stray beyond the&para;<br>ambiguity in the text being interpreted, deference compels&para;<br>the reviewing court to “decide” that the text means what&para;<br>the agency says. The Court continues that “deference is&para;<br>not an inexorable command in all cases,” because (for&para;<br>example) it does not apply to plainly erroneous interpretations. Ibid. True, but beside the point. Saying all interpretive rules lack force of law because plainly erroneous&para;<br>interpretations do not bind courts is like saying all substantive rules lack force of law because arbitrary and&para;<br>capricious rules do not bind courts. Of course an interpretive rule must meet certain conditions before it gets deference—the interpretation must, for instance, be reasonable—but once it does so it is every bit as binding as a&para;<br>substantive rule. So the point stands: By deferring to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>interpretive rules, we have allowed agencies to make&para;<br>binding rules unhampered by notice-and-comment&para;<br>procedures.&para;<br>The problem is bad enough, and perhaps insoluble if&para;<br>Chevron is not to be uprooted, with respect to interpretive&para;<br>rules setting forth agency interpretation of statutes. But&para;<br>an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations is another matter. By giving that category of interpretive rules&para;<br>Auer deference, we do more than allow the agency to make&para;<br>binding regulations without notice and comment. Because&para;<br>the agency (not Congress) drafts the substantive rules&para;<br>that are the object of those interpretations, giving them&para;<br>deference allows the agency to control the extent of its&para;<br>notice-and-comment-free domain. To expand this domain,&para;<br>the agency need only write substantive rules more&para;<br>broadly and vaguely, leaving plenty of gaps to be filled in&para;<br>later, using interpretive rules unchecked by notice and&para;<br>comment. The APA does not remotely contemplate this&para;<br>regime.&para;<br>Still and all, what are we to do about the problem? The&para;<br>Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is a courageous (indeed,&para;<br>brazen) attempt to limit the mischief by requiring an&para;<br>interpretive rule to go through notice and comment if it&para;<br>revises an earlier definitive interpretation of a regulation.&para;<br>That solution is unlawful for the reasons set forth in the&para;<br>Court’s opinion: It contradicts the APA’s unqualified exemption of interpretive rules from notice-and-comment&para;<br>rulemaking.&para;<br>But I think there is another solution—one unavailable&para;<br>to the D. C. Circuit since it involves the overruling of one&para;<br>this Court’s decisions (that being even a greater fault than&para;<br>merely ignoring the APA). As I have described elsewhere,&para;<br>the rule of Chevron, if it did not comport with the APA, at&para;<br>least was in conformity with the long history of judicial&para;<br>review of executive action, where “[s]tatutory ambiguities&para;<br>. . . were left to reasonable resolution by the Executive.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

And, it has been applied to an agency interpretation that was inconsistent with a previous interpretation of the same regulation. See Long Island Care at&para;<br>Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 170–171 (2007). It has&para;<br>been applied to formal and informal interpretations alike,&para;<br>including those taken during litigation. See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997). Its reasoning has also&para;<br>been extended outside the context of traditional agency&para;<br>regulations into the realm of criminal sentencing. See&para;<br>Stinson v. United States, 508 U.

See Christensen v.&para;<br>Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 588 (2000). We rejected that&para;<br>request for deference as an effort, “under the guise of&para;<br>interpreting a regulation, to create de facto a new regulation.” Ibid. This narrow limit on the broad deference&para;<br>given the agency interpretations, though sound, could not&para;<br>save a doctrine that was constitutionally infirm from the&para;<br>start.

Administrator of General Services, 433&para;<br>U. S. 425, 442 (1977). As the history shows, that approach&para;<br>runs the risk of compromising our constitutional&para;<br>structure.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Constitution’s particular blend of separated powers&para;<br>and checks and balances was informed by centuries of&para;<br>political thought and experiences. See M. Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 38, 168–169 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1998) (Vile). Though the theories of the separation of&para;<br>powers and checks and balances have roots in the ancient&para;<br>world, events of the 17th and 18th centuries played a&para;<br>crucial role in their development and informed the men&para;<br>who crafted and ratified the Constitution.&para;<br>Over a century before our War of Independence, the&para;<br>English Civil War catapulted the theory of the separation&para;<br>of powers to prominence. As political theorists of the day&para;<br>witnessed the conflict between the King and Parliament,&para;<br>and the dangers of tyrannical government posed by each,&para;<br>they began to call for a clear division of authority between&para;<br>the two. Id., at 44–45, 48–49. A 1648 work titled The&para;<br>Royalist’s Defence offered perhaps the first extended&para;<br>account of the theory of the separation of powers:&para;<br>“[W]hilst the Supreamacy, the Power to Judge the Law,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>and Authority to make new Lawes, are kept in severall&para;<br>hands, the known Law is preserved, but united, it is vanished, instantly thereupon, and Arbytrary and Tyrannicall&para;<br>power is introduced.” The Royalist’s Defence 80 (1648)&para;<br>(italics in original).&para;<br>John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu endorsed and&para;<br>expanded on this concept. See Vile 63–64. They agreed&para;<br>with the general theory set forth in The Royalist’s Defence, emphasizing the need for a separation of powers to&para;<br>protect individual liberty. J. Locke, Second Treatise of&para;<br>Civil Government §§143–144, p. 72 (J. Gough ed. 1947);&para;<br>Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152&para;<br>(O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949). But they also advocated a system of checks and balances to reinforce that&para;<br>separation. Vile 72–73, 102. For instance, they agreed&para;<br>that the executive should have the power to assemble and&para;<br>dismiss the legislature and to consent to laws passed by it.&para;<br>See Locke, supra, §§151, 156, at 75, 77–78; Montesquieu,&para;<br>Spirit of the Laws, at 157, 159. Montesquieu warned that&para;<br>“power should be a check to power” lest the legislature&para;<br>“arrogate to itself what authority it pleased . . . [and] soon&para;<br>destroy all the other powers.” Id., at 150, 157.&para;<br>The experience of the States during the period between&para;<br>the War of Independence and the ratification of the Constitution confirmed the wisdom of combining these theories. Although many State Constitutions of the time&para;<br>included language unequivocally endorsing the separation&para;<br>of powers, they did not secure that separation with checks&para;<br>and balances, Vile 147, and actively placed traditional&para;<br>executive and judicial functions in the legislature,&para;<br>G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776–&para;<br>1787, pp. 155–156 (1969). Under these arrangements,&para;<br>state legislatures arrogated power to themselves and&para;<br>began to confiscate property, approve the printing of paper&para;<br>money, and suspend the ordinary means for the recovery&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Id., at 403–409.3&para;<br>When the Framers met for the Constitutional Convention, they understood the need for greater checks and&para;<br>balances to reinforce the separation of powers. As Madison remarked, “experience has taught us a distrust” of the&para;<br>separation of powers alone as “a sufficient security to each&para;<br>[branch] [against] encroachments of the others.” 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 77 (M. Farrand&para;<br>rev. 1966). “[I]t is necessary to introduce such a balance of&para;<br>powers and interests, as will guarantee the provisions on&para;<br>paper.” Ibid. The Framers thus separated the three main&para;<br>powers of Government—legislative, executive, and judicial—into the three branches created by Articles I, II, and&para;<br>III. But they also created checks and balances to reinforce&para;<br>that separation. For example, they gave Congress specific&para;<br>enumerated powers to enact legislation, Art. I, §8, but&para;<br>gave the President the power to veto that legislation,&para;<br>subject to congressional override by a supermajority vote,&para;<br>Art. I, §7, cls. 2, 3. They gave the President the power to&para;<br>appoint principal officers of the United States, but gave&para;<br>the Senate the power to give advice and consent to those&para;<br>appointments. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. They gave the House and&para;<br>Senate the power to agree to adjourn for more than three&para;<br>days, Art. I, §5, cl. 4, but gave the President the power, “in&para;<br>Case of Disagreement between them,” to adjourn the&para;<br>Congress “to such Time as he shall think proper.” Art. II,&para;<br>§3, cl. 3. During the ratification debates, Madison argued&para;<br>that this structure represented “the great security” for&para;<br>liberty in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 51, p. 321&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The practices of the time can perhaps best be summarized by the&para;<br>following commentary from a contemporaneous magazine: “[S]o many&para;<br>legal infractions of sacred right—so many public invasions of private&para;<br>property—so many wanton abuses of legislative powers!” Giles Hickory&para;<br>(Noah Webster), Government, The American Magazine, Mar. 1788, p.&para;<br>206.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.

They were&para;<br>practical and real protections for individual liberty in the&para;<br>new Constitution. See Mistretta v. United States, 488&para;<br>U. S. 361, 426 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[The Constitution] is a prescribed structure, a framework, for the&para;<br>conduct of government. In designing that structure, the&para;<br>Framers themselves considered how much commingling [of&para;<br>governmental powers] was, in the generality of things,&para;<br>acceptable, and set forth their conclusions in the document”).&para;<br>The Judiciary—no less than the other two&para;<br>branches—has an obligation to guard against deviations&para;<br>from those principles. The Seminole Rock line of precedent is one such deviation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Seminole Rock raises two related constitutional concerns. It represents a transfer of judicial power to the&para;<br>Executive Branch, and it amounts to an erosion of the&para;<br>judicial obligation to serve as a “check” on the political&para;<br>branches.&para;<br>1&para;<br>When a party properly brings a case or controversy to&para;<br>an Article III court, that court is called upon to exercise&para;<br>the “judicial Power of the United States.” Art.

See generally&para;<br>Molot, The Judicial Perspective in the Administrative&para;<br>State: Reconciling Modern Doctrines of Deference with the&para;<br>Judiciary’s Structural Role, 53 Stan. L.

As&para;<br>James Madison explained, “All new laws, though penned&para;<br>with the greatest technical skill and passed on the fullest&para;<br>and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or&para;<br>less obscure and equivocal . . . .” The Federalist No. 37,&para;<br>at 229.&para;<br>The judicial power was understood to include the power&para;<br>to resolve these ambiguities over time. See ibid. Alexander Hamilton lauded this power, arguing that “[t]he interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of&para;<br>the courts.” Id., No. 78, at 467. It is undoubtedly true&para;<br>that the other branches of Government have the authority&para;<br>and obligation to interpret the law, but only the judicial&para;<br>interpretation would be considered authoritative in a&para;<br>judicial proceeding. Vile 360.&para;<br>Although the Federalists and Anti-Federalists engaged&para;<br>in a public debate about this interpretive power, that&para;<br>debate centered on the dangers inherent in the power, not&para;<br>on its allocation under the Constitution. See, e.g., Letters&para;<br>from The Federal Farmer XV (Jan. 18, 1788), in 2 The&para;<br>Complete Anti-Federalist 315–316 (H. Storing ed. 1981)&para;<br>(arguing that the interpretive power made the Judiciary&para;<br>the most dangerous branch). Writing as “Brutus,” one&para;<br>leading anti-Federalist argued that judges “w[ould] not&para;<br>confine themselves to any fixed or established rules, but&para;<br>w[ould] determine, according to what appears to them, the&para;<br>reason and spirit of the constitution.” Essays of Brutus&para;<br>(Jan. 31, 1788), in 2 id., at 420. The Federalists rejected&para;<br>these arguments, assuring the public that judges would be&para;<br>guided “by strict rules and precedents which serve to&para;<br>define and point out their duty in every particular case&para;<br>that comes before them.” The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A.&para;<br>Hamilton). Those rules included principles of interpretation that had been set out by jurists for centuries. See,&para;<br>e.g., 2 S. von Pufendorf, De Officio Hominis Et Civis Juxta&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v.

Blackstone, Commentaries on&para;<br>the Laws of England 59–61 (1765).&para;<br>One of the key elements of the Federalists’ arguments in&para;<br>support of the allocation of power to make binding interpretations of the law was that Article III judges would&para;<br>exercise independent judgment. Although “judicial independence” is often discussed in terms of independence&para;<br>from external threats, the Framers understood the concept&para;<br>to also require independence from the “internal threat” of&para;<br>“human will.” P. Hamburger, Law and Judicial Duty 507,&para;<br>508 (2008); see also The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (A.&para;<br>Hamilton) (“The judiciary . . . may truly be said to have&para;<br>neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment . . . ”).&para;<br>Independent judgment required judges to decide cases in&para;<br>accordance with the law of the land, not in accordance&para;<br>with pressures placed upon them through either internal&para;<br>or external sources. Internal sources might include personal biases, while external sources might include pressure from the political branches, the public, or other&para;<br>interested parties. See Hamburger, supra, at 508–521.&para;<br>The Framers made several key decisions at the Convention with these pressures in mind. For example, they&para;<br>rejected proposals to include a federal council of revision&para;<br>after several participants at the Convention expressed&para;<br>concern that judicial involvement in such a council would&para;<br>foster internal biases. Rufus King of Maryland, for example, asserted that “the Judges ought to be able to expound&para;<br>the law as it should come before them, free from the bias&para;<br>of having participated in its formation.” 1 Records of the&para;<br>Federal Convention of 1787, at 98. Alexander Hamilton&para;<br>repeated these concerns in The Federalist, arguing that&para;<br>“the judges, who are to be interpreters of the law, might&para;<br>receive an improper bias from having given a previous&para;<br>opinion in their revisionary capacities” or “be induced to&para;<br>embark too far in the political views of [the Executive]”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

The Federalist No.&para;<br>73, at 446; see also Hamburger, supra, at 508–512.&para;<br>The Framers also created structural protections in the&para;<br>Constitution to free judges from external influences. They&para;<br>provided, for example, that judges should “hold their&para;<br>Offices during good Behaviour” and receive “a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.” Art. III, §1. Hamilton noted that such&para;<br>unequivocal language had been shown necessary by the&para;<br>experience of the States, where similar state constitutional&para;<br>protections for judges had not been “sufficiently definite&para;<br>to preclude legislative evasions” of the separation of the&para;<br>judicial power. The Federalist No. 79, at 472. Because&para;<br>“power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over&para;<br>his will,” he argued that Article III’s structural protections&para;<br>would help ensure that judges fulfilled their constitutional&para;<br>role. Ibid. (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>The Framers made the opposite choice for legislators&para;<br>and the Executive. Instead of insulating them from external pressures, the Constitution tied them to those pressures. It provided for election of Members of the House of&para;<br>Representatives every two years, Art. I, §2, cl. 1; and&para;<br>selection of Members of the Senate every six years, Art. I,&para;<br>§3, cl. 1. It also provided for the President to be subject to&para;<br>election every four years. Art. II, §1, cl. 1. “The President&para;<br>is [thus] directly dependent on the people, and since there&para;<br>is only one President, he is responsible. The people know&para;<br>whom to blame . . . .” See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S.&para;<br>654, 729 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). To preserve that&para;<br>accountability, we have held that executive officers must&para;<br>be subject to removal by the President to ensure accountability within the Executive Branch. See Free Enterprise&para;<br>Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561&para;<br>U. S. 477, 495 (2010); see also Morrison, supra, at 709&para;<br>(opinion of SCALIA, J.)

The Constitution prescribes&para;<br>that they all are”).&para;<br>Given these structural distinctions between the branches,&para;<br>it is no surprise that judicial interpretations are definitive in cases and controversies before the courts. Courts&para;<br>act as “an intermediate body between the people and the&para;<br>legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the&para;<br>latter within the limits assigned to their authority.” Federalist No. 78, at 467 (A. Hamilton). The Legislature and&para;<br>Executive may be swayed by popular sentiment to abandon the strictures of the Constitution or other rules of law.&para;<br>But the Judiciary, insulated from both internal and external sources of bias, is duty bound to exercise independent&para;<br>judgment in applying the law.&para;<br>Interpreting agency regulations calls for that exercise of&para;<br>independent judgment. Substantive regulations have the&para;<br>force and effect of law. See, e.g., United States v. Mead&para;<br>Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 231–232 (2001).4 Agencies and pri——————&para;<br>4 These cases also raise constitutional questions about the distinction&para;<br>in administrative law between “substantive” (or “legislative”) and&para;<br>interpretative rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit has defined a legislative rule as “[a]n agency action that purports to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated&para;<br>parties” and an interpretative rule as “[a]n agency action that merely&para;<br>interprets a prior statute or regulation, and does not itself purport to&para;<br>impose new obligations or prohibitions or requirements on regulated&para;<br>parties.” National Mining Assn. v. McCarthy, 758 F. 3d 243, 251–252&para;<br>(2014). And our precedents make clear that administrative agencies&para;<br>must exercise only executive power in promulgating these rules.&para;<br>Arlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 13, n. 4).&para;<br>But while it is easy to see the promulgation of interpretative rules as&para;<br>an “executive” function—executive officials necessarily interpret the&para;<br>laws they enforce—it is difficult to see what authority the President&para;<br>has “to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated&para;<br>parties.” That definition suggests something much closer to the legislative power, which our Constitution does not permit the Executive to&para;<br>exercise in this manner. Because these troubling questions are not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Just as it is critical&para;<br>for judges to exercise independent judgment in applying&para;<br>statutes, it is critical for judges to exercise independent&para;<br>judgment in determining that a regulation properly covers&para;<br>the conduct of regulated parties. Defining the legal meaning of the regulation is one aspect of that determination.&para;<br>Seminole Rock deference, however, precludes judges&para;<br>from independently determining that meaning. Rather&para;<br>than judges’ applying recognized tools of interpretation to&para;<br>determine the best meaning of a regulation, this doctrine&para;<br>demands that courts accord “controlling weight” to the&para;<br>agency interpretation of a regulation, subject only to the&para;<br>narrow exception for interpretations that are plainly&para;<br>erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. That deference amounts to a transfer of the judge’s exercise of interpretive judgment to the agency. See 1 S. Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language 499 (4th ed. 1773)&para;<br>(defining “[d]efer” as “to leave to another’s judgment”).&para;<br>But the agency, as part of the Executive Branch, lacks the&para;<br>structural protections for independent judgment adopted&para;<br>by the Framers, including the life tenure and salary protections of Article III. Because the agency is thus not&para;<br>properly constituted to exercise the judicial power under&para;<br>the Constitution, the transfer of interpretive judgment&para;<br>raises serious separation-of-powers concerns.&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>directly implicated here, I leave them for another case.

That check is the&para;<br>enforcement of the rule of law through the exercise of&para;<br>judicial power.&para;<br>Judges have long recognized their responsibility to&para;<br>apply the law, even if they did not conceive of it as a&para;<br>“check” on political power.

Under this justification,&para;<br>deference to administrative agencies is necessary when a&para;<br>“regulation concerns ‘a complex and highly technical regulatory program’ in which the identification and classification of relevant ‘criteria necessarily require significant&para;<br>expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in&para;<br>policy concerns.’ ” Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U.

The proper question faced by courts&para;<br>in interpreting a regulation is not what the best policy&para;<br>choice might be, but what the regulation means.

See 5 U. S. C. §556.&para;<br>Today, however, formal rulemaking is the Yeti of administrative law.&para;<br>There are isolated sightings of it in the ratemaking context, but elsewhere it proves elusive. It is somewhat ironic for the Court so adamantly to insist that agencies be subject to no greater procedures than&para;<br>those required by the APA when we have not been adamant in requiring agencies to comply with even those baseline procedures. See United&para;<br>States v. Florida East Coast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973)&para;<br>(concluding that the APA’s formal procedures, which were to apply&para;<br>“[w]hen rules are required by statute to be made on the record after&para;<br>opportunity for an agency hearing,” §553(c), were not triggered by a&para;<br>statute that permitted an agency to engage in rulemaking only “ ‘after&para;<br>[a] hearing’ ”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

S. 281, 295 (1979), such regulations should&para;<br>be interpreted like any other law. Thus, we should “assum[e] that the ordinary meaning of the regulation’s&para;<br>language expresses” its purpose and enforce it “according&para;<br>to its terms.” See Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.&para;<br>Co., 560 U. S. 242, 251 (2010) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Judges are at least as well suited as administrative agencies to engage in this task. Cf. Marbury, 1&para;<br>Cranch, at 177 (“It is emphatically the province and duty&para;<br>of the judicial department to say what the law is”). Indeed, judges are frequently called upon to interpret the&para;<br>meaning of legal texts and are able to do so even when&para;<br>those texts involve technical language. See, e.g., Barber v.&para;<br>Gonzales, 347 U. S. 637, 640–643 (1954) (interpreting&para;<br>deportation statute according to technical meaning).&para;<br>Fundamentally, the argument about agency expertise is&para;<br>less about the expertise of agencies in interpreting language than it is about the wisdom of according agencies&para;<br>broad flexibility to administer statutory schemes.6 “But&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Many decisions of this Court invoke agency expertise as a justification for deference. This argument has its root in the support for administrative agencies that developed during the Progressive Era in this&para;<br>country. The Era was marked by a move from the individualism that&para;<br>had long characterized American society to the concept of a society&para;<br>organized for collective action. See A. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the&para;<br>Progressive Era 1910–1917, p. 1 (1954). That move also reflected a&para;<br>deep disdain for the theory of popular sovereignty. As Woodrow Wilson&para;<br>wrote before he attained the presidency, “Our peculiar American&para;<br>difficulty in organizing administration is not the danger of losing&para;<br>liberty, but the danger of not being able or willing to separate its&para;<br>essentials from its accidents. Our success is made doubtful by that&para;<br>besetting error of ours, the error of trying to do too much by vote.”&para;<br>Wilson, The Study of Administration, 2 Pol. Sci. Q. 197, 214 (1887). In&para;<br>President Wilson’s view, public criticism would be beneficial in the&para;<br>formation of overall policy, but “a clumsy nuisance” in the daily life of&para;<br>Government—“a rustic handling delicate machinery.” Id., at 215.&para;<br>Reflecting this belief that bureaucrats might more effectively govern&para;<br>the country than the American people, the progressives ushered in&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v.

See Martin v.&para;<br>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, 499 U. S.&para;<br>144, 152–153 (1991). Under this justification, “[b]ecause&para;<br>the Secretary [of Labor] promulgates th[e] standards, the&para;<br>Secretary is in a better position . . . to reconstruct the&para;<br>purpose of the regulations in question.” Id., at 152.&para;<br>This justification rings hollow. This Court has afforded&para;<br>Seminole Rock deference to agency interpretations even&para;<br>when the agency was not the original drafter. See Pauley,&para;<br>501 U. S., at 696–698 (applying Seminole Rock deference&para;<br>to one agency’s interpretation of another agency’s regulations because Congress had delegated authority to both to&para;<br>administer the program). It has likewise granted Seminole Rock deference to agency interpretations that are&para;<br>inconsistent with interpretations adopted closer in time to&para;<br>the promulgation of the regulations. See, e.g., Long Island&para;<br>Care at Home, 551 U. S., at 170–171.&para;<br>Even if the scope of Seminole Rock deference more&para;<br>closely matched the original-drafter justification, it would&para;<br>still fail. It is the text of the regulations that have the&para;<br>force and effect of law, not the agency’s intent. “Citizens&para;<br>——————&para;<br>significant expansions of the administrative state, ultimately culminating in the New Deal.

See, e.g., Martin, 499 U. S., at 151. The theory is that, “[b]ecause&para;<br>applying an agency’s regulation to complex or changing&para;<br>circumstances calls upon the agency’s unique expertise&para;<br>and policymaking prerogatives, . . . the power authoritatively to interpret its own regulations is a component of&para;<br>the agency’s delegated lawmaking powers.” Ibid.&para;<br>This justification fails because Congress lacks authority&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>to delegate the power. As we have explained in an analogous context, “[t]he structure of the Constitution does not&para;<br>permit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Congress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it&para;<br>does not possess.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726&para;<br>(1986). Similarly, the Constitution does not empower&para;<br>Congress to issue a judicially binding interpretation of the&para;<br>Constitution or its laws. Lacking the power itself, it cannot delegate that power to an agency.&para;<br>To hold otherwise would be to vitiate the separation of&para;<br>powers and ignore the “sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power . . . [that]&para;<br>triumphed among the Framers of the new Federal Constitution.” Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211,&para;<br>221 (1995). As this Court has explained, the “essential&para;<br>balance” of the Constitution is that the Legislature is&para;<br>“possessed of power to ‘prescrib[e] the rules by which the&para;<br>duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,’ but&para;<br>the power of ‘[t]he interpretation of the laws’ [is] ‘the&para;<br>proper and peculiar province of the courts.’ ” Id., at 222&para;<br>(citation omitted; third brackets added). Although the&para;<br>Constitution imposes a duty on all three branches to&para;<br>interpret the laws within their own spheres, the power to&para;<br>create legally binding interpretations rests with the Judiciary. See Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177, 179–180.&para;<br>D&para;<br>A final proposed justification for Seminole Rock deference is that too much oversight of administrative matters&para;<br>would imperil the “independence and esteem” of judges.&para;<br>See, e.g., Charles Evans Hughes, Speech before the Elmira&para;<br>Chamber of Commerce, May 3, 1907, in Addresses of&para;<br>Charles Evans Hughes, 1906–1916, p. 185 (2d ed. 1916).&para;<br>The argument goes that questions of administration are&para;<br>those which “lie close to the public impatience,” id., at 186,&para;<br>and thus the courts’ resolution of such questions could&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

The Judicial Branch is separate from the political branches for a reason: It has the&para;<br>obligation to apply the law to cases and controversies that&para;<br>come before it, and concerns about the popular esteem of&para;<br>individual judges—or even the Judiciary as a whole—have&para;<br>no place in that analysis. Our system of Government&para;<br>could not long survive absent adherence to the written&para;<br>Constitution that formed it.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Although on the surface these cases require only a&para;<br>straightforward application of the APA, closer scrutiny&para;<br>reveals serious constitutional questions lurking beneath.
