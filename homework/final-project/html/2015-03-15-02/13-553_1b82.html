CSX&para;<br>TRANSPORTATION, INC.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–553.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 9, 2014—Decided March 4, 2015&para;<br>&para;<br>Alabama imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase&para;<br>or consume diesel fuel, but exempts from those taxes trucking&para;<br>transport companies (motor carriers) and companies that transport&para;<br>goods interstate through navigable waters (water carriers), both railroad competitors. Motor carriers pay an alternative fuel-excise tax&para;<br>on diesel, but water carriers pay neither the sales tax nor the excise&para;<br>tax. Respondent (CSX), an interstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its&para;<br>diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State’s asymmetrical tax&para;<br>treatment “discriminates against a rail carrier” in violation of the&para;<br>Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4–R&para;<br>Act, 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(4). This Court held that a tax “discriminates” under subsection (b)(4) when it treats “groups [that] are similarly situated” differently without sufficient “justification for the difference in treatment,” CSX Transp. v. Ala. Dept. of Revenue, 562&para;<br>U. S. 277, 287 (CSX I). On remand, the District Court rejected CSX’s&para;<br>claim. Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish&para;<br>discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors, but rejected Alabama’s argument that imposing a fuel-excise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, justified imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not motor carriers.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX’s competitors&para;<br>are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection (b)(4) claim.&para;<br>All general and commercial taxpayers may be an appropriate comparison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim, but it is not the only one.&para;<br>Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word “discrimination” sug-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>gests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the&para;<br>population at large. Context confirms this reading. The 4–R Act is&para;<br>an “asymmetrical statute.” CSX I, supra, at 296. In subsections&para;<br>(b)(1) to (b)(3)—which specify prohibitions directed toward property&para;<br>taxes—the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial&para;<br>property in the same assessment jurisdiction. But subsection (b)(4)&para;<br>contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is to be determined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.&para;<br>Thus, when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared&para;<br>to its transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class. Because subsection (b)(4) requires a showing of discrimination, however, the comparison class&para;<br>must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.&para;<br>Subsection (b)(4) would be deprived of all real-world effect if “similarly situated” were given the same narrow construction the concept&para;<br>has in the Equal Protection Clause context, where it would be permissible for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier,&para;<br>despite their seemingly similar lines of business. The category of&para;<br>“similarly situated” (b)(4) comparison classes must at least include&para;<br>the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other subsections. But it also can include a railroad’s competitors. Discrimination in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“discrimination” and frustrates the 4–R Act’s purpose of “restor[ing]&para;<br>the financial stability of the [Nation’s] railway system” while “foster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes&para;<br>of transportation,” 90 Stat. 33. Contrary to Alabama’s argument,&para;<br>normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation&para;<br>to “commercial and industrial” in the first three provisions, and its&para;<br>absence in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the&para;<br>fourth. Alabama’s additional arguments are also unavailing. Pp. 4–&para;<br>8.&para;<br>2. The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales&para;<br>and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuelexcise tax. It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that&para;<br>a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt&para;<br>from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail&para;<br>carrier is exempt, since both competitors could then claim to be discriminated against relative to each other. The Court’s negative&para;<br>Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional&para;<br>tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.&para;<br>Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472, 479–480. Similarly, an alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that&para;<br>renders a tax disparity non-discriminatory. CSX’s counterarguments&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>are rejected. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit is to consider whether&para;<br>Alabama’s fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama’s sales&para;<br>tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier&para;<br>sales-tax exemption. Although the State cannot offer a similar defense with respect to its water carrier exemption, the court should also examine whether any of the State’s alternative rationales justify&para;<br>that exemption.

But it rejected Ala­&para;<br>bama’s argument that the fuel-excise taxes offset the sales&para;<br>taxes—in other words, that because it imposed its fuelexcise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, it was&para;<br>justified in imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not&para;<br>motor carriers.

Ibid.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The 4–R Act provides:&para;<br>“(b) The following acts unreasonably burden and&para;<br>discriminate against interstate commerce, and a&para;<br>State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a&para;<br>State or subdivision of a State may not do any of&para;<br>them:&para;<br>“(1) Assess rail transportation property at a value&para;<br>that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the&para;<br>rail transportation property than the ratio that the&para;<br>assessed value of other commercial and industrial&para;<br>property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to&para;<br>the true market value of the other commercial and in­&para;<br>dustrial property.&para;<br>“(2) Levy or collect a tax that may not be made un­&para;<br>der paragraph (1) of this subsection.&para;<br>“(3) Levy or collect an ad valorem property tax at a&para;<br>tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to com­&para;<br>mercial and industrial property in the same assess­&para;<br>ment jurisdiction.&para;<br>“(4) Impose another tax that discriminates against a&para;<br>rail carrier providing transportation subject to the&para;<br>jurisdiction of the Board under this part.” §11501(b)&para;<br>(1)–(4).&para;<br>In our last opinion in this case, we held that “discrimi­&para;<br>nates” in subsection (b)(4) carries its ordinary meaning,&para;<br>and that a tax discriminates under subsection (b)(4) when&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>it treats “groups [that] are similarly situated” differently&para;<br>without sufficient “justification for the difference in treat­&para;<br>ment.” CSX I, supra, at 287. Here, we address the mean­&para;<br>ing of these two quoted phrases.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The first question in this case is who is the “comparison&para;<br>class” for purposes of a subsection (b)(4) claim. Alabama&para;<br>argues that the only appropriate comparison class for a&para;<br>subsection (b)(4) claim is all general commercial and&para;<br>industrial taxpayers. We disagree. While all general and&para;<br>commercial taxpayers is an appropriate comparison class,&para;<br>it is not the only one.&para;<br>Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word “discrimi­&para;<br>nation” suggests that it occurs only when the victim is&para;<br>singled out relative to the population at large. If, for&para;<br>example, a State offers free college education to all return­&para;<br>ing combat veterans, but arbitrarily excepts those who&para;<br>served in the Marines, we would say that Marines have&para;<br>experienced discrimination. That would remain the case&para;<br>even though the Marines are treated the same way as&para;<br>members of the general public, who have to pay for their&para;<br>education.&para;<br>Context confirms that the comparison class for subsec­&para;<br>tion (b)(4) is not limited as Alabama suggests. The 4–R&para;<br>Act is an “asymmetrical statute.” Id., at 296. Subsections&para;<br>(b)(1) to (b)(3) contain three specific prohibitions directed&para;<br>towards property taxes. Each requires comparison of&para;<br>railroad property to commercial and industrial property in&para;<br>the same assessment jurisdiction. The Act therefore limits&para;<br>the comparison class for challenges under those provi­&para;<br>sions. Even if the jurisdiction treats railroads less favorably than residential property, no violation of these subsec­&para;<br>tions has occurred. Subsection (b)(4) contains no such&para;<br>limitation, leaving the comparison class to be determined&para;<br>as it is normally determined with respect to discrimination&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>claims. And we think that depends on the theory of dis­&para;<br>crimination alleged in the claim. When a railroad alleges&para;<br>that a tax targets it for worse treatment than local busi­&para;<br>nesses, all other commercial and industrial taxpayers are&para;<br>the comparison class. When a railroad alleges that a tax&para;<br>disadvantages it compared to its competitors in the trans­&para;<br>portation industry, the railroad’s competitors in that&para;<br>jurisdiction are the comparison class.&para;<br>So, picking a comparison class is extraordinarily easy.&para;<br>Unlike under subsections (b)(1)–(3), the railroad is not&para;<br>limited to all commercial and industrial taxpayers; all the&para;<br>world, or at least all the world within the taxing jurisdic­&para;<br>tion, is its comparison-class oyster. But that is not as&para;<br>generous a concession as might seem. What subsection&para;<br>(b)(4) requires, and subsections (b)(1)–(3) do not, is a&para;<br>showing of discrimination—of a failure to treat similarly&para;<br>situated persons alike. A comparison class will thus sup­&para;<br>port a discrimination claim only if it consists of individuals&para;<br>similarly situated to the claimant.&para;<br>That raises the question of when a proposed comparison&para;<br>class qualifies as similarly situated. In the Equal Protec­&para;<br>tion Clause context, very few taxpayers are regarded as&para;<br>similarly situated and thus entitled to equal treatment.&para;<br>There, a State may tax different lines of businesses differ­&para;<br>ently with near-impunity, even if they are apparently&para;<br>similar. We have upheld or approved of distinctions be­&para;<br>tween utilities—including a railroad—and other corpora­&para;<br>tions, New York Rapid Transit Corp. v. City of New York,&para;<br>303 U. S. 573, 579 (1938), between wholesalers and retail­&para;<br>ers in goods, Caskey Baking Co. v. Virginia, 313 U.

CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Oil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114, 121 (1910). As one treatise&para;<br>has observed, we recognize a “wide latitude state legisla­&para;<br>tures enjoy in drawing tax classifications under the Equal&para;<br>Protection Clause.” 1 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein,&para;<br>State Taxation ¶3.03[1], p. 3–5 (3d ed. 2001–2005). This&para;<br>includes the power to impose “widely different taxes on&para;<br>various trades or professions.” Id., at 3–5 to 3–6. It would&para;<br>be permissible—as far as the Equal Protection Clause is&para;<br>concerned—for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a&para;<br>motor carrier, despite the seeming similarity in their lines&para;<br>of business.&para;<br>The concept of “similarly situated” individuals cannot be&para;<br>so narrow here. That would deprive subsection (b)(4) of all&para;<br>real-world effect, providing protection that the Equal&para;<br>Protection Clause already provides. Moreover, the category of “similarly situated” (b)(4) comparison classes must&para;<br>include commercial and industrial taxpayers. There is no&para;<br>conceivable reason why the statute would forbid property&para;<br>taxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but&para;<br>permit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class&para;<br>vis-à-vis railroads. And we think the competitors of rail­&para;<br>roads can be another “similarly situated” comparison&para;<br>class, since discrimination in favor of that class most&para;<br>obviously frustrates the purpose of the 4–R Act, which was&para;<br>to “restore the financial stability of the railway system of&para;<br>the United States,” §101(a), 90 Stat. 33, while “foster[ing]&para;<br>competition among all carriers by railroad and other&para;<br>modes of transportation,” §101(b)(2). We need not, and&para;<br>thus do not, express any opinion on what other comparison&para;<br>classes may qualify. Sufficient unto the day is the evil&para;<br>thereof.&para;<br>Alabama claims that because subsections (b)(1) and&para;<br>(b)(3) (and (b)(2) through reference to (b)(1)) establish a&para;<br>comparison class of “commercial and industrial property,”&para;<br>subsection (b)(4) must establish a comparison class of&para;<br>“general commercial and industrial taxpayers.” This&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>inverts normal rules of interpretation, which would say&para;<br>that the explicit limitation to “commercial and industrial”&para;<br>in the first three provisions, and the absence of such a&para;<br>limitation in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation&para;<br>applies to the fourth. Moreover, Alabama’s interpretation&para;<br>would require us to dragoon the modifier “commercial and&para;<br>industrial”—but not the noun “property”—from the first&para;<br>three provisions, append “general” in front of it and “tax­&para;<br>payers” after, both words foreign to the preceding subsec­&para;<br>tions. We might also have to strip away the restrictions in&para;<br>the definition of “commercial and industrial property,”&para;<br>which excludes land primarily used for agricultural pur­&para;<br>poses and timber growing. 49 U. S. C. §11501(a)(4). This&para;<br>is not our concept of fidelity to a statute’s text.&para;<br>Alabama responds that the introductory clause of&para;<br>§11501(b)—which declares that the “following acts unrea­&para;<br>sonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce,”—“binds its four subsections together,” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 23 (emphasis deleted), and gives them a com­&para;<br>mon object and scope. The last time this case appeared&para;<br>before us, Alabama made a similar argument in support of&para;<br>the claim that, because subsections (b)(1)–(3) cover only&para;<br>property taxes, so too does subsection (b)(4). See Brief for&para;<br>Respondents in CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of&para;<br>Revenue, O. T. 2010, No. 09–520, p. 25–26. We rejected&para;<br>this argument then, and we reject it again now.&para;<br>Alabama persists that a case-specific inquiry allows a&para;<br>railroad to “hand-pick [its] comparison class,” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 41, which would be unfair—a “windfall” to&para;<br>railroads. Ibid. As we have described above, picking a&para;<br>class is easy, but it is not easy to establish that the selected&para;<br>class is “similarly situated” for purposes of discrimina­&para;<br>tion in taxation. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded&para;<br>that, in light of CSX Transportation’s complaint and the&para;<br>parties’ stipulation, a comparison class of competitors&para;<br>consisting of motor carriers and water carriers was appro­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>priate, and differential treatment vis-à-vis that class&para;<br>would constitute discrimination. We therefore turn to&para;<br>the court’s refusal to consider Alabama’s alternative tax&para;<br>justifications.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A State’s tax discriminates only where the State cannot&para;<br>sufficiently justify differences in treatment between simi­&para;<br>larly situated taxpayers. As we have discussed above, a&para;<br>rail carrier and its competitors can be considered similarly&para;<br>situated for purposes of this provision. But what about&para;<br>the claim that those competitors are subject to other taxes&para;<br>that the railroads avoid? We think Alabama can justify its&para;<br>decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use&para;<br>tax through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuelexcise tax.&para;<br>It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say&para;<br>that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival&para;<br>who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable&para;<br>tax from which the rail carrier is exempt. If that were&para;<br>true, both competitors could claim to be disfavored—&para;<br>discriminated against—relative to each other. Our nega­&para;<br>tive Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that&para;<br>an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise&para;<br>discriminatory tax. Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S.&para;<br>472, 479–480 (1932). We think that an alternative, roughly&para;<br>equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders&para;<br>a tax disparity nondiscriminatory.&para;<br>CSX claims that because the statutory prohibition for­&para;<br>bids “impos[ing] another tax that discriminates against a&para;<br>rail carrier,” 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(4)—“tax” in the singu­&para;<br>lar—the appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged tax&para;<br>discriminates, not whether the tax code as a whole does so.&para;<br>It is undoubtedly correct that the “tax” (singular) must&para;<br>discriminate—but it does not discriminate unless it treats&para;<br>railroads differently from other similarly situated taxpay­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ers without sufficient justification. A comparable tax&para;<br>levied on a competitor may justify not extending that&para;<br>competitor’s exemption from a general tax to a railroad. It&para;<br>is easy to display the error of CSX’s single-tax-provision&para;<br>approach. Under that model, the following tax would&para;<br>violate the 4–R Act: “(1) All railroads shall pay a 4% sales&para;<br>tax. (2) All other individuals shall also pay a 4% sales&para;<br>tax.”&para;<br>CSX would undoubtedly object that not every case will&para;<br>be so easy, and that federal courts are ill qualified to&para;<br>explore the vagaries of state tax law. We are inclined to&para;<br>agree, but that cannot carry the day. Congress assigned&para;<br>this task to the courts by drafting an antidiscrimination&para;<br>command in such sweeping terms. There is simply no&para;<br>discrimination when there are roughly comparable taxes.&para;<br>If the task of determining when that is so is “Sisyphean,”&para;<br>as the Eleventh Circuit called it, 720 F. 3d, at 871, it is a&para;<br>Sisyphean task that the statute imposes. We therefore&para;<br>cannot approve of the Eleventh Circuit’s refusal to consider&para;<br>Alabama’s tax-based justification, and remand for that&para;<br>court to consider whether Alabama’s fuel-excise tax is the&para;<br>rough equivalent of Alabama’s sales tax as applied to&para;<br>diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier salestax exemption.&para;<br>C&para;<br>While the State argues that the existence of a fuelexcise tax justifies its decision to exempt motor carriers&para;<br>from the sales and use tax, it cannot offer a similar de­&para;<br>fense with respect to its exemption for water carriers.&para;<br>Water carriers pay neither tax.&para;<br>The State, however, offers other justifications for the&para;<br>water carrier exemption—for example, that such an ex­&para;<br>emption is compelled by federal law.

OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.&para;<br>Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, the meaning of&para;<br>which is best understood by reference to the provisions&para;<br>that precede it. Subsection (b) begins by announcing that&para;<br>“[t]he following acts . . . discriminate against interstate&para;<br>commerce” and are prohibited. §11501(b). Subsections&para;<br>(b)(1) through (3) then list three tax-related actions that&para;<br>single out rail carriers by treating rail property differently&para;<br>from all other commercial and industrial property.&para;<br>§§11501(b)(1)–(3); id., at 300. Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3)&para;<br>explicitly identify “commercial and industrial property” as&para;<br>the comparison class, and subsection (b)(2) incorporates&para;<br>that comparison class by reference. §11501(b); id., at 300.&para;<br>Subsection (b)(4) refers back to these provisions when it&para;<br>forbids “[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates&para;<br>against a rail carrier.” §11501(b)(4) (emphasis added); id.,&para;<br>at 300). The statutory structure therefore supports the&para;<br>conclusion that a tax “discriminates against a rail carrier”&para;<br>within the meaning of subsection (b)(4) if it singles out&para;<br>railroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the&para;<br>general class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. Id.,&para;<br>at 300–301.&para;<br>The statutory background supports the same conclusion.&para;<br>When Congress enacted the 4–R Act, it was apparent that&para;<br>railroads were “easy prey for State and local tax assessors&para;<br>in that they are nonvoting, often nonresident, targets for&para;<br>local taxation, who cannot easily remove themselves from&para;<br>the locality.” Id., at 301 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) thus “establish a&para;<br>political check” by preventing States from imposing exces­&para;<br>sive property taxes on railroads “without imposing the&para;<br>same taxes more generally on voting, resident local busi­&para;<br>nesses.” Ibid. Subsection (b)(4) is best understood as&para;<br>addressing the same problem in the same way. Id., at&para;<br>301–302.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>Alabama’s tax scheme cannot be said to “discriminat[e]&para;<br>against a rail carrier.” Id., at 302. To begin, the scheme&para;<br>does not single out rail carriers. Although one would not&para;<br>know it from the majority opinion, the tax is not directed&para;<br>at rail carriers, their property, their activity, or goods&para;<br>uniquely consumed by them. It is instead a generally&para;<br>applicable sales tax. It applies (with other exemptions not&para;<br>at issue here) to all goods purchased, used, or stored in the&para;<br>State of Alabama. Ala. Code §§40–23–2(1), 40–23–61(a)&para;<br>(2011). The only relevant good exempted from the tax is&para;<br>diesel on which the motor fuel tax has been paid, §40–17–&para;<br>325(b), and no provision of law prevents rail carriers from&para;<br>buying such diesel. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 13&para;<br>(acknowledging that CSX pays the motor fuel tax on the&para;<br>diesel fuel it uses in trucks and other on-road vehicles). Water carriers, it is true, enjoy a special carve-out&para;<br>from this sales tax, §40–23–4(a)(10) (Cum. Supp. 2014),&para;<br>but that exemption singles out water carriers, not rail&para;<br>carriers.&para;<br>Even if this constellation of exemptions to Alabama’s&para;<br>sales tax could be said to single out rail carriers from the&para;<br>general class of their interstate competitors, the tax surely&para;<br>does not single out rail carriers as compared to commercial&para;<br>and industrial taxpayers. Those taxpayers are subject to&para;<br>exactly the same generally applicable sales and use tax&para;<br>regime as are rail carriers.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court started off on the wrong track in CSX I when&para;<br>it relied on a generic dictionary definition of “discrimi­&para;<br>nates” in the face of a statutory context suggesting a more&para;<br>specific definition. See 562 U. S., at 304. Today’s decision&para;<br>continues that error.&para;<br>The Court uncritically accepts the conclusion that the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“discriminat[ion]” addressed by the statute encompasses&para;<br>any distinction between rail carriers and their comparison&para;<br>class, ante, at 4, as opposed to mere “singling out” or some­&para;<br>thing in between, even though the word “discriminates”&para;<br>is ambiguous in that way. CSX I, supra, at 299. The&para;<br>Court’s usual practice has not been to treat the meaning&para;<br>of “discriminates” so casually. See generally Guardians&para;<br>Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of New York City, 463 U. S.&para;<br>582, 590–593 (1983) (opinion of White, J.) (discussing&para;<br>the Court’s shifting definition of the ambiguous term&para;<br>“discrimination”).&para;<br>Today’s decision compounds this error by holding that a&para;<br>rail carrier may make out a claim of discrimination using&para;<br>any comparison class so long as that class consists of&para;<br>“individuals similarly situated to the claimant” rail carrier.&para;<br>Ante, at 5. The majority purports to derive this limitation from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to&para;<br>proceed: After all, Black’s Law Dictionary contains no&para;<br>entry defining what it means to be “similarly situated” for&para;<br>the purpose of subsection (b)(4). Forced finally to turn to&para;<br>the statutory context, the majority rejects the statutorily&para;<br>defined competitor class of commercial and industrial&para;<br>taxpayers in favor of a shifting comparison class of its own&para;<br>creation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The majority disregards the commercial and industrial&para;<br>property comparison class identified in subsections (b)(1)&para;<br>through (3) because subsection (b)(4) does not explicitly&para;<br>include language from those provisions. See ante, at 4–5,&para;<br>6–7. It asserts that defining the comparison class for the&para;<br>purpose of subsection (b)(4) by reference to the comparison&para;<br>class identified in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) “would&para;<br>require us to dragoon the modifier ‘commercial and indus­&para;<br>trial’—but not the noun ‘property’—from the first three&para;<br>provisions, append ‘general’ in front of it and ‘taxpayers’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>after, both words foreign to the preceding subsections.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7.&para;<br>The majority’s accusation of grammatical conscription&para;<br>misses the point. Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause,&para;<br>explicitly marked as such by the use of the word “another.”&para;<br>See Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.&para;<br>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003).&para;<br>Like other residual clauses, it need not use the same&para;<br>language as the clauses it follows to derive meaning from&para;<br>those clauses. See, e.g., Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U. S. 277,&para;<br>___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); James v. United States, 550&para;<br>U. S. 192, 217–218 (2007) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Where,&para;<br>as here, a residual clause includes an ambiguous word like&para;<br>“discriminates,” we must look to the clauses that precede&para;<br>it to guide our understanding of its scope.&para;<br>In some sense, my task in giving meaning to the statu­&para;<br>tory term “discriminates” is no different from the major­&para;<br>ity’s: to determine what type of differential treatment the&para;<br>statute forbids. The first three clauses provide important&para;<br>clues that the statute forbids singling out rail carriers&para;<br>from other commercial and industrial taxpayers because&para;<br>commercial and industrial taxpayers are the ones who pay&para;<br>taxes on “commercial and industrial property.” The major­&para;<br>ity pursues the same logical train of thought when it&para;<br>opines that “the category of ‘similarly situated’ (b)(4)&para;<br>comparison classes must include commercial and industrial taxpayers” because “[t]here is no conceivable reason&para;<br>why the statute would forbid property taxes higher than&para;<br>what that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes&para;<br>that discriminate in favor of that class vis-à-vis railroads.”&para;<br>Ante, at 6. Where we part ways is in the inferences we&para;<br>draw from the statutory context.&para;<br>Treating subsection (b)(4) as a residual clause does not&para;<br>require the grammatical distortions that the majority&para;<br>alleges. The word “discriminates” in subsection (b)(4) is&para;<br>not a referential phrase whose antecedent is uncertain. If&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>it were, then it would be necessary to select an antecedent&para;<br>that would fit grammatically in place of “discriminates.”&para;<br>Instead, I look to (b)(1) to (3) merely to clarify an ambiguity in the meaning of “discriminates,” a task that does not&para;<br>require me to “dragoon” the language of the prior clauses&para;<br>into subsection (b)(4).&para;<br>Nor does my approach rely on the first three clauses of&para;<br>§11501(b) to supply a general limitation on the independ­&para;<br>ent prohibition that appears in subsection (b)(4). See&para;<br>United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)&para;<br>(criticizing this type of argument). That is what Alabama&para;<br>sought to do in CSX I when it argued that subsection (b)(4)&para;<br>is limited to property taxes (or their equivalent “in lieu”&para;<br>taxes). Ante, at 7; CSX I, 562 U. S., at 285 (majority opin­&para;<br>ion). I joined the majority in rejecting that argument. Id.,&para;<br>at 297 (dissenting opinion). But whereas there is no un­&para;<br>certainty about the meaning of “taxes” in subsection (b)(4)&para;<br>that would justify importing the property tax limitation&para;<br>from the three preceding subsections, id., at 284–285&para;<br>(majority opinion), there is a good deal of uncertainty&para;<br>about the meaning of “discriminates.” This uncertainty&para;<br>justifies looking to the three previous clauses to under­&para;<br>stand the type of differential treatment §11501(b) is&para;<br>meant to prohibit. Id., at 298–299 (dissenting opinion);&para;<br>see Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 588–&para;<br>589 (1980). And those three previous clauses easily supply&para;<br>the answer to the comparison class question.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Unwilling to so limit the range of available comparison&para;<br>classes, the majority takes an approach to determining&para;<br>which individuals are “similarly situated” for purposes of&para;<br>the statute that “is almost entirely ad hoc,” James, supra,&para;<br>at 215 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It asserts that the compar­&para;<br>ison class will “depen[d] on the theory of discrimination&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>alleged in the claim.” Ante, at 4–5. Sometimes the com­&para;<br>parison class will be “all other commercial and industrial&para;<br>taxpayers,” sometimes it will be “the railroad’s competi­&para;<br>tors” in a particular jurisdiction, and sometimes it may be&para;<br>some other comparison class entirely. Id., at 5.&para;<br>The sole evidence on which the majority relies to con­&para;<br>clude that competitors are similarly situated, and there­&para;<br>fore qualify as a comparison class, is the professed pur­&para;<br>poses of the Act: “to ‘restore the financial stability of the&para;<br>railway system of the United States,’ while ‘foster[ing]&para;<br>competition among all carriers by railroad and other&para;<br>modes of transportation.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting 90 Stat. 33,&para;<br>§§101(a), (b)(2)). Interpreting statutory text solely in light&para;<br>of purpose, absent any reliance on text or structure, is&para;<br>dangerous business because it places courts in peril of&para;<br>substituting their policy judgment for that of Congress. In&para;<br>considering statutory purpose, therefore, we should be&para;<br>careful that any inferences of purpose are tied to text&para;<br>rather than instinct.&para;<br>The majority throws such caution to the wind. Its twosentence argument is a perfect illustration of the dangers&para;<br>of a purely purpose-based approach. The majority cherrypicks two of a number of stated goals of a complex piece of&para;<br>legislation over 100 pages long and assumes that this&para;<br>specific provision was assigned to those specific purposes.&para;<br>And then it interprets the statute to perform in the man­&para;<br>ner the majority believes is best designed to “restore . . .&para;<br>financial stability” and “foster . . . competition.” Ante, at 6&para;<br>(alteration omitted).&para;<br>I have no reason to doubt the economic soundness of the&para;<br>majority’s conclusion that discrimination between rail&para;<br>carriers and their competitors threatens their financial&para;<br>stability and impedes competition, but I lack the majority’s certitude that §11501(b)(4) is designed to further those&para;<br>goals by combatting that evil, at least in the way the ma­&para;<br>jority asserts. Instead, the first three subsections provide&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>strong textual evidence that §11501(b) was designed to&para;<br>stabilize rail carriers by protecting them from discrimina­&para;<br>tion against interstate commerce. And they provide evi­&para;<br>dence of Congress’ chosen mechanism for accomplishing&para;<br>that goal: tying the fate of interstate rail carriers to the&para;<br>broader class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. See&para;<br>supra, at 2.&para;<br>The introductory clause of §11501(b) provides further&para;<br>evidence that the evil at which subsection (b)(4) is targeted is not discrimination between rail carriers and their&para;<br>competitors, but “acts [that] unreasonably burden and&para;<br>discriminate against interstate commerce.” The majority’s&para;<br>response to this evidence—that the Court rejected a simi­&para;<br>lar argument when it refused to limit subsection (b)(4) to&para;<br>property taxes or their kin, ante, at 7—is a non sequitur.&para;<br>The introductory clause contains no reference to property&para;<br>taxes that “binds its four subsections together” as prohibi­&para;<br>tions on discriminatory property taxes. Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). But it does have a reference to&para;<br>discrimination against interstate commerce, which does&para;<br>tie the sections together to serve that common statutory&para;<br>purpose. This, in turn, weighs against the majority’s&para;<br>inferences about how §11501(b) relates to the stated pur­&para;<br>poses of the 4–R Act.&para;<br>The majority’s conclusion that competitors are a permis­&para;<br>sible comparison class completely ignores these contextual&para;<br>clues, permitting subsection (b)(4) to serve different statu­&para;<br>tory goals by a different mechanism than its three prede­&para;<br>cessor clauses. And it leads to odd inconsistencies. If we&para;<br>were to understand the provision as prohibiting only&para;<br>discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors,&para;<br>then it might well further the goal of promoting competi­&para;<br>tion between interstate carriers. But the majority instead&para;<br>selects a shifting-comparison-class approach, requiring&para;<br>rail carriers to be treated at least as well as their competi­&para;<br>tors and any other similarly situated taxpayers. See ante,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at 4–5. This most-favored taxpayer status is a position the&para;<br>competitors do not enjoy, so the majority’s position could&para;<br>result in tax schemes that impede competition between&para;<br>interstate carriers rather than promote it.&para;<br>Identifying “similarly situated” taxpayers by the undis­&para;<br>ciplined approach the majority endorses could well lead to&para;<br>other unanticipated consequences. This is why the policy&para;<br>judgments needed to link statutory mechanisms to statu­&para;<br>tory purposes are best left to Congress. If this Court is&para;<br>going to adopt a shifting-comparison-class approach to&para;<br>§11501(b)(4), then it should at least demand a stronger&para;<br>textual link between the comparison class a claimant&para;<br>seeks to import into subsection (b)(4) and any purpose that&para;<br>the claimant argues it serves.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Because the majority adopts an interpretation of&para;<br>§11501(b)(4) that is not grounded in the text, it should&para;<br>come as no surprise that this interpretation is difficult to&para;<br>apply, as this case demonstrates. It is easy to see how,&para;<br>accepting water carriers as a comparison class, the scheme&para;<br>treats water carriers and rail carriers differently when it&para;<br>grants water carriers, but not rail carriers, an exemption&para;<br>from the sales tax. Ala. Code §40–23–4(a)(10). Identifying&para;<br>the difference in treatment between rail and motor carriers, by contrast, requires a good deal more imagination.&para;<br>The majority’s approach exhibits that imagination. It&para;<br>glosses over the general applicability of the provisions that&para;<br>apply to rail and motor carriers, stating that “[t]he State&para;<br>applies the [sales or use] tax, at the usual 4% rate, to&para;<br>railroads’ purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail oper­&para;<br>ations,” but “exempts from the tax purchases and uses of&para;<br>diesel fuel made by [motor carriers].” Ante, at 1. A quick&para;<br>glimpse at the code reveals that this is not quite the case.&para;<br>The applicability of the sales and use taxes does not de­&para;<br>pend on the identity of the purchaser, but on whether the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>purchaser pays another excise tax, §40–17–325(b), which&para;<br>in turn depends on the nature of the product purchased&para;<br>and its use, §§40–17–328, 40–17–329, which in turn merely&para;<br>correlates to the carriers’ operations.&para;<br>As far as I can tell, the rail carriers use dyed diesel that&para;<br>is exempt from the motor fuel tax—and therefore subject&para;<br>to the sales and use taxes—as a matter of choice rather&para;<br>than necessity. Dyed diesel has no special properties that&para;<br>make it more suitable for use in a train engine; the dye&para;<br>merely identifies it as exempt from the federal excise tax,&para;<br>§40–17–322(21). And no law prohibits rail carriers from&para;<br>using undyed diesel. To the contrary, it is the motor&para;<br>carriers who are prohibited from using the dyed variant&para;<br>for on-road use.&para;<br>Assuming arguendo that state law provides that only&para;<br>dyed diesel may be used in rail operations, it becomes a&para;<br>little easier to make an argument that the State treats rail&para;<br>carriers differently in this case. But the majority still&para;<br>faces a line-drawing problem. Is it necessary that the good&para;<br>subject to the challenged tax be the same as the good on&para;<br>which the competitor enjoys an exemption? Could a rail&para;<br>carrier that relies on natural gas rather than diesel for&para;<br>motive power make the same claim of discrimination if&para;<br>natural gas is not entitled to the same sales-tax exemption&para;<br>as diesel? Is it necessary that the rail carrier and its&para;<br>competitor rely on the good for the same purpose? Could a&para;<br>rail carrier that uses diesel for motive power challenge a&para;<br>hypothetical provision that exempted from the sales and&para;<br>use taxes diesel that motor carriers use for refrigeration in&para;<br>refrigerated trailers?&para;<br>The majority never answers these questions. “Sufficient&para;<br>unto the day is the evil thereof,” it intones. Ante, at 6.&para;<br>“That gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it&para;<br>utterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: pro­&para;<br>vide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the” statute&para;<br>is applied consistently. James, 550 U.
