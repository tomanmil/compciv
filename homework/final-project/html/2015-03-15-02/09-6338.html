UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–6338. Argued March 30, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010&para;<br>In 1993, petitioner Dillon was convicted of, inter alia, crack and powder&para;<br>cocaine offenses, which produced a base offense level of 38 and a&para;<br>Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months’ imprisonment. The court&para;<br>sentenced him at the bottom of the range for those counts. After the&para;<br>Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the base&para;<br>offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine, USSG&para;<br>Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706, and made that amendment retroactive,&para;<br>USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713, Dillon moved for a sentence reduc&para;<br>tion under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2). That provision authorizes a&para;<br>district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a&para;<br>Guidelines amendment if a reduction is consistent with the Commis&para;<br>sion’s policy statements. The relevant policy statement, USSG&para;<br>§1B1.10, precludes a court from reducing a sentence “to a term that is&para;<br>less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range” except in&para;<br>limited circumstances. In addition to the two-level reduction author&para;<br>ized by the amendment, Dillon sought a variance below the amended&para;<br>Guidelines range, contending that United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.&para;<br>220, authorized the exercise of such discretion. The District Court&para;<br>imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised range but declined to&para;<br>grant a further reduction. Finding Booker inapplicable to §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>proceedings, the court concluded that the Commission’s directives in&para;<br>§1B1.10 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended&para;<br>Guidelines range. The Third Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Booker’s holdings do not apply to §3582(c)(2) proceedings and&para;<br>therefore do not require treating §1B1.10(b) as advisory. Pp. 6–14.&para;<br>(a) The statute’s text and narrow scope belie Dillon’s characteriza&para;<br>tion of proceedings under §3582(c)(2) as “resentencing” proceedings&para;<br>governed by the same principles as other sentencing proceedings. In&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>stead, §3582(c)(2) authorizes only a limited adjustment to an other&para;<br>wise final sentence. This conclusion is further supported by the sub&para;<br>stantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence&para;<br>modification proceedings, charging it with determining whether and&para;<br>to what extent a Guidelines amendment will be retroactive, 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §994(u), and authorizing a court to grant a reduction under&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) only “if [it] is consistent with applicable policy statements&para;<br>issued by the Sentencing Commission.” Section 3582(c)(2) estab&para;<br>lishes a two-step inquiry: A court must (1) determine the scope of the&para;<br>reduction, if any, authorized by §1B1.10, and then (2) consider&para;<br>whether the authorized reduction is warranted according to the ap&para;<br>plicable §3553(a) factors. At step one, the court must follow the&para;<br>Commission’s instructions in §1B1.10 to impose a term of imprison&para;<br>ment within the amended Guidelines range unless the sentencing&para;<br>court originally imposed a below-Guidelines sentence. §1B1.10(b)(2).&para;<br>Because reference to §3553(a) is appropriate only at step two, that&para;<br>provision does not transform §3582(c)(2) proceedings into plenary re&para;<br>sentencing proceedings. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(b) Given §3582(c)(2)’s limited scope and purpose, proceedings un&para;<br>der that section do not implicate Booker. The section represents a&para;<br>congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of&para;<br>later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guide&para;<br>lines. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a&para;<br>judge at a §3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the pre&para;<br>scribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge’s ex&para;<br>ercise of discretion within that range. That exercise does not contra&para;<br>vene the Sixth Amendment, even if it is informed by judge-found&para;<br>facts. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481. Thus, Dillon’s&para;<br>Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Court’s&para;<br>adherence to §1B1.10’s instruction to consider a reduction only within&para;<br>the amended Guidelines range. Dillon’s argument that Booker’s re&para;<br>medial opinion nonetheless requires the Guidelines to be treated as&para;<br>advisory in such proceedings is unpersuasive given that proceedings&para;<br>under §3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing&para;<br>proceedings. Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(c) Also rejected is Dillon’s argument that the District Court should&para;<br>have corrected other mistakes in his original sentence, namely, a&para;<br>Booker error resulting from the initial sentencing court’s treatment of&para;<br>the Guidelines as mandatory and an alleged error in the calculation&para;<br>of his criminal-history category. Because those aspects of Dillon’s&para;<br>sentence were not affected by the crack-cocaine Guidelines amend&para;<br>ment, they are outside the scope of the §3582(c)(2) proceeding, and&para;<br>the District Court properly declined to address them.

S. C.&para;<br>§3582(c). Congress has provided an exception to that rule&para;<br>“in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a&para;<br>term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that&para;<br>has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com&para;<br>mission.” §3582(c)(2). In those circumstances, §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>authorizes a court to reduce the term of imprisonment “if&para;<br>such a reduction is consistent with” applicable Commis&para;<br>sion policy statements. The policy statement governing&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) proceedings instructs courts not to reduce a&para;<br>term of imprisonment below the minimum of an amended&para;<br>sentencing range except to the extent the original term of&para;<br>imprisonment was below the range then applicable. See&para;<br>United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual&para;<br>§1B1.10(b)(2) (Nov. 2009) (USSG). This case presents the&para;<br>question whether our decision in United States v. Booker,&para;<br>543 U. S. 220 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advi&para;<br>sory to remedy the Sixth Amendment problems associated&para;<br>with a mandatory sentencing regime, requires treating&para;<br>§1B1.10(b) as nonbinding. We conclude that Booker does&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not demand that result.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA or Act), 98&para;<br>Stat. 1987, established the Sentencing Commission and&para;<br>authorized it to promulgate Sentencing Guidelines and to&para;<br>issue policy statements regarding the Guidelines’ applica&para;<br>tion. See 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994(a). The Act also charged&para;<br>the Commission with periodically reviewing and revising&para;<br>the Guidelines. See §994(o). When a revision reduces the&para;<br>Guidelines range for a given offense, the Commission must&para;<br>determine “in what circumstances and by what amount&para;<br>the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment&para;<br>for the offense may be reduced.” §994(u).&para;<br>As enacted, the SRA made the Sentencing Guidelines&para;<br>binding. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 233–234. Except in&para;<br>limited circumstances, district courts lacked discretion to&para;<br>depart from the Guidelines range. See Burns v. United&para;<br>States, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991). Under that regime, facts&para;<br>found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence often&para;<br>increased the mandatory Guidelines range and permitted&para;<br>the judge to impose a sentence greater than that sup&para;<br>ported by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty&para;<br>plea. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 235. We held in Booker&para;<br>that treating the Guidelines as mandatory in these cir&para;<br>cumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of crimi&para;<br>nal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every&para;<br>element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt. Id., at 243–244.&para;<br>To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the&para;<br>Guidelines advisory by invalidating two provisions of the&para;<br>SRA: 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which&para;<br>generally required a sentencing court to impose a sentence&para;<br>within the applicable Guidelines range, and §3742(e)&para;<br>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of&para;<br>review on appeal, including de novo review of Guidelines&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>departures. 543 U. S., at 259. “With these two sections&para;<br>excised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections&para;<br>consequently invalidated),” we held that “the remainder of&para;<br>the Act satisfies the Court’s constitutional requirements.”&para;<br>Ibid. Booker thus left intact other provisions of the SRA,&para;<br>including those giving the Commission authority to revise&para;<br>the Guidelines, 28 U. S. C. §994(o) (2006 ed.), and to de&para;<br>termine when and to what extent a revision will be retro&para;<br>active, §994(u).&para;<br>With respect to drug-trafficking offenses, the Sentencing&para;<br>Guidelines establish a defendant’s base offense level ac&para;<br>cording to the type and weight of the drug. See USSG&para;<br>§§2D1.1(a), (c). When the Commission first promulgated&para;<br>the Guidelines in 1987, it adopted the 100-to-1 ratio se&para;<br>lected by Congress in setting mandatory minimum sen&para;<br>tences in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207.&para;<br>Under that framework, the Commission “treated every&para;<br>gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of&para;<br>powder cocaine.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.&para;<br>85, 96 (2007). The Commission later sought to alleviate&para;<br>the disparity produced by this ratio. After several failed&para;<br>attempts at reform, see id., at 99, the Commission in 2007&para;<br>amended the Guidelines to reduce by two levels the base&para;<br>offense level associated with each quantity of crack co&para;<br>caine. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov.&para;<br>1, 2007). In 2008, the Commission made that amendment&para;<br>retroactive. See id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).&para;<br>When the Commission makes a Guidelines amendment&para;<br>retroactive, 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2) authorizes a district&para;<br>court to reduce an otherwise final sentence that is based&para;<br>on the amended provision. Any reduction must be consis&para;<br>tent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sen&para;<br>tencing Commission.&para;<br>The relevant policy statement,&para;<br>USSG §1B1.10, instructs courts proceeding under&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) to substitute the amended Guidelines range&para;<br>while “leav[ing] all other guideline application decisions&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unaffected.” §1B1.10(b)(1).1 Under §3582(c)(2), a court&para;<br>may then grant a reduction within the amended Guide&para;<br>lines range if it determines that one is warranted “after&para;<br>considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the&para;<br>extent that they are applicable.”2 Except in limited cir&para;<br>cumstances, however, §1B1.10(b)(2)(A) forecloses a court&para;<br>acting under §3582(c)(2) from reducing a sentence “to a&para;<br>term that is less than the minimum of the amended guide&para;<br>line range.”&para;<br>II&para;<br>A jury convicted petitioner Percy Dillon in 1993 of con&para;<br>spiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to&para;<br>distribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine and&para;<br>more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21&para;<br>U. S. C. §846, possession with the intent to distribute&para;<br>more than 500 grams of powder cocaine in violation of&para;<br>§841(a)(1), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a&para;<br>drug-trafficking offense in violation of 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(c)(1). Dillon’s convictions exposed him to a statutory&para;<br>sentencing range of 10 years to life for the conspiracy, 5&para;<br>to-40 years for cocaine possession, and a mandatory mini&para;<br>mum sentence of 5 years for the firearm offense, to be&para;<br>served consecutively to the sentence for the drug offenses.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Sentencing Commission substantially revised §1B1.10 in March&para;<br>2008, see USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 712 (Nov. 2009) (effective Mar. 3,&para;<br>2008), roughly three months before the District Court’s decision in this&para;<br>case. Because the current version of the relevant Guidelines provisions&para;<br>is not meaningfully different from the version in effect at the time of&para;<br>the District Court’s decision, references in this opinion are to the&para;<br>current, 2009 edition of the Guidelines.&para;<br>2 Section 3553(a) provides that a “court shall impose a sentence suffi&para;<br>cient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set&para;<br>forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,” and it enumerates several&para;<br>factors a court “shall consider” in determining an appropriate sentence,&para;<br>including “the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history&para;<br>and characteristics of the defendant,” §3553(a)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>At sentencing, the District Court made additional find&para;<br>ings of fact and concluded that Dillon was responsible for&para;<br>1.5 kilograms of crack and 1.6 kilograms of powder co&para;<br>caine. Under USSG §2D1.1, those drug quantities pro&para;<br>duced a base offense level of 38. After offsetting adjust&para;<br>ments for acceptance of responsibility, §3E1.1, and&para;<br>reckless endangerment during flight, §3C1.2, Dillon’s total&para;<br>offense level remained 38. Coupled with a criminal&para;<br>history category of II,3 that offense level produced a then&para;<br>mandatory Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months’ im&para;<br>prisonment for the drug counts.&para;<br>The court sentenced Dillon at the bottom of the Guide&para;<br>lines range for those counts, followed by a mandatory 60&para;<br>month sentence for the firearm count, for a total sentence&para;<br>of 322 months’ imprisonment. At Dillon’s sentencing, the&para;<br>court described the term of imprisonment as “entirely too&para;<br>high for the crime [Dillon] committed.” App. 13. Perceiv&para;<br>ing no basis for departing from the then-mandatory Sen&para;<br>tencing Guidelines, the District Court felt constrained to&para;<br>impose a sentence within the prescribed range. The Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Dillon’s convic&para;<br>tions and sentence on appeal. See 100 F. 3d 949 (1996).&para;<br>After the Sentencing Commission made the amendment&para;<br>to the crack-cocaine Guidelines retroactive in 2008, Dillon&para;<br>filed a pro se motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to&para;<br>§3582(c)(2). In the motion, Dillon asked the court to grant&para;<br>not just the two-level reduction authorized by the amend&para;<br>ment but also a further reduction consistent with the&para;<br>sentencing factors found in §3553(a). Based largely on his&para;<br>postsentencing conduct, including his determined pursuit&para;<br>of educational and community-outreach opportunities,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Probation Office based Dillon’s criminal-history assessment on&para;<br>two prior misdemeanor convictions, one for possession of marijuana and&para;<br>one for resisting arrest. Dillon did not object to that calculation of his&para;<br>criminal-history score.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Dillon contended that a variance from the amended Guide&para;<br>lines range was warranted in his case. He further urged&para;<br>that, after Booker, the court was authorized to grant such&para;<br>a variance because the amended Guidelines range was&para;<br>advisory notwithstanding any contrary statement in&para;<br>§1B1.10.&para;<br>The District Court reduced Dillon’s sentence to 270&para;<br>months—the term at the bottom of the revised Guidelines&para;<br>range.4 But the court declined to go further. Concluding&para;<br>that the sentencing proceedings at issue in Booker are&para;<br>readily distinguishable from those under §3582(c)(2), the&para;<br>court found Booker’s holdings inapplicable to the instant&para;<br>proceeding and accordingly held that it lacked authority to&para;<br>impose a sentence inconsistent with §1B1.10.&para;<br>The Third Circuit affirmed. 572 F. 3d 146, 150 (2009).&para;<br>The court noted that §3582(c)(2) is codified in a different&para;<br>section than the provisions invalidated in Booker and&para;<br>contains no cross-reference to those provisions. Finding&para;<br>no other indication that Booker “obviate[d] the congres&para;<br>sional directive in §3582(c)(2) that a sentence reduction&para;<br>pursuant to that section be consistent with Sentencing&para;<br>Commission policy statements,” 572 F. 3d, at 149, the&para;<br>Third Circuit held that §1B1.10 is binding. It therefore&para;<br>agreed that the District Court lacked authority to reduce&para;<br>Dillon’s sentence below the amended Guidelines range.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to consider Booker’s applicability&para;<br>to §3582(c)(2) proceedings. 558 U.

Section 3582(c)(2) establishes an ex&para;<br>ception to the general rule of finality “in the case of a&para;<br>defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprison&para;<br>ment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently&para;<br>been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §994(o)” and made retroactive pursuant to&para;<br>§994(u). In such cases, Congress has authorized courts to&para;<br>“reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the&para;<br>factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they&para;<br>are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with appli&para;<br>cable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commis&para;<br>sion.” §3582(c)(2).&para;<br>Characterizing proceedings under §3582(c)(2) as “resen&para;<br>tencing” proceedings, Dillon contends that “[t]here is no&para;<br>practical or functional difference between a resentencing&para;<br>pursuant to §3582(c)(2) and any other resentencing.” Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 18. Accordingly, Dillon urges, the same&para;<br>principles that govern other sentencing proceedings like&para;<br>wise govern §3582(c)(2) proceedings, and courts have&para;<br>authority under §3582(c)(2) to vary from the revised&para;<br>Guidelines range consistent with §3553(a), see&para;<br>Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 101. Dillon cites as support for&para;<br>this view §3582(c)(2)’s instruction to consider the factors&para;<br>in §3553(a) in determining whether a sentence reduction&para;<br>is warranted. Under Dillon’s approach, Booker would&para;<br>preclude the Commission from issuing a policy statement&para;<br>that generally forecloses below-Guidelines sentences at&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) proceedings, as USSG §1B1.10 purports to do.&para;<br>Dillon thus asks us to excise the mandatory language of&para;<br>§1B1.10(b)(2)(A) and treat that provision as advisory, just&para;<br>as we did the offending statutory provisions in Booker.&para;<br>The language of §3582(c)(2) belies Dillon’s characteriza&para;<br>tion of proceedings under that section. By its terms,&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentenc&para;<br>ing proceeding. Instead, it provides for the “modif[ication&para;<br>of] a term of imprisonment” by giving courts the power to&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“reduce” an otherwise final sentence in circumstances&para;<br>specified by the Commission.&para;<br>Compare 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§994(a)(2)(C) (referring to §3582(c)(2) as a “sentence modi&para;<br>fication provisio[n]”), with 18 U. S. C. §3742(f) (authoriz&para;<br>ing courts of appeals to remand “for further sentencing”&para;<br>upon a finding of error), and §3742(g) (establishing the&para;<br>terms of “sentencing upon remand” and describing the&para;<br>proceeding as a “resentenc[ing]” (capitalization omitted)).&para;<br>It is also notable that the provision applies only to a lim&para;<br>ited class of prisoners—namely, those whose sentence was&para;<br>based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the&para;<br>Commission. Section 3582(c)(2)’s text, together with its&para;<br>narrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize&para;<br>only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence&para;<br>and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.&para;<br>The substantial role Congress gave the Commission&para;<br>with respect to sentence-modification proceedings further&para;<br>supports this conclusion. The SRA charges the Commis&para;<br>sion both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines,&para;<br>§994(o), and with determining whether and to what extent&para;<br>an amendment will be retroactive, §994(u).5 A court’s&para;<br>power under §3582(c)(2) thus depends in the first instance&para;<br>on the Commission’s decision not just to amend the Guide&para;<br>lines but to make the amendment retroactive. The court is&para;<br>also constrained by the Commission’s statements dictating&para;<br>“by what amount” the sentence of a prisoner serving a&para;<br>term of imprisonment affected by the amendment “may be&para;<br>reduced.” §994(u); see also Braxton v. United States, 500&para;<br>U. S. 344, 348 (1991) (noting that the Commission imple&para;<br>mented that power through §1B1.10).&para;<br>Read in this context, §3582(c)(2)’s reference to §3553(a)&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 We&para;<br>&para;<br>do not respond to the dissent’s separation-of-powers discussion,&para;<br>see post, at 11–16 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), as that issue is not fairly&para;<br>encompassed within the questions presented and was not briefed by the&para;<br>parties.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>does not undermine our narrow view of proceedings under&para;<br>the former provision. Section 3582(c)(2) instructs a dis&para;<br>trict court to “conside[r] the factors set forth in section&para;<br>3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,” but it&para;<br>authorizes a reduction on that basis only “if such a reduc&para;<br>tion is consistent with applicable policy statements issued&para;<br>by the Sentencing Commission”—namely, §1B1.10. The&para;<br>statute thus establishes a two-step inquiry. A court must&para;<br>first determine that a reduction is consistent with §1B1.10&para;<br>before it may consider whether the authorized reduction is&para;<br>warranted, either in whole or in part, according to the&para;<br>factors set forth in §3553(a).&para;<br>Following this two-step approach, a district court pro&para;<br>ceeding under §3582(c)(2) does not impose a new sentence&para;<br>in the usual sense. At step one, §3582(c)(2) requires the&para;<br>court to follow the Commission’s instructions in §1B1.10 to&para;<br>determine the prisoner’s eligibility for a sentence modifi&para;<br>cation and the extent of the reduction authorized. Specifi&para;<br>cally, §1B1.10(b)(1) requires the court to begin by “deter&para;<br>min[ing] the amended guideline range that would have&para;<br>been applicable to the defendant” had the relevant&para;<br>amendment been in effect at the time of the initial sen&para;<br>tencing. “In making such determination, the court shall&para;<br>substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for&para;<br>the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied&para;<br>when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all&para;<br>other guideline application decisions unaffected.” Ibid.&para;<br>Consistent with the limited nature of §3582(c)(2) pro&para;<br>ceedings, §1B1.10(b)(2) also confines the extent of the&para;<br>reduction authorized. Courts generally may “not reduce&para;<br>the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the minimum of&para;<br>the amended guideline range” produced by the substitu&para;<br>tion. §1B1.10(b)(2)(A).

Like&para;<br>§3582(c)(2), Rule 35 delineates a limited set of circum&para;<br>stances in which a sentence may be corrected or reduced.&para;<br>Specifically, it authorizes a court to “correct a sentence&para;<br>that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear&para;<br>error” within 14 days after sentencing, Rule 35(a), and it&para;<br>authorizes a reduction for substantial assistance on the&para;<br>Government’s motion, Rule 35(b).

See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.&para;<br>713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).&para;<br>Although Dillon does not have a constitutional right to&para;<br>obtain the benefit of the Commission’s change, it is undis­&para;<br>puted that he has a statutory right to do so. Under 18&para;<br>U. S.

His 322-month&para;<br>sentence was reduced to a 270-month sentence—still 17½&para;<br>years more than the sentencing judge thought necessary&para;<br>as an initial matter.&para;<br>In his §3582(c)(2) proceeding, Dillon alleged that his&para;<br>circumstances warranted an additional reduction in light&para;<br>of the fact that his sentence was “greater than necessary”&para;<br>to effectuate the goals of our sentencing system, §3553(a).&para;<br>He also emphasized that he has been a model inmate&para;<br>during his 17 years in federal prison. Once again, how­&para;<br>ever, the District Court felt that its hands were tied, this&para;<br>——————&para;<br>guidelines, see 28 U. S. C. §994(a)(1), and policy statements, see&para;<br>§944(a)(2). I use “Guidelines” in this opinion to refer to both the guide­&para;<br>lines as described in §994(a)(1), as well as more generally to all of the&para;<br>provisions in the Guidelines Manual.

In my view, the&para;<br>Court’s decision to treat the Commission’s policy state­&para;<br>ment as a mandatory command rather than an advisory&para;<br>recommendation is unfaithful to Booker. It is also on&para;<br>dubious constitutional footing, as it permits the Commis­&para;<br>sion to exercise a barely constrained form of lawmaking&para;<br>authority. And it is manifestly unjust.

At the time, there was nothing in §3582(c)(2)—&para;<br>separate and apart from the Guidelines’ general manda­&para;<br>tory nature—that would have limited the District Court’s&para;<br>discretion in a §3582(c)(2) proceeding. There was, conse­&para;<br>quently, nothing that needed excising. Relief under&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) is available if it is “consistent with” the Com­&para;<br>mission’s related policy statement.

See 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3553(b)(1). Following Booker, the Commission’s policy&para;<br>statement in §1B1.10 took effect in March 2008. That&para;<br>statement, I will explain more fully in Part II, infra, is&para;<br>now the only source of binding authority in §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>proceedings, as it purports to have the effect of reinstating&para;<br>a mandatory Guidelines regime within the context of a&para;<br>sentence modification proceeding. It is now the Commis­&para;<br>sion’s policy statement, and not an explicit congressional&para;<br>mandate, that makes the Guidelines ranges binding under&para;<br>§3582(c)(2).&para;<br>As a matter of textual analysis, divorced from judicial&para;<br>precedent, it is certainly reasonable for the Court to find&para;<br>that the Commission can set mandatory limits on sentence&para;<br>reductions under §3582(c)(2). But it is a mistake, in my&para;<br>view, to take such a narrow approach to the question&para;<br>presented by this case. The Court has turned a blind eye&para;<br>to the fundamental sea-change that was our decision in&para;<br>Booker.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 From 1989 to 1994, the policy statement in §1B1.10 also contained&para;<br>what could be described fairly as a limitation on the “amount” of an&para;<br>available sentence reduction. See USSG §1B1.10(c)(2) (Nov. 1990) (“[A]&para;<br>reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment . . . may, in no event,&para;<br>exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline&para;<br>range applicable to the defendant . . . has been lowered”). In 1994, as&para;<br>part of Amendment 504 to the Guidelines Manual, the Commission&para;<br>deleted this provision, explaining that this “rather complex subsection”&para;<br>was an “unnecessary restriction on the court’s consideration of a&para;<br>revised sentence.” USSG, App. C, Amdt. 504 (effective Nov. 1, 1994).&para;<br>Later, in an “Application Note,” the Commission indicated that “the&para;<br>amended guideline range” “limit[s] the extent to which an eligible&para;<br>defendant’s sentence may be reduced.” Id., Amdt. 548 (effective Nov. 1,&para;<br>1997). The bottom line is that it was the Guidelines’ mandatory nature,&para;<br>and not the effect of a policy statement, that made the Guidelines&para;<br>ranges binding in an 18 U. S.

Notwithstanding the&para;<br>fact that the Court could have retained the Guidelines’&para;<br>mandatory prescriptive effect in a manner consonant with&para;<br>the jury-trial right, the Court nevertheless adopted a&para;<br>broad remedy that recast the Guidelines in their entirety.&para;<br>That change did not respond to a determination that the&para;<br>mandatory Guidelines regime itself violated the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment. Neither my opinion for the Court with re­&para;<br>spect to our constitutional holding, nor JUSTICE BREYER’s&para;<br>remedial opinion, contained any such determination.&para;<br>Instead, the Court’s decision to make the Guidelines dis­&para;<br>cretionary rested entirely on the majority’s judgment that&para;<br>Congress would have preferred that result to either an&para;<br>increase in the jury’s role in making factual findings or a&para;<br>decision invalidating the entire regime. Id., at 249. When&para;<br>Congress was wrestling with the Sentencing Reform Act of&para;<br>1984, it did not foresee Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely. The&para;<br>Court made a policy-based prediction that, were Congress&para;<br>to have had such foresight, it would not have elected—in&para;<br>any respect—a mandatory sentencing regime.&para;<br>The Court openly acknowledged this methodology:&para;<br>“In essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why&para;<br>Congress would likely have preferred the total invali­&para;<br>dation of the Act to an Act with the Court’s Sixth&para;<br>Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2)&para;<br>why Congress would likely have preferred the excision&para;<br>of some of the Act, namely the Act’s mandatory lan­&para;<br>guage, to the invalidation of the entire Act. That is to&para;<br>say, in light of today’s holding, we compare maintain­&para;<br>ing the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the&para;<br>dissenters’ proposed remedy) to the total invalidation&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have&para;<br>preferred the latter. We then compare our own rem­&para;<br>edy to the total invalidation of the statute, and con­&para;<br>clude that Congress would have preferred our rem­&para;<br>edy.” 543 U. S., at 249.&para;<br>Thus, rather than “maintaining the Act as written with&para;<br>jury factfinding added,” ibid., the Court opted to alter the&para;<br>Commission’s power in a more fundamental way: It did&para;<br>away with a fixed, determinate sentencing regime based&para;<br>on mandatory Guidelines. Henceforth the Commission&para;<br>would guide and advise federal courts in the exercise of&para;<br>their sentencing authority. But the Commission would&para;<br>not bind.&para;<br>The Court held as follows:&para;<br>“We answer the question of remedy by finding the&para;<br>provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes&para;<br>the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1)&para;<br>(Supp. IV), incompatible with today’s constitutional&para;<br>holding. We conclude that this provision must be sev­&para;<br>ered and excised, as must one other statutory section,&para;<br>§3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which depends upon&para;<br>the Guidelines’ mandatory nature. So modified, the&para;<br>federal sentencing statute, see Sentencing Reform Act&para;<br>of 1984 (Sentencing Act), as amended, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. §991 et seq., makes the&para;<br>Guidelines effectively advisory. It requires a sentenc­&para;<br>ing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.&para;<br>§3553(a)(4) (Supp. IV), but it permits the court to tai­&para;<br>lor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as&para;<br>well, see §3553(a).” Id., at 245–246.&para;<br>The only fair way to read the Booker majority’s remedy&para;<br>is that it eliminated the mandatory features of the Guide­&para;<br>lines—all of them.4 It is true that the Court explicitly&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See&para;<br>&para;<br>also, e.g., Booker, 543 U.

Nor is it&para;<br>relevant that Dillon has no right to be present at a pro­&para;<br>ceeding under §3582(c)(2), ante, at 9–10, or that a sentence&para;<br>reduction proceeding may not be “constitutionally com­&para;<br>pelled,” ante, at 10–11. The Court’s general reliance on&para;<br>Booker in this case, see ante, at 11–12, is odd because the&para;<br>Booker Court explained its belief “that Congress would not&para;<br>have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a&para;<br>nonmandatory system in others,” 543 U. S., at 266. Yet,&para;<br>this is precisely the system the Court approves today.&para;<br>Approaching this case as the Booker Court did, one must&para;<br>ask whether it is likely that a fully informed Congress&para;<br>would have created this kind of Commission: one endowed&para;<br>with vast responsibilities for drafting advisory Guidelines&para;<br>and policy statements, but also with the tiniest sliver of&para;<br>lawmaking power to tie the hands of a district court’s&para;<br>exercise of grace under §3582(c)(2). I think the answer is&para;<br>obvious.&para;<br>II&para;<br>My understanding of the scope of the Booker remedy is&para;<br>reinforced by an additional consideration: The Commis­&para;<br>sion’s policy statement, to which the Court today allows&para;<br>binding effect, may exceed the scope of the Commission’s&para;<br>powers. No one disputes that Congress could have re­&para;<br>jected the Court’s remedial holding in Booker if it so&para;<br>wished. Instead, it is the Commission that has rejected&para;<br>Booker’s application to §3582(c)(2), by purporting to give&para;<br>mandatory force to its own policy statement. That action&para;<br>presses the bounds of the authority Congress validly gave&para;<br>the Commission in 1984, for it is not clear that Congress&para;<br>has authorized the Commission to create this type of&para;<br>policy statement or to circumvent a decision such as&para;<br>Booker on its own accord.&para;<br>We have been quite permissive of congressional delega­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tions in our separation-of-powers jurisprudence. “So long&para;<br>as Congress ‘shall lay down by legislative act an intelligi­&para;<br>ble principle to which the person or body authorized to&para;<br>[exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform,&para;<br>such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of&para;<br>legislative power.’ ” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 372 (quoting J.&para;<br>W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394,&para;<br>409 (1928)). Few legislative actions have been found to&para;<br>offend this principle. 488 U. S., at 373.&para;<br>More than 20 years ago, the Court upheld the constitu­&para;<br>tionality of the Commission’s work from just such an&para;<br>attack in Mistretta. We took sanctuary then in the fact&para;<br>that, in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act and creating&para;<br>the Commission, Congress had “se[t] forth more than&para;<br>merely an ‘intelligible principle’ or minimal standard” for&para;<br>the exercise of the Commission’s discretion, and had “ ‘ex­&para;<br>plain[ed] what the Commission should do and how it&para;<br>should do it, and se[t] out specific directives to govern&para;<br>particular situations.’ ” Id., at 379. To this end, Congress&para;<br>gave the Commission clear “goals,” id., at 374; specified&para;<br>the “ ‘purposes of sentencing,’ ” ibid.; “prescribed the spe­&para;<br>cific tool”—“the guidelines system”—the Commission was&para;<br>to use in its work, ibid.; set limits on the appropriate&para;<br>Guidelines ranges the Commission was to promulgate, id.,&para;<br>at 375; and set forth “seven factors” and “11 factors,”&para;<br>respectively, to assist the Commission with “its formula­&para;<br>tion of offense categories” and its establishment of “catego­&para;<br>ries of defendants” for sentencing purposes, id., at 375–&para;<br>376.&para;<br>We explained that “although Congress granted the&para;<br>Commission substantial discretion in formulating guide­&para;<br>lines, in actuality it legislated a full hierarchy of punish­&para;<br>ment—from near maximum imprisonment, to substantial&para;<br>imprisonment, to some imprisonment, to alternatives—&para;<br>and stipulated the most important offense and offender&para;<br>characteristics to place defendants within these catego­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

There was, accordingly, no “concern of&para;<br>encroachment and aggrandizement that has animated our&para;<br>separation-of-powers jurisprudence and aroused our vigi­&para;<br>lance against the ‘hydraulic pressure inherent within each&para;<br>of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its&para;<br>power.’ ” Id., at 382 (quoting INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.&para;<br>919, 951 (1983)).&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA disagreed. He argued forcefully that&para;<br>Congress’ creation of the Commission was itself “a pure&para;<br>delegation of legislative power” and therefore an abuse of&para;<br>separation of powers. 488 U. S., at 420 (dissenting opin­&para;<br>ion). “Congress’ commitment of such broad policy respon­&para;<br>sibility to any institution,” in JUSTICE SCALIA’s view,&para;<br>violated a core principle of our governing system: that&para;<br>“basic policy decisions governing society are to be made by&para;<br>the Legislature.” Id., at 415.&para;<br>Although we acknowledged in Mistretta that Congress&para;<br>had permissibly granted substantial powers to the Com­&para;<br>mission to set law and policy on sentencing generally, we&para;<br>had no occasion to consider whether it had spoken with&para;<br>sufficient clarity respecting the Commission’s authority to&para;<br>prescribe sentence reductions. That question has now&para;<br>reared its head, and in my view it raises separation-of­&para;<br>powers concerns significantly more difficult than those&para;<br>presented in Mistretta.&para;<br>First, I am doubtful that Congress authorized the type&para;<br>of “policy statement” we find in USSG §1B1.10. Congress&para;<br>instructed the Commission to promulgate “general policy&para;<br>statements regarding application of the guidelines or any&para;<br>other aspect of sentencing or sentence implementation&para;<br>that in the view of the Commission would further the&para;<br>purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18 . . .&para;<br>including the appropriate use of,” inter alia, various “sen­&para;<br>tence modification provisions.” 28 U. S. C. §994(a)(2). As&para;<br>envisioned by the Sentencing Reform Act, the role of policy&para;<br>statements was merely to inform the judge’s exercise of&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>discretion within an otherwise mandatory Guidelines&para;<br>regime. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 167 (1983) (explaining&para;<br>that the “sentencing judge is required to take the policy&para;<br>statements into account in deciding what sentence to&para;<br>impose,” but that departure from a policy statement is not&para;<br>itself grounds for appeal); see also id., at 166 (identifying&para;<br>potential use of policy statement to “offe[r] recommenda­&para;<br>tions as to how” to “trea[t]” “in the future” “existing dis­&para;<br>parities which are not adequately cured by the guide­&para;<br>lines”).&para;<br>Congress reserved binding effect for the&para;<br>Commission’s “guidelines,” which the Commission was to&para;<br>promulgate pursuant to a distinct statutory provision,&para;<br>§994(a)(1). The Sentencing Reform Act thus drew a basic&para;<br>distinction: Guidelines would bind; policy statements&para;<br>would advise.&para;<br>Given that distinction, it is significant that Congress&para;<br>elected to use the Commission’s policy-statement power to&para;<br>set limitations on the sentencing modification procedures,&para;<br>rather than invoking the Commission’s Guidelines power.&para;<br>The Commission is now trying to use a policy statement to&para;<br>have the mandatory effect of a guideline—inverting the&para;<br>Sentencing Reform Act’s original design. I find no provi­&para;<br>sion within §994(a)(2) that would authorize the Commis­&para;<br>sion, via a policy statement, to create a binding Guidelines&para;<br>regime. With respect to the type of action the Commission&para;<br>has taken, there is certainly no provision that even ap­&para;<br>proximates the detailed prescriptions on the Commission’s&para;<br>power we considered in Mistretta.&para;<br>Moreover, not only does nothing in §994(a)(2) appear to&para;<br>authorize this type of policy statement, but there is also&para;<br>nothing that appears to authorize the Commission, by its&para;<br>own fiat, to limit the effect of our decision in Booker.&para;<br>How to respond to Booker, and whether to retain man­&para;<br>datory Guidelines, was a decision for Congress—and&para;<br>Congress alone. Booker expressly left “[t]he ball” “in&para;<br>Congress’ court,” explaining that “[t]he National Legisla­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ture is equipped to devise and install, long term, the sen­&para;<br>tencing system, compatible with the Constitution, that&para;<br>Congress judges best for the federal system of justice.”&para;<br>543 U. S., at 265; see also supra, at 3–4. That Congress&para;<br>has declined to disturb Booker in the five years since its&para;<br>issuance demonstrates not only that JUSTICE BREYER is&para;<br>more clairvoyant than I am, but also that Congress has&para;<br>acquiesced to a discretionary Guidelines regime. Con­&para;<br>gress’ silence has deprived the Commission of any “intelli­&para;<br>gible principle[s],” J. W. Hampton, 276 U. S., at 409, by&para;<br>which to steer its consideration of the appropriate re­&para;<br>sponse to Booker. And without such guidance, I fear that,&para;<br>in promulgating USSG §1B1.10, the Commission may&para;<br>have made the type of “basic policy decisio[n]” that&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA reminded us is the province of the Legis­&para;<br>lature, Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 415 (dissenting opinion).&para;<br>Prior to the Commission’s 2008 overhaul of its policy&para;<br>statement in §1B1.10—and even under the applicable&para;<br>policy statement in effect when the Court decided&para;<br>Booker—nothing in the Guidelines, see supra, at 3–4, and&para;<br>n. 2, as understood in light of Booker, would have pre­&para;<br>cluded Dillon from obtaining the type of discretionary&para;<br>sentence reduction he now seeks (assuming he was so&para;<br>eligible). Standing in Dillon’s way presently are two pro­&para;<br>visions of §1B1.10, revised contemporaneously with the&para;<br>Commission’s decision to make its amendments to the&para;<br>crack cocaine offense Guidelines retroactive.&para;<br>There can be no question that the purpose of the Com­&para;<br>mission’s amendments to its policy statement in §1B1.10&para;<br>was to circumvent the Booker remedy. See Brief for Fed­&para;<br>eral Public and Community Defenders et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 3–9 (describing history of promulgation of current&para;<br>version of §1B1.10). To this end, the Commission dis­&para;<br>claimed that proceedings under §3582(c)(2) “constitute a&para;<br>full resentencing of the defendant.” USSG §1B1.10(a)(3).&para;<br>And it advised that “the court shall not reduce the defen­&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>and this policy statement to a term that is less than the&para;<br>minimum of the amended guideline range determined”&para;<br>under the new range. §1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In other words,&para;<br>the Commission told federal courts that its Guidelines, at&para;<br>least in §3582(c)(2) proceedings, remain mandatory and&para;<br>binding.&para;<br>Had the Commission taken it upon itself, by issuance of&para;<br>a general policy statement, to make its Guidelines manda­&para;<br>tory but subject to jury findings in all cases, we would&para;<br>either strike down such an act on separation-of-powers&para;<br>grounds or apply the same remedy we did in Booker to&para;<br>render the statement advisory. It makes little difference,&para;<br>in my view, that the Commission has only rejected the&para;<br>Booker remedy in this single procedure. The encroach­&para;<br>ment is the same, if only more subtle. Any legislative&para;<br>response to Booker was a decision for Congress to make—&para;<br>not the Commission.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Separate from the arguments noted above, the Court’s&para;<br>decision today may reflect a concern that a contrary hold­&para;<br>ing would discourage the Commission from issuing retro­&para;<br>active amendments to the Guidelines, owing to a fear of&para;<br>burdening the district courts. In what might be described&para;<br>as a subtle threat, the Commission has highlighted this&para;<br>point in its amicus brief supporting the Government. The&para;<br>brief explains that holding for Dillon would introduce&para;<br>uncertainty into the Commission’s “assessments about the&para;<br>effects of retroactivity decisions,” making these decisions&para;<br>“very difficult” and “weigh[ing] against making Guideline&para;<br>amendments retroactive in the future.” Brief for United&para;<br>States Sentencing Commission as Amicus Curiae 21.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The Government’s argument along these lines is less subtle: “To&para;<br>forbid the Sentencing Commission from limiting the scope of Section&para;<br>3582(c)(2) sentence reduction proceedings to the scope of the amend­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §994(o). And Con­&para;<br>gress has commanded that the Commission “shall specify&para;<br>in what circumstances” an amendment is retroactive,&para;<br>indicating that most, if not all, substantial amendments&para;<br>are to receive some type of retroactive effect. §994(u); see&para;<br>also S. Rep.

In other&para;<br>words, while Congress has left the retroactivity decision to&para;<br>the Commission’s discretion, it has done so with the pre­&para;<br>sumption that some form of retroactive relief is appropri­&para;<br>ate when a Guidelines amendment is nontrivial.8 I cannot&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ments themselves would inevitably discourage the Sentencing Commis­&para;<br>sion from ever authorizing sentence reductions.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 37.&para;<br>8 As the Court notes, I do agree that §994(u) authorizes the Commis­&para;<br>sion to determine the retroactive effect of sentence reductions. Ante, at&para;<br>13. I understand §994(u) as directing the Commission to prescribe the&para;<br>retroactive effect, if any, of its Guidelines amendments. The power to&para;<br>make retroactivity determinations is meaningfully different, however,&para;<br>from the other power the Court claims for the Commission. In granting&para;<br>the former power, Congress has instructed the Commission to perform&para;<br>a gate keeping function by determining which individuals are eligible&para;<br>for relief pursuant to §3582(c)(2). By contrast, the other power the&para;<br>Court claims for the Commission today is the type of mandatory sen­&para;<br>tencing authority at issue in Booker. Contrary to the Court’s conclu­&para;<br>sion, the Commission after Booker does not have the power to bind the&para;<br>district court in setting a particular sentence.&para;<br>I also cannot accept the Court’s broad understanding of the power&para;<br>the Commission derives from §994(u), see ante, at 8, because it suffers&para;<br>from the same delegation concerns I discussed above, see supra, 11–16.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>DILLON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>accept that the Commission would ignore its obligations,&para;<br>and would withhold retroactive application of a Guidelines&para;<br>reduction, simply because a judge would have discretion&para;<br>to enter a below-Guidelines sentence in a §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>proceeding.&para;<br>Undoubtedly, discretionary application of the Guidelines&para;<br>in §3582(c)(2) proceedings would impose a greater burden&para;<br>on the district courts. Such a process would require case­&para;<br>specific evaluations rather than the rote, two-level reduc­&para;<br>tions the Commission envisioned when it made Amend­&para;<br>ment 706 retroactive. But it is important to remember&para;<br>that §3582(c)(2) already requires the district court to&para;<br>consider the §3553(a) factors when it determines whether&para;<br>to grant a reduction, as well as the extent of the reduction.&para;<br>And any additional consideration of evidence proffered to&para;<br>justify a downward departure need not create a great deal&para;<br>of work. Indeed, it need not create any particular adver­&para;<br>sarial process at all: The Commission could simply advise&para;<br>the district courts to review paper submissions, including&para;<br>the original presentence report and objections, as well as&para;<br>any new submissions. By now, courts are intimately&para;<br>familiar with our post-Booker sentencing regime and the&para;<br>discretionary application of the §3553(a) factors.&para;<br>The facts of Dillon’s case show why any additional bur­&para;<br>den on the courts caused by applying Booker’s remedial&para;<br>holding likely pales in comparison to the benefit of achiev­&para;<br>ing more tailored, proportionate sentences for those indi­&para;<br>viduals currently serving terms of imprisonment that&para;<br>exceed what is “necessary” to meet the goals of our sen­&para;<br>tencing system, §3553(a).

His attorney urged the District Court to&para;<br>enter a below-Guidelines sentence because of, inter alia,&para;<br>the gross disparity between sentences for crack and pow­&para;<br>der cocaine offenses. App. 8–9. It would take another 14&para;<br>years for this Court to agree, finally, in Kimbrough, 552&para;<br>U. S. 85, that sentencing courts could consider this unjust&para;<br>disparity.&para;<br>But the District Court, constrained by the then­&para;<br>mandatory Guidelines, increased Dillon’s sentence based&para;<br>on judge-found facts by more than 10 years over the sen­&para;<br>tence authorized by the jury’s verdict. See Brief for Peti­&para;<br>tioner 2, and n. 2. The court could only lament: “I person­&para;<br>ally don’t believe that you should be serving 322 months.&para;<br>But I feel I am bound by those Guidelines and I don’t feel&para;<br>there is any grounds for . . . depart[ing] from those Guide­&para;<br>lines.” App. 12–13. The court acknowledged: “I don’t say&para;<br>to you that these penalties are fair. I don’t think they are&para;<br>fair.” Id., at 13. The court also implored Dillon to make&para;<br>something of the hand he had dealt himself: “I hope that&para;<br>while you are in prison . . . that you will take some time to&para;<br>consider the direction that your life will take when you do&para;<br>return to society. . . . It is only through people like you if&para;<br>you spread the word that other young men of your age will&para;<br>hesitate to get involved in [dealing drugs].” Ibid.&para;<br>Dillon has done just that. He has participated in out­&para;<br>reach efforts in the communities in which he has been&para;<br>imprisoned, doing extensive work with adolescents to steer&para;<br>them away from a life of drugs and crime.

Working with two universities, he has facili­&para;<br>tated the initiation of an African-American Studies pro­&para;<br>gram at Hunters Point Family, a Bay Area organization&para;<br>devoted to assisting at-risk youth. He has also played a&para;<br>large role in initiating a similar program at his prison&para;<br>facility.
