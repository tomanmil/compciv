Pp. 10–18.&para;<br>(a) The Patent Act permits patents to be issued to “[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful . . . composition of matter,”&para;<br>§101, but “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas”&para;<br>“ ‘are basic tools of scientific and technological work’ ” that lie beyond&para;<br>the domain of patent protection, Mayo, supra, at ___. The rule&para;<br>against patents on naturally occurring things has limits, however.&para;<br>Patent protection strikes a delicate balance between creating “incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery” and “imped[ing]&para;<br>the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention.”&para;<br>Id., at ___. This standard is used to determine whether Myriad’s patents claim a “new and useful . . . composition of matter,” §101, or&para;<br>claim naturally occurring phenomena. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(b) Myriad’s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception.&para;<br>Myriad’s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location&para;<br>and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Diamond v.&para;<br>Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry&para;<br>whether such action was new “with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature,” id., at 310. Myriad did not create or&para;<br>alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and&para;<br>BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even&para;<br>brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry. See&para;<br>Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127. Finding&para;<br>the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes does not render the&para;<br>genes patent eligible “new . . . composition[s] of matter,” §101. Myriad’s patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims: They&para;<br>detail the extensive process of discovery, but extensive effort alone is&para;<br>insufficient to satisfy §101’s demands. Myriad’s claims are not saved&para;<br>by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs the&para;<br>chemical bonds that bind gene molecules together. The claims are&para;<br>not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely on&para;<br>the chemical changes resulting from the isolation of a particular DNA&para;<br>section. Instead, they focus on the genetic information encoded in the&para;<br>BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Finally, Myriad argues that the Patent&para;<br>and Trademark Office’s past practice of awarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred&para;<br>Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, a case where Congress had endorsed a PTO&para;<br>practice in subsequent legislation. There has been no such endorsement here, and the United States argued in the Federal Circuit and&para;<br>in this Court that isolated DNA was not patent eligible under §101.&para;<br>Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(c) cDNA is not a “product of nature,” so it is patent eligible under&para;<br>§101. cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as&para;<br>naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. Its creation results in&para;<br>an exons-only molecule, which is not naturally occurring. Its order of&para;<br>the exons may be dictated by nature, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when introns are removed from a&para;<br>DNA sequence to make cDNA. Pp. 16–17.&para;<br>(d) This case, it is important to note, does not involve method&para;<br>claims, patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1&para;<br>and BRCA2 genes, or the patentability of DNA in which the order of&para;<br>the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered.

Myriad obtained a number&para;<br>of patents based upon its discovery. This case involves&para;<br>claims from three of them and requires us to resolve&para;<br>whether a naturally occurring segment of deoxyribonucleic&para;<br>acid (DNA) is patent eligible under 35 U. S. C. §101 by&para;<br>virtue of its isolation from the rest of the human genome.&para;<br>We also address the patent eligibility of synthetically&para;<br>created DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA), which&para;<br>contains the same protein-coding information found in&para;<br>a segment of natural DNA but omits portions within the&para;<br>DNA segment that do not code for proteins. For the reasons that follow, we hold that a naturally occurring DNA&para;<br>segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible&para;<br>merely because it has been isolated, but that cDNA is&para;<br>patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring. We,&para;<br>therefore, affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.&para;<br>MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Genes form the basis for hereditary traits in living&para;<br>organisms. See generally Association for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, 702&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 181, 192–211 (SDNY 2010). The human genome consists of approximately 22,000 genes packed into&para;<br>23 pairs of chromosomes. Each gene is encoded as DNA,&para;<br>which takes the shape of the familiar “double helix”&para;<br>that Doctors James Watson and Francis Crick first described in 1953. Each “cross-bar” in the DNA helix consists of two chemically joined nucleotides. The possible&para;<br>nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and&para;<br>guanine (G), each of which binds naturally with another&para;<br>nucleotide: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. The nucleotide&para;<br>cross-bars are chemically connected to a sugar-phosphate&para;<br>backbone that forms the outside framework of the DNA&para;<br>helix. Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino acids, which&para;<br>in turn are used in the body to build proteins. Only some&para;<br>DNA nucleotides, however, code for amino acids; these&para;<br>nucleotides are known as “exons.” Nucleotides that do not&para;<br>code for amino acids, in contrast, are known as “introns.”&para;<br>Creation of proteins from DNA involves two principal&para;<br>steps, known as transcription and translation. In transcription, the bonds between DNA nucleotides separate,&para;<br>and the DNA helix unwinds into two single strands. A&para;<br>single strand is used as a template to create a complementary ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand. The nucleotides on the&para;<br>DNA strand pair naturally with their counterparts, with&para;<br>the exception that RNA uses the nucleotide base uracil (U)&para;<br>instead of thymine (T). Transcription results in a single&para;<br>strand RNA molecule, known as pre-RNA, whose nucleotides form an inverse image of the DNA strand from which&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>it was created. Pre-RNA still contains nucleotides corresponding to both the exons and introns in the DNA molecule. The pre-RNA is then naturally “spliced” by the&para;<br>physical removal of the introns. The resulting product is a&para;<br>strand of RNA that contains nucleotides corresponding&para;<br>only to the exons from the original DNA strand. The&para;<br>exons-only strand is known as messenger RNA (mRNA),&para;<br>which creates amino acids through translation. In translation, cellular structures known as ribosomes read each&para;<br>set of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the mRNA.&para;<br>Each codon either tells the ribosomes which of the 20&para;<br>possible amino acids to synthesize or provides a stop&para;<br>signal that ends amino acid production.&para;<br>DNA’s informational sequences and the processes that&para;<br>create mRNA, amino acids, and proteins occur naturally&para;<br>within cells. Scientists can, however, extract DNA from&para;<br>cells using well known laboratory methods. These methods allow scientists to isolate specific segments of DNA—&para;<br>for instance, a particular gene or part of a gene—which&para;<br>can then be further studied, manipulated, or used. It is also&para;<br>possible to create DNA synthetically through processes&para;<br>similarly well known in the field of genetics. One such&para;<br>method begins with an mRNA molecule and uses the&para;<br>natural bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new,&para;<br>synthetic DNA molecule. The result is the inverse of the&para;<br>mRNA’s inverse image of the original DNA, with one&para;<br>important distinction: Because the natural creation of&para;<br>mRNA involves splicing that removes introns, the synthetic&para;<br>DNA created from mRNA also contains only the exon&para;<br>sequences. This synthetic DNA created in the laboratory&para;<br>from mRNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA).&para;<br>Changes in the genetic sequence are called mutations.&para;<br>Mutations can be as small as the alteration of a single&para;<br>nucleotide—a change affecting only one letter in the genetic&para;<br>code. Such small-scale changes can produce an entirely&para;<br>different amino acid or can end protein production alto-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.&para;<br>MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>gether. Large changes, involving the deletion, rearrangement, or duplication of hundreds or even millions of nucleotides, can result in the elimination, misplacement, or&para;<br>duplication of entire genes. Some mutations are harmless,&para;<br>but others can cause disease or increase the risk of disease. As a result, the study of genetics can lead to valuable medical breakthroughs.&para;<br>B&para;<br>This case involves patents filed by Myriad after it made&para;<br>one such medical breakthrough. Myriad discovered the&para;<br>precise location and sequence of what are now known as&para;<br>the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations in these genes&para;<br>can dramatically increase an individual’s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The average American&para;<br>woman has a 12- to 13-percent risk of developing breast&para;<br>cancer, but for women with certain genetic mutations, the&para;<br>risk can range between 50 and 80 percent for breast cancer and between 20 and 50 percent for ovarian cancer.&para;<br>Before Myriad’s discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2&para;<br>genes, scientists knew that heredity played a role in establishing a woman’s risk of developing breast and ovarian&para;<br>cancer, but they did not know which genes were associated&para;<br>with those cancers.&para;<br>Myriad identified the exact location of the BRCA1 and&para;<br>BRCA2 genes on chromosomes 17 and 13. Chromosome&para;<br>17 has approximately 80 million nucleotides, and chromosome 13 has approximately 114 million. Association&para;<br>for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, 689 F. 3d 1303, 1328 (CA Fed. 2012). Within&para;<br>those chromosomes, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are&para;<br>each about 80,000 nucleotides long. If just exons are&para;<br>counted, the BRCA1 gene is only about 5,500 nucleotides&para;<br>long; for the BRCA2 gene, that number is about 10,200.&para;<br>Ibid. Knowledge of the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2&para;<br>genes allowed Myriad to determine their typical nucleotide&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sequence.1 That information, in turn, enabled Myriad to&para;<br>develop medical tests that are useful for detecting mutations in a patient’s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby&para;<br>assessing whether the patient has an increased risk of&para;<br>cancer.&para;<br>Once it found the location and sequence of the BRCA1&para;<br>and BRCA2 genes, Myriad sought and obtained a number&para;<br>of patents. Nine composition claims from three of those&para;<br>patents are at issue in this case.2 See id., at 1309, and&para;<br>n. 1 (noting composition claims). Claims 1, 2, 5, and 6&para;<br>from the ’282 patent are representative. The first claim&para;<br>asserts a patent on “[a]n isolated DNA coding for a BRCA1&para;<br>polypeptide,” which has “the amino acid sequence set forth&para;<br>in SEQ ID NO:2.” App. 822. SEQ ID NO:2 sets forth a list&para;<br>of 1,863 amino acids that the typical BRCA1 gene encodes.&para;<br>See id., at 785–790. Put differently, claim 1 asserts a&para;<br>patent claim on the DNA code that tells a cell to produce&para;<br>the string of BRCA1 amino acids listed in SEQ ID NO:2.&para;<br>Claim 2 of the ’282 patent operates similarly. It claims&para;<br>“[t]he isolated DNA of claim 1, wherein said DNA has the&para;<br>nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.” Id., at&para;<br>822. Like SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth a&para;<br>long list of data, in this instance the sequence of cDNA that&para;<br>codes for the BRCA1 amino acids listed in claim 1. Importantly, SEQ ID NO:1 lists only the cDNA exons in the&para;<br>BRCA1 gene, rather than a full DNA sequence containing both exons and introns. See id., at 779 (stating that&para;<br>SEQ ID NO:1’s “MOLECULE TYPE:” is “cDNA”). As a result, the Federal Circuit recognized that claim 2 asserts a&para;<br>patent on the cDNA nucleotide sequence listed in SEQ ID&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Technically, there is no “typical” gene because nucleotide sequences&para;<br>vary between individuals, sometimes dramatically. Geneticists refer to&para;<br>the most common variations of genes as “wild types.”&para;<br>2 At issue are claims 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 of U. S. Patent 5,747,282 (the&para;<br>’282 patent), claim 1 of U. S. Patent 5,693,473 (the ’473 patent), and&para;<br>claims 1, 6, and 7 of U. S. Patent 5,837,492 (the ’492 patent).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.&para;<br>MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>NO:1, which codes for the typical BRCA1 gene. 689 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1326, n. 9; id., at 1337 (Moore, J., concurring in part);&para;<br>id., at 1356 (Bryson, J., concurring in part and dissenting&para;<br>in part).&para;<br>Claim 5 of the ’282 patent claims a subset of the data in&para;<br>claim 1. In particular, it claims “[a]n isolated DNA having&para;<br>at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 1.” App. 822.&para;<br>The practical effect of claim 5 is to assert a patent on any&para;<br>series of 15 nucleotides that exist in the typical BRCA1&para;<br>gene. Because the BRCA1 gene is thousands of nucleotides long, even BRCA1 genes with substantial mutations&para;<br>are likely to contain at least one segment of 15 nucleotides&para;<br>that correspond to the typical BRCA1 gene. Similarly,&para;<br>claim 6 of the ’282 patent claims “[a]n isolated DNA having at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 2.” Ibid.&para;<br>This claim operates similarly to claim 5, except that it&para;<br>references the cDNA-based claim 2. The remaining claims&para;<br>at issue are similar, though several list common mutations&para;<br>rather than typical BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences. See&para;<br>ibid. (claim 7 of the ’282 patent); id., at 930 (claim 1 of the&para;<br>’473 patent); id., at 1028 (claims 1, 6, and 7 of the ’492&para;<br>patent).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Myriad’s patents would, if valid, give it the exclusive&para;<br>right to isolate an individual’s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes&para;<br>(or any strand of 15 or more nucleotides within the genes)&para;<br>by breaking the covalent bonds that connect the DNA to&para;<br>the rest of the individual’s genome. The patents would&para;<br>also give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create&para;<br>BRCA cDNA. In Myriad’s view, manipulating BRCA DNA&para;<br>in either of these fashions triggers its “right to exclude&para;<br>others from making” its patented composition of matter&para;<br>under the Patent Act. 35 U. S. C. §154(a)(1); see also&para;<br>§271(a) (“[W]hoever without authority makes . . . any&para;<br>patented invention . . . infringes the patent”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The University of Pennsylvania’s&para;<br>Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory (GDL) and others provided&para;<br>genetic testing services to women. Petitioner Dr. Harry&para;<br>Ostrer, then a researcher at New York University School&para;<br>of Medicine, routinely sent his patients’ DNA samples to&para;<br>GDL for testing. After learning of GDL’s testing and&para;<br>Ostrer’s activities, Myriad sent letters to them asserting&para;<br>that the genetic testing infringed Myriad’s patents. App.&para;<br>94–95 (Ostrer letter). In response, GDL agreed to stop&para;<br>testing and informed Ostrer that it would no longer accept&para;<br>patient samples. Myriad also filed patent infringement&para;<br>suits against other entities that performed BRCA testing,&para;<br>resulting in settlements in which the defendants agreed to&para;<br>cease all allegedly infringing activity. 689 F. 3d, at 1315.&para;<br>Myriad, thus, solidified its position as the only entity&para;<br>providing BRCA testing.&para;<br>Some years later, petitioner Ostrer, along with medical&para;<br>patients, advocacy groups, and other doctors, filed this&para;<br>lawsuit seeking a declaration that Myriad’s patents are&para;<br>invalid under 35 U.

All three judges agreed&para;<br>that only petitioner Ostrer had standing. They reasoned&para;<br>that Myriad’s actions against him and his stated ability&para;<br>and willingness to begin BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing if Myriad’s patents were invalidated were sufficient for Article III&para;<br>standing. 689 F. 3d, at 1323; id., at 1337 (opinion of&para;<br>Moore, J.); id., at 1348 (opinion of Bryson, J.).&para;<br>With respect to the merits, the court held that both&para;<br>isolated DNA and cDNA were patent eligible under §101.&para;<br>The central dispute among the panel members was&para;<br>whether the act of isolating DNA—separating a specific&para;<br>gene or sequence of nucleotides from the rest of the&para;<br>chromosome—is an inventive act that entitles the individual who first isolates it to a patent. Each of the judges on&para;<br>the panel had a different view on that question. Judges&para;<br>Lourie and Moore agreed that Myriad’s claims were patent&para;<br>eligible under §101 but disagreed on the rationale. Judge&para;<br>Lourie relied on the fact that the entire DNA molecule is&para;<br>held together by chemical bonds and that the covalent&para;<br>bonds at both ends of the segment must be severed in&para;<br>order to isolate segments of DNA. This process technically&para;<br>creates new molecules with unique chemical compositions.&para;<br>See id., at 1328 (“Isolated DNA . . . is a free-standing&para;<br>portion of a larger, natural DNA molecule. Isolated DNA&para;<br>has been cleaved (i.e., had covalent bonds in its backbone&para;<br>chemically severed) or synthesized to consist of just a&para;<br>fraction of a naturally occurring DNA molecule”). Judge&para;<br>Lourie found this chemical alteration to be dispositive,&para;<br>because isolating a particular strand of DNA creates&para;<br>a nonnaturally occurring molecule, even though the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>chemical alteration does not change the informationtransmitting quality of the DNA. See id., at 1330 (“The&para;<br>claimed isolated DNA molecules are distinct from their&para;<br>natural existence as portions of larger entities, and their&para;<br>informational content is irrelevant to that fact. We recognize that biologists may think of molecules in terms of&para;<br>their uses, but genes are in fact materials having a chemical nature”). Accordingly, he rejected petitioners’ argument&para;<br>that isolated DNA was ineligible for patent protection&para;<br>as a product of nature.&para;<br>Judge Moore concurred in part but did not rely exclusively on Judge Lourie’s conclusion that chemically breaking covalent bonds was sufficient to render isolated DNA&para;<br>patent eligible. Id., at 1341 (“To the extent the majority&para;<br>rests its conclusion on the chemical differences between&para;<br>[naturally occurring] and isolated DNA (breaking the&para;<br>covalent bonds), I cannot agree that this is sufficient to&para;<br>hold that the claims to human genes are directed to patentable subject matter”). Instead, Judge Moore also&para;<br>relied on the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s&para;<br>(PTO) practice of granting such patents and on the reliance interests of patent holders. Id., at 1343.

Instead, he relied on the fact that “[t]he nucleotide sequences of the claimed molecules are the same as&para;<br>the nucleotide sequences found in naturally occurring&para;<br>human genes.” Id., at 1355.

Moreover, Judge Bryson gave no weight to the PTO’s position&para;<br>on patentability because of the Federal Circuit’s position&para;<br>that “the PTO lacks substantive rulemaking authority as&para;<br>to issues such as patentability.” Id., at 1357.&para;<br>Although the judges expressed different views concerning the patentability of isolated DNA, all three agreed that&para;<br>patent claims relating to cDNA met the patent eligibility&para;<br>requirements of §101.

Rather, “ ‘they are the basic tools of&para;<br>scientific and technological work’ ” that lie beyond the&para;<br>domain of patent protection. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As&para;<br>the Court has explained, without this exception, there&para;<br>would be considerable danger that the grant of patents&para;<br>would “tie up” the use of such tools and thereby “inhibit&para;<br>future innovation premised upon them.” Id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 17). This would be at odds with the very point&para;<br>of patents, which exist to promote creation. Diamond v.&para;<br>Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980) (Products of nature are not created, and “ ‘manifestations . . . of nature&para;<br>[are] free to all men and reserved exclusively to none’ ”).&para;<br>The rule against patents on naturally occurring things&para;<br>is not without limits, however, for “all inventions at some&para;<br>level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of&para;<br>nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas,” and “too&para;<br>broad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle&para;<br>could eviscerate patent law.” 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>2). As we have recognized before, patent protection strikes&para;<br>a delicate balance between creating “incentives that lead&para;<br>to creation, invention, and discovery” and “imped[ing] the&para;<br>flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23). We must apply this&para;<br>well-established standard to determine whether Myriad’s patents claim any “new and useful . . . composition&para;<br>of matter,” §101, or instead claim naturally occurring&para;<br>phenomena.&para;<br>B&para;<br>It is undisputed that Myriad did not create or alter any&para;<br>of the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.&para;<br>MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>BRCA2 genes. The location and order of the nucleotides&para;<br>existed in nature before Myriad found them. Nor did Myriad create or alter the genetic structure of DNA. Instead, Myriad’s principal contribution was uncovering the&para;<br>precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1&para;<br>and BRCA2 genes within chromosomes 17 and 13. The&para;<br>question is whether this renders the genes patentable.&para;<br>Myriad recognizes that our decision in Chakrabarty is&para;<br>central to this inquiry. Brief for Respondents 14, 23–27.&para;<br>In Chakrabarty, scientists added four plasmids to a bacterium, which enabled it to break down various components&para;<br>of crude oil. 447 U. S., at 305, and n. 1. The Court held&para;<br>that the modified bacterium was patentable. It explained&para;<br>that the patent claim was “not to a hitherto unknown&para;<br>natural phenomenon, but to a nonnaturally occurring&para;<br>manufacture or composition of matter—a product of human ingenuity ‘having a distinctive name, character [and]&para;<br>use.’ ” Id., at 309–310 (quoting Hartranft v. Wiegmann,&para;<br>121 U. S. 609, 615 (1887); alteration in original). The&para;<br>Chakrabarty bacterium was new “with markedly different&para;<br>characteristics from any found in nature,” 447 U. S., at&para;<br>310, due to the additional plasmids and resultant “capacity for degrading oil.” Id., at 305, n. 1. In this case, by&para;<br>contrast, Myriad did not create anything. To be sure, it&para;<br>found an important and useful gene, but separating that&para;<br>gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of&para;<br>invention.&para;<br>Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery&para;<br>does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry. In Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127 (1948),&para;<br>this Court considered a composition patent that claimed a&para;<br>mixture of naturally occurring strains of bacteria that&para;<br>helped leguminous plants take nitrogen from the air and&para;<br>fix it in the soil. Id., at 128–129. The ability of the bacteria to fix nitrogen was well known, and farmers commonly&para;<br>“inoculated” their crops with them to improve soil nitrogen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>levels. But farmers could not use the same inoculant for&para;<br>all crops, both because plants use different bacteria and&para;<br>because certain bacteria inhibit each other. Id., at 129–&para;<br>130. Upon learning that several nitrogen-fixing bacteria&para;<br>did not inhibit each other, however, the patent applicant&para;<br>combined them into a single inoculant and obtained a&para;<br>patent. Id., at 130. The Court held that the composition&para;<br>was not patent eligible because the patent holder did not&para;<br>alter the bacteria in any way. Id., at 132 (“There is no&para;<br>way in which we could call [the bacteria mixture a product&para;<br>of invention] unless we borrowed invention from the discovery of the natural principle itself ”). His patent claim&para;<br>thus fell squarely within the law of nature exception. So&para;<br>do Myriad’s. Myriad found the location of the BRCA1 and&para;<br>BRCA2 genes, but that discovery, by itself, does not render&para;<br>the BRCA genes “new . . . composition[s] of matter,” §101,&para;<br>that are patent eligible.&para;<br>Indeed, Myriad’s patent descriptions highlight the&para;<br>problem with its claims. For example, a section of the ’282&para;<br>patent’s Detailed Description of the Invention indicates&para;<br>that Myriad found the location of a gene associated with&para;<br>increased risk of breast cancer and identified mutations of&para;<br>that gene that increase the risk. See App. 748–749.4 In&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>full relevant text of the Detailed Description of the Patent is as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“It is a discovery of the present invention that the BRCA1 locus&para;<br>which predisposes individuals to breast cancer and ovarian cancer, is a&para;<br>gene encoding a BRCA1 protein, which has been found to have no&para;<br>significant homology with known protein or DNA sequences. . . . It is a&para;<br>discovery of the present invention that mutations in the BRCA1 locus&para;<br>in the germline are indicative of a predisposition to breast cancer and&para;<br>ovarian cancer. Finally, it is a discovery of the present invention that&para;<br>somatic mutations in the BRCA1 locus are also associated with breast&para;<br>cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancers, which represents an indicator&para;<br>of these cancers or of the prognosis of these cancers. The mutational&para;<br>events of the BRCA1 locus can involve deletions, insertions and point&para;<br>mutations.” App. 749.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.&para;<br>MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>subsequent language Myriad explains that the location of&para;<br>the gene was unknown until Myriad found it among the&para;<br>approximately eight million nucleotide pairs contained in&para;<br>a subpart of chromosome 17. See Ibid.5 The ’473 and ’492&para;<br>patents contain similar language as well. See id., at 854,&para;<br>947. Many of Myriad’s patent descriptions simply detail&para;<br>the “iterative process” of discovery by which Myriad narrowed the possible locations for the gene sequences that it&para;<br>sought.6 See, e.g., id., at 750. Myriad seeks to import&para;<br>these extensive research efforts into the §101 patenteligibility inquiry. Brief for Respondents 8–10, 34. But&para;<br>extensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy the demands&para;<br>of §101.&para;<br>Nor are Myriad’s claims saved by the fact that isolating&para;<br>DNA from the human genome severs chemical bonds and&para;<br>thereby creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule. Myriad’s claims are simply not expressed in terms of chemical&para;<br>composition, nor do they rely in any way on the chemical changes that result from the isolation of a particular&para;<br>section of DNA. Instead, the claims understandably focus&para;<br>on the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Notwithstanding Myriad’s repeated use of the phrase “present&para;<br>invention,” it is clear from the text of the patent that the various&para;<br>discoveries are the “invention.”&para;<br>5 “Starting from a region on the long arm of human chromosome 17 of&para;<br>the human genome, 17q, which has a size estimated at about 8 million&para;<br>base pairs, a region which contains a genetic locus, BRCA1, which&para;<br>causes susceptibility to cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer,&para;<br>has been identified.” Ibid.&para;<br>6 Myriad first identified groups of relatives with a history of breast&para;<br>cancer (some of whom also had developed ovarian cancer); because&para;<br>these individuals were related, scientists knew that it was more likely&para;<br>that their diseases were the result of genetic predisposition rather than&para;<br>other factors. Myriad compared sections of their chromosomes, looking&para;<br>for shared genetic abnormalities not found in the general population. It&para;<br>was that process which eventually enabled Myriad to determine where&para;<br>in the genetic sequence the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes reside. See, e.g.,&para;<br>id., at 749, 763–775.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>BRCA2 genes. If the patents depended upon the creation&para;<br>of a unique molecule, then a would-be infringer could&para;<br>arguably avoid at least Myriad’s patent claims on entire&para;<br>genes (such as claims 1 and 2 of the ’282 patent) by isolating a DNA sequence that included both the BRCA1 or&para;<br>BRCA2 gene and one additional nucleotide pair. Such a&para;<br>molecule would not be chemically identical to the molecule&para;<br>“invented” by Myriad. But Myriad obviously would resist&para;<br>that outcome because its claim is concerned primarily with&para;<br>the information contained in the genetic sequence, not&para;<br>with the specific chemical composition of a particular&para;<br>molecule.&para;<br>Finally, Myriad argues that the PTO’s past practice of&para;<br>awarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing&para;<br>J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 534&para;<br>U. S. 124 (2001). See Brief for Respondents 35–39, 49–50.&para;<br>We disagree. J. E. M. held that new plant breeds were&para;<br>eligible for utility patents under §101 notwithstanding&para;<br>separate statutes providing special protections for plants,&para;<br>see 7 U. S. C. §2321 et seq. (Plant Variety Protection Act);&para;<br>35 U. S. C. §§161–164 (Plant Patent Act of 1930). After&para;<br>analyzing the text and structure of the relevant statutes,&para;<br>the Court mentioned that the Board of Patent Appeals and&para;<br>Interferences had determined that new plant breeds were&para;<br>patent eligible under §101 and that Congress had recognized and endorsed that position in a subsequent Patent&para;<br>Act amendment. 534 U. S., at 144–145 (citing In re Hibberd, 227 USPQ 443 (1985) and 35 U. S. C. §119(f)). In&para;<br>this case, however, Congress has not endorsed the views of&para;<br>the PTO in subsequent legislation. While Myriad relies on&para;<br>Judge Moore’s view that Congress endorsed the PTO’s&para;<br>position in a single sentence in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004, see Brief for Respondents 31, n. 8;&para;<br>689 F. 3d, at 1346, that Act does not even mention genes,&para;<br>much less isolated DNA. §634, 118 Stat. 101 (“None of the&para;<br>funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.&para;<br>MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Act may be used to issue patents on claims directed to or&para;<br>encompassing a human organism”).&para;<br>Further undercutting the PTO’s practice, the United&para;<br>States argued in the Federal Circuit and in this Court that&para;<br>isolated DNA was not patent eligible under §101, Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 20–33, and that the&para;<br>PTO’s practice was not “a sufficient reason to hold that&para;<br>isolated DNA is patent-eligible.” Id., at 26.

See Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories,&para;<br>Inc., 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 22–24).&para;<br>8 Some viruses rely on an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to reproduce by copying RNA into cDNA. In rare instances, a side effect of&para;<br>a viral infection of a cell can be the random incorporation of fragments&para;<br>of the resulting cDNA, known as a pseudogene, into the genome. Such&para;<br>pseudogenes serve no purpose; they are not expressed in protein&para;<br>creation because they lack genetic sequences to direct protein expression. See J. Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene 142, 144, fig.&para;<br>7–5 (6th ed. 2008).

They nevertheless argue that cDNA is not patent eligible because “[t]he&para;<br>nucleotide sequence of cDNA is dictated by nature, not by&para;<br>the lab technician.” Id., at 51. That may be so, but the lab&para;<br>technician unquestionably creates something new when&para;<br>cDNA is made. cDNA retains the naturally occurring&para;<br>exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which&para;<br>it was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a “product of&para;<br>nature” and is patent eligible under §101, except insofar&para;<br>as very short series of DNA may have no intervening&para;<br>introns to remove when creating cDNA. In that situation,&para;<br>a short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from&para;<br>natural DNA.9&para;<br>III&para;<br>It is important to note what is not implicated by this&para;<br>decision. First, there are no method claims before this&para;<br>Court. Had Myriad created an innovative method of&para;<br>manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and&para;<br>BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method patent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA&para;<br>were well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad’s&para;<br>patents “were well understood, widely used, and fairly&para;<br>uniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for&para;<br>a gene would likely have utilized a similar approach,” 702&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 202–203, and are not at issue in this case.&para;<br>Similarly, this case does not involve patents on new&para;<br>applications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2&para;<br>genes. Judge Bryson aptly noted that, “[a]s the first party&para;<br>with knowledge of the [BRCA1 and BRCA2] sequences,&para;<br>Myriad was in an excellent position to claim applications&para;<br>of that knowledge.
