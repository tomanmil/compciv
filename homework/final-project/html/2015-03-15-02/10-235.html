MCBRIDE&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–235.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 28, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent McBride, a locomotive engineer with petitioner CSX&para;<br>Transportation, Inc., an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating&para;<br>hand injury while switching railroad cars. He filed suit under the&para;<br>Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable&para;<br>for employees’ injuries “resulting in whole or in part from [carrier]&para;<br>negligence.” 45 U. S. C. §51. McBride alleged that CSX negligently&para;<br>(1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to&para;<br>train him to operate that equipment. A verdict for McBride would be&para;<br>in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX’s&para;<br>negligence “caused or contributed to” his injury. The court declined&para;<br>CSX’s request for additional charges requiring McBride to “show that&para;<br>. . . [CSX’s] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury” and de&para;<br>fining “proximate cause” as “any cause which, in natural or probable&para;<br>sequence, produced the injury complained of.” Instead, relying on&para;<br>Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, the court gave the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit’s pattern FELA instruction: “Defendant ‘caused or&para;<br>contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury if Defendant’s negligence played a&para;<br>part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.” The jury&para;<br>returned a verdict for McBride.&para;<br>On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on&para;<br>proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a “direct relation&para;<br>between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” The&para;<br>appeals court, however, approved the District Court’s instruction and&para;<br>affirmed its judgment for McBride. Because Rogers had relaxed the&para;<br>proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an in&para;<br>struction that simply paraphrased Rogers’ language could not be de&para;<br>clared erroneous.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with&para;<br>respect to all but Part III–A, concluding, in accord with FELA’s text&para;<br>and purpose, Rogers, and the uniform view of the federal appellate&para;<br>courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock “proximate cause” stan&para;<br>dards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The&para;<br>charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress&para;<br>employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad “caused or con&para;<br>tributed to” a railroad worker’s injury “if [the railroad’s] negligence&para;<br>played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.”&para;<br>That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation&para;<br>in FELA cases. Pp. 4–14, 16–19.&para;<br>(a) CSX’s interpretation of Rogers is not persuasive. Pp. 4–12.&para;<br>(1) Given FELA’s “broad” causation language, Urie v. Thompson,&para;<br>337 U. S. 163, 181, and Congress’ “humanitarian” and “remedial&para;<br>goal[s]” in enacting the statute, FELA’s causation standard is “re&para;<br>laxed” compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation,&para;<br>Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542–543.&para;<br>Rogers described that relaxed standard as “whether the proofs justify&para;<br>with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part,&para;<br>even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which dam&para;<br>ages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506. Because the District Court’s in&para;<br>struction tracked Rogers’ language, the instruction was plainly&para;<br>proper so long as Rogers actually prescribes the causation definition&para;<br>applicable under FELA. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491&para;<br>U. S. 164, 172. CSX, however, contends that Rogers was a narrowly&para;<br>focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of&para;<br>“proximate cause.” Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurrence&para;<br>in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173, CSX urges&para;<br>that Rogers’ “any part . . . in producing the injury” test displaced only&para;<br>common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contribu&para;<br>tory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the req&para;<br>uisite directness of a cause. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(2) In Rogers, the employee was burning vegetation that lined his&para;<br>employer’s railroad tracks. A passing train fanned the flames, which&para;<br>spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing. Attempting&para;<br>to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the cul&para;<br>vert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U. S., at 501–503. The state&para;<br>court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme&para;<br>Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to&para;<br>maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault&para;<br>because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire. As the fire “was&para;<br>something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the in&para;<br>cline of the gravel,” the court found that “plaintiff’s injury was not the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>natural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.”&para;<br>Ibid. This Court reversed. FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incor&para;<br>porate any traditional common-law formulation of “proximate causa&para;<br>tion[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant’s negli&para;<br>gence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.” Id., at 506.&para;<br>Whether the railroad’s negligent act was the “immediate reason” for&para;<br>the fall, the Court added, was “irrelevant.” Id., at 503. The Court&para;<br>then announced its “any part . . . in producing the injury” test, id., at&para;<br>506.&para;<br>Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of&para;<br>FELA’s causation standard. The State Supreme Court there ac&para;<br>knowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but con&para;<br>sidered the respondent railroad’s part too indirect to establish the&para;<br>requisite causation. That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in&para;<br>Rogers. It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.&para;<br>The interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory his&para;<br>tory, see Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,&para;<br>3, the precedents on which Rogers drew, see, e.g., Coray v. Southern&para;<br>Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 523–524, this Court’s subsequent deci&para;<br>sions, see, e.g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S.&para;<br>521, 523–524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews&para;<br>FELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and&para;<br>scholars. This understanding of Rogers “has been accepted as settled&para;<br>law for several decades.” IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32. To&para;<br>discard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve stare decisis.&para;<br>Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(b) CSX nonetheless worries that the Rogers “any part” instruction&para;<br>opens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability&para;<br>on the basis of “but for” causation. A half century’s experience with&para;<br>Rogers gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even one&para;<br>trial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward&para;<br>award.&para;<br>FELA’s “in whole or in part” language is straightforward.&para;<br>“[R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of&para;<br>[FELA] negligence,” Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 372 U. S.&para;<br>108, 117 (emphasis added). If negligence is proved, however, and is&para;<br>shown to have “played any part, even the slightest, in producing the&para;<br>injury,” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in&para;<br>damages even if “ ‘the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it&para;<br>occurred’ ” was not “[p]robable” or “foreseeable.” Gallick, 372 U. S.,&para;<br>at 120–121, and n. 8. Properly instructed on negligence and causa&para;<br>tion, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their&para;<br>“common sense” in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no war&para;<br>rant to award damages in far out “but for” scenarios, and judges&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

S. C. §51 et seq. FELA renders rail­&para;<br>roads liable for employees’ injuries or deaths “resulting in&para;<br>whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” §51. In accord&para;<br>with the text and purpose of the Act, this Court’s decision&para;<br>in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957),&para;<br>and the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we con­&para;<br>clude that the Act does not incorporate “proximate cause”&para;<br>standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort&para;<br>actions. The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, sim­&para;<br>ply tracks the language Congress employed, informing&para;<br>juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a&para;<br>plaintiff employee’s injury if the railroad’s negligence&para;<br>played any part in bringing about the injury.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent Robert McBride worked as a locomotive&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III–A of this opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>engineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which&para;<br>operates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12,&para;<br>2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run be­&para;<br>tween Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois.&para;<br>The run involved frequent starts and stops to add and&para;<br>remove individual rail cars, a process known as “switch­&para;<br>ing.” The train McBride was to operate had an unusual&para;<br>engine configuration: two “wide-body” engines followed&para;<br>by three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested&para;<br>that the configuration was unsafe, because switching with&para;<br>heavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand­&para;<br>operated independent brake. But he was told to take the&para;<br>train as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured&para;<br>his hand while using the independent brake. Despite two&para;<br>surgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never re­&para;<br>gained full use of the hand.&para;<br>Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride com­&para;<br>menced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District&para;<br>Court for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that&para;<br>CSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him&para;<br>to use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed&para;<br>to train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a–26a. A&para;<br>verdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court&para;<br>instructed, if the jury found that CSX “was negligent” and&para;<br>that the “negligence caused or contributed to” McBride’s&para;<br>injury. Id., at 23a.&para;<br>CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to&para;<br>give. One of the rejected instructions would have required&para;<br>“the plaintiff [to] show that . . . the defendant’s negligence&para;<br>was a proximate cause of the injury.” Id., at 34a. Another&para;<br>would have defined “proximate cause” to mean “any cause&para;<br>which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the&para;<br>injury complained of,” with the qualification that a proxi­&para;<br>mate cause “need not be the only cause, nor the last or&para;<br>nearest cause.” Id., at 32a.&para;<br>Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride re­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>quested, the Seventh Circuit’s pattern instruction for&para;<br>FELA cases, which reads:&para;<br>“Defendant ‘caused or contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury&para;<br>if Defendant’s negligence played a part—no matter&para;<br>how small—in bringing about the injury. The mere&para;<br>fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean&para;<br>that the injury was caused by negligence.” Id., at 31a.&para;<br>For this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this&para;<br>Court’s decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352&para;<br>U. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride,&para;<br>setting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that&para;<br>amount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to&para;<br>plaintiff’s negligence. App. 29a.&para;<br>CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob­&para;<br>jection to the failure to instruct on “proximate cause.”&para;<br>Before the appellate court, CSX “maintain[ed] that the&para;<br>correct definition of proximate causation is a ‘direct rela­&para;<br>tion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct&para;<br>alleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes&para;<br>v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S.&para;<br>258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con­&para;<br>tended, might have found that the chain of causation was&para;<br>too indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe&para;<br>because of its propensity to cause crashes during switch­&para;<br>ing, not because of any risk to an engineer’s hands. Brief&para;<br>for Defendant-Appellant in No. 08–3557 (CA7), pp. 49–52.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals approved the District Court’s&para;<br>instruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the&para;<br>jury’s verdict. Rogers had “relaxed the proximate cause&para;<br>requirement” in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit con­&para;<br>cluded, a view of Rogers “echoed by every other court of&para;<br>appeals.” 598 F. 3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a&para;<br>handful of state courts “still appl[ied] traditional formula­&para;<br>tions of proximate cause in FELA cases,” id., at 404, n. 7,&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit said it could hardly declare erroneous&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an instruction that “simply paraphrase[d] the Supreme&para;<br>Court’s own words in Rogers,” id., at 406.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide whether the causation&para;<br>instruction endorsed by the Seventh Circuit is proper in&para;<br>FELA cases. 562 U. S. ___ (2010). That instruction does&para;<br>not include the term “proximate cause,” but does tell the&para;<br>jury defendant’s negligence must “pla[y] a part—no matter&para;<br>how small—in bringing about the [plaintiff’s] injury.” App.&para;<br>31a.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The railroad business was exceptionally hazardous at&para;<br>the dawn of the twentieth century. As we have recounted,&para;<br>“the physical dangers of railroading . . . resulted in the&para;<br>death or maiming of thousands of workers every year,”&para;<br>Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,&para;<br>542 (1994), including 281,645 casualties in the year 1908&para;<br>alone, S. Rep. No. 61–432, p. 2 (1910). Enacted that same&para;<br>year in an effort to “shif[t] part of the human overhead of&para;<br>doing business from employees to their employers,” Gott&para;<br>shall, 512 U. S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted), FELA prescribes:&para;<br>“Every common carrier by railroad . . . shall be li­&para;<br>able in damages to any person suffering injury while&para;<br>he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or&para;<br>death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence&para;<br>of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car­&para;<br>rier . . . .” 45 U. S. C. §51 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects:&para;<br>Railroads are liable only to their employees, and only for&para;<br>injuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA’s&para;<br>language on causation, however, “is as broad as could be&para;<br>framed.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 181 (1949).&para;<br>Given the breadth of the phrase “resulting in whole or in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>part from the [railroad’s] negligence,” and Congress’ “hu­&para;<br>manitarian” and “remedial goal[s],” we have recognized&para;<br>that, in comparison to tort litigation at common law, “a&para;<br>relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.”&para;<br>Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 542–543. In our 1957 decision in&para;<br>Rogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows:&para;<br>“Under [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply&para;<br>whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion&para;<br>that employer negligence played any part, even the&para;<br>slightest, in producing the injury or death for which&para;<br>damages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506.&para;<br>As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the&para;<br>District Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for&para;<br>McBride if “[railroad] negligence played a part—no matter&para;<br>how small—in bringing about the injury,” tracked the&para;<br>language of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of&para;<br>causation applicable under FELA, that instruction was&para;<br>plainly proper. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,&para;<br>491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (“Considerations of stare decisis&para;<br>have special force in the area of statutory interpretation&para;<br>. . . .”). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the&para;<br>railroad contends that lower courts have overread that&para;<br>opinion. In CSX’s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9–&para;<br>10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not&para;<br>touch, concern, much less displace common-law formula­&para;<br>tions of “proximate cause.”&para;<br>Understanding this argument requires some back­&para;<br>ground. The term “proximate cause” is shorthand for a&para;<br>concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should&para;<br>give rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,&para;<br>R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of&para;<br>Torts §42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and&para;<br>Keeton). “What we . . . mean by the word ‘proximate,’ ” one&para;<br>noted jurist has explained, is simply this: “[B]ecause of&para;<br>convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events&para;<br>beyond a certain point.” Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co.,&para;<br>248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). Common-law “proximate cause” formulations&para;<br>varied, and were often both constricted and difficult to&para;<br>comprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73–77, 812–813&para;<br>(2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre­&para;<br>cluding recovery in the event of any “intervening” cause or&para;<br>any contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability&para;<br>if a “proximate cause” was not the sole proximate cause.&para;<br>Prosser and Keeton §65, p. 452 (noting “tendency . . . to&para;<br>look for some single, principal, dominant, ‘proximate’&para;<br>cause of every injury”). Many used definitions resembling&para;<br>those CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the&para;<br>Court of Appeals. See supra, at 2–3 (CSX proposed key&para;<br>words “natural or probable” or “direct” to describe required&para;<br>relationship between injury and alleged negligent con­&para;<br>duct); Prosser and Keeton §43, pp. 282–283.&para;<br>Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurring opinion&para;<br>in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173&para;<br>(2007), CSX contends that the Rogers “any part” test&para;<br>displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for&para;<br>injuries involving contributory negligence or other “multi­&para;<br>ple causes.” Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).1 Rogers “did not address the requisite&para;<br>directness of a cause,” CSX argues, hence that question&para;<br>continues to be governed by restrictive common-law for­&para;<br>mulations. Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>To evaluate CSX’s argument, we turn first to the facts of&para;<br>Rogers. The employee in that case was injured while&para;<br>burning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same&para;<br>for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said&para;<br>nothing about what that standard should be. 549 U.

A passing train had fanned the&para;<br>flames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a&para;<br>culvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to&para;<br>escape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel&para;<br>covering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352&para;<br>U. S., at 501–503. A Missouri state-court jury returned a&para;<br>verdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court&para;<br>reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in fail­&para;<br>ing to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the&para;<br>employee was at fault because of his lack of attention to&para;<br>the spreading fire. Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d&para;<br>467, 472 (Mo. 1955). As the fire “was something extraordi­&para;<br>nary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of&para;<br>the gravel,” the court felt “obliged to say [that] plaintiff’s&para;<br>injury was not the natural and probable consequence of&para;<br>any negligence of defendant.” Ibid.&para;<br>We held that the jury’s verdict should not have been&para;<br>upset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri&para;<br>Supreme Court’s opinion, we condemned both. First, the&para;<br>court erred in concluding that the employee’s negligence&para;<br>was the “sole” cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably&para;<br>found that railroad negligence played a part. Rogers, 352&para;<br>U. S., at 504–505. Second, the court erred insofar as it&para;<br>held that the railroad’s negligence was not a sufficient&para;<br>cause unless it was the more “probable” cause of the in­&para;<br>jury. Id., at 505. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate&para;<br>any traditional common-law formulation of “proximate&para;<br>causation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the&para;<br>defendant’s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing&para;<br>cause of injury.” Id., at 506. Whether the railroad’s negli­&para;<br>gent act was the “immediate reason” for the fall, we added,&para;<br>was “an irrelevant consideration.” Id., at 503. We then&para;<br>announced the “any part” test, id., at 506, and reiterated it&para;<br>several times.

Notably, the Mis­&para;<br>souri Supreme Court in Rogers did not doubt that a FELA&para;<br>injury might have multiple causes, including railroad&para;<br>negligence and employee negligence. See 284 S. W. 2d, at&para;<br>472 (reciting FELA’s “in whole or in part” language).

That is the very reason­&para;<br>ing the Court rejected in Rogers. It is also the reasoning&para;<br>CSX asks us to resurrect.&para;<br>Our understanding is informed by the statutory history&para;<br>and precedent on which Rogers drew. Before FELA was&para;<br>enacted, the “harsh and technical” rules of state common&para;<br>law had “made recovery difficult or even impossible” for in­&para;<br>jured railroad workers. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Vir&para;<br>ginia State Bar, 377 U.

That is not what Rogers&para;<br>conveyed. To repeat, Rogers instructed that “the test of a jury case&para;<br>[under FELA] is simply whether . . . employer negligence played any&para;<br>part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.” 352 U.

Aiming to end lower court disregard of congressional purpose, the Rogers Court repeatedly&para;<br>called the “any part” test the “single” inquiry determining&para;<br>causation in FELA cases. Id., at 507, 508 (emphasis&para;<br>added). In short, CSX’s argument that the Rogers stan­&para;<br>dard concerns only division of responsibility among multi­&para;<br>ple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the&para;<br>thrust of our decision in that case.&para;<br>Tellingly, in announcing the “any part . . . in producing&para;<br>the injury” test, Rogers cited Coray v. Southern Pacific&para;<br>Co., 335 U. S. 520 (1949), a decision emphasizing that&para;<br>FELA had parted from traditional common-law formula­&para;<br>tions of causation. What qualified as a “proximate” or&para;<br>legally sufficient cause in FELA cases, Coray had ex­&para;<br>plained, was determined by the statutory phrase “result­&para;<br>ing in whole or in part,” which Congress “selected . . . to fix&para;<br>liability” in language that was “simple and direct.” Id., at&para;<br>524. That straightforward phrase, Coray observed, was&para;<br>incompatible with “dialectical subtleties” that common-law&para;<br>courts employed to determine whether a particular cause&para;<br>was sufficiently “substantial” to constitute a proximate&para;<br>cause. Id., at 523–524.3&para;<br>Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that Rogers&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent, while recognizing “the variety of formulations” courts&para;<br>have employed to define “proximate cause,” post, at 2, does not say&para;<br>which of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA&para;<br>cases. We regard the phrase “negligence played a part—no matter how&para;<br>small,” see Rogers, 352 U. S., at 508, as synonymous with “negligence&para;<br>played any part, even the slightest,” see id., at 506, and the phrase “in&para;<br>producing the injury” as synonymous with the phrase “in bringing&para;<br>about the injury.” We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit’s&para;<br>instruction and the “any part, even the slightest, in producing the&para;<br>injury” formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in&para;<br>contrast, are hardly synonymous.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>announced a general standard for causation in FELA&para;<br>cases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involving multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day&para;<br>Rogers was announced, we applied its “any part” instruc­&para;<br>tion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the&para;<br>directness or foreseeability of the connection between the&para;<br>carrier’s negligence and the plaintiff’s injury. See Fergu&para;<br>son v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523–&para;<br>524 (1957) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>A few years later, in Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.,&para;<br>372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff&para;<br>proper in a case presenting the following facts: For years,&para;<br>the railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing “dead and&para;<br>decayed rats and pigeons,” to accumulate near its right-of­&para;<br>way; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee&para;<br>suffered an insect bite that became infected and required&para;<br>amputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court&para;<br>had concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation&para;<br>to warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at&para;<br>112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers&para;<br>announced. Id., at 116–117, 120–121. See also Crane v.&para;<br>Cedar Rapids &amp; Iowa City R. Co., 395 U.

Indeed, the “natural or probable” charge&para;<br>that CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a&para;<br>pre-FELA case, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U.

The argument for importing into FELA’s text&para;<br>“previous judicial definitions or dicta” originating in non­&para;<br>statutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in&para;<br>Actions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends&para;<br>how foreseeability figures in FELA cases.&para;<br>“[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,” we clarified in&para;<br>Gallick, is indeed “an essential ingredient of [FELA] neg&para;<br>ligence.” 372 U.

It is in good company with&para;<br>proof beyond a reasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness,&para;<br>and unconscionability—to name just a few.&para;<br>Proximate cause refers to the basic requirement that&para;<br>before recovery is allowed in tort, there must be “some&para;<br>direct relation between the injury asserted and the injuri­&para;<br>ous conduct alleged,” Holmes, 503 U.

It limits liabil­&para;<br>ity at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of&para;<br>the kingdom. When FELA was passed, as now, “[t]he&para;<br>question whether damage in a given case is proximate or&para;<br>remote [was] one of great importance. . . .

As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the&para;<br>common law contributory negligence rule, which barred&para;<br>plaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their inju­&para;<br>ries from recovering for the negligence of another. See Act&para;<br>of Apr. 22, §3, 35 Stat. 66. FELA also abandoned the so­&para;<br>called fellow-servant rule, §1, prohibited an assumption of&para;<br>risk defense in certain cases, §4, and barred employees&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

FELA did not abolish the familiar&para;<br>requirement of proximate cause. Because “Congress ex­&para;<br>pressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines”&para;<br>in FELA but “did not deal at all with [other] equally well­&para;<br>established doctrine[s],” I do not believe that “Congress&para;<br>intended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] sub silentio.”&para;<br>Monessen Southwestern R.

But nothing&para;<br>in Section 1 is similar to the “express language” Congress&para;<br>employed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate&para;<br>a common law rule, Sorrell, supra, at 165–166. See, e.g.,&para;<br>§53 (“the fact that the employee may have been guilty of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

It provides that “[e]very common carrier by&para;<br>railroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suf­&para;<br>fering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for&para;<br>such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the&para;<br>negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of&para;<br>such carrier.” §51. The Court’s theory seems to be that&para;<br>the words “in whole or in part” signal a departure from the&para;<br>historic requirement of proximate cause. But those words&para;<br>served a very different purpose. They did indeed mark an&para;<br>important departure from a common law principle, but it&para;<br>was the principle of contributory negligence—not proxi­&para;<br>mate cause.&para;<br>As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory&para;<br>negligence; the “in whole or in part” language simply re­&para;<br>flected the fact that the railroad would remain liable&para;<br>even if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury. See&para;<br>Sorrell, 549 U. S., at 170. The Congress that was so clear&para;<br>when it was abolishing common law limits on recovery&para;<br>elsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental&para;<br>principle of proximate cause in the oblique manner the&para;<br>Court suggests. “[I]f Congress had intended such a sea&para;<br>change” in negligence principles “it would have said so&para;<br>clearly.” Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior&para;<br>Univ. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 563 U.

S., at 506; emphasis deleted);&para;<br>see also ante, at 18–19 (“Juries in such cases are properly&para;<br>instructed that a defendant railroad ‘caused or contributed&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

As Justice Souter&para;<br>has explained, for the half century after the enactment&para;<br>of FELA, the Court “consistently recognized and applied&para;<br>proximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.”&para;<br>Sorrell, supra, at 174 (concurring opinion).&para;<br>No matter. For the Court, time begins in 1957, with our&para;<br>opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.

A jury in that&para;<br>case awarded Rogers damages against his railroad em­&para;<br>ployer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the&para;<br>jury verdict. As the Court explains today, we suggested in&para;<br>Rogers that there were “two potential readings” of the&para;<br>lower court’s opinion and that both were wrong. Ante, at&para;<br>7. In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA’s&para;<br>elimination of the common law contributory negligence&para;<br>rule. We did not do what Congress chose not to do, and&para;<br>abrogate the rule of proximate cause.&para;<br>First, we rejected the idea “that [Rogers’s] conduct was&para;<br>the sole cause of his mishap.” 352 U. S., at 504 (emphasis&para;<br>added); contra, Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d 467, 472&para;<br>(Mo. 1955) (while “[Rogers] was confronted by an emer­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>gency[,] . . . it was an emergency brought about by him­&para;<br>self”). There were, we explained, “probative facts from&para;<br>which the jury could find that [the railroad] was or should&para;<br>have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood&para;<br>that [Rogers] . . . would suffer just such an injury as he&para;<br>did.” 352 U. S., at 503. We noted that “[c]ommon experi­&para;<br>ence teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames&para;<br>of a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames&para;<br>and smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the&para;<br>danger.” Ibid. In referring to this predictable sequence&para;<br>of events, we described—in familiar terms—sufficient evi­&para;<br>dence of proximate cause. We therefore held that the&para;<br>railroad’s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers’s&para;<br>injury regardless of whether “the immediate reason” why&para;<br>Rogers slipped was the railroad’s negligence in permitting&para;<br>gravel to remain on the surface or some other cause. Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>Rogers thereby clarified that, under a statute in which&para;<br>employer and employee could both be proximate causes of&para;<br>an injury, a railroad’s negligence need not be the sole or&para;<br>last cause in order to be proximate. That is an application&para;<br>of proximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111&para;<br>(“a cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to&para;<br>be considered its effective legal cause without by any&para;<br>means being the nearest or most proximate to the causes&para;<br>which contribute of the injury”); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts&para;<br>§180, p. 445 (2001).&para;<br>We then considered a second interpretation. The Mis­&para;<br>souri Supreme Court’s opinion could alternatively be read&para;<br>as having held that Rogers’s “conduct was at least as&para;<br>probable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the&para;<br>[railroad],” and that—in those circumstances—“there was&para;<br>no case for the jury.” 352 U. S., at 505 (emphasis added).&para;<br>If this was the principle the court applied below, it was&para;<br>also wrong and for many of the same reasons.&para;<br>Under a comparative negligence scheme in which multi­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ple causes may act concurrently, we clarified that a rail­&para;<br>road’s negligence need not be the “sole, efficient, producing cause of injury,” id., at 506. The question was simply&para;<br>whether “employer negligence played any part, even the&para;<br>slightest, in producing the injury.” Ibid. “It does not&para;<br>matter,” we continued, “that, from the evidence, the jury&para;<br>may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute&para;<br>the result to other causes, including the employee’s con&para;<br>tributory negligence.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Court today takes the “any part, even the slightest”&para;<br>language out of context and views it as a rejection of proxi­&para;<br>mate cause. But Rogers was talking about contributory&para;<br>negligence—it said so—and the language it chose confirms&para;<br>just that. “Slight” negligence was familiar usage in this&para;<br>context. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed&para;<br>just two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from con­&para;<br>tributory to comparative negligence. It provided that “the&para;<br>fact that the employee may have been guilty of contribu­&para;<br>tory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contrib­&para;<br>utory negligence was slight and that of the employer&para;<br>was gross in comparison.” Act of June 11, 1906, §2, 34&para;<br>Stat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway&para;<br>stop on the road from contributory to pure comparative&para;<br>negligence, again using the term “slight.” See Dobbs §201,&para;<br>at 503 (“One earlier [version of comparative fault] . . .&para;<br>allowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiff’s&para;<br>negligence was slight and the defendant’s gross. . . .

In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure com­&para;<br>parative negligence with respect to rail workers. See&para;<br>Dobbs §201, at 503.

See&para;<br>Sorrell, 549 U.

See 352 U. S., at 506 (describing its test as “the&para;<br>test of a jury case” (emphasis added)). Rogers did not set&para;<br>forth a novel standard for proximate cause—much less an&para;<br>instruction designed to guide jurors in determining causa­&para;<br>tion. Indeed, the trial court in Rogers used the term&para;<br>“proximate cause” in its jury instruction and directed the&para;<br>jury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries&para;<br>“were not directly . . . caused by” the railroad’s negligence.&para;<br>Id., at 505, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our&para;<br>opinion quoted that instruction, ibid., but “took no issue&para;<br>with [it] in this respect,” Sorrell, supra, at 176 (Souter, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>A few of our cases have characterized Rogers as holding that “a relaxed standard of causation applies under&para;<br>FELA.” Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 543; see Crane v. Cedar&para;<br>Rapids &amp; Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166 (1969). Fair&para;<br>enough; but these passing summations of Rogers do not&para;<br>alter its holding. FELA did, of course, change common law&para;<br>rules relating to causation in one respect: Under FELA, a&para;<br>railroad’s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause&para;<br>of an injury. See Gottshall, supra, at 542–543 (“Congress&para;<br>did away with several common-law tort defenses . . . .&para;<br>Specifically, the statute . . . rejected the doctrine of con­&para;<br>tributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negli­&para;<br>gence”). And, unlike under FELA’s predecessor, the pro­&para;<br>portionate degree of the employee’s negligence would not&para;<br>necessarily bar his recovery. But we have never held—&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

The something it proposes&para;<br>is “[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,” ante, at 16 (inter­&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). Foreseeability as a test for&para;<br>proximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability&para;<br>has, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But&para;<br>that is not the test the Court prescribes. It instead limits&para;<br>the foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was&para;<br>negligent in the first place.&para;<br>The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a&para;<br>defendant’s negligence depends on “what a reasonably&para;<br>prudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a&para;<br>potential for harm.” 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury&para;<br>Instructions–Civil ¶89.10, p. 89–21 (2010); see ante, at 16–&para;<br>17. That’s all fine and good when a defendant’s negligence&para;<br>results directly in the plaintiff’s injury (nevermind that no&para;<br>“reasonable foreseeability” instruction was given in this&para;<br>case). For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it&para;<br>falls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent&para;<br>and could have foreseen that the piano would hit some­&para;<br>one—as, in fact, it did. The problem for the Court’s test&para;<br>arises when the negligence does not directly produce the&para;<br>injury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the side­&para;<br>walk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling&para;<br>down the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen&para;<br>have placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was&para;<br>I negligent in dropping the piano because I could have&para;<br>foreseen “a mishap and injury,” ante, at 17 (emphasis&para;<br>added; internal quotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my&para;<br>negligence cause “[the] mishap and injury” that resulted?&para;<br>It depends on what is meant by cause. My negligence was&para;<br>a “but for” cause of the injury: If I had not dropped the&para;<br>piano, the bicyclist would not have crashed.

J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>legal cause? No.&para;<br>In one respect the Court’s test is needlessly rigid. If&para;<br>courts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an aspect&para;<br>of negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as&para;<br>an aspect of causation? And if the jury is simply supposed&para;<br>to intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain&para;<br>of causation—and that “but for” cause is not enough—why&para;<br>hide the ball? Why not simply tell the jury? Finally, if&para;<br>the Court intends “foreseeability of harm” to be a kind&para;<br>of poorman’s proximate cause, then where does the Court&para;<br>find that requirement in the test Rogers—or FELA—pre­&para;<br>scribes? Could it be derived from the common law?&para;<br>Where does “foreseeability of harm” as the sole protec­&para;<br>tion against limitless liability run out of steam? An an­&para;<br>swer would seem only fair to the common law.&para;<br>A railroad negligently fails to maintain its boiler, which&para;<br>overheats. An employee becomes hot while repairing it&para;<br>and removes his jacket.

Was the risk that someone would be&para;<br>harmed by the failure to maintain the boiler foreseeable?&para;<br>Was the risk that an employee would be burned while&para;<br>repairing the overheated boiler foreseeable? Can the&para;<br>railroad be liable under the Court’s test for the coffee&para;<br>burn? According to the Court’s opinion, it does not matter&para;<br>that the “manner in which [the injury] occurred was not&para;<br>. . . foreseeable,” ante, at 17 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), so long as some negligence—any negligence at&para;<br>all—can be established.&para;<br>The Court’s opinion fails to settle on a single test for&para;<br>answering these questions: Is it that the railroad’s negli­&para;<br>gence “pla[y] a part—no matter how small—in bringing&para;<br>about the [plaintiff’s] injury,” as the Court indicates on&para;<br>pages 5, 17 note 13, and 19, or that “negligence play any&para;<br>part, even the slightest, in producing the injury,” as sug­&para;<br>gested at pages 8 note 2, 11 note 4, and 17?

In any event, if the Court’s&para;<br>test—whichever version—provides answers to these hypo­&para;<br>theticals, the Court keeps them to itself.&para;<br>Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering&para;<br>such questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury that&para;<br>resulted was within the scope of the risk created by the&para;<br>defendant’s negligent act; whether the injury was a natu­&para;<br>ral or probable consequence of the negligence; whether&para;<br>there was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the&para;<br>negligence was anything more than an antecedent event&para;<br>without which the harm would not have occurred.&para;<br>The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test&para;<br>and have been criticized for that.
