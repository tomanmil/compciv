PHOEBE PUTNEY&para;<br>HEALTH SYSTEM, INC., ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1160. Argued November 26, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013&para;<br>Under Georgia’s Hospital Authorities Law (Law), political subdivisions&para;<br>may create special-purpose public entities called hospital authorities&para;<br>to provide “for the operation and maintenance of needed health care&para;<br>facilities in the several counties and municipalities of th[e] state.”&para;<br>The Law permits authorities to “exercise public and essential governmental functions” and delegates to them numerous general powers, including the ability to acquire and lease hospitals and other&para;<br>public health facilities. Ga. Code Ann. §31–7–75.&para;<br>The Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County (Authority)&para;<br>owns Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital (Memorial), one of two hospitals in the county. The Authority formed two private nonprofit corporations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.&para;<br>(PPHS) and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Inc. (PPMH). After&para;<br>the Authority decided to purchase the second hospital in the county&para;<br>and lease it to a subsidiary of PPHS, the Federal Trade Commission&para;<br>(FTC) issued an administrative complaint alleging that the transaction would substantially reduce competition in the market for acutecare hospital services, in violation of §5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and §7 of the Clayton Act. The FTC and Georgia subsequently sued the Authority, PPHS, PPMH, and others (collectively&para;<br>respondents), seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative proceedings. The District Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction and granted respondents’ motion to dismiss, holding&para;<br>that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the stateaction doctrine. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It concluded that the&para;<br>Authority, as a local governmental entity, was entitled to state-action&para;<br>immunity because the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a fore-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>seeable result of the Law. The court reasoned that the state legislature could have readily anticipated an anticompetitive effect, given&para;<br>the breadth of the powers delegated to hospital authorities, particularly leasing and acquisition powers that could lead to consolidation&para;<br>of hospital ownership.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Because Georgia has not clearly articulated and affirmatively&para;<br>expressed a policy allowing hospital authorities to make acquisitions&para;<br>that substantially lessen competition, state-action immunity does not&para;<br>apply. Pp. 6–19.&para;<br>(a) This Court recognized in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, 350–&para;<br>352, that the federal antitrust laws do not prevent States from imposing market restraints “as an act of government . . . .” Under the&para;<br>state-action doctrine, immunity from federal antitrust law may extend to nonstate actors carrying out the State’s regulatory program.&para;<br>See, e.g., Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 99–100. But given the antitrust laws’ values of free enterprise and economic competition, “stateaction immunity is disfavored,” FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S.&para;<br>621, 636, and is recognized only when it is clear that the challenged&para;<br>anticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to the “State’s own”&para;<br>regulatory scheme, id., at 635. Immunity will attach only to activities of substate governmental entities that are undertaken pursuant&para;<br>to a “clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed” state policy to&para;<br>displace competition. Community Communications Co. v. Boulder,&para;<br>455 U. S. 40, 52. A state legislature need not “expressly state” that&para;<br>intent, Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 43, but the anticompetitive&para;<br>effect must have been the “foreseeable result” of what the State authorized, id., at 42. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) Respondents’ state-action immunity defense fails under the&para;<br>clear-articulation test because there is no evidence the State affirmatively contemplated that hospital authorities would displace competition by consolidating hospital ownership. The Authority’s powers, including its acquisition and leasing powers, mirror general powers&para;<br>routinely conferred by state law on private corporations. More is required to establish state-action immunity; the Authority must show&para;<br>that it has been delegated authority not just to act, but to act or regulate anticompetitively. Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,&para;<br>499 U. S. 365, 372. In Boulder, this Court concluded that a Colorado&para;<br>law granting municipalities the power to enact ordinances governing&para;<br>local affairs did not satisfy the clear-articulation test, 455 U. S., at&para;<br>55–56, because, when a State’s position “is one of mere neutrality respecting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive,” the&para;<br>State cannot be said to have “ ‘contemplated’ ” those anticompetitive&para;<br>actions, id., at 55.&para;<br>That principle controls here. Grants of general corporate power al-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>lowing substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive&para;<br>marketplace are typically used without raising federal antitrust concerns, so a State cannot be said to have contemplated that such powers will be used anticompetitively. Here, though the Law allows the&para;<br>Authority to acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and affirmatively express a state policy empowering the Authority to make&para;<br>acquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen competition. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(c) In concluding otherwise, the Eleventh Circuit applied the concept of “foreseeability” too loosely. This Court, recognizing that no&para;<br>legislature “can be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects” of&para;<br>a statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity,&para;<br>Hallie, 471 U. S., at 43, has approached the clear-articulation inquiry&para;<br>practically, but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the&para;<br>State must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of&para;<br>competition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be&para;<br>attributed to the “state itself,” Parker, 317 U. S., at 352. Thus, the&para;<br>Court has found a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was&para;<br>sufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the&para;<br>inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature. In that scenario, the State must have&para;<br>foreseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals. See Hallie, 471 U. S., at 41; Omni, 499&para;<br>U. S., at 373. By contrast, when a State grants an entity a general&para;<br>power to act, it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.&para;<br>Entities might transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their&para;<br>powers anticompetitively, but a reasonable legislature’s ability to anticipate that possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to displace competition. The Eleventh Circuit’s&para;<br>argument, echoed by respondents, that the case falls within the foreseeability standard used in Hallie and Omni is rejected. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(d) Respondents’ additional arguments are also unpersuasive.&para;<br>They contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique&para;<br>powers and responsibilities to fulfill Georgia’s objective of providing&para;<br>access to adequate and affordable health care, it was foreseeable that&para;<br>they would decide that the best way to serve their communities was&para;<br>to acquire an existing local hospital, instead of incurring the additional expense and regulatory burden of expanding, or constructing, a&para;<br>facility. But even though the authorities may differ from private corporations offering hospital services, neither the Law nor any other&para;<br>state-law provision clearly articulates a state policy allowing authorities to exercise their general corporate powers without regard to anticompetitive effects. Respondents also contend that when there is&para;<br>doubt about whether the clear-articulation test is satisfied, federal&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interference with state policy choices. But the Law here is not&para;<br>ambiguous, and respondents’ suggestion is inconsistent with the&para;<br>principle that “state-action immunity is disfavored,” Ticor Title, 504&para;<br>U. S., at 636. Pp. 14–19.&para;<br>&para;<br>663 F. 3d 1369, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

In this case, we must decide&para;<br>whether a Georgia law that creates special-purpose public&para;<br>entities called hospital authorities and gives those entities&para;<br>general corporate powers, including the power to acquire&para;<br>hospitals, clearly articulates and affirmatively expresses a&para;<br>state policy to permit acquisitions that substantially lessen&para;<br>competition. Because Georgia’s grant of general corporate powers to hospital authorities does not include&para;<br>permission to use those powers anticompetitively, we hold&para;<br>that the clear-articulation test is not satisfied and state­&para;<br>action immunity does not apply.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>In 1941, the State of Georgia amended its Constitution&para;<br>to allow political subdivisions to provide health care ser­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vices. 1941 Ga. Laws p. 50. The State concurrently enacted&para;<br>the Hospital Authorities Law (Law), id., at 241, Ga.&para;<br>Code Ann. §31–7–70 et seq. (2012), “to provide a mecha­&para;<br>nism for the operation and maintenance of needed health&para;<br>care facilities in the several counties and municipalities&para;<br>of th[e] state.” §31–7–76(a). “The purpose of the constitu­&para;<br>tional provision and the statute based thereon was to . . .&para;<br>create an organization which could carry out and make&para;<br>more workable the duty which the State owed to its indigent sick.” DeJarnette v. Hospital Auth. of Albany,&para;<br>195 Ga. 189, 200, 23 S. E. 2d 716, 723 (1942) (citations&para;<br>omitted). As amended, the Law authorizes each county&para;<br>and municipality, and certain combinations of counties&para;<br>or municipalities, to create “a public body corporate and&para;<br>politic” called a “hospital authority.” §§31–7–72(a), (d).&para;<br>Hospital authorities are governed by 5- to 9-member&para;<br>boards that are appointed by the governing body of the&para;<br>county or municipality in their area of operation. §31–7–&para;<br>72(a).&para;<br>Under the Law, a hospital authority “exercise[s] public&para;<br>and essential governmental functions” and is delegated&para;<br>“all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and&para;<br>effectuate” the Law’s purposes. §31–7–75. Giving more&para;<br>content to that general delegation, the Law enumerates 27&para;<br>powers conferred upon hospital authorities, including the&para;<br>power “[t]o acquire by purchase, lease, or otherwise and to&para;<br>operate projects,” §31–7–75(4), which are defined to in­&para;<br>clude hospitals and other public health facilities, §31–7–&para;<br>71(5); “[t]o construct, reconstruct, improve, alter, and&para;<br>repair projects,” §31–7–75(5); “[t]o lease . . . for operation&para;<br>by others any project” provided certain conditions are&para;<br>satisfied, §31–7–75(7); and “[t]o establish rates and charges&para;<br>for the services and use of the facilities of the authority,”&para;<br>§31–7–75(10).

In 1990, the Authority restructured its&para;<br>operations by forming two private nonprofit corporations&para;<br>to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.&para;<br>(PPHS), and its subsidiary, Phoebe Putney Memorial&para;<br>Hospital, Inc. (PPMH). The Authority leased Memorial&para;<br>to PPMH for $1 per year for 40 years. Under the lease,&para;<br>PPMH has exclusive authority over the operation of Me­&para;<br>morial, including the ability to set rates for services.&para;<br>Consistent with §31–7–75(7), PPMH is subject to lease&para;<br>conditions that require provision of care to the indigent&para;<br>sick and limit its rate of return.&para;<br>Memorial is one of two hospitals in Dougherty County.&para;<br>The second, Palmyra Medical Center (Palmyra), was estab­&para;<br>lished in Albany in 1971 and is located just two miles&para;<br>from Memorial. At the time suit was brought in this case,&para;<br>Palmyra was operated by a national for-profit hospital&para;<br>network, HCA, Inc. (HCA). Together, Memorial and Pal­&para;<br>myra account for 86 percent of the market for acute-care&para;<br>hospital services provided to commercial health care plans&para;<br>and their customers in the six counties surrounding Albany. Memorial accounts for 75 percent of that market on&para;<br>its own.&para;<br>In 2010, PPHS began discussions with HCA about&para;<br>acquiring Palmyra. Following negotiations, PPHS pre­&para;<br>sented the Authority with a plan under which the Author­&para;<br>ity would purchase Palmyra with PPHS controlled funds&para;<br>and then lease Palmyra to a PPHS subsidiary for $1 per&para;<br>year under the Memorial lease agreement. The Authority&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unanimously approved the transaction.&para;<br>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shortly there­&para;<br>after issued an administrative complaint alleging that the&para;<br>proposed purchase-and-lease transaction would create a&para;<br>virtual monopoly and would substantially reduce competi­&para;<br>tion in the market for acute-care hospital services, in&para;<br>violation of §5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38&para;<br>Stat. 719, 15 U. S. C. §45, and §7 of the Clayton Act, 38&para;<br>Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. §18. The FTC, along with the State&para;<br>of Georgia,1 subsequently filed suit against the Authority,&para;<br>HCA, Palmyra, PPHS, PPMH, and the new PPHS subsid­&para;<br>iary created to manage Palmyra (collectively respondents),&para;<br>seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative&para;<br>proceedings. See 15 U. S. C. §§26, 53(b).&para;<br>The United States District Court for the Middle District&para;<br>of Georgia denied the request for a preliminary injunction&para;<br>and granted respondents’ motion to dismiss. 793 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 1356 (2011). The District Court held that respondents&para;<br>are immune from antitrust liability under the state-action&para;<br>doctrine. See id., at 1366–1381.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit affirmed. 663 F. 3d 1369 (2011). As an initial&para;<br>matter, the court “agree[d] with the [FTC] that, on the&para;<br>facts alleged, the joint operation of Memorial and Palmyra&para;<br>would substantially lessen competition or tend to create,&para;<br>if not create, a monopoly.” Id., at 1375. But the court con­&para;<br>cluded that the transaction was immune from antitrust&para;<br>liability. See id., at 1375–1378. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>explained that as a local governmental entity, the Author­&para;<br>ity was entitled to state-action immunity if the challenged&para;<br>anticompetitive conduct was a “ ‘foreseeable result’ ” of&para;<br>Georgia’s legislation. Id., at 1375. According to the court,&para;<br>anticompetitive conduct is foreseeable if it could have been&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Georgia did not join the notice of appeal filed by the FTC and is no&para;<br>longer a party in the case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Hospital&para;<br>Bd. of Directors of Lee Cty., 38 F. 3d 1184, 1188, 1190–&para;<br>1191 (CA11 1994)). Applying that standard, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals concluded that the Law contemplated the anti­&para;<br>competitive conduct challenged by the FTC. The court&para;<br>noted the “impressive breadth” of the powers given to&para;<br>hospital authorities, which include traditional powers of&para;<br>private corporations and a few additional capabilities,&para;<br>such as the power to exercise eminent domain. See 663&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1376. More specifically, the court reasoned that&para;<br>the Georgia Legislature must have anticipated that the&para;<br>grant of power to hospital authorities to acquire and lease&para;<br>projects would produce anticompetitive effects because&para;<br>“[f]oreseeably, acquisitions could consolidate ownership&para;<br>of competing hospitals, eliminating competition between&para;<br>them.” Id., at 1377.2&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also rejected the FTC’s alternative&para;<br>argument that state-action immunity did not apply be­&para;<br>cause the transaction in substance involved a transfer of&para;<br>control over Palmyra from one private entity to another,&para;<br>with the Authority acting as a mere conduit for the sale to&para;<br>evade antitrust liability.

See 567&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2012). Concluding that the answer to the first&para;<br>question is “no,” we reverse without reaching the second&para;<br>question.3&para;<br>II&para;<br>In Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943), this Court&para;<br>held that because “nothing in the language of the Sher­&para;<br>man Act [15 U. S.

Following&para;<br>Parker, we have held that under certain circumstances,&para;<br>immunity from the federal antitrust laws may extend to&para;<br>nonstate actors carrying out the State’s regulatory pro­&para;<br>gram. See Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 99–100 (1988);&para;<br>Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United&para;<br>States, 471 U.

The case is not moot, however, because the District Court on&para;<br>remand could enjoin respondents from taking actions that would&para;<br>disturb the status quo and impede a final remedial decree. See Knox v.&para;<br>Service Employees, 567 U.

Ticor&para;<br>Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 636 (1992). Consistent with&para;<br>this preference, we recognize state-action immunity only&para;<br>when it is clear that the challenged anticompetitive con­&para;<br>duct is undertaken pursuant to a regulatory scheme that&para;<br>“is the State’s own.” Id., at 635. Accordingly, “[c]loser&para;<br>analysis is required when the activity at issue is not di­&para;<br>rectly that of ” the State itself, but rather “is carried out by&para;<br>others pursuant to state authorization.” Hoover v. Ronwin,&para;<br>466 U. S. 558, 568 (1984). When determining whether&para;<br>the anticompetitive acts of private parties are entitled&para;<br>to immunity, we employ a two-part test, requiring first&para;<br>that “the challenged restraint . . . be one clearly articu­&para;<br>lated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,” and second&para;<br>that “the policy . . . be actively supervised by the State.”&para;<br>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.

At the same time, however,&para;<br>substate governmental entities do receive immunity from&para;<br>antitrust scrutiny when they act “pursuant to state policy&para;<br>to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public&para;<br>service.” Id., at 413.4 This rule “preserves to the States&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 An amicus curiae contends that we should recognize and apply&para;<br>a “market participant” exception to state-action immunity because&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FTC v.

See Omni, 499 U. S., at 372. In Boulder, we held&para;<br>that Colorado’s Home Rule Amendment allowing munici­&para;<br>palities to govern local affairs did not satisfy the clear­&para;<br>articulation test. 455 U. S., at 55–56.

S., at 43. “No legis­&para;<br>lature,” we explained, “can be expected to catalog all of the&para;<br>anticipated effects” of a statute delegating authority to&para;<br>a substate governmental entity. Ibid. Instead, we have&para;<br>approached the clear-articulation inquiry more practically,&para;<br>but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the&para;<br>State must have affirmatively contemplated the displace­&para;<br>ment of competition such that the challenged anticompeti­&para;<br>tive effects can be attributed to the “state itself.” Parker,&para;<br>317 U. S., at 352. Thus, we have concluded that a state&para;<br>policy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently&para;<br>expressed where the displacement of competition was the&para;<br>inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of&para;<br>authority delegated by the state legislature. In that sce­&para;<br>nario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly en­&para;<br>dorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its&para;<br>policy goals.&para;<br>For example, in Hallie, Wisconsin statutory law regulat­&para;<br>ing the municipal provision of sewage services expressly&para;<br>permitted cities to limit their service to surrounding unin­&para;<br>corporated areas. See 471 U. S., at 41. While unincorpo­&para;<br>rated towns alleged that the city’s exercise of that power&para;<br>constituted an unlawful tying arrangement, an unlawful&para;<br>refusal to deal, and an abuse of monopoly power, we had&para;<br>no trouble concluding that these alleged anticompetitive&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FTC v.

Id., at 42. As described by the&para;<br>Wisconsin Supreme Court, the state legislature “ ‘viewed&para;<br>annexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated&para;<br>area as a reasonable quid pro quo that a city could require&para;<br>before extending sewer services to the area.’ ” Id., at 44–&para;<br>45, n. 8 (quoting Hallie v. Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d&para;<br>533, 540–541, 314 N. W. 2d 321, 325 (1982)). Without&para;<br>immunity, federal antitrust law could have undermined&para;<br>that arrangement and taken completely off the table the&para;<br>policy option that the State clearly intended for cities to&para;<br>have.&para;<br>Similarly, in Omni, where the respondents alleged that&para;<br>the city had used its zoning power to protect an incumbent&para;<br>billboard provider against competition, we found that the&para;<br>clear-articulation test was easily satisfied even though the&para;<br>state statutes delegating zoning authority to the city did&para;<br>not explicitly permit the suppression of competition. We&para;<br>explained that “[t]he very purpose of zoning regulation is&para;<br>to displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that&para;<br>regularly has the effect of preventing normal acts of com­&para;<br>petition” and that a zoning ordinance regulating the size,&para;<br>location, and spacing of billboards “necessarily protects&para;<br>existing billboards against some competition from new­&para;<br>comers.” 499 U.

Other cases in which we have&para;<br>found a “clear articulation” of the State’s intent to displace&para;<br>competition without an explicit statement have also in­&para;<br>volved authorizations to act or regulate in ways that were&para;<br>inherently anticompetitive.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v.

Contrary to the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ and respondents’ characterization, §31–7–75(4) is&para;<br>not principally concerned with hospital authorities’ ability&para;<br>to acquire multiple hospitals and consolidate their opera­&para;<br>tions. Section 31–7–75(4) allows authorities to acquire&para;<br>“projects,” which includes not only “hospitals,” but also&para;<br>“health care facilities, dormitories, office buildings, clinics,&para;<br>housing accommodations, nursing homes, rehabilitation&para;<br>centers, extended care facilities, and other public health&para;<br>facilities.” §31–7–71(5). Narrowing our focus to the mar­&para;<br>ket for hospital services, the power to acquire hospitals&para;<br>still does not ordinarily produce anticompetitive effects.&para;<br>Section 31–7–75(4) was, after all, the source of power for&para;<br>newly formed hospital authorities to acquire a hospital in&para;<br>the first instance—a transaction that was unlikely to raise&para;<br>any antitrust concerns even in small markets because the&para;<br>transfer of ownership from private to public hands does&para;<br>not increase market concentration.

While&para;<br>subsequent acquisitions by authorities have the potential&para;<br>to reduce competition, they will raise federal antitrust&para;<br>concerns only in markets that are large enough to support&para;<br>more than one hospital but sufficiently small that the&para;<br>merger of competitors would lead to a significant increase&para;<br>in market concentration.

See Brief for Respond­&para;<br>ents 33–39.&para;<br>In support of this argument, respondents observe that&para;<br>hospital authorities are simultaneously empowered to act&para;<br>in ways private entities cannot while also being subject to&para;<br>significant regulatory constraints.

See 663&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1377. This provision applies in cases in which the county or&para;<br>municipality has entered into a contract with a hospital authority for&para;<br>the use of its facilities. See §§31–7–84(a), 31–7–85.

Moreover, hospital authorities&para;<br>operate within a broader regulatory context in which&para;<br>Georgia requires any party seeking to establish or signifi­&para;<br>cantly expand certain medical facilities, including hospi­&para;<br>tals, to obtain a certificate of need from state regulators.&para;<br>See §31–6–40 et seq.9&para;<br>We have no doubt that Georgia’s hospital authorities&para;<br>differ materially from private corporations that offer&para;<br>hospital services. But nothing in the Law or any other&para;<br>provision of Georgia law clearly articulates a state policy&para;<br>to allow authorities to exercise their general corporate&para;<br>powers, including their acquisition power, without regard&para;<br>to negative effects on competition. The state legislature’s&para;<br>objective of improving access to affordable health care does&para;<br>not logically suggest that the State intended that hospital&para;<br>authorities pursue that end through mergers that create&para;<br>monopolies. Nor do the restrictions imposed on hospital&para;<br>authorities, including the requirement that they operate&para;<br>on a nonprofit basis, reveal such a policy.
