Argued February 26, 2014—Decided April 29, 2014&para;<br>The Patent Act’s fee-shifting provision authorizes district courts to&para;<br>award attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in “exceptional cases.” 35&para;<br>U. S. C. §285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc.,&para;<br>393 F. 3d 1378, 1381, the Federal Circuit defined an “exceptional&para;<br>case” as one which either involves “material inappropriate conduct”&para;<br>or is both “objectively baseless” and “brought in subjective bad faith.”&para;<br>Brooks Furniture also requires that parties establish the “exceptional” nature of a case by “clear and convincing evidence.” Id., at 1382.&para;<br>Respondent ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane&para;<br>Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement. The District Court granted&para;<br>summary judgment to Octane. Octane then moved for attorney’s fees&para;<br>under §285. The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks&para;<br>Furniture framework, finding ICON’s claim to be neither objectively&para;<br>baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith. The Federal Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.&para;<br>Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(a) Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district&para;<br>courts’ discretion to award attorney’s fees: The power is reserved for&para;<br>“exceptional” cases. Because the Patent Act does not define “exceptional,” the term is construed “in accordance with [its] ordinary&para;<br>meaning.” Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___. In 1952, when Congress used the word in §285 (and today, for that matter),&para;<br>“[e]xceptional” meant “uncommon,” “rare,” or “not ordinary.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934). An “exceptional” case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH &amp; FITNESS, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>spect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts&para;<br>may determine whether a case is “exceptional” in the case-by-case&para;<br>exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances. Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible&para;<br>framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(1) Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two categories of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category—&para;<br>cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct—appears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not&para;<br>the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the&para;<br>rare case in which a party’s unreasonable, though not independently&para;<br>sanctionable, conduct is so “exceptional” as to justify an award. For&para;<br>litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must determine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in&para;<br>subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad&para;<br>faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself&para;<br>apart from mine-run cases to be “exceptional.” The Federal Circuit&para;<br>imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, but that&para;<br>case’s standard finds no roots in §285’s text and makes little sense in&para;<br>the context of the exceptional-case determination. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(2) Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to&para;<br>render §285 largely superfluous. Because courts already possess the&para;<br>inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad&para;<br>faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S.&para;<br>240, 258–259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provisions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(3) Brooks Furniture’s requirement that proof of entitlement to&para;<br>fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by&para;<br>§285, which imposes no specific evidentiary burden. Nor has this&para;<br>Court interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require such a&para;<br>burden of proof. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U. S, at 519. P. 11.&para;<br>&para;<br>496 Fed.

S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In 1946, Congress amended the&para;<br>Patent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision,&para;<br>then codified in §70, which stated that a court “may in its&para;<br>discretion award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.”&para;<br>35 U. S. C. §70 (1946 ed.).1&para;<br>Courts did not award fees under §70 as a matter of&para;<br>course. They viewed the award of fees not “as a penalty&para;<br>for failure to win a patent infringement suit,” but as appropriate “only in extraordinary circumstances.” Park-InTheatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F. 2d 137, 142 (CA9 1951).&para;<br>The provision enabled them to address “unfairness or bad&para;<br>faith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other&para;<br>equitable consideration of similar force,” which made a&para;<br>case so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting.

Whereas §70 had&para;<br>specified that a district court could “in its discretion award&para;<br>reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party,” the&para;<br>revised language of §285 (which remains in force today)&para;<br>provides that “[t]he court in exceptional cases may award&para;<br>reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.” We have&para;<br>observed, in interpreting the damages provision of the&para;<br>Patent Act, that the addition of the phrase “exceptional&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 This provision did “not contemplat[e] that the recovery of attorney’s&para;<br>fees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits . . . .” S.

And the parties agree&para;<br>that the recodification did not substantively alter the&para;<br>meaning of the statute.3&para;<br>For three decades after the enactment of §285, courts&para;<br>applied it—as they had applied §70—in a discretionary&para;<br>manner, assessing various factors to determine whether a&para;<br>given case was sufficiently “exceptional” to warrant a fee&para;<br>award.

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993)&para;<br>(PRE), which involved an exception to the NoerrPennington doctrine of antitrust law. It does not. Under&para;<br>the Noerr-Pennington doctrine—established by Eastern&para;<br>Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,&para;<br>Inc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), and Mine Workers v. Penning­&para;<br>ton, 381 U. S. 657 (1965)—defendants are immune from&para;<br>antitrust liability for engaging in conduct (including litigation) aimed at influencing decisionmaking by the government. PRE, 508 U. S., at 56. But under a “sham exception” to this doctrine, “activity ‘ostensibly directed toward&para;<br>&para;<br>10 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH &amp; FITNESS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>influencing governmental action’ does not qualify for&para;<br>Noerr immunity if it ‘is a mere sham to cover . . . an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships&para;<br>of a competitor.’ ” Id., at 51. In PRE, we held that to&para;<br>qualify as a “sham,” a “lawsuit must be objectively baseless” and must “concea[l] ‘an attempt to interfere directly&para;<br>with the business relationships of a competitor . . . .’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 60–61 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff&para;<br>must have brought baseless claims in an attempt to&para;<br>thwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).&para;<br>In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the&para;<br>PRE standard into §285. See 393 F. 3d, at 1381. But the&para;<br>PRE standard finds no roots in the text of §285, and it&para;<br>makes little sense in the context of determining whether a&para;<br>case is so “exceptional” as to justify an award of attorney’s&para;<br>fees in patent litigation. We crafted the Noerr-Pennington&para;<br>doctrine—and carved out only a narrow exception for&para;<br>“sham” litigation—to avoid chilling the exercise of the&para;<br>First Amendment right to petition the government for the&para;<br>redress of grievances. See PRE, 508 U. S., at 56 (“Those&para;<br>who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability”). But to the extent that&para;<br>patent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning,&para;<br>it is not clear why the shifting of fees in an “exceptional”&para;<br>case would diminish that right. The threat of antitrust&para;<br>liability (and the attendant treble damages, 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§15) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right&para;<br>to petition than does the mere shifting of attorney’s fees.&para;<br>In the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immunity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit&para;<br>was actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a&para;<br>far less onerous declaration that they should bear the&para;<br>costs of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.&para;<br>2&para;<br>We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason: It is so&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>demanding that it would appear to render §285 largely&para;<br>superfluous. We have long recognized a common-law&para;<br>exception to the general “American rule” against feeshifting—an exception, “inherent” in the “power [of] the&para;<br>courts” that applies for “ ‘willful disobedience of a court&para;<br>order’ ” or “when the losing party has ‘acted in bad faith,&para;<br>vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons . . . .’ ”&para;<br>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421&para;<br>U. S. 240, 258–259 (1975). We have twice declined to&para;<br>construe fee-shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that&para;<br>doing so would render them superfluous, given the background exception to the American rule, see Christiansburg&para;<br>Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419 (1978); Newman&para;<br>v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402, n. 4&para;<br>(1968) (per curiam), and we again decline to do so here.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Finally, we reject the Federal Circuit’s requirement that&para;<br>patent litigants establish their entitlement to fees under&para;<br>§285 by “clear and convincing evidence,” Brooks Furniture,&para;<br>393 F. 3d, at 1382. We have not interpreted comparable&para;<br>fee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees&para;<br>by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510&para;<br>U. S., at 519; Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.&para;<br>384 (1990); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558&para;<br>(1988). And nothing in §285 justifies such a high standard&para;<br>of proof. Section 285 demands a simple discretionary&para;<br>inquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much&para;<br>less such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the&para;<br>evidence standard, see, e.g., Béné v. Jeantet, 129 U. S. 683,&para;<br>688 (1889), and that is the “standard generally applicable&para;<br>in civil actions,” because it “allows both parties to ‘share&para;<br>the risk of error in roughly equal fashion,’ ” Herman &amp;&para;<br>MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 390 (1983).&para;<br>&para;<br>12 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v.
