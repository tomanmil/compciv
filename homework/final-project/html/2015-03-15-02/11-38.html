Decided February 21, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>James Lambert was convicted and sentenced to death in&para;<br>1984 for the murder of two patrons during a robbery of&para;<br>Prince’s Lounge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of&para;<br>the Commonwealth’s primary witnesses at Lambert’s trial&para;<br>was Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in&para;<br>the robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as&para;<br>his accomplices. Almost 20 years later, Lambert brought a&para;<br>claim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court,&para;<br>alleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose,&para;<br>inter alia, a “police activity sheet” in violation of Brady v.&para;<br>Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). This document, dated&para;<br>October 25, 1982, noted that a photo display containing&para;<br>a picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was&para;<br>shown to two witnesses to the Prince’s Lounge robbery,&para;<br>but that “[n]o identification was made.” Exh. 1, App. to&para;<br>Brief in Opposition. The document further noted that&para;<br>“Mr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant” by Jackson,&para;<br>who was in custody at the time on several charges and had&para;<br>admitted to involvement in at least 13 armed robberies of&para;<br>bars. Ibid. The activity sheet did not indicate whether&para;<br>Jackson’s reference was to the Prince’s Lounge crime or&para;<br>one of the others. The sheet bore the names of the law&para;<br>enforcement officers involved in the investigation of the&para;<br>Prince’s Lounge robbery. It also bore the names of the&para;<br>robbery’s murder victims, as well as the police case numbers for those murders. The Commonwealth has identified&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WETZEL v. LAMBERT&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>no evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any&para;<br>other robbery, or that his photo was shown to a witness in&para;<br>any other robbery.&para;<br>Lambert claimed that the activity sheet was exculpatory, because it suggested that someone other than or in&para;<br>addition to him, Jackson, and Reese was involved in the&para;<br>Prince’s Lounge crime. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584&para;<br>Pa. 461, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). Lambert also&para;<br>argued that he could have used the activity sheet to impeach Jackson’s testimony at trial, because the statement&para;<br>attributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lambert. Ibid.&para;<br>The Commonwealth countered that the asserted “statement” by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact&para;<br>nothing more than an “ambiguously worded notation.”&para;<br>Ibid. The Commonwealth argued that this notation simply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a “codefendant” in some incident, without specifying whether&para;<br>Woodlock was said to be involved in the Prince’s Lounge&para;<br>robbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which&para;<br>Jackson had admitted participating. In this regard, the&para;<br>Commonwealth noted that Woodlock’s name was not&para;<br>mentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial&para;<br>proceedings, or Jackson’s statements about the Prince’s&para;<br>Lounge robbery. As the Commonwealth has put it, “it&para;<br>seems likely that Jackson identified [Woodlock] as a participant in one of his many other robberies, and police&para;<br>simply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do with&para;<br>this case.” Reply to Brief in Opposition 2. The Commonwealth “further note[d]” that the document would not have&para;<br>advanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had&para;<br>already been extensively impeached at trial. Lambert, 584&para;<br>Pa., at 472, 884 A. 2d, at 855. Thus, according to the&para;<br>Commonwealth, the “ambiguous reference to Woodlock”&para;<br>would not have discredited Jackson any further. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the&para;<br>Commonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert’s&para;<br>Brady claim, holding that the disputed document was not&para;<br>material. Id., at 472–473, 848 A. 2d, at 855–856. The&para;<br>court concluded that there was no reasonable probability&para;<br>that the result of Lambert’s trial would have been different had the document been disclosed. Ibid. See Strickler&para;<br>v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281 (1999). Calling Lambert’s&para;<br>claim that the reference to Woodlock “automatically”&para;<br>meant someone else was involved in the Prince’s Lounge&para;<br>robbery “purely speculative at best,” the court noted that&para;<br>“the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock&para;<br>a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not&para;<br>mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”&para;<br>584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d, at 855. “Moreover,” the court&para;<br>continued, the document “would not have materially furthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was&para;<br>already extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and&para;<br>Reese.” Ibid.&para;<br>Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in&para;<br>the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealth’s&para;<br>failure to disclose the document violated his rights under&para;<br>Brady. The District Court denied the writ, holding that&para;<br>the state courts’ determination that the notations “were&para;<br>not exculpatory or impeaching” was “reasonable.” Lambert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 02–9034 (July 24, 2007),&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36. The court explained that&para;<br>“[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert]&para;<br>claims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are entirely ambiguous, and would have required the state&para;<br>courts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for&para;<br>Lambert and material to his guilt or punishment.” Id.,&para;<br>at 36.&para;<br>On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third&para;<br>Circuit reversed and granted the writ. 633 F. 3d 126&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WETZEL v. LAMBERT&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>(2011). The Third Circuit concluded that it was “patently&para;<br>unreasonable” for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to&para;<br>presume that whenever a witness is impeached in one&para;<br>manner, any other impeachment evidence would be immaterial. Id., at 134. According to the Third Circuit, the&para;<br>notation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a “codefendant” would have “opened an entirely new line of&para;<br>impeachment” because the prosecutor at trial had relied&para;<br>on the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert&para;<br>as the third participant in the robbery. Id., at 135. The&para;<br>Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari.&para;<br>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a&para;<br>writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state&para;<br>court’s adjudication of his claim “resulted in a decision&para;<br>that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by&para;<br>the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1). “Under §2254(d), a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state&para;<br>court’s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments&para;<br>or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior&para;<br>decision of this Court.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).&para;<br>In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the&para;<br>determination of the state courts that the notations were,&para;<br>as the District Court put it, “not exculpatory or impeaching” but instead “entirely ambiguous.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 34, 36. Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on&para;<br>the alternative ground that any impeachment value that&para;<br>might have been obtained from the notations would have&para;<br>been cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts&para;<br>about the content of the document was reasonable—not&para;<br>necessarily correct, but reasonable—whatever those courts&para;<br>had to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>be beside the point. The failure of the Third Circuit even&para;<br>to address the “ambiguous” nature of the notations, and&para;<br>the “speculat[ive]” nature of Lambert’s reading of them, is&para;<br>especially surprising, given that this was the basis of the&para;<br>District Court ruling. Id., at 36.*&para;<br>The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of&para;<br>capital murder nearly 30 years ago, be set free unless the&para;<br>Commonwealth retried him within 120 days. It did so&para;<br>because of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had&para;<br>identified Woodlock as a “co-defendant,” and bearing other&para;<br>information associating the sheet with the Prince’s Lounge&para;<br>robbery. The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address&para;<br>the state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was&para;<br>ambiguous and any connection to the Prince’s Lounge&para;<br>robbery speculative. That ruling—on which we do not now&para;<br>opine—may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity&para;<br>sheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince’s&para;<br>Lounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other&para;<br>such robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the&para;<br>investigation into the Prince’s Lounge crime. Post, at 1 (opinion of&para;<br>BREYER, J.). No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns&para;<br>whether Jackson’s statement referred to that crime, or one of his many&para;<br>others. The dissent also finds “no suggestion” that the state courts&para;<br>believed Jackson’s reference to Woodlock “contained the argued ambiguity.” Post, at 3. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recognized the Commonwealth’s argument that Jackson could have named&para;<br>Woodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that&para;<br>“the Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had&para;<br>reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his&para;<br>name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”&para;<br>Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 473, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005).&para;<br>The only state court ruling the Third Circuit addressed—the conclusion&para;<br>that any impeachment evidence would have been cumulative—was one&para;<br>the state court introduced with “[m]oreover,” confirming that it was an&para;<br>alternative basis for its decision. Ibid. And the District Court certainly&para;<br>understood the state court decisions to have considered the reference&para;<br>ambiguous. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 36.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WETZEL v. LAMBERT&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>charges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Woodlock’s name appeared nowhere else in the Prince’s Lounge&para;<br>files, and (5) the two witnesses from the Prince’s Lounge&para;<br>robbery who were shown Woodlock’s photo did not identify&para;<br>him as involved in that crime.&para;<br>Any retrial here would take place three decades after the&para;<br>crime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prosecution. That burden should not be imposed unless each&para;<br>ground supporting the state court decision is examined&para;<br>and found to be unreasonable under AEDPA.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and respondent’s motion to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Decided February 21, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.&para;<br>The Court grants the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s&para;<br>petition for certiorari and sends this case back to the&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, primarily because&para;<br>the Court believes that the “Circuit overlooked the determination of the state courts that the [police] notations&para;<br>were . . . ‘entirely ambiguous.’ ” Ante, at 4 (quoting App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 34, 36). I cannot agree.&para;<br>For one thing, I cannot accept that the “notations” at&para;<br>issue are “entirely ambiguous.” I attach a copy of the&para;<br>relevant police notation. See Appendix, infra. The notation clearly refers to this case, not to some other case. It&para;<br>sets forth the file number of this investigation, the investigators of this crime, the victims of this murder, and&para;<br>the potential witnesses of these events. It does not refer&para;<br>specifically to any other robbery. The notation says that&para;<br>“[a] [p]hoto display was shown to . . . [witnesses in this&para;<br>case],” and it specifies that the “[p]hoto display contained&para;<br>a Lawrence WOODLOCK.” In this context, the words&para;<br>must refer to a display that included persons potentially&para;<br>involved in this robbery. That being so, the most natural&para;<br>reading of the statement, “Mr. WOODLOCK is named as&para;<br>co-defendant by Bernard JACKSON,” is that it too refers&para;<br>to this murder and not to some other crime. Ibid.&para;<br>For another thing, the Circuit did not “overloo[k] the&para;<br>determination of the state courts that the notations were&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WETZEL v. LAMBERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>. . . ‘ambiguous.’ ” Ante, at 4 (quoting the Federal District&para;<br>Court, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36 (emphasis added)).&para;<br>There were no such state court “determination[s].” Ante,&para;<br>at 4. Rather, the state trial court wrote that the notation&para;<br>was not material for Brady purposes only because “Jackson was comprehensively impeached” at trial and “it is not&para;<br>reasonable to believe that Jackson’s further inconsistency&para;<br>found only in a police activity sheet and not in any of his&para;<br>statements to police would have caused the jury to discredit him.” Record 228 (emphasis added). As the italicized words make clear, if the trial court expressed any&para;<br>view about ambiguity, it thought that the police notation&para;<br>was not ambiguous.&para;<br>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did point out that the&para;<br>Commonwealth argued that the document was “ ‘ambiguously worded.’ ” Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa.&para;<br>461, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). But the court did&para;<br>not adopt this rationale. Rather, it found the document&para;<br>not material with respect to impeachment because “[a]ny&para;<br>additional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police&para;<br>notation would have been cumulative.” Id., at 473, 884&para;<br>A. 2d, at 856. The Third Circuit disagreed with the state&para;<br>courts in respect to this last-mentioned holding. But this&para;<br>Court does not take issue with the Third Circuit on this&para;<br>point. The Court points out, instead, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court used the word “ ‘speculative.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>3. But in context it is clear that the court used that word&para;<br>to refer to Lambert’s claim that the notation showed that&para;<br>he was innocent. With respect to that claim (not at issue&para;<br>here), the court wrote: “[Lambert’s] claim that Jackson’s&para;<br>reference to Woodlock automatically means that someone&para;<br>other than himself committed the shootings and robbery&para;<br>is purely speculative at best.” 584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d,&para;<br>at 855. And it supported the “speculative” nature of the&para;<br>innocence claim by pointing out that Woodlock’s name “is&para;<br>not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>files.” Ibid. There is no suggestion that the notation&para;<br>contained the argued ambiguity.&para;<br>Finally, the Circuit questioned the strength of the case&para;<br>against Lambert. See Lambert v. Beard, 633 F. 3d 126,&para;<br>135–136 (CA3 2011). It pointed out that the case against&para;<br>Lambert was largely based on Jackson’s testimony, explaining that “without Jackson’s statements to the police,&para;<br>the Commonwealth could not have indicted Lambert on&para;<br>these charges.” Id., at 131. Yet Jackson had made “four&para;<br>prior inconsistent statements to the police about who did&para;<br>what and who said what on the night in question,” and he&para;<br>had admitted that his goal in testifying was “to save himself from a death sentence.” Ibid. The Circuit could not&para;<br>“help but observe that the evidence is very strong that&para;<br>Reese, not Lambert, was the shooter, even assuming that&para;<br>Lambert (and not Jackson, as two of the barmaids testified) was in the Prince’s Lounge that night.” Id., at 135.&para;<br>The Circuit stated: “One wonders how the Commonwealth&para;<br>could have based this case of first-degree murder on a&para;<br>Bernard Jackson.” Id., at 131. These statements suggest&para;<br>that the Commonwealth’s case against Lambert was&para;<br>unusually weak. If the Commonwealth was wrong, an&para;<br>innocent man has spent almost 30 years in prison under&para;<br>sentence of death for a crime he did not commit.&para;<br>We do not normally consider questions of the type presented here, namely fact-specific questions about whether&para;<br>a lower court properly applied the well-established legal&para;<br>principles that it sets forth in its opinion. See Kyles v.&para;<br>Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(An “intensely fact-specific case in which the court below&para;<br>unquestionably applied the correct rule of law and did not&para;<br>unquestionably err” is “precisely the type of case in which&para;<br>we are most inclined to deny certiorari”). And, for the&para;<br>reasons I have stated, I believe the Court is ill advised to&para;<br>grant certiorari in this case.&para;<br>I would deny the Commonwealth’s petition for a writ of&para;<br>certiorari.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WETZE&para;<br>EL v.
