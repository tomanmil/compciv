DAN WIDEMAN ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 12–168.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided November 5, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>This case concerns the award of attorney’s fees in a suit&para;<br>alleging unconstitutional conduct by government officials.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit&para;<br>held that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction&para;<br>but no monetary damages was not a “prevailing party”&para;<br>under 42 U. S. C. §1988, and so could not receive fees.&para;<br>That was error. Because the injunction ordered the defendant officials to change their behavior in a way that&para;<br>directly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Circuit’s decision and remand for further proceedings.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia&para;<br>Christians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in&para;<br>which they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the&para;<br>availability of abortions. On November 3, 2005, Lefemine&para;<br>and about 20 other CCL members conducted such a&para;<br>demonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood County, South Carolina. Citing complaints about the graphic&para;<br>signs, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefemine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be ticketed for breach of the peace. Lefemine objected, asserting&para;<br>that the officer was violating his First Amendment rights,&para;<br>but the threat eventually caused him to disband the protest. See Lefemine v. Davis, 732 F. Supp. 2d 614, 617–619&para;<br>(SC 2010).&para;<br>A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Dan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, informing him that the group intended to return to the same site&para;<br>with the disputed signs. The letter cautioned that further&para;<br>interference would cause Lefemine “ ‘to pursue all available legal remedies.’ ” Id., at 619. Chief Deputy Mike&para;<br>Frederick responded that the police had not previously&para;<br>violated Lefemine’s rights, and warned that “ ‘should we&para;<br>observe any protester or demonstrator committing the&para;<br>same act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the&para;<br>same manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal&para;<br>sanctions.’ ” Ibid. Out of fear of those sanctions, the group&para;<br>chose not to protest in the county for the next two years.&para;<br>See ibid.&para;<br>On October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint under&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1983 against several Greenwood County&para;<br>police officers alleging violations of his First Amendment&para;<br>rights. Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory&para;<br>judgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney’s fees.&para;<br>See 732 F. Supp. 2d, at 620. Ruling on the parties’ dueling&para;<br>motions for summary judgment, the District Court determined that the defendants had infringed Lefemine’s&para;<br>rights. See id., at 620–625. The court therefore permanently enjoined the defendants “from engaging in contentbased restrictions on [Lefemine’s] display of graphic signs”&para;<br>under similar circumstances. Id., at 627. The court,&para;<br>however, refused Lefemine’s request for nominal damages,&para;<br>finding that the defendants were entitled to qualified&para;<br>immunity because the illegality of their conduct was not&para;<br>clearly established at the time. See ibid. The court as&para;<br>well denied Lefemine’s request for attorney’s fees under&para;<br>§1988, stating that “[u]nder the totality of the facts in this&para;<br>case the award of attorney’s fees is not warranted.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney’s fees&para;<br>on the ground that the District Court’s judgment did&para;<br>not make Lefemine a “prevailing party” under §1988. 672&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>F. 3d 292, 302–303 (2012).* The court reasoned that the&para;<br>relief awarded did not “ ‘alte[r] the relative positions of&para;<br>the parties’ ”: The injunction prohibited only “unlawful, but&para;<br>not legitimate, conduct by the defendant[s],” and merely&para;<br>“ordered [d]efendants to comply with the law and safeguard [Lefemine’s] constitutional rights in the future. No&para;<br>other damages were awarded.” Ibid. Lefemine sought a&para;<br>writ of certiorari to review the Fourth Circuit’s determination that he was not a prevailing party under §1988.&para;<br>The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90&para;<br>Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. §1988, allows “the prevailing party”&para;<br>in certain civil rights actions, including suits brought&para;<br>under §1983, to recover “a reasonable attorney’s fee.” A&para;<br>plaintiff “prevails,” we have held, “when actual relief on&para;<br>the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant’s&para;<br>behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.”&para;<br>Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 111–112 (1992). And we&para;<br>have repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory&para;<br>judgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that&para;<br>test. See, e.g., Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 4 (1988) (per&para;<br>curiam).&para;<br>Under these established standards, Lefemine was a&para;<br>prevailing party. Lefemine desired to conduct demonstrations in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant&para;<br>police officers had told him he could not carry. He brought&para;<br>this suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself&para;<br>from the defendants’ standing threat of sanctions. And he&para;<br>succeeded in removing that threat. The District Court&para;<br>held that the defendants had violated Lefemine’s rights&para;<br>and enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The defendants did not appeal the District Court’s judgment that&para;<br>they had violated Lefemine’s First Amendment rights, so the Court of&para;<br>Appeals took as a given that a violation had occurred. See 672 F. 3d, at&para;<br>299, n. 5.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>future. Contrary to the Fourth Circuit’s view, that ruling&para;<br>worked the requisite material alteration in the parties’&para;<br>relationship. Before the ruling, the police intended to stop&para;<br>Lefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling,&para;<br>the police could not prevent him from demonstrating&para;<br>in that manner. So when the District Court “ordered&para;<br>[d]efendants to comply with the law,” 672 F. 3d, at 303,&para;<br>the relief given—as in the usual case involving such an&para;<br>injunction—supported the award of attorney’s fees.&para;<br>Because Lefemine is a “prevailing party,” he “should&para;<br>ordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.” Hensley v.&para;<br>Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Neither of the courts below addressed&para;<br>whether any special circumstances exist in this case, and&para;<br>we do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on&para;<br>which the police officers could contest liability for fees&para;<br>is not a question before us. Accordingly, the petition for&para;<br>certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is&para;<br>vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings&para;<br>consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
