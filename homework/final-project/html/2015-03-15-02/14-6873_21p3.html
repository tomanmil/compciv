DON ROPER, WARDEN&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 14–6873. Decided January 20, 2015&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Petitioner Mark Christeson’s first federal habeas petition was dismissed as untimely. Because his appointed&para;<br>attorneys—who had missed the filing deadline—could not&para;<br>be expected to argue that Christeson was entitled to the&para;<br>equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, Christeson&para;<br>requested substitute counsel who would not be laboring&para;<br>under a conflict of interest. The District Court denied the&para;<br>motion, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit&para;<br>summarily affirmed. In so doing, these courts contravened our decision in Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>Christeson’s petition for certiorari is therefore granted,&para;<br>the judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the&para;<br>case is remanded for further proceedings.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1999, a jury convicted Christeson of three counts of&para;<br>capital murder. It returned verdicts of death on all&para;<br>three counts. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed&para;<br>Christeson’s conviction and sentence in 2001, see State v.&para;<br>Christeson, 50 S. W. 3d 251 (en banc), and affirmed the&para;<br>denial of his postconviction motion for relief in 2004, see&para;<br>Christeson v. State, 131 S. W. 3d 796 (en banc).&para;<br>Under the strict 1-year statute of limitations imposed by&para;<br>the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996&para;<br>(AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1), Christeson’s federal&para;<br>habeas petition was due on April 10, 2005. Nine months&para;<br>before this critical deadline, the District Court appointed&para;<br>attorneys Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to represent&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTESON v. ROPER&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Christeson in his federal habeas proceedings. See 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3599(a)(2) (providing for appointment of counsel&para;<br>for state death row inmates).&para;<br>Horwitz and Butts, as they have subsequently acknowledged, failed to meet with Christeson until more than six&para;<br>weeks after his petition was due. See App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>93a. There is no evidence that they communicated with&para;<br>their client at all during this time. They finally filed the&para;<br>petition on August 5, 2005—117 days too late. They have&para;<br>since claimed that their failure to meet with their client&para;<br>and timely file his habeas petition resulted from a simple&para;<br>miscalculation of the AEDPA limitations period (and in&para;<br>defending themselves, they may have disclosed privileged&para;<br>client communications). See id., at 90a–92a, 135a. But a&para;<br>legal ethics expert, reviewing counsel’s handling of&para;<br>Christeson’s habeas petition, stated in a report submitted&para;<br>to the District Court: “[I]f this was not abandonment, I am&para;<br>not sure what would be.” Id., at 132a.&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely,&para;<br>and the Court of Appeals denied Christeson’s application&para;<br>for a certificate of appealability. Christeson, who appears&para;<br>to have severe cognitive disabilities that lead him to rely&para;<br>entirely on his attorneys, may not have been aware of this&para;<br>dismissal. See id., at 229a, 231a, 237a.&para;<br>Nearly seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted&para;<br>attorneys Jennifer Merrigan and Joseph Perkovich to&para;<br>discuss how to proceed in Christeson’s case. Merrigan and&para;<br>Perkovich immediately noticed a glaring problem.&para;<br>Christeson’s only hope for securing review of the merits of&para;<br>his habeas claims was to file a motion under Federal Rule&para;<br>of Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking to reopen final judgment&para;<br>on the ground that AEDPA’s statute of limitations should&para;<br>have been equitably tolled. But Horwitz and Butts could&para;<br>not be expected to file such a motion on Christeson’s behalf, as any argument for equitable tolling would be premised on their own malfeasance in failing to file timely the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>habeas petition. While initially receptive to Merrigan and&para;<br>Perkovich’s assistance, Horwitz and Butts soon refused to&para;<br>allow outside counsel access to their files. See App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 345a.&para;<br>On May 23, 2014, Merrigan and Perkovich filed a motion for substitution of counsel. The District Court denied&para;<br>the motion, explaining only that it was “not in&para;<br>[Christeson’s] best interest to be represented by attorneys&para;<br>located in New York and Pennsylvania,” as Merrigan and&para;<br>Perkovich are. Id., at 169a. The District Court did not&para;<br>address Merrigan and Perkovich’s offer to forgo all fees&para;<br>and expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it&para;<br>address the possibility of appointing other attorneys for&para;<br>Christeson.&para;<br>Christeson appealed. The Eighth Circuit dismissed for&para;<br>lack of jurisdiction, apparently reasoning that Merrigan&para;<br>and Perkovich were not authorized to file an appeal on&para;<br>Christeson’s behalf.1 On September 19, 2014, while this&para;<br>appeal was still pending before the Eighth Circuit, the&para;<br>Missouri Supreme Court issued a warrant of execution&para;<br>setting October 29, 2014, as Christeson’s execution date.&para;<br>After further proceedings not relevant here, Merrigan&para;<br>and Perkovich again filed a motion for substitution of&para;<br>counsel on Christeson’s behalf. The District Court again&para;<br>denied the motion.&para;<br>Explaining that substitution of&para;<br>“federally-appointed counsel is warranted only when it would&para;<br>serve the interests of justice,” it offered four reasons for its&para;<br>decision. Order in No. 04–CV–08004 (WD Mo., Oct. 22,&para;<br>2014), p. 1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a (quoting Lambrix v.&para;<br>Secretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, 756 F. 3d 1246,&para;<br>1259 (CA11 2014); internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>First, it deemed the motion to be untimely because it “was&para;<br>not filed until 2014, and shortly before [Christeson’s]&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Christeson has since submitted a signed retainer agreement with&para;<br>Merrigan and Perkovich that removes any doubt on that score.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTESON v. ROPER&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>execution date.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. Second, it&para;<br>observed that Horwitz and Butts had not “abandoned”&para;<br>Christeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in&para;<br>a class-action lawsuit challenging Missouri’s lethal injection protocol. Id., at 376a. Third, it noted that although&para;<br>Horwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit, that court had not appointed substitute&para;<br>counsel. Ibid. Fourth and finally, the District Court&para;<br>expressed its belief that granting the motion would set “an&para;<br>untenable precedent” by allowing outside attorneys to seek&para;<br>“ ‘abusive’ ” delays in capital cases. Ibid.&para;<br>Christeson again appealed. This time, the Eighth Circuit summarily affirmed the District Court’s order. We&para;<br>stayed Christeson’s execution, see post, p. ____, and now&para;<br>reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Title 18 U. S. C. §3599 “entitles indigent defendants to&para;<br>the appointment of counsel in capital cases, including&para;<br>habeas corpus proceedings.” Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 1). “By providing indigent capital defendants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in&para;<br>these proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal&para;<br>habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in&para;<br>promoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the&para;<br>death penalty.” McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 859&para;<br>(1994). Congress has not, however, conferred capital&para;<br>habeas petitioners with the right to counsel of their choice.&para;<br>Instead, the statute leaves it to the court to select a&para;<br>properly qualified attorney. See §§3599(a)–(d). But the&para;<br>statute contemplates that a court may “replace” appointed&para;<br>counsel with “similarly qualified counsel . . . upon motion”&para;<br>of the petitioner. §3599(e).&para;<br>We addressed the standard that a court should apply in&para;<br>considering such a motion in Clair. We rejected the argument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is war-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>ranted in only three situations: “when the lawyer lacks the&para;<br>qualifications necessary for appointment . . . ; when he has&para;<br>a disabling conflict of interest; or when he has completely&para;<br>abandoned the client.” 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we adopted a&para;<br>broader standard, holding that a motion for substitution&para;<br>should be granted when it is in the “ ‘interests of justice.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We further explained that the&para;<br>factors a court of appeals should consider in determining&para;<br>whether a district court abused its discretion in denying&para;<br>such a motion “include: the timeliness of the motion; the&para;<br>adequacy of the district court’s inquiry into the defendant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,&para;<br>including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client (and the client’s&para;<br>responsibility, if any, for that conflict).” Ibid.&para;<br>The District Court here properly recognized that its&para;<br>consideration of Christeson’s motion for substitution was&para;<br>governed by Clair’s “interests of justice” standard. But its&para;<br>denial of his motion did not adequately account for all of&para;<br>the factors we set forth in Clair.&para;<br>The court’s principal error was its failure to&para;<br>acknowledge Horwitz and Butts’ conflict of interest. Tolling based on counsel’s failure to satisfy AEDPA’s statute&para;<br>of limitations is available only for “serious instances of&para;<br>attorney misconduct.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631,&para;<br>651–652 (2010). Advancing such a claim would have&para;<br>required Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own performance. Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to make&para;<br>such an argument, which threatens their professional&para;<br>reputation and livelihood. See Restatement (Third) of&para;<br>Law Governing Lawyers §125 (1998). Thus, as we observed in a similar context in Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, n. 8 (2012) (slip op., at 17, n. 8), a “significant&para;<br>conflict of interest” arises when an attorney’s “interest in&para;<br>avoiding damage to [his] own reputation” is at odds with&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTESON v. ROPER&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>his client’s “strongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys&para;<br>had abandoned him.”&para;<br>Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged&para;<br>the nature of their conflict. Shortly before the first motion&para;<br>for substitution was filed, they provided an update to the&para;<br>Missouri Supreme Court on the status of Christeson’s&para;<br>collateral proceedings. In it, they stated:&para;<br>“Because counsel herein would be essential witnesses&para;<br>to factual questions indispensable to a Holland inquiry, there may be ethical and legal conflicts that&para;<br>would arise that would prohibit counsel from litigating issues that would support a Holland claim. Unwaivable ethical and legal conflicts prohibit undersigned counsel from litigating these issues in any way.&para;<br>See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, 485–486&para;<br>(1978). Conflict free counsel must be appointed to&para;<br>present the equitable tolling question in federal district court.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a.&para;<br>Yet, in their response to the District Court’s order to&para;<br>address the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts characterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable&para;<br>tolling as “ludicrous,” and asserted that they had “a legal&para;<br>basis and rationale for the [erroneous] calculation of the&para;<br>filing date.” Id., at 86a, 90a. While not every case in&para;<br>which a counseled habeas petitioner has missed AEDPA’s&para;<br>statute of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of&para;<br>interest, Horwitz and Butts’ contentions here were directly&para;<br>and concededly contrary to their client’s interest, and&para;<br>manifestly served their own professional and reputational&para;<br>interests.&para;<br>Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds&para;<br>for substitution. Even the narrower standard we rejected&para;<br>in that case would have allowed for substitution where an&para;<br>attorney has a “ ‘disabling conflict of interest.’ ” 565 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 7). And that standard, we concluded,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>would “gu[t]” the specific substitution-of-counsel clause&para;<br>contained in §3559(e), which must contemplate the granting of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a&para;<br>petitioner effectively “has no counsel at all”—as is the case&para;<br>when counsel is conflicted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>Indeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital defendant’s “statutory right to counsel,” even “in the absence” of §3599(e) a district court would be compelled “to&para;<br>appoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a conflict.” Ibid.&para;<br>Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the considerations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its&para;<br>decision to deny petitioner new counsel. The second and&para;<br>third factors noted by the District Court—that appointed&para;<br>counsel continued to represent Christeson in litigation&para;<br>challenging the means of his execution, and that the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit had not previously substituted counsel—&para;<br>are not substantial. Whether Horwitz and Butts had&para;<br>currently “abandoned” Christeson is beside the point:&para;<br>Even if they were actively representing him in some matters, their conflict prevented them from representing him&para;<br>in this particular matter. Likewise, it is irrelevant that&para;<br>the Eighth Circuit had not previously sua sponte directed&para;<br>substitution of counsel in the course of denying&para;<br>Christeson’s request for a certificate of appealabilty and&para;<br>adjudicating his challenge to Missouri’s execution protocol,&para;<br>when the conflict was not evident.&para;<br>The first and fourth factors cited by the District Court—&para;<br>the delay in seeking substitution and the potential for&para;<br>abuse—might be valid considerations in many cases. See&para;<br>Clair, 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (“Protecting against&para;<br>abusive delay is an interest of justice”). But under the&para;<br>circumstances here, these factors alone cannot warrant&para;<br>denial of substitution. Christeson’s first substitution&para;<br>motion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive. It&para;<br>was filed approximately a month after outside counsel&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTESON v. ROPER&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>became aware of Christeson’s plight and well before the&para;<br>State had set an execution date, and it requested only 90&para;<br>days to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion.&para;<br>Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substitute counsel might file on Christeson’s behalf would be&para;<br>futile. See id., at ___ – ___ (slip op., at 15–16) (affirming&para;<br>denial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing&para;<br>made by substitute counsel would have been futile). To be&para;<br>sure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to&para;<br>having a federal court consider his habeas petition. Although Christeson might properly raise a claim for relief&para;<br>pursuant to Rule 60(b), see Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.&para;<br>524, 535–536 (2005), to obtain such relief he must demonstrate both the motion’s timeliness and, more significant&para;<br>here, that “ ‘extraordinary circumstances’ justif[y] the&para;<br>reopening of a final judgment.” Id., at 535 (quoting&para;<br>Ackermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950)).&para;<br>That, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was&para;<br>entitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPA’s statute of&para;<br>limitations. He should have that opportunity, and is&para;<br>entitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in doing so.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in&para;<br>forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Eighth&para;<br>Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

As the Court&para;<br>acknowledges, petitioner cannot obtain review of the&para;<br>merits of his federal habeas claims without showing that&para;<br>the applicable statute of limitations should have been&para;<br>equitably tolled, ante, at 2, and the availability of equitable tolling in cases governed by the Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is a question&para;<br>of great importance.&para;<br>AEDPA sought to ameliorate the lengthy delay that had&para;<br>often characterized federal habeas proceedings in the&para;<br>past.* See Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003)&para;<br>(“Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in&para;<br>capital cases”). AEDPA thus imposed a strict 1-year time&para;<br>limit for filing a federal habeas petition. 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2244(d). If this 1-year period were equitably tolled&para;<br>whenever a habeas petitioner’s attorney missed the deadline and thus rendered ineffective assistance, the 1-year&para;<br>period would be of little value, and the days of seemingly&para;<br>interminable federal habeas review would return. In&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Members of this Court have lamented the delay that often occurs in&para;<br>capital cases. Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U.

ROPER&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Holland, the Court held that the AEDPA statute of limitations may be equitably tolled—but only under quite extraordinary circumstances. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S.&para;<br>631, 651–652 (2010). Any expansion or further delineation of such circumstances should not be undertaken&para;<br>without the careful consideration that is possible only&para;<br>after the normal procedure of full briefing and argument.&para;<br>The Court believes that briefing and argument are not&para;<br>necessary in this case, and my understanding of the&para;<br>Court’s decision is that it expresses no view whatsoever on&para;<br>the question whether petitioner may ultimately be entitled&para;<br>to equitable tolling. I understand the Court to hold only&para;<br>that conflict-free substitute counsel should have been&para;<br>appointed for the purposes of investigating the facts related to the issue of equitable tolling and presenting whatever argument can be mounted in support of a request for&para;<br>that relief.&para;<br>Based on the present record, it is not clear that this case&para;<br>involves anything other than an error, albeit a serious one,&para;<br>on the part of the attorneys who represented petitioner at&para;<br>the time when his federal habeas petition was due to be&para;<br>filed. According to those attorneys, they miscalculated the&para;<br>due date and as a result filed the petition after the time&para;<br>had run. They met with petitioner to discuss the habeas&para;<br>petition prior to the date on which they say they thought&para;<br>the petition was due but after the date on which it was&para;<br>actually due. These facts show nothing more than attorney error and thus fall short of establishing the kind of&para;<br>abandonment that is needed for equitable tolling under&para;<br>our precedent. See id., at 651–652. I do not understand&para;<br>the Court’s opinion to hold otherwise.&para;<br>Because of the close relationship between the question&para;<br>that the Court decides (the propriety of the District&para;<br>Court’s refusal to appoint substitute counsel) and the&para;<br>question of petitioner’s entitlement to equitable tolling, I&para;<br>think that plenary review would have been more appro-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.
