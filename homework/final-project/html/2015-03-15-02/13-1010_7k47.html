TACKETT ET AL&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–1010. Argued November 10, 2014—Decided January 26, 2015&para;<br>When petitioner M&amp;G Polymers USA, LLC (M&amp;G), purchased the&para;<br>Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in 2000, it entered a collectivebargaining agreement and related Pension, Insurance, and Service&para;<br>Award Agreement (P &amp; I agreement) with respondent union. As relevant here, the P &amp; I agreement provided that certain retirees, along&para;<br>with their surviving spouses and dependents, would “receive a full&para;<br>Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits”;&para;<br>that such benefits would be provided “for the duration of [the]&para;<br>Agreement”; and that the agreement would be subject to renegotiation in three years.&para;<br>Following the expiration of those agreements, M&amp;G announced&para;<br>that it would require retirees to contribute to the cost of their health&para;<br>care benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, sued M&amp;G and related entities, alleging that&para;<br>the P &amp; I agreement created a vested right to lifetime contributionfree health care benefits.&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a&para;<br>claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed based on the reasoning of its&para;<br>earlier decision in International Union, United Auto, Aerospace, &amp;&para;<br>Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 2d&para;<br>1476. On remand, the District Court ruled in favor of the retirees,&para;<br>and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The Sixth Circuit’s decision rested on principles that are incompatible with ordinary principles of contract law. Pp. 5–14.&para;<br>(a) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)&para;<br>governs pension and welfare benefits plans, including those established by collective-bargaining agreements. ERISA establishes minimum funding and vesting standards for pension plans, but exempts&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>M&amp;G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>welfare benefits plans—which provide the types of benefits at issue&para;<br>here—from those rules. See 29 U. S. C. §§1051(1), 1053, 1081(a)(2),&para;<br>1083. “[E]mployers have large leeway to design . . . welfare plans as&para;<br>they see fit.” Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822,&para;<br>833. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) This Court interprets collective-bargaining agreements, including those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary principles&para;<br>of contract law, at least when those principles are not inconsistent&para;<br>with federal labor policy. See Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,&para;<br>353 U. S. 448, 456–457. When a collective-bargaining agreement is&para;<br>unambiguous, its meaning must be ascertained in accordance with its&para;<br>plainly expressed intent. 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:6, p.&para;<br>108. P. 7.&para;<br>(c) In Yard-Man, the Sixth Circuit found a provision governing retiree insurance benefits ambiguous as to the duration of those benefits; and, looking to other provisions of the agreement, purported to&para;<br>apply ordinary contract law to resolve the ambiguity. First, the court&para;<br>inferred from the existence of termination provisions for other benefits that the absence of a termination provision specifically addressing retiree benefits expressed an intent to vest those benefits for life.&para;<br>The court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be&para;<br>interpreted to avoid illusory promises, reasoning that, absent vesting,&para;<br>the promise would be illusory for the subset of retirees who would not&para;<br>become eligible for those benefits before the contract expired. Finally, the court relied on “the context” of labor negotiations to resolve&para;<br>the ambiguity, inferring that the parties would have intended such&para;<br>benefits to vest for life because they are not mandatory subjects of&para;<br>collective bargaining; are “typically understood as a form of delayed&para;<br>compensation,” 716 F. 2d, at 1482; and are keyed to the acquisition of&para;<br>retirement status. The court concluded that these contextual clues&para;<br>“outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine duration clause.” Id., at 1483. The Sixth Circuit has since extended its&para;<br>Yard-Man analysis in a series of other cases. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(d) The inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny do not represent ordinary principles of contract law. Yard-Man distorts the attempt to ascertain the intention of the parties by placing a thumb on&para;<br>the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreements. Rather than relying on known customs and usages in a&para;<br>particular industry as proven by the parties, the Yard-Man court relied on its own suppositions about the intentions of parties negotiating retiree benefits. It then compounded the error by applying those&para;<br>suppositions indiscriminately across industries. Furthermore, the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit’s refusal to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits distorts an agreement’s text and con-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>flicts with the principle that a written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties.&para;<br>Perhaps tugged by its inferences, the Sixth Circuit also misapplied&para;<br>the illusory promises doctrine. It construed provisions that admittedly benefited some class of retirees as “illusory” merely because they&para;<br>did not benefit all retirees. That interpretation is a contradiction in&para;<br>terms—a promise that is “partly illusory” is by definition not illusory.&para;<br>And its use of this doctrine is particularly inappropriate in the context of collective-bargaining agreements, which often include provisions inapplicable to some category of employees.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit also failed even to consider other traditional contract principles, including the rule that courts should not construe&para;<br>ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and the rule that&para;<br>“contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement,” Litton Financial Printing&para;<br>Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 207.&para;<br>Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(e) Though there is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny affected the outcome here, the Sixth Circuit should be the first to review&para;<br>the agreements under ordinary principles of contract law.

The retirees (and their former union) claim that&para;<br>these agreements created a right to lifetime contributionfree health care benefits for retirees, their surviving&para;<br>spouses, and their dependents. The employer, for its part,&para;<br>claims that those provisions terminated when the agreements expired. The United States Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Sixth Circuit sided with the retirees, relying on its&para;<br>conclusion in International Union, United Auto, Aerospace,&para;<br>&amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man,&para;<br>Inc., 716 F. 2d 1476, 1479 (1983), that retiree health care&para;<br>benefits are unlikely to be left up to future negotiations.&para;<br>We granted certiorari and now conclude that such reasoning is incompatible with ordinary principles of contract&para;<br>law.

Conley worked at (and retired from) the&para;<br>Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in Apple Grove, West&para;<br>Virginia (hereinafter referred to as the Plant). During&para;<br>their employment, respondent United Steel, Paper and&para;<br>Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIOCLC, or its predecessor unions (hereinafter referred to as&para;<br>the Union), represented them in collective bargaining.&para;<br>Tackett and Pyles retired in 1996, and Conley retired in&para;<br>1998. They represent a class of retired employees from&para;<br>the Plant, along with their surviving spouses and other&para;<br>dependents. Petitioner M&amp;G Polymers USA, LLC, is the&para;<br>current owner of the Plant.&para;<br>When M&amp;G purchased the Plant in 2000, it entered a&para;<br>master collective-bargaining agreement and a Pension,&para;<br>Insurance, and Service Award Agreement (P &amp; I agreement) with the Union, generally similar to agreements the&para;<br>Union had negotiated with M&amp;G’s predecessor. The P &amp; I&para;<br>agreement provided for retiree health care benefits as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“Employees who retire on or after January 1, 1996&para;<br>and who are eligible for and receiving a monthly pension under the 1993 Pension Plan . . . whose full years&para;<br>of attained age and full years of attained continuous&para;<br>service . . . at the time of retirement equals 95 or more&para;<br>points will receive a full Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits described in&para;<br>this Exhibit B–1 . . . .

The P &amp; I agreement provided for&para;<br>renegotiation of its terms in three years.1&para;<br>B&para;<br>In December 2006, M&amp;G announced that it would begin&para;<br>requiring retirees to contribute to the cost of their health&para;<br>care benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, sued M&amp;G and related entities, alleging that the decision to require these&para;<br>contributions breached both the collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreement and the P &amp; I agreement, in violation of §301 of&para;<br>the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA) and&para;<br>§502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security&para;<br>Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891.2 Specifically, the retirees alleged that M&amp;G had promised to provide lifetime&para;<br>contribution-free health care benefits for them, their&para;<br>surviving spouses, and their dependents. They pointed to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In accordance with this provision, M&amp;G and the Union began bargaining anew in 2003, ultimately reaching a new agreement in 2005.&para;<br>The provisions of the existing agreements remained in effect during the&para;<br>course of those negotiations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25, n. 1.&para;<br>2 The Union was a plaintiff in the suit and is a respondent here.

Exhibit B–1.” The retirees&para;<br>alleged that, with this promise, M&amp;G had created a vested&para;<br>right to such benefits that continued beyond the expiration&para;<br>of the 2000 P &amp; I agreement.&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to&para;<br>state a claim. 523 F. Supp. 2d 684, 696 (SD Ohio 2007). It&para;<br>concluded that the cited language unambiguously did not&para;<br>create a vested right to retiree benefits.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed based on the reasoning of&para;<br>its earlier decision in Yard-Man. 561 F. 3d 478 (CA6&para;<br>2009) (Tackett I). Yard-Man involved a similar claim that&para;<br>an employer had breached a collective-bargaining agreement when it terminated retiree benefits. 716 F. 2d, at&para;<br>1478. Although the court found the text of the provision in&para;<br>that case ambiguous, it relied on the “context” of labor&para;<br>negotiations to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the&para;<br>retirees’ interpretation. Id., at 1482. Specifically, the&para;<br>court inferred that parties to collective bargaining would&para;<br>intend retiree benefits to vest for life because such benefits&para;<br>are “not mandatory” or required to be included in collectivebargaining agreements, are “typically understood as a&para;<br>form of delayed compensation or reward for past services,”&para;<br>and are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status.&para;<br>Ibid. The court concluded that these inferences “outweigh[ed] any contrary implications [about the termination of retiree benefits] derived from” general termination&para;<br>clauses. Id., at 1483.&para;<br>Applying the Yard-Man inferences on review of the&para;<br>District Court’s dismissal of the action, the Court of Appeals concluded that the retirees had stated a plausible&para;<br>claim. Tackett I, 561 F. 3d, at 490. “Keeping in mind the&para;<br>context of the labor-management negotiations identified in&para;<br>Yard-Man,” the court found “it unlikely that [the Union]&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would agree to language that ensures its members a ‘full&para;<br>Company contribution,’ if the company could unilaterally&para;<br>change the level of contribution.” Ibid. The court construed the language about “employees” contributing to&para;<br>their health care premiums as limited to employees who&para;<br>had not attained the requisite seniority points to be entitled to a full company contribution. Ibid. And it discerned&para;<br>an intent to vest lifetime contribution-free health care&para;<br>benefits from provisions tying eligibility for health care&para;<br>benefits to eligibility for pension benefits. Id., at 490–491.&para;<br>On remand, the District Court conducted a bench trial&para;<br>and ruled in favor of the retirees. It declined to revisit the&para;<br>question whether the P &amp; I agreement created a vested&para;<br>right to retiree benefits, concluding that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals had definitively resolved that issue. It then&para;<br>issued a permanent injunction ordering M&amp;G to reinstate&para;<br>contribution-free health care benefits for the individual&para;<br>respondents and similarly situated retirees. 853 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 697 (SD Ohio 2012).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that, although the District Court had erred in treating Tackett I as&para;<br>a conclusive resolution of the meaning of the P &amp; I agreement, it had not erred in “presum[ing]” that, “in the absence of extrinsic evidence to the contrary, the agreements&para;<br>indicated an intent to vest lifetime contribution-free benefits.” 733 F. 3d 589, 600 (CA6 2013) (Tackett II). And&para;<br>because the District Court had concluded that the proffered extrinsic evidence was inapplicable, it had not clearly&para;<br>erred in finding that the agreement created those vested&para;<br>rights.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), and now&para;<br>vacate and remand.&para;<br>II&para;<br>This case is about the interpretation of collectivebargaining agreements that define rights to welfare bene-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>M&amp;G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fits plans. The LMRA grants federal courts jurisdiction to&para;<br>resolve disputes between employers and labor unions&para;<br>about collective-bargaining agreements. 29 U. S. C. §185.&para;<br>When collective-bargaining agreements create pension or&para;<br>welfare benefits plans, those plans are subject to rules&para;<br>established in ERISA. ERISA defines pension plans as&para;<br>plans, funds, or programs that “provid[e] retirement income to employees” or that “resul[t] in a deferral of income.” §1002(2)(A). It defines welfare benefits plans as&para;<br>plans, funds, or programs established or maintained to&para;<br>provide participants with additional benefits, such as life&para;<br>insurance and disability coverage. §1002(1).&para;<br>ERISA treats these two types of plans differently.&para;<br>Although ERISA imposes elaborate minimum funding and&para;<br>vesting standards for pension plans, §§1053, 1082, 1083,&para;<br>1084, it explicitly exempts welfare benefits plans from&para;<br>those rules, §§1051(1), 1081(a)(1). Welfare benefits plans&para;<br>must be “established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,” §1102(a)(1), but “[e]mployers or other&para;<br>plan sponsors are generally free under ERISA, for any&para;<br>reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare&para;<br>plans,” Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S.&para;<br>73, 78 (1995).&para;<br>As we have previously recognized,&para;<br>“[E]mployers have large leeway to design disability and&para;<br>other welfare plans as they see fit.” Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822, 833 (2003). And, we&para;<br>have observed, the rule that contractual “provisions ordinarily should be enforced as written is especially appropriate when enforcing an ERISA [welfare benefits] plan.”&para;<br>Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 571 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7). That is because the “focus&para;<br>on the written terms of the plan is the linchpin of a system&para;<br>that is not so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering&para;<br>[welfare benefits] plans in the first place.” Id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 8) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>We interpret collective-bargaining agreements, including those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary&para;<br>principles of contract law, at least when those principles&para;<br>are not inconsistent with federal labor policy. See Textile&para;<br>Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 456–457&para;<br>(1957). “In this endeavor, as with any other contract, the&para;<br>parties’ intentions control.” Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 682 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Where the words of a contract in&para;<br>writing are clear and unambiguous, its meaning is to be&para;<br>ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:6, p. 108 (4th&para;<br>ed. 2012) (Williston) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>In this case, the Court of Appeals applied the Yard-Man&para;<br>inferences to conclude that, in the absence of extrinsic&para;<br>evidence to the contrary, the provisions of the contract&para;<br>indicated an intent to vest retirees with lifetime benefits.&para;<br>Tackett II, 733 F. 3d, at 599–600. As we now explain,&para;<br>those inferences conflict with ordinary principles of contract law.&para;<br>III&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Court of Appeals has long insisted that its YardMan inferences are drawn from ordinary contract law. In&para;<br>Yard-Man itself, the court purported to apply “traditional&para;<br>rules for contractual interpretation.” 716 F. 2d, at 1479.&para;<br>The court first concluded that the provision governing&para;<br>retiree insurance benefits—which stated only that the&para;<br>employer “will provide” such benefits—was ambiguous as&para;<br>to the duration of those benefits. Id., at 1480. To resolve&para;<br>that ambiguity, it looked to other provisions of the agreement. The agreement included provisions for terminating&para;<br>active employees’ insurance benefits in the case of layoffs&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>M&amp;G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and for terminating benefits for a retiree’s spouse and&para;<br>dependents in case of the retiree’s death before the expiration of the collective-bargaining agreement, but no provision specifically addressed the duration of retiree health&para;<br>care benefits. Id., at 1481–1482. From the existence of&para;<br>these termination provisions and the absence of a termination provision specifically addressing retiree benefits,&para;<br>the court inferred an intent to vest those retiree benefits&para;<br>for life.&para;<br>The court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be interpreted to avoid illusory promises. It&para;<br>noted that the retiree insurance provisions “contain[ed] a&para;<br>promise that the company will pay an early retiree’s insurance upon such retiree reaching age 65 but that the&para;<br>retiree must bear the cost of company insurance until that&para;<br>time.” Id., at 1481. Employees could retire at age 55, but&para;<br>the agreement containing this promise applied only for a&para;<br>3-year term. Ibid. Thus, retirees between the ages of 55&para;<br>and 62 would not turn 65 and become eligible for the&para;<br>company contribution before the 3-year agreement expired. In light of this fact, the court reasoned that the&para;<br>promise would be “completely illusory for many early&para;<br>retirees under age 62” if the retiree benefits terminated&para;<br>when the contract expired. Ibid.&para;<br>Finally, the court turned to “the context” of labor negotiations. Id., at 1482. It observed that “[b]enefits for&para;<br>retirees are . . . not mandatory subjects of collective bargaining” and that “employees are presumably aware that&para;<br>the union owes no obligation to bargain for continued&para;<br>benefits for retirees.” Ibid. Based on these observations,&para;<br>the court concluded that “it is unlikely that such benefits&para;<br>. . . would be left to the contingencies of future negotiations.” Ibid. It also asserted that “retiree benefits are in a&para;<br>sense ‘status’ benefits which, as such, carry with them an&para;<br>inference that they continue so long as the prerequisite&para;<br>status is maintained.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Although the contract included a general durational&para;<br>clause—meaning that the contract itself would expire at a&para;<br>set time—the court concluded that these contextual clues&para;<br>“outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a&para;<br>routine duration clause.” Id., at 1483.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Two years after Yard-Man, the court took this analysis&para;<br>even further. In a dispute between retirees and a steel&para;<br>company over retiree health insurance benefits, it construed the language “will continue to provide at its expense, supplemental medicare and major medical benefits&para;<br>for Pensioners aged 65 and over” to “unambiguously confe[r]” lifetime benefits. Policy v. Powell Pressed Steel Co.,&para;<br>770 F. 2d 609, 615 (CA6 1985) (emphasis added). Yet it&para;<br>had interpreted similar language—“will provide insurance&para;<br>benefits equal to the active group”—to be ambiguous in&para;<br>Yard-Man. The court refused to give any weight to provisions that supported a contrary construction—namely, one&para;<br>establishing a fund to pay pension, but not welfare, benefits, and another providing for the continuation of pension,&para;<br>but not welfare, benefits after the agreement expired.&para;<br>Policy, 770 F. 2d, at 615–616. According to the court, a&para;<br>contrary interpretation “would render the Company’s&para;<br>promise [of benefits for retirees aged 65 and over] in substantial part nugatory and illusory” to retirees who were&para;<br>62 or younger when the 3-year agreement was signed.&para;<br>Ibid. And it faulted the District Court for failing “to give&para;<br>effect” to Yard-Man’s admonition “that retiree benefits&para;<br>normally . . . are interminable.” 770 F. 2d, at 616.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals has continued to extend the reasoning of Yard-Man. Relying on Yard-Man’s statement&para;<br>that context considerations outweigh the effect of a general termination clause, it has concluded that, “ ‘[a]bsent&para;<br>specific durational language referring to retiree benefits&para;<br>themselves,’ a general durational clause says nothing&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>M&amp;G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>about the vesting of retiree benefits.” Noe v. PolyOne&para;<br>Corp., 520 F. 3d 548, 555 (CA6 2008) (emphasis added). It&para;<br>has also held that a provision that “ties eligibility for&para;<br>retirement-health benefits to eligibility for a pension . . .&para;<br>[leaves] little room for debate that retirees’ health benefits&para;<br>ves[t] upon retirement.” Id., at 558 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Commenting on these extensions of&para;<br>Yard-Man, the court has acknowledged that “there is a&para;<br>reasonable argument to be made that, while th[e] court&para;<br>has repeatedly cautioned that Yard-Man does not create a&para;<br>presumption of vesting, [it] ha[s] gone on to apply just&para;<br>such a presumption.” Cole v. ArvinMeritor, Inc., 549 F. 3d&para;<br>1064, 1074 (CA6 2008).&para;<br>B&para;<br>We disagree with the Court of Appeals’ assessment that&para;<br>the inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny represent ordinary principles of contract law.&para;<br>As an initial matter, Yard-Man violates ordinary contract principles by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of&para;<br>vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining agreements. That rule has no basis in ordinary principles of&para;<br>contract law. And it distorts the attempt “to ascertain the&para;<br>intention of the parties.” 11 Williston §30:2, at 18 (emphasis added); see also Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 682. YardMan’s assessment of likely behavior in collective bargaining is too speculative and too far removed from the context&para;<br>of any particular contract to be useful in discerning the&para;<br>parties’ intention.&para;<br>And the Court of Appeals derived its assessment of&para;<br>likely behavior not from record evidence, but instead from&para;<br>its own suppositions about the intentions of employees,&para;<br>unions, and employers negotiating retiree benefits. See&para;<br>Yard-Man, 716 F. 2d, at 1482. For example, it asserted,&para;<br>without any foundation, that, “when . . . parties contract&para;<br>for benefits which accrue upon achievement of retiree&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>status, there is an inference that the parties likely intended those benefits to continue as long as the beneficiary remains a retiree.” Ibid.; see also ibid. (“[I]t is unlikely&para;<br>that [retiree] benefits . . . would be left to the contingencies of future negotiations”). Although a court may look to&para;<br>known customs or usages in a particular industry to determine the meaning of a contract, the parties must prove&para;<br>those customs or usages using affirmative evidentiary&para;<br>support in a given case. 12 Williston §34:3; accord, Robinson v. United States, 13 Wall. 363, 366 (1872); Oelricks v.&para;<br>Ford, 23 How. 49, 61–62 (1860). Yard-Man relied on no&para;<br>record evidence indicating that employers and unions in&para;<br>that industry customarily vest retiree benefits. Worse, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals has taken the inferences in Yard-Man&para;<br>and applied them indiscriminately across industries. See,&para;<br>e.g., Cole, supra, at 1074 (automobile); Armistead v. Vernitron Corp., 944 F. 2d 1287, 1297 (CA6 1991) (electronics); Policy, supra, at 618 (steel).&para;<br>Because the Court of Appeals did not ground its YardMan inferences in any record evidence, it is unsurprising&para;<br>that the inferences rest on a shaky factual foundation.&para;<br>For example, Yard-Man relied in part on the premise that&para;<br>retiree health care benefits are not subjects of mandatory&para;<br>collective bargaining. Parties, however, can and do voluntarily agree to make retiree benefits a subject of mandatory collective bargaining. Indeed, the employer and union&para;<br>in this case entered such an agreement in 2001. App.&para;<br>435–436. Yard-Man also relied on the premise that retiree benefits are a form of deferred compensation, but&para;<br>that characterization is contrary to Congress’ determination otherwise. In ERISA, Congress specifically defined&para;<br>plans that “resul[t] in a deferral of income by employees” as pension plans, §1002(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer&para;<br>medical benefits as welfare plans, §1002(1)(A). Thus,&para;<br>retiree health care benefits are not a form of deferred&para;<br>compensation.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>M&amp;G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Further compounding this error, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>has refused to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits. Having inferred that&para;<br>parties would not leave retiree benefits to the contingencies of future negotiations, and that retiree benefits generally last as long as the recipient remains a retiree, the&para;<br>court in Yard-Man explicitly concluded that these inferences “outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived&para;<br>from a routine duration clause terminating the agreement&para;<br>generally.” 716 F. 2d, at 1482–1483. The court’s subsequent decisions went even further, requiring a contract to&para;<br>include a specific durational clause for retiree health care&para;<br>benefits to prevent vesting. E.g., Noe, supra, at 555.&para;<br>These decisions distort the text of the agreement and&para;<br>conflict with the principle of contract law that the written&para;<br>agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement&para;<br>of the parties. See 1 W. Story, Law of Contracts §780 (M.&para;<br>Bigelow ed., 5th ed. 1874); see also 11 Williston §31:5.&para;<br>Perhaps tugged by these inferences, the Court of Appeals misapplied other traditional principles of contract&para;<br>law, including the illusory promises doctrine. That doctrine instructs courts to avoid constructions of contracts&para;<br>that would render promises illusory because such promises&para;<br>cannot serve as consideration for a contract. See 3&para;<br>Williston §7:7 (4th ed. 2008). But the Court of Appeals&para;<br>construed provisions that admittedly benefited some class&para;<br>of retirees as “illusory” merely because they did not equally&para;<br>benefit all retirees. See Yard-Man, supra, at 1480–&para;<br>1481. That interpretation is a contradiction in terms—a&para;<br>promise that is “partly” illusory is by definition not illusory.&para;<br>If it benefits some class of retirees, then it may serve&para;<br>as consideration for the union’s promises. And the court’s&para;<br>interpretation is particularly inappropriate in the context&para;<br>of collective-bargaining agreements, which are negotiated&para;<br>on behalf of a broad category of individuals and consequently will often include provisions inapplicable to some&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>category of employees.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also failed even to consider the&para;<br>traditional principle that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises. See 3 A.&para;<br>Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §553, p. 216 (1960) (explaining that contracts that are silent as to their duration will&para;<br>ordinarily be treated not as “operative in perpetuity” but&para;<br>as “operative for a reasonable time” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)). The court recognized that “traditional&para;<br>rules of contractual interpretation require a clear manifestation of intent before conferring a benefit or obligation,”&para;<br>but asserted that “the duration of the benefit once clearly&para;<br>conferred is [not] subject to this stricture.” Yard-Man,&para;<br>supra, at 1481, n. 2. In stark contrast to this assertion,&para;<br>however, the court later applied that very stricture to&para;<br>noncollectively bargained contracts offering retiree benefits. See Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F. 3d 388,&para;<br>400 (CA6 1998) (“To vest benefits is to render them forever&para;<br>unalterable. Because vesting of welfare plan benefits is&para;<br>not required by law, an employer’s commitment to vest&para;<br>such benefits is not to be inferred lightly; the intent to vest&para;<br>must be found in the plan documents and must be stated&para;<br>in clear and express language” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). The different treatment of these two types of&para;<br>employment contracts only underscores Yard-Man’s deviation from ordinary principles of contract law.&para;<br>Similarly, the Court of Appeals failed to consider the&para;<br>traditional principle that “contractual obligations will&para;<br>cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the&para;<br>bargaining agreement.” Litton Financial Printing Div.,&para;<br>Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 207&para;<br>(1991). That principle does not preclude the conclusion&para;<br>that the parties intended to vest lifetime benefits for&para;<br>retirees. Indeed, we have already recognized that “a&para;<br>collective-bargaining agreement [may] provid[e] in explicit&para;<br>terms that certain benefits continue after the agreement’s&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>M&amp;G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>expiration.” Ibid. But when a contract is silent as to the&para;<br>duration of retiree benefits, a court may not infer that the&para;<br>parties intended those benefits to vest for life.&para;<br>C&para;<br>There is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny affected the outcome here. As in its previous decisions, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals here cited the “context of . . . labormanagement negotiations” and reasoned that the Union&para;<br>likely would not have agreed to language ensuring its&para;<br>members a “full Company contribution” if the company&para;<br>could change the level of that contribution. Tackett I, 561&para;<br>F. 3d, at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). It similarly concluded that the tying of eligibility for health care&para;<br>benefits to receipt of pension benefits suggested an intent&para;<br>to vest health care benefits. Ibid. And it framed its analysis from beginning to end in light of the principles it&para;<br>announced in Yard-Man and its progeny. See 561 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 489; see also Tackett II, 733 F. 3d, at 599–600.&para;<br>We reject the Yard-Man inferences as inconsistent with&para;<br>ordinary principles of contract law. But because “[t]his&para;<br>Court is one of final review, not of first view,” Ford Motor&para;<br>Co. v. United States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam)&para;<br>(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted), the&para;<br>Court of Appeals should be the first to review the agreements at issue under the correct legal principles.

Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:2, p. 27 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston).
