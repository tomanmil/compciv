UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–6549. Argued October 3, 2011—Decided January 23, 2012&para;<br>The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Act) requires convicted sex offenders to provide state governments with, and&para;<br>to update, information, e.g., names and current addresses, for state&para;<br>and federal sex offender registries. It is a crime if a person who is&para;<br>“required to register under [the Act]” and who “travels in interstate&para;<br>. . . commerce” knowingly “fails to register or update a registration.”&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The Act defines “sex offender” to include offenders who were convicted before the Act’s effective date, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§16911(1), and says that “the Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements”&para;<br>to pre-Act offenders, §16913(d). The Act, which seeks to make more&para;<br>uniform and effective a patchwork of pre-Act federal and 50 state registration systems, became law in July 2006. In February 2007, the&para;<br>Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the&para;<br>Act applies to all pre-Act offenders. He has since promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications.&para;<br>Petitioner Reynolds, a pre-Act offender, registered in Missouri in&para;<br>2005 but moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updating the Missouri registration or registering in Pennsylvania. He was&para;<br>indicted for failing to meet the Act’s registration requirements between September 16 and October 16, 2007. He moved to dismiss the&para;<br>indictment on the ground that the Act was not applicable to pre-Act&para;<br>offenders during that time, arguing that the Attorney General’s February 2007 Interim Rule was invalid because it violated the Constitution’s “nondelegation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure&para;<br>Act’s notice and comment requirements. The District Court rejected&para;<br>on the merits of Reynolds’ legal attack on the Interim Rule, but the&para;<br>Third Circuit rejected his argument without reaching the merits,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>concluding that the Act’s registration requirements applied to pre-Act&para;<br>offenders even in the absence of a rule by the Attorney General.&para;<br>Thus, it found, the Interim Rule’s validity made no legal difference in&para;<br>the outcome.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Act does not require pre-Act offenders to register before the&para;<br>Attorney General validly specifies that the Act’s registration provisions apply to them. Pp. 6–13.&para;<br>(a) This conclusion is supported by a natural reading of the Act’s&para;<br>text, which consists of four statements. Statement One says that “[a]&para;<br>sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.”&para;<br>Statement Two says that, generally, the offender must initially register before completing his “sentence of imprisonment.” Statement&para;<br>Three says that the sex offender must update a registration within&para;<br>three business days of any change of “name, residence, employment,&para;<br>or student status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney General&para;<br>shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements . . . to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of” the Act.&para;<br>§16913. Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First. It&para;<br>deals specifically with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of the First Statement’s broad general class (all sex offenders) and thus should control&para;<br>the Act’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v. United&para;<br>States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. Also, by giving the Attorney General authority to specify the Act’s “applicability,” not its “nonapplicability,”&para;<br>the Fourth Statement is more naturally read to confer authority to&para;<br>apply the Act, not authority to make exceptions. This reading efficiently resolves what may have been Congress’ concern about the&para;<br>practical problems of applying the new registration requirements to a&para;<br>large number of pre-Act offenders, which could have been expensive&para;<br>and might not have proved feasible to do immediately. It might have&para;<br>thought that such concerns warranted different treatment for different categories of pre-Act offenders. And it could have concluded that&para;<br>it was efficient and desirable to ask the Justice Department, charged&para;<br>with responsibility for implementation, to examine pre-Act offender&para;<br>problems and to apply the new requirements accordingly. This reading also takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by&para;<br>related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic criminal&para;<br>law principles. The Second Statement, e.g., requires a sex offender to&para;<br>register before completing his prison term, but says nothing about&para;<br>when a pre-Act offender who has left prison is to register. An Attorney General ruling could diminish such uncertainties, helping to&para;<br>eliminate the kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law&para;<br>must seek to avoid. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) The Government’s three principal contrary arguments—that&para;<br>the Court’s reading conflicts with the Act’s purpose of establishing a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>national registration system that includes pre-Act offenders; that the&para;<br>Court’s reading could lead to an absurdly long implementation delay;&para;<br>and that the Act should be read to apply the requirements immediately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders to avoid the possibility&para;<br>that the Attorney General, who has, but is not required to use, “the&para;<br>authority to specify” requirements, might take no action—are unpersuasive. Some lower courts have read the Attorney General’s authority to apply only to pre-Act sex offenders who are unable to comply&para;<br>with the statute’s “initial registration” requirements, but that is not&para;<br>what the Act says. Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>(c) Because the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to preAct offenders until the Attorney General so specifies, the question&para;<br>whether the Attorney General’s Interim Rule is a valid specification&para;<br>matters in this case.

(2006&para;<br>ed. and Supp. III), requires those convicted of certain sex&para;<br>crimes to provide state governments with (and to update)&para;<br>information, such as names and current addresses, for&para;<br>inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.&para;<br>§§16912(a), 16913–16914, 16919(a) (2006 ed.). The Act&para;<br>makes it a crime for a person who is “required to register” under the Act and who “travels in interstate or foreign&para;<br>commerce” knowingly to “fai[l] to register or update a registration . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The question before us concerns the date on which this federal registration requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders&para;<br>convicted before the Act became law.&para;<br>The Act defines the term “sex offender” as including&para;<br>these pre-Act offenders. 42 U. S. C. §16911(1); see Carr v.&para;<br>United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7). It&para;<br>says that “[a] sex offender shall register.” §16913(a).

In our view, these provisions, read together, mean&para;<br>that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to&para;<br>pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that&para;<br>they do apply. We reverse a Court of Appeals determination that, in effect, holds the contrary.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The new federal Act reflects Congress’ awareness that&para;<br>pre-Act registration law consisted of a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems. See&para;<br>73 Fed. Reg. 38045 (2008). The Act seeks to make those&para;<br>systems more uniform and effective. It does so by repealing several earlier federal laws that also (but less effectively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive&para;<br>registration-system standards; by making federal funding&para;<br>contingent on States’ bringing their systems into compliance with those standards; by requiring both state and&para;<br>federal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions&para;<br>(and to keep registration information current); and by&para;<br>creating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who&para;<br>violate the Act’s registration requirements. 18 U.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The new Act became law on July 27, 2006.&para;<br>On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that “[t]he requirements of&para;<br>[the Act] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders&para;<br>convicted of the offense for which registration is required&para;<br>prior to the enactment of that Act.” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897&para;<br>(codified at 28 CFR §72.3). Subsequently, the Attorney&para;<br>General promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (2008); 75 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>81849 (2010); 76 Fed. Reg. 1630 (2011). The present case&para;<br>focuses upon the applicability of the Act’s registration&para;<br>requirements to pre-Act offenders during the period between (1) July 27, 2006 (when the Act took effect) and&para;<br>(2) the moment when the Attorney General promulgated&para;<br>a valid rule specifying the registration requirements’ applicability, namely, February 28, 2007 (or a later date if&para;<br>the February 28 specification was invalid).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Billy Joe Reynolds, the petitioner, is a pre-Act offender.&para;<br>He was convicted of a Missouri sex offense in October&para;<br>2001; he served four years in prison; he was released in&para;<br>July 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender;&para;<br>but he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without&para;<br>updating his Missouri registration information (as Missouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylvania. A federal grand jury indicted him, charging him with,&para;<br>between September 16 and October 16, 2007, having&para;<br>“knowingly failed to register and update a registration as&para;<br>required by [the Act].” App. 13; see 18 U. S. C. §2250(a).&para;<br>In the Government’s view, Reynolds’ failure to update his&para;<br>address information when he moved to Pennsylvania&para;<br>violated the requirement that a “sex offender” update&para;<br>registration information within “3 business days after&para;<br>each change of . . . residence.” 42 U. S. C. §16913(c).&para;<br>Reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ground that in September and October 2007 the Act’s registration requirements had not yet become applicable to&para;<br>pre-Act offenders. He conceded that the Act had become&para;<br>law earlier (namely, in July 2006), and he conceded that&para;<br>the Attorney General had already (in February 2007)&para;<br>promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act’s&para;<br>registration requirements were applicable to pre-Act&para;<br>offenders. But he claimed that the Interim Rule was&para;<br>invalid because it violated both the Constitution’s “nondelegation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act’s&para;<br>(APA) requirement for “good cause” to promulgate a rule&para;<br>without “notice and comment” (as the Attorney General&para;<br>had done). See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United&para;<br>States, 295 U. S. 495, 529 (1935) (nondelegation doctrine);&para;<br>5 U. S. C. §§553(b)(3)(B), (d)(3) (APA). Because the Interim Rule is invalid, he added, the law must treat him like a&para;<br>pre-Act offender who traveled interstate and violated the&para;<br>Act’s registration requirements before the Attorney General specified their applicability.&para;<br>The District Court rejected on the merits Reynolds’ legal&para;<br>attack on the Interim Rule. But the Court of Appeals&para;<br>rejected Reynolds’ argument without reaching those merits. 380 Fed. Appx. 125 (2010). That court thought that&para;<br>the Act’s registration requirements apply to pre-Act offenders such as Reynolds (who was subject to a preexisting state-law registration requirement) from the date&para;<br>of the new law’s enactment—even in the absence of any&para;<br>rule or regulation by the Attorney General specifying that&para;<br>the new registration requirements apply. That being so,&para;<br>the validity of the Interim Rule could make no legal difference, for the Act required Reynolds to follow the&para;<br>new federal registration requirements regardless of any&para;<br>rulemaking.&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals have reached different conclusions about whether the Act’s registration requirements&para;<br>apply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time that the Attor-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ney General specifies their applicability, i.e., from July&para;<br>2006 until at least February 2007. Six Circuits have held&para;<br>that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to&para;<br>pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so&para;<br>specifies. United States v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 922–&para;<br>927 (CA5 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F. 3d 1159,&para;<br>1162–1164 (CA9 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d&para;<br>408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F.&para;<br>3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551&para;<br>F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); United States v. Madera, 528 F.&para;<br>3d 852, 856–859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam). Five Circuits&para;<br>have held that they apply from the date of the Act’s enactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with&para;<br>respect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered&para;<br>under state law. United States v. Fuller, 627 F. 3d 499,&para;<br>506 (CA2 2010); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F. 3d 17,&para;<br>24 (CA1 2010); United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F. 3d&para;<br>151, 163 (CA3 2010); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d&para;<br>926, 932 (CA10 2008); United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912,&para;<br>918–919 (CA8 2008). In light of this split, we agreed to&para;<br>consider the question.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The question before us is whether the Act requires&para;<br>pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General&para;<br>validly specifies that the Act’s registration provisions apply to them. We believe that it does not. For one thing,&para;<br>a natural reading of the textual language supports our&para;<br>conclusion. The text consists of four statements. See&para;<br>supra, at 3. Statement One says that “[a] sex offender&para;<br>shall register, and keep the registration current.” Statement Two says that a sex offender must initially register&para;<br>before completing his “sentence of imprisonment” (or, if&para;<br>the sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three&para;<br>days of conviction). Statement Three says that the sex&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>offender must update a registration within three business&para;<br>days of any change of “name, residence, employment, or&para;<br>student status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney&para;<br>General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders&para;<br>convicted before the enactment of this chapter.”&para;<br>Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.&para;<br>It specifically deals with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of&para;<br>a broad general class (all sex offenders) to which the First&para;<br>Statement applies. And it therefore should control the&para;<br>Act’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v.&para;<br>United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (specific statutory&para;<br>provision normally controls over one of more general&para;<br>application); see also Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (same).&para;<br>At the same time, the Fourth Statement says that the&para;<br>Attorney General has authority to specify the Act’s “applicability,” not its “nonapplicability.” And it consequently&para;<br>is more naturally read as conferring the authority to apply&para;<br>the Act, not the authority to make exceptions. That is&para;<br>how we normally understand a term such as “authority to&para;<br>specify” in the context of applying new rules to persons&para;<br>already governed by pre-existing rules. If, for example,&para;<br>the Major League Baseball Players Association and the&para;<br>team owners agreed that the Commissioner of Baseball&para;<br>“shall have the authority to specify the applicability” to&para;<br>the major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug&para;<br>testing policy, we should think that the minor league&para;<br>policy would not apply unless and until the Commissioner&para;<br>so specified.&para;<br>For another thing, this reading of the Act efficiently&para;<br>resolves what Congress may well have thought were practical problems arising when the Act sought to apply the&para;<br>new registration requirements to pre-Act offenders. The&para;<br>problems arise out of the fact that the Act seeks to make&para;<br>more uniform a patchwork of pre-existing state systems.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Doing so could require newly registering or re-registering&para;<br>“a large number” of pre-Act offenders. That effort could&para;<br>prove expensive. And it might not prove feasible to do so&para;<br>immediately. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these&para;<br>problems). Congress’ concern about these problems is reflected in the Act’s providing the States with three years&para;<br>to bring their systems into compliance with federal standards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that&para;<br>3-year grace period to five years. 42 U. S. C. §16924.&para;<br>These same considerations might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act offenders. Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035–38036,&para;<br>and 38046–38047 (final Department of Justice guidelines&para;<br>allowing States to meet Act requirements without registering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>1635–1636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same).&para;<br>At least Congress might well have so thought. And consequently, Congress might well have looked for a solution.&para;<br>Asking the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act&para;<br>offender problems and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly could have represented one efficient and desirable solution (though we express no view&para;<br>on Reynolds’ related constitutional claim). Cf. 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§16912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945&para;<br>(granting the Attorney General authority to administer&para;<br>various aspects of the Act). And that is just the solution&para;<br>that the Act’s language says that Congress adopted.&para;<br>Finally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have&para;<br>filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions)&para;<br>in a manner consistent with basic background principles&para;<br>of criminal law. The Second Statement, for example, says&para;<br>that a sex offender must register before completing his&para;<br>prison term, but the provision says nothing about when a&para;<br>pre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act&para;<br>must register. Although a state pre-Act offender could not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>be prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no&para;<br>interstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender. And&para;<br>to apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from&para;<br>the date of enactment would require reading into the&para;<br>statute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equivalent (e.g., registering or updating within a “reasonable&para;<br>time” or “within three days of first post-Act travel in interstate commerce” or “as preexisting state law requires”).&para;<br>Pre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae,&para;<br>and difficulties, might, on their own, reach different conclusions about whether, or how, the new registration&para;<br>requirements applied to them. A ruling from the Attorney&para;<br>General, however, could diminish or eliminate those uncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of&para;<br>vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to&para;<br>avoid. Cf., e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 266&para;<br>(1997) (noting that “the canon of strict construction of&para;<br>criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by&para;<br>so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it&para;<br>only to conduct clearly covered”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Government makes three principal arguments to&para;<br>the contrary. First, it says that our interpretation of the&para;<br>Act conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the&para;<br>“establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for&para;<br>the registration of [sex] offenders,” 42 U. S. C. §16901,&para;<br>that includes offenders who committed their offenses&para;<br>before the Act became law. The Act reflects that purpose&para;<br>when it defines “sex offender” broadly to include any&para;<br>“individual who was convicted of a sex offense.” §16911(1).&para;<br>And we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in&para;<br>general, the Act’s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act&para;<br>offender required to register under the Act who later&para;<br>travels interstate and fails to register. See Carr, 560&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Act’s history also reveals that many of its supporters placed considerable importance upon the registration&para;<br>of pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt.&para;<br>1, p. 24 (2005) (H. R. Rep.) (“[Twenty] percent of sexual&para;<br>offenders are ‘lost,’ and there is a strong public interest&para;<br>in finding them and having them register with current&para;<br>information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes&para;<br>against children”); 152 Cong. Rec. 15333 (2006) (statement&para;<br>of Sen. Cantwell) (“Child sex offenders have exploited this&para;<br>stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have&para;<br>been tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation’s 560,000 sex&para;<br>offenders are ‘lost’ because State offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough”); id., at 15338&para;<br>(statement of Sen. Kyl) (“There currently are over 100,000&para;<br>sex offenders in this country who are required to register&para;<br>but are ‘off the system.’ They are not registered. The&para;<br>penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that&para;<br>these individuals register”); id., at 13050 (statement of&para;<br>Sen.

Every day that we don’t have&para;<br>this national sex offender registry, these missing sex&para;<br>predators are out there somewhere”).&para;<br>The difficulty with the Government’s argument, however, is that it overstates the need for instantaneous registration of pre-Act offenders. Our different reading, we&para;<br>concede, involves implementation delay. But that delay&para;<br>need not be long (the Attorney General issued his Interim&para;<br>Rule 217 days after the effective date of the new law).&para;<br>And that delay can be justified by the need to accommodate other Act-related interests. See supra, at 7–9.&para;<br>Second, the Government suggests that our reading leads&para;<br>to an absurd result. As it points out, the Fourth Statement&para;<br>grants the Attorney General the “authority to specify”&para;<br>the registration requirements’ applicability not only to&para;<br>pre-Act offenders but also to those convicted prior to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“implementation” of the new Act “in a particular jurisdiction.” Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act&para;<br>for up to five years. See 42 U. S. C. §16924; see also Dept. of&para;<br>Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department&para;<br>Finds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented&para;<br>SORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as&para;<br>of July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the&para;<br>Act’s requirements), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/&para;<br>pressreleases/2011/SMART_PR-072811.htm (all Internet&para;<br>materials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk&para;<br>of Court’s case file). Yet, the Government concludes, it is&para;<br>absurd to believe that Congress would have desired so&para;<br>long a delay in the application of its new registration&para;<br>requirements.&para;<br>The problem with this argument, however, is that reading the two categories similarly (a matter which we need&para;<br>not decide) would not require a long delay in applying the&para;<br>registration requirements to post-Act offenders who committed a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement&para;<br>the new requirements. At most, that reading would require the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applicable to all preimplementation offenders. That rule could&para;<br>specify that the Act’s preregistration provisions apply to&para;<br>some or to all those offenders. And it could do so quickly,&para;<br>well before a jurisdiction implements the Act’s requirements. Indeed, the Attorney General’s Interim Rule and&para;<br>the Department of Justice’s final guidelines, both issued&para;<br>before any jurisdiction implemented the Act’s requirements, state that the Act’s requirements apply to “all sex&para;<br>offenders,” including all preimplementation offenders. See&para;<br>72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR §72.3); 73 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>38036; cf. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,&para;<br>Justice Department Announces First Two Jurisdictions&para;<br>to Implement Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Sept. 23, 2009), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/&para;<br>pressreleases/2009/SMART09154.htm.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Third, the Government argues against our interpretation on the ground that the Act says only that the Attorney General “shall have the authority to specify the&para;<br>applicability” of the Act’s registration requirements to preAct offenders; it does not say that he “shall specify” or&para;<br>otherwise require him to do so. The Act’s language, the&para;<br>Government continues, consequently gives the Attorney&para;<br>General the power not to specify anything; that power is&para;<br>inconsistent with Congress’ intent to ensure the speedy&para;<br>registration of thousands of “lost” pre-Act offenders, supra,&para;<br>at 10; and we can avoid this result only by reading the&para;<br>Act’s registration requirements as applying immediately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though&para;<br>the Attorney General would have the power to make&para;<br>exceptions).&para;<br>This argument bases too much upon too little. There is&para;<br>no reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attorney General would refuse to apply the new requirements&para;<br>to pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., at 23–24; Protecting Our Nation’s Children from Sexual Predators and&para;<br>Violent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing&para;<br>before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary,&para;<br>109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4–13 (2005); Office of the Press&para;<br>Sec’y, The White House, President Signs H. R. 4472,&para;<br>the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006&para;<br>(July 27, 2006), http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/&para;<br>news/releases/2006/07/20060727-6.html. And there was no&para;<br>need for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic&para;<br>possibility. There is consequently no need to read the&para;<br>language unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the&para;<br>authority only to make exceptions from an implicit (unstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registration requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board&para;<br>and immediately.&para;<br>Finally, we note that some lower courts have read the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Attorney General’s specification authority as applying&para;<br>only to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with&para;<br>the statute’s “initial registration” requirements. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §16913(b). That, however, is not what the statute&para;<br>says. Rather, its Fourth Statement, §16913(d), says that&para;<br>the Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the&para;<br>applicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act&para;<br>(and preimplementation) offenders, “and ” (2) to prescribe&para;<br>rules for their registration, “and ” (3) to prescribe registration rules for other categories of sex offenders who are&para;<br>unable to comply with the initial registration requirements. See supra, at 3. The word “and” means that the&para;<br>Attorney General’s authority extends beyond those pre-Act&para;<br>“sex offenders who are unable to comply” with the initial&para;<br>registration requirements.&para;<br>III&para;<br>For these reasons, we conclude that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until&para;<br>the Attorney General so specifies. Whether the Attorney&para;<br>General’s Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification&para;<br>consequently matters in the case before us. And we reverse the Third Circuit’s judgment to the contrary. We&para;<br>remand the case for further proceedings consistent with&para;<br>this opinion.&para;<br>So ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v.

UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 23, 2012]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,&para;<br>dissenting.&para;<br>In my view, the registration requirements of the Sex&para;<br>Offender Registration and Notification Act (Act), 120 Stat.&para;<br>590, 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. III),&para;<br>apply of their own force, without action by the Attorney&para;<br>General. The Act’s statement that “[t]he Attorney General&para;<br>shall have the authority to specify the applicability of&para;<br>the [registration] requirements” to pre-Act sex offenders,&para;<br>§16913(d), is best understood as conferring on the Attorney General an authority to make exceptions to the otherwise applicable registration requirements.&para;<br>To begin with, I do not share the Court’s belief that&para;<br>to “specify the applicability” more naturally means, in the&para;<br>present context, to “make applicable” rather than to “make&para;<br>inapplicable.” See ante, at 7. The example the Court&para;<br>gives, the Commissioner of Baseball’s “ ‘authority to specify the applicability’ ” of more stringent minor-league drug&para;<br>testing policies to the major leagues, ibid., is entirely&para;<br>inapt, because it deals with a policy that on its face is&para;<br>otherwise not applicable. Since the major leagues are not&para;<br>covered by the policies, the Commissioner’s “ ‘authority to&para;<br>specify [their] applicability’ ” can mean nothing else but the&para;<br>authority to render them applicable. What we have here,&para;<br>however, is a statute that states in unqualified terms that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“a sex offender shall register,” §16913(a)—and that the&para;<br>Court rightly believes was meant to cover pre-Act offenders.* The issue is whether “specify the applicability”&para;<br>means that no pre-Act offenders need register unless the&para;<br>Attorney General says so, or rather that the Attorney&para;<br>General may excuse the unqualified requirement for preAct offenders. In that context, it seems to me that the&para;<br>latter meaning is more natural. One specifies the applicability of an application that already exists by describing or&para;<br>revising its contours.&para;<br>I think it preferable to give “specify” this meaning not&para;<br>only because here it is more natural, but also because&para;<br>the alternative is to read the statute as leaving it up to the&para;<br>Attorney General whether the registration requirement&para;<br>would ever apply to pre-Act offenders, even though registration of pre-Act offenders was (as the Court acknowledges) what the statute sought to achieve. For the statute&para;<br>does not instruct the Attorney General to specify; it merely&para;<br>gives him “authority” to do so. In this respect, the provision at issue here stands in marked contrast to other&para;<br>provisions of the Act which clearly impose duties on the&para;<br>Attorney General. See, e.g., §16912(b) (“The Attorney&para;<br>General shall issue guidelines and regulations to interpret&para;<br>and implement this subchapter”); §16917(b) (“The Attorney General shall prescribe rules for the notification of&para;<br>[certain] sex offenders”); §16919(a) (“The Attorney General&para;<br>shall maintain a national database”); §16926(a) (“The&para;<br>Attorney General shall establish and implement a Sex&para;<br>Offender Management Assistance program”).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The Court reaches this conclusion based on an inquiry into legislative history. See ante, at 9–10. That inquiry is quite superf luous,&para;<br>however since the text of the Act itself makes clear that Congress&para;<br>sought to “establis[h] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex offenders],” 42 U. S. C. §16901, with “sex offender” defined&para;<br>broadly to “mea[n] an individual who was convicted of a sex offense,”&para;<br>§16911(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court’s response to this—that “there was no need&para;<br>for a mandatory requirement to avoid [the] unrealistic&para;<br>possibility” that the Attorney General would not specify,&para;<br>ante, at 12—seems to me a fine answer to the question&para;<br>“What mandatory requirements must a poorly drafted&para;<br>statute contain in order to be workable?” It is an inadequate answer, however, to the question that is relevant&para;<br>here: “Would Congress have written the provision this way&para;<br>if it wanted pre-Act offenders covered and did not think&para;<br>they were covered absent specification by the Attorney General?” Intelligently drafted statutes make mandatory&para;<br>those executive acts essential to their functioning, whether&para;<br>or not those acts would likely occur anyway. It would have&para;<br>taken little effort (in fact, less effort) for Congress to write&para;<br>“the Attorney General shall specify the applicability”&para;<br>instead of “the Attorney General shall have authority to&para;<br>specify the applicability.” The latter formulation confers&para;<br>discretion, and it is simply implausible that the Attorney&para;<br>General was given discretion to determine whether coverage of pre-Act offenders (one of the purposes of the Act)&para;<br>should exist.&para;<br>Indeed, it is not entirely clear to me that Congress&para;<br>can constitutionally leave it to the Attorney General to&para;<br>decide—with no statutory standard whatever governing his&para;<br>discretion—whether a criminal statute will or will not&para;<br>apply to certain individuals. That seems to me sailing&para;<br>close to the wind with regard to the principle that legislative powers are nondelegable, see Whitman v. American&para;<br>Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472–476 (2001);&para;<br>Loving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 776–777 (1996)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and “[i]t is our settled policy to avoid an interpretation of a federal statute that engenders constitutional&para;<br>issues if a reasonable alternative interpretation poses&para;<br>no constitutional question.” Gomez v. United States, 490&para;<br>U. S. 858, 864 (1989). Construing the Act to give the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Attorney General the power to reduce congressionally&para;<br>imposed requirements fits that bill, because such a power&para;<br>is little more than a formalized version of the timehonored practice of prosecutorial discretion.&para;<br>The Court points out that there might have been need&para;<br>for “different federal registration treatment of different&para;<br>categories of pre-Act offenders,” ante, at 8, and that absent&para;<br>a “ruling from the Attorney General” pre-Act offenders&para;<br>would be uncertain “about whether, or how, the new registration requirements applied to them,” ante, at 9. But&para;<br>attending to those details would certainly come within the&para;<br>Attorney General’s authority to “specify” application of the&para;<br>Act—and so would the temporary suspension of registration requirements pending the Attorney General’s resolution of those details. And of course the uncertainty of&para;<br>where to register could form the basis for the Attorney&para;<br>General’s exercise of his discretion not to prosecute in&para;<br>individual cases. Neither problem, it seems to me, justifies the extraordinary interpretation that this Act does not&para;<br>apply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney&para;<br>General, in his discretion, says so.&para;<br>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
