Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to&para;<br>disclose a crime lab report. Because of his robbery conviction,&para;<br>Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was&para;<br>convicted. A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report&para;<br>was discovered. A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and&para;<br>Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge. He&para;<br>then filed suit against the district attorney’s office under 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the&para;<br>office’s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors&para;<br>to avoid such constitutional violations. The district court held that,&para;<br>to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a&para;<br>pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that&para;<br>the need for training was obvious. The jury found the district attor&para;<br>ney’s office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson dam&para;<br>ages. The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.&para;<br>Held: A district attorney’s office may not be held liable under §1983 for&para;<br>failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation. Pp.&para;<br>6–20.&para;<br>(a) Plaintiffs seeking to impose §1983 liability on local governments&para;<br>must prove that their injury was caused by “action pursuant to offi&para;<br>cial municipal policy,” which includes the decisions of a government’s&para;<br>lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so&para;<br>persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.&para;<br>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691. A&para;<br>local government’s decision not to train certain employees about their&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>legal duty to avoid violating citizens’ rights may rise to the level of an&para;<br>official government policy for §1983 purposes, but the failure to train&para;<br>must amount to “deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with&para;<br>whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.” Canton v. Har&para;<br>ris, 489 U. S. 378, 388. Deliberate indifference in this context re&para;<br>quires proof that city policymakers disregarded the “known or obvi&para;<br>ous consequence” that a particular omission in their training&para;<br>program would cause city employees to violate citizens’ constitutional&para;<br>rights. Board of Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.&para;<br>Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained em&para;<br>ployees is “ordinarily necessary” to demonstrate deliberate indiffer&para;<br>ence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. Without notice that a course of&para;<br>training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have delib&para;<br>erately chosen a training program that will cause violations of consti&para;<br>tutional rights. Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern&para;<br>of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for&para;<br>dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial&para;<br>could not have put the district attorney’s office on notice of the need&para;<br>for specific training. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(c) Thompson mistakenly relies on the “single-incident” liability&para;<br>hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his&para;<br>case was the “obvious” consequence of failing to provide specific&para;<br>Brady training and that this “obviousness” showing can substitute&para;<br>for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish munici&para;<br>pal culpability. In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed&para;<br>its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing&para;<br>felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on&para;<br>the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city’s de&para;<br>liberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely,&para;<br>violations of constitutional rights. Failure to train prosecutors in&para;<br>their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Can&para;<br>ton’s hypothesized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe&para;<br>cific legal training present in Canton’s scenario—police academy ap&para;<br>plicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on&para;<br>deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge—is&para;<br>absent here. Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the&para;<br>tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitu&para;<br>tional limits, and exercise legal judgment. They receive training be&para;<br>fore entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing educa&para;<br>tion requirements, often train on the job with more experienced&para;<br>attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical&para;<br>obligations. Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically&para;<br>bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations&para;<br>are not the “obvious consequence” of failing to provide prosecutors&para;<br>with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary&para;<br>training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.&para;<br>Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.&para;<br>Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with&para;<br>constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but&para;<br>must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady&para;<br>evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.&para;<br>That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate&para;<br>indifference here. Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow&para;<br>that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are dif&para;<br>ficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing&para;<br>to train them amounts, as it must, to “a decision by the city itself to&para;<br>violate the Constitution.” Canton, 489 U.

Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). Thompson&para;<br>was convicted. Because of that conviction Thompson&para;<br>elected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial&para;<br>for murder, and he was again convicted. Thompson spent&para;<br>18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row. One&para;<br>month before Thompson’s scheduled execution, his inves&para;<br>tigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his&para;<br>armed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined that&para;<br>the evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson’s&para;<br>convictions were vacated.&para;<br>After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner&para;<br>Harry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans&para;<br>Parish District Attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat.&para;<br>§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Thompson alleged that Connick&para;<br>had failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their&para;<br>duty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>training had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson’s rob&para;<br>bery case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million,&para;<br>and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by&para;<br>an evenly divided en banc court. We granted certiorari to&para;<br>decide whether a district attorney’s office may be held&para;<br>liable under §1983 for failure to train based on a single&para;<br>Brady violation. We hold that it cannot.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the&para;<br>murder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans. Pub&para;<br>licity following the murder charge led the victims of an&para;<br>unrelated armed robbery to identify Thompson as their&para;<br>attacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with&para;<br>attempted armed robbery.&para;<br>As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene&para;<br>technician took from one of the victims’ pants a swatch of&para;<br>fabric stained with the robber’s blood. Approximately one&para;<br>week before Thompson’s armed robbery trial, the swatch&para;<br>was sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the&para;<br>trial, assistant district attorney Bruce Whittaker received&para;<br>the crime lab’s report, which stated that the perpetrator&para;<br>had blood type B. There is no evidence that the prosecu&para;<br>tors ever had Thompson’s blood tested or that they knew&para;<br>what his blood type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the&para;<br>report on assistant district attorney James Williams’ desk,&para;<br>but Williams denied seeing it. The report was never dis&para;<br>closed to Thompson’s counsel.&para;<br>Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant&para;<br>district attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial,&para;<br>Deegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out&para;<br>of the police property room, including the blood-stained&para;<br>swatch. Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the&para;<br>swatch into the courthouse property room.

Because&para;<br>of the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to&para;<br>testify in his own defense. He was convicted and sen&para;<br>tenced to death. State v. Thompson, 516 So. 2d 349 (La.&para;<br>1987). In the 14 years following Thompson’s murder&para;<br>conviction, state and federal courts reviewed and denied&para;<br>his challenges to the conviction and sentence. See State ex&para;<br>rel. Thompson v. Cain, 95–2463 (La. 4/25/96), 672 So. 2d&para;<br>906; Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802 (CA5 1998). The&para;<br>State scheduled Thompson’s execution for May 20, 1999.&para;<br>In late April 1999, Thompson’s private investigator&para;<br>discovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery&para;<br>investigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime&para;<br>Laboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have&para;<br>blood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not&para;<br>his. Thompson’s attorneys presented this evidence to the&para;<br>district attorney’s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the&para;<br>execution and vacate Thompson’s armed robbery convic&para;<br>tion.1 The Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed&para;<br>Thompson’s murder conviction, concluding that the armed&para;<br>robbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson&para;<br>of his right to testify in his own defense at the murder&para;<br>trial. State v. Thompson, 2002–0361 (La. App. 7/17/02),&para;<br>825 So. 2d 552. In 2003, the district attorney’s office&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 After Thompson discovered the crime lab report, former assistant&para;<br>district attorney Michael Riehlmann revealed that Deegan had con&para;<br>fessed to him in 1994 that he had “intentionally suppressed blood&para;<br>evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson that in some&para;<br>way exculpated the defendant.” Record EX583; see also id., at 2677.&para;<br>Deegan apparently had been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer&para;<br>when he made his confession.

THOMPSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>retried Thompson for Liuzza’s murder.2 The jury found&para;<br>him not guilty.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Thompson then brought this action against the district&para;<br>attorney’s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging&para;<br>that their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,&para;<br>incarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only&para;<br>claim that proceeded to trial was Thompson’s claim under&para;<br>§1983 that the district attorney’s office had violated Brady&para;<br>by failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed&para;<br>robbery trial. See Brady, 373 U. S. 83. Thompson alleged&para;<br>liability under two theories: (1) the Brady violation was&para;<br>caused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attor&para;<br>ney’s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick’s&para;<br>deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the&para;<br>prosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitu&para;<br>tional violations.&para;<br>Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to pro&para;<br>duce the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.3&para;<br>See Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court&para;<br>instructed the jury that the “only issue” was whether the&para;<br>nondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or&para;<br>custom of the district attorney’s office or a deliberately&para;<br>indifferent failure to train the office’s prosecutors. Record&para;<br>1615.&para;<br>Although no prosecutor remembered any specific train&para;<br>ing session regarding Brady prior to 1985, it was undis&para;<br>puted at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Thompson testified in his own defense at the second trial and pre&para;<br>sented evidence suggesting that another man committed the murder.&para;<br>That man, the government’s key witness at the first murder trial, had&para;<br>died in the interval between the first and second trials.&para;<br>3 Because Connick conceded that the failure to disclose the crime lab&para;<br>report violated Brady, that question is not presented here, and we do&para;<br>not address it.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>general Brady requirement that the State disclose to the&para;<br>defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to&para;<br>the accused. Prosecutors testified that office policy was to&para;<br>turn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over&para;<br>to the defense. They also testified that, after the discovery&para;<br>of the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors&para;<br>disagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under&para;<br>Brady absent knowledge of Thompson’s blood type.&para;<br>The jury rejected Thompson’s claim that an unconstitu&para;<br>tional office policy caused the Brady violation, but found&para;<br>the district attorney’s office liable for failing to train the&para;<br>prosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in&para;<br>damages, and the District Court added more than $1&para;<br>million in attorney’s fees and costs.&para;<br>After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection—which&para;<br>he had raised on summary judgment—that he could not&para;<br>have been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for&para;<br>more or different Brady training because there was no&para;<br>evidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar Brady&para;<br>violations. The District Court rejected this argument for&para;<br>the reasons that it had given in the summary judgment&para;<br>order. In that order, the court had concluded that a pat&para;<br>tern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate&para;<br>indifference when the need for training is “so obvious.”&para;<br>No. Civ. A. 03–2045 (ED La., Nov. 15, 2005), App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13. Relying on Canton&para;<br>v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989), the court had held that&para;<br>Thompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by&para;<br>proving that “the DA’s office knew to a moral certainty&para;<br>that assistan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire Brady&para;<br>material, that without training it is not always obvious&para;<br>what Brady requires, and that withholding Brady mate&para;<br>rial will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of&para;<br>constitutional rights.”4 App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>District Court rejected Connick’s proposed deliberate indiffer&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>WL 3541035, *13.&para;<br>A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not&para;<br>present evidence of a pattern of similar Brady violations,&para;<br>553 F. 3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not&para;<br>need to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the&para;<br>panel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on&para;<br>notice of an obvious need for Brady training by presenting&para;<br>evidence “that attorneys, often fresh out of law school,&para;<br>would undoubtedly be required to confront Brady issues&para;<br>while at the DA’s Office, that erroneous decisions regard&para;<br>ing Brady evidence would result in serious constitutional&para;<br>violations, that resolution of Brady issues was often un&para;<br>clear, and that training in Brady would have been help&para;<br>ful.” 553 F. 3d, at 854.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel&para;<br>opinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby&para;<br>affirming the District Court. 578 F. 3d 293 (CA5 2009)&para;<br>(per curiam). In four opinions, the divided en banc court&para;<br>disputed whether Thompson could establish municipal&para;<br>liability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the&para;<br>single Brady violation without proving a prior pattern of&para;<br>similar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make&para;<br>that showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when&para;<br>one or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thomp&para;<br>son’s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the&para;<br>crime lab report to Thompson’s counsel. Under Thomp&para;<br>son’s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving&para;<br>both (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district&para;<br>attorney’s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ence jury instruction—which would have required Thompson to prove a&para;<br>pattern of similar violations—for the same reasons as the summary&para;<br>judgment motion.

Connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as&para;<br>a matter of law because Thompson did not prove that he&para;<br>was on actual or constructive notice of, and therefore&para;<br>deliberately indifferent to, a need for more or different&para;<br>Brady training.

Thus, we do not address whether&para;<br>the alleged training deficiency, or some other cause, was the “ ‘moving&para;<br>force,’ ” Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 389 (1989) (quoting Monell v.&para;<br>New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978), and&para;<br>Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.

Affirming the&para;<br>verdict in favor of Thompson would require finding both that he proved&para;<br>deliberate indifference and that he proved causation. Perhaps unsur&para;<br>prisingly, the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis,&para;<br>which would require showing that the failure to provide particular&para;<br>training (which the dissent never clearly identifies) “actually caused”&para;<br>the flagrant—and quite possibly intentional—misconduct that occurred&para;<br>in this case. See post, at 21 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (assuming that,&para;<br>“[h]ad Brady’s importance been brought home to prosecutors,” the&para;<br>violation at issue “surely” would not have occurred).

Of course, if&para;<br>evidence of a need for training, by itself, were sufficient to prove that&para;<br>the lack of training “actually caused” the violation at issue, no causa&para;<br>tion requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who&para;<br>satisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily&para;<br>satisfy the causation requirement.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v.

Thus, when city policymakers are on&para;<br>actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in&para;<br>their training program causes city employees to violate&para;<br>citizens’ constitutional rights, the city may be deemed&para;<br>deliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to&para;<br>retain that program. Id., at 407. The city’s “policy of&para;<br>inaction” in light of notice that its program will cause&para;<br>constitutional violations “is the functional equivalent of a&para;<br>decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”&para;<br>Canton, 489 U.

Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The Court posed the&para;<br>hypothetical example of a city that arms its police force&para;<br>with firearms and deploys the armed officers into the&para;<br>public to capture fleeing felons without training the offi&para;<br>cers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly&para;<br>force. Canton, supra, at 390, n. 10. Given the known&para;<br>frequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing&para;<br>felons and the “predictability that an officer lacking spe&para;<br>cific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens’&para;<br>rights,” the Court theorized that a city’s decision not to&para;<br>train the officers about constitutional limits on the use of&para;<br>deadly force could reflect the city’s deliberate indifference&para;<br>to the “highly predictable consequence,” namely, violations&para;<br>of constitutional rights. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The&para;<br>Court sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare,&para;<br>that the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train&para;<br>could be so patently obvious that a city could be liable&para;<br>under §1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of&para;<br>violations.&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

The obvious need for spe&para;<br>cific legal training that was present in the Canton scenario&para;<br>is absent here. Armed police must sometimes make split&para;<br>second decisions with life-or-death consequences. There is&para;<br>no reason to assume that police academy applicants are&para;<br>familiar with the constitutional constraints on the use of&para;<br>deadly force. And, in the absence of training, there is no&para;<br>way for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they&para;<br>require. Under those circumstances there is an obvious&para;<br>need for some form of training. In stark contrast, legal&para;<br>“[t]raining is what differentiates attorneys from average&para;<br>public employees.” 578 F. 3d, at 304–305 (opinion of&para;<br>Clement, J.).&para;<br>Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the&para;<br>tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand&para;<br>constitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before&para;<br>they may enter the profession and receive a law license,&para;<br>all attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a&para;<br>substantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of&para;<br>jurisdictions must do both. See, e.g., La. State Bar Assn.&para;<br>(LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §37,&para;<br>ch. 4, App., Art. 14, §7 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended&para;<br>through 1985). These threshold requirements are de&para;<br>signed to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how&para;<br>to find, understand, and apply legal rules. Cf. United&para;<br>States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984) (noting&para;<br>that the presumption “that the lawyer is competent to&para;<br>provide the guiding hand that the defendant needs” ap&para;<br>plies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their&para;<br>first jury trial and even when the case is complex).&para;<br>Nor does professional training end at graduation. Most&para;<br>jurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing&para;<br>education requirements. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of In&para;<br>corporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La.

Even those few jurisdic&para;<br>tions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education&para;<br>requirements mandate that attorneys represent their&para;<br>clients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in&para;<br>continuing study and education. See, e.g., Mass. Rule&para;<br>Prof. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before&para;<br>Louisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it&para;<br>imposed similar general competency requirements on its&para;<br>state bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1–&para;<br>1, 1–2, DR 6–101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).&para;<br>Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in&para;<br>district attorney’s offices, also train on the job as they&para;<br>learn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here&para;<br>in the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, junior&para;<br>prosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who super&para;<br>vised them as they worked together to prepare cases for&para;<br>trial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.&para;<br>Senior attorneys also circulated court decisions and in&para;<br>structional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of&para;<br>relevant legal developments.&para;<br>In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy&para;<br>character and fitness standards to receive a law license&para;<br>and are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to&para;<br>reinforce the profession’s standards. See, e.g., LSBA,&para;<br>Articles of Incorporation, Art. 14, §7 (1985); see generally&para;<br>id., Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).&para;<br>Trial lawyers have a “duty to bring to bear such skill and&para;<br>knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial&para;<br>testing process.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668,&para;<br>688 (1984).

Among prosecutors’ unique&para;<br>ethical obligations is the duty to produce Brady evidence&para;<br>to the defense.

Code Crim. Proc.&para;<br>Ann., Art. 718 (West 1981) (added 1977), as well as “any results or&para;<br>reports” of “scientific tests or experiments, made in connection with&para;<br>or material to the particular case” if those reports are exculpatory or&para;<br>intended for use at trial, id., Art. 719.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

A licensed attorney making legal judg&para;<br>ments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about Brady mate&para;<br>rial simply does not present the same “highly predictable”&para;<br>constitutional danger as Canton’s untrained officer.&para;<br>A second significant difference between this case and&para;<br>the example in Canton is the nuance of the allegedly&para;<br>necessary training. The Canton hypothetical assumes&para;<br>that the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of&para;<br>the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force. But it&para;<br>is undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick’s office&para;<br>were familiar with the general Brady rule. Thompson’s&para;<br>complaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an&para;<br>ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies&para;<br>the Canton hypothetical, but rather must assert that&para;<br>prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evi&para;<br>dence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his&para;<br>case. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an infer&para;<br>ence of deliberate indifference here. As the Court said in&para;<br>Canton, “[i]n virtually every instance where a person has&para;<br>had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city&para;<br>employee, a §1983 plaintiff will be able to point to some&para;<br>thing the city ‘could have done’ to prevent the unfortunate&para;<br>incident.” 489 U.

But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the&para;<br>substance of the training, not the particular instructional&para;<br>format. The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts&para;<br>carte blanche to micromanage local governments through&para;<br>out the United States.&para;<br>We do not assume that prosecutors will always make&para;<br>correct Brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific&para;<br>Brady questions would not assist prosecutors. But show&para;<br>ing merely that additional training would have been&para;<br>helpful in making difficult decisions does not establish&para;<br>municipal liability. “[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident&para;<br>could have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or&para;<br>more training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particu&para;<br>lar injury-causing conduct” will not suffice. Canton, su&para;<br>pra, at 391. The possibility of single-incident liability that&para;<br>the Court left open in Canton is not this case.10&para;<br>2&para;<br>The dissent rejects our holding that Canton’s hypothe&para;<br>sized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter,&para;<br>encompass failure to train prosecutors in their Brady&para;<br>obligation. It would instead apply the Canton hypotheti&para;<br>cal to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion&para;<br>to explaining why the evidence supports liability under&para;<br>that theory.11 But the dissent’s attempt to address our&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Thompson also argues that he proved deliberate indifference by&para;<br>“direct evidence of policymaker fault” and so, presumably, did not need&para;<br>to rely on circumstantial evidence at all. Brief for Respondent 37. In&para;<br>support, Thompson contends that Connick created a “culture of indif&para;<br>ference” in the district attorney’s office, id., at 38, as evidenced by&para;<br>Connick’s own allegedly inadequate understanding of Brady, the office’s&para;<br>unwritten Brady policy that was later incorporated into a 1987 hand&para;<br>book, and an officewide “restrictive discovery policy,” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 39–40. This argument is essentially an assertion that Connick’s&para;<br>office had an unconstitutional policy or custom. The jury rejected this&para;<br>claim, and Thompson does not challenge that finding.&para;<br>11 The dissent spends considerable time finding new Brady violations&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

I write separately only&para;<br>to address several aspects of the dissent.&para;<br>1. The dissent’s lengthy excavation of the trial record is&para;<br>a puzzling exertion. The question presented for our re&para;<br>view is whether a municipality is liable for a single Brady&para;<br>violation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern&para;<br>or practice of prior violations put the municipality on&para;<br>notice of a need for specific training that would have pre&para;<br>vented it. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).&para;<br>That question is a legal one: whether a Brady violation&para;<br>presents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized&para;<br>in Canton’s footnote 10, in which the need for training in&para;<br>constitutional requirements is so obvious ex ante that the&para;<br>municipality’s failure to provide that training amounts&para;<br>to deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. See&para;<br>Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390, n. 10 (1989).&para;<br>The dissent defers consideration of this question until&para;<br>page 23 of its opinion. It first devotes considerable space&para;<br>to allegations that Connick’s prosecutors misunderstood&para;<br>Brady when asked about it at trial, see post, at 16–18&para;<br>(opinion of GINSBURG, J.), and to supposed gaps in the&para;<br>Brady guidance provided by Connick’s office to prosecu&para;<br>tors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific Brady&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>violation at issue in this case) in a policy manual pub&para;<br>lished by Connick’s office three years after Thompson’s&para;<br>trial, see post, at 18–21. None of that is relevant. Thomp&para;<br>son’s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a&para;<br>pervasive culture of indifference to Brady, but rather on&para;<br>the inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of&para;<br>criminal trials. The District Court instructed the jury it&para;<br>could find Connick deliberately indifferent if:&para;<br>“First: The District Attorney was certain that prosecu&para;<br>tors would confront the situation where they would&para;<br>have to decide which evidence was required by the&para;<br>constitution to be provided to an accused[;]&para;<br>“Second: The situation involved a difficult choice, or&para;<br>one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,&para;<br>such that additional training, supervision, or monitor&para;<br>ing was clearly needed[; and]&para;<br>“Third: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that&para;<br>situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an ac&para;<br>cused’s constitutional rights.” App. 828.&para;<br>That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the&para;<br>law of Monell1 in favor of the Law of Large Numbers.&para;<br>Brady mistakes are inevitable. So are all species of error&para;<br>routinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad&para;<br>warrant; losing a Batson2 claim; crossing the line in clos&para;<br>ing argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Con&para;<br>frontation Clause. Nevertheless, we do not have “de facto&para;<br>respondeat superior liability,” Canton, 489 U. S., at 392,&para;<br>for each such violation under the rubric of failure-to-train&para;<br>simply because the municipality does not have a profes&para;<br>sional educational program covering the specific violation&para;<br>in sufficient depth.3 Were Thompson’s theory the law,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Monell&para;<br>&para;<br>v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978).&para;<br>v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).&para;<br>3 I do not share the dissent’s confidence that this result will be&para;<br>avoided by the instruction’s requirement that “ ‘more likely than not the&para;<br>2 Batson&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>there would have been no need for Canton’s footnote to&para;<br>confine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of&para;<br>arming police officers with guns without telling them&para;<br>about the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing&para;<br>felons; the District Court’s instructions cover every recur&para;<br>ring situation in which citizens’ rights can be violated.&para;<br>That result cannot be squared with our admonition that&para;<br>failure-to-train liability is available only in “limited cir&para;<br>cumstances,” id., at 387, and that a pattern of consti&para;<br>tutional violations is “ordinarily necessary to establish&para;<br>municipal culpability and causation,” Board of Comm’rs of&para;<br>Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 409 (1997). These&para;<br>restrictions are indispensable because without them,&para;<br>“failure to train” would become a talismanic incantation&para;<br>producing municipal liability “[i]n virtually every instance&para;<br>where a person has had his or her constitutional rights&para;<br>violated by a city employee”—which is what Monell re&para;<br>jects. Canton, 489 U. S., at 392. Worse, it would “engage&para;<br>the federal courts in an endless exercise of second&para;<br>guessing municipal employee-training programs,” thereby&para;<br>diminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>2. Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seri&para;<br>ously contend that Thompson’s theory of recovery was&para;<br>proper. Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that&para;<br>theory at trial. See post, at 25. The accusation is false.&para;<br>Connick’s central claim was and is that failure-to-train&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>Brady material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in &para;<br>&para;<br>his underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or &para;<br>&para;<br>monitored regarding the production of Brady evidence.’ ” Post, at 25, &para;<br>&para;<br>n. 17 (quoting Tr. 1100). How comforting that assurance is depends&para;<br>entirely on what proper training consists of. If it is not limited to&para;<br>training in aspects of Brady that have been repeatedly violated, but&para;<br>includes—as the dissent would have it include here—training that&para;<br>would avoid any one-time violation, the assurance is no assurance at&para;<br>all.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>liability for a Brady violation cannot be premised on a&para;<br>single incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previ&para;<br>ous violations. He pressed that argument at the summary&para;<br>judgment stage but was rebuffed. At trial, when Connick&para;<br>offered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge&para;<br>effectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:&para;<br>“[Connick’s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition&para;<br>in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to&para;<br>include language that says that deliberate indiffer&para;<br>ence to training requires a pattern of similar viola&para;<br>tions and proof of deliberate indifference requires&para;<br>more than a single isolated act.&para;<br>“[Thompson’s counsel]: That’s not the law, Your&para;<br>Honor.&para;<br>“THE COURT: No, I’m not giving that. That was in&para;<br>your motion for summary judgment that I denied.”&para;<br>Tr. 1013.&para;<br>Nothing more is required to preserve a claim of error. See&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).4&para;<br>3. But in any event, to recover from a municipality&para;<br>under 42 U. S. C. §1983, a plaintiff must satisfy a “rigor&para;<br>ous” standard of causation, Bryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 405;&para;<br>he must “demonstrate a direct causal link between the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The dissent’s contention that “[t]he instruction Connick proposed&para;<br>resembled the charge given by the District Court,” post, at 25, n. 18,&para;<br>disregards his requested instruction concerning the necessity of a&para;<br>pattern of prior violations. It is meaningless to say that after “the court&para;<br>rejected [Connick’s] categorical position,” as it did, he did not “assail the&para;<br>District Court’s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,”&para;<br>post, at 26, n. 18. The prior-pattern requirement was part of Connick’s&para;<br>requested formulation of deliberate indifference: “To prove deliberate&para;<br>indifference, a plaintiff must demonstrate ‘at least a pattern of similar&para;<br>violations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be&para;<br>obviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.’ ” Record, Doc.&para;<br>94, p. 18 (emphasis added).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.”&para;<br>Id., at 404. Thompson cannot meet that standard. The&para;<br>withholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly&para;<br>caused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific train&para;<br>ing, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan’s willful&para;<br>suppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in&para;<br>an effort to railroad Thompson. According to Deegan’s&para;<br>colleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to&para;<br>him—in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed&para;<br>he had only a few months to live—that he had “suppressed&para;<br>blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thomp&para;<br>son that in some way exculpated the defendant.” App.&para;<br>367; see also id., at 362 (“[Deegan] told me . . . that he had&para;<br>failed to inform the defense of exculpatory information”). I&para;<br>have no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly&para;<br>since Riehlmann’s testimony hardly paints a flattering&para;<br>picture of himself: Riehlmann kept silent about Deegan’s&para;<br>misconduct for another five years, as a result of which he&para;<br>incurred professional sanctions. See In re Riehlmann,&para;<br>2004–0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.&para;<br>And if&para;<br>Riehlmann’s story is true, then the “moving force,” Bryan&para;<br>Cty., supra, at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted),&para;<br>behind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a&para;<br>failure of continuing legal education.&para;<br>4. The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting&para;<br>that with proper Brady training, “surely at least one” of&para;<br>the prosecutors in Thompson’s trial would have turned&para;<br>over the lab report and blood swatch. Post, at 21. But&para;<br>training must consist of more than mere broad encomiums&para;<br>of Brady: We have made clear that “the identified defi&para;<br>ciency in a city’s training program [must be] closely re&para;<br>lated to the ultimate injury.” Canton, supra, at 391. So&para;<br>even indulging the dissent’s assumption that Thompson’s&para;<br>prosecutors failed to disclose the lab report in good faith—&para;<br>in a way that could be prevented by training—what sort of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>training would have prevented the good-faith nondisclo&para;<br>sure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?&para;<br>Perhaps a better question to ask is what legally accurate&para;<br>training would have prevented it. The dissent’s sugges&para;<br>tion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of&para;<br>Brady limiting prosecutors’ disclosure obligations to evi&para;<br>dence that is “favorable to an accused,” 373 U. S., at 87.&para;<br>Instead, the dissent proposes that “Connick could have&para;<br>communicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncer&para;<br>tain terms, that, ‘[i]f you have physical evidence that, if&para;<br>tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is&para;<br>charged, you have to turn it over.’ ” Post, at 20, n. 13&para;<br>(quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34). Though labeled a training&para;<br>suggestion, the dissent’s proposal is better described as a&para;<br>sub silentio expansion of the substantive law of Brady. If&para;<br>any of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have&para;<br>never read it, and the dissent does not cite it.5&para;<br>Since Thompson’s trial, however, we have decided a case&para;<br>that appears to say just the opposite of the training the&para;<br>dissent would require: In Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S.&para;<br>51, 58 (1988), we held that “unless a criminal defendant&para;<br>can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to&para;<br>preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a&para;<br>denial of due process of law.” We acknowledged that&para;<br>“Brady . . . makes the good or bad faith of the State irrele&para;<br>vant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant&para;<br>material exculpatory evidence,” but concluded that “the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 What the dissent does cite in support of its theory comes from an&para;<br>unexpected source: Connick’s testimony about what qualifies as Brady&para;<br>material. See post, at 20–21, n. 13. (“Or Connick could have told&para;<br>prosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prose&para;<br>cutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense, even if the pros&para;<br>ecutor does not know the defendant’s blood type: ‘Under the law, it&para;<br>qualifies as Brady material.’ ” (quoting Tr. 872)). Given the effort the&para;<br>dissent has expended persuading us that Connick’s understanding of&para;<br>Brady is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on&para;<br>the subject is, to the say the least, surprising.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>Due Process Clause requires a different result when we&para;<br>deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary&para;<br>material of which no more can be said than that it could&para;<br>have been subjected to tests, the results of which might&para;<br>have exonerated the defendant.” Id., at 57. Perhaps one&para;<br>day we will recognize a distinction between good-faith&para;<br>failures to preserve from destruction evidence whose&para;<br>inculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown, and&para;<br>good-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the de&para;<br>fense. But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to&para;<br>observe that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indif&para;<br>ference.&para;<br>5. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best&para;<br>kept secret of this case: There was probably no Brady&para;<br>violation at all—except for Deegan’s (which, since it was a&para;<br>bad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attrib&para;<br>uted to lack of training).6 The dissent surely knows this,&para;<br>which is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick&para;<br>conceded that Brady was violated. I can honor that con&para;<br>cession in my analysis of the case because even if it ex&para;<br>tends beyond Deegan’s deliberate actions, it remains&para;<br>irrelevant to Connick’s training obligations. For any&para;<br>Brady violation apart from Deegan’s was surely on the&para;<br>very frontier of our Brady jurisprudence; Connick could&para;<br>not possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was&para;<br>required to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to&para;<br>untested evidence that we had not (and still have not)&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The dissent’s only response to this is that the jury must have found&para;<br>otherwise, since it was instructed that “ ‘[f]or liability to attach because&para;<br>of a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not&para;<br>in any particular prosecutor.’ ” Post, at 28, n. 20 (quoting Tr. 1098).&para;<br>But this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not&para;<br>commit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury&para;<br>from finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train.&para;<br>I not only agree with that; it is part of my point.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>recognized. As a consequence, even if I accepted the dis&para;<br>sent’s conclusion that failure-to-train liability could be&para;<br>premised on a single Brady error, I could not agree that&para;<br>the lack of an accurate training regimen caused the viola&para;<br>tion Connick has conceded.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

That is so, the&para;<br>Court tells us, because Thompson has shown only an&para;<br>aberrant Brady violation, not a routine practice of giving&para;<br>short shrift to Brady’s requirements.

The prosecutors&para;<br>did so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two&para;<br>decades, to set the record straight.

This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecu&para;<br>tor’s notation that the Office “may wish to do [a] blood&para;<br>test.” Id., at EX122.&para;<br>The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March&para;<br>1985. Armed with the later indictment against Thompson&para;<br>for robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic&para;<br>choice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceed&para;<br>ing first on the robbery indictment. Id., at EX128–EX129.&para;<br>Their aim was twofold. A robbery conviction gained first&para;<br>would serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his&para;<br>own defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction&para;<br>could be used to impeach his credibility. In addition, an&para;<br>armed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty&para;<br>phase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution’s&para;<br>plea for the death penalty. Id., at 682.&para;<br>Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team,&para;<br>petitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the&para;<br>Parish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric&para;<br>Dubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases. Dubelier&para;<br>enlisted Jim Williams to try the armed robbery case and to&para;<br>assist him in the murder case. Gerry Deegan assisted&para;<br>Williams in the armed robbery case. Bruce Whittaker, the&para;<br>fourth prosecutor involved in the cases, had approved&para;<br>Thompson’s armed robbery indictment.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 At&para;<br>&para;<br>the time of their assignment, Dubelier had served in the District&para;<br>Attorney’s Office for three and a half years, Williams, for four and a&para;<br>half years, Deegan, a recent law school graduate, for less than one year,&para;<br>and Whittaker, for three years.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v. THOMPSON&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>During pretrial proceedings in the armed robbery case,&para;<br>Thompson filed a motion requesting access to all materials&para;<br>and information “favorable to the defendant” and “mate&para;<br>rial and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,” as&para;<br>well as “any results or reports” of “scientific tests or ex&para;<br>periments.” Id., at EX144, EX145. Prosecutorial re&para;<br>sponses to this motion fell far short of Brady compliance.4&para;<br>First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel’s inspection of&para;<br>the pant leg swatch stained by the robber’s blood. Al&para;<br>though Dubelier’s April 3 response stated, “Inspection to&para;<br>be permitted,” id., at EX149, the swatch was signed out&para;<br>from the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and&para;<br>was not returned until noon on April 10, the day before&para;<br>trial, id., at EX43, EX670. Thompson’s attorney inspected&para;<br>the evidence made available to him and found no blood&para;<br>evidence. No one told defense counsel about the swatch&para;<br>and its recent removal from the property room. Id., at&para;<br>EX701–EX702; Tr. 400–402.

And the&para;<br>District Court instructed the jury, with no objection from Connick, “that&para;<br>the nonproduced blood evidence . . . violated [Thompson’s] constitu&para;<br>tional rights as a matter of law.” Id., at 1095.&para;<br>6 JUSTICE SCALIA questions petitioners’ concession that Brady was&para;<br>violated when the prosecution failed to inform Thompson of the blood&para;<br>evidence.

THOMPSON&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>murder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution’s&para;<br>order-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.7 By prosecuting&para;<br>Thompson for armed robbery first—and withholding blood&para;<br>evidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that&para;<br>charge—the District Attorney’s Office disabled Thompson&para;<br>from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.8 As&para;<br>earlier observed, see supra, at 5, impeaching use of the&para;<br>prior conviction would have severely undermined Thomp&para;<br>son’s credibility. And because Thompson was effectively&para;<br>stopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony&para;<br>of the witnesses against him gained force. The prosecu&para;<br>tion’s failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached&para;<br>those witnesses helped to seal Thompson’s fate.&para;<br>First, the prosecution undermined Thompson’s efforts to&para;<br>impeach Perkins. Perkins testified that he volunteered&para;<br>information to the police with no knowledge of reward&para;<br>money. Record EX366, EX372–EX373. Because prosecu&para;<br>tors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins’ conversa&para;<br>tions with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the&para;<br>tapes), Thompson’s attorneys could do little to cast doubt&para;<br>on Perkins’ credibility. In closing argument, the prosecu&para;<br>tion emphasized that Thompson presented no “direct&para;<br>evidence” that reward money had motivated any of the&para;<br>witnesses. Id., at EX3171–EX3172.&para;<br>Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson’s impeach&para;<br>ment of key witness Kevin Freeman.

Lacking any knowledge of the police&para;<br>report, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.&para;<br>Third, and most vital, the eyewitness’ initial description&para;<br>of the assailant’s hair, see supra, at 3, was of prime rele&para;<br>vance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson,&para;<br>murdered Liuzza, see supra, at 4. The materiality of the&para;<br>eyewitness’ contemporaneous description of the murderer&para;<br>should have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.&para;<br>Failure to produce the police reports setting out what the&para;<br>eyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to im&para;<br>peach that witness and the police officer who initially&para;<br>interviewed him.

Cor&para;<br>roboratively, the police officer—after refreshing his recol&para;<br>lection by reviewing material at the prosecution’s table—&para;<br>gave artful testimony. He characterized the witness’&para;<br>initial description of the perpetrator’s hair as “black and&para;<br>short, afro style.” Id., at EX265 (emphasis added). As&para;<br>prosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police&para;<br>reports, which described the murderer’s hair simply as&para;<br>“close cut,” portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro&para;<br>style hair.&para;<br>The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.&para;<br>Having prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman&para;<br>was the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate&para;<br>argument.

The strategy worked as planned; Thomp&para;<br>son was sentenced to death.&para;<br>E&para;<br>Thompson discovered the prosecutors’ misconduct&para;<br>through a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine&para;<br>years after Thompson’s convictions, Deegan, the assistant&para;<br>prosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was&para;<br>terminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his&para;<br>friend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood&para;<br>evidence in the armed robbery case. Id., at EX709.&para;<br>Deegan did not heed Riehlmann’s counsel to reveal what&para;<br>he had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former&para;<br>Orleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan’s confession to&para;<br>himself. Id., at EX712–EX713.&para;<br>On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled&para;<br>Thompson’s execution. Id., at EX1366–EX1367.

A full hearing&para;<br>was unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had con&para;<br>fessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery&para;<br>charges. See, e.g., id., at EX617. The court insisted on a&para;<br>public hearing. Given “the history of this case,” the court&para;<br>said, it “was not willing to accept the representations that&para;<br>[Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dis&para;<br>miss].” id., at EX882. After a full day’s hearing, the court&para;<br>vacated Thompson’s attempted armed robbery conviction&para;<br>and dismissed the charges.

THOMPSON&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Thompson’s right to testify and thus fully present his&para;<br>defense in the murder trial. Id., at 557. The merits of&para;<br>several Brady claims arising out of the murder trial, the&para;<br>court observed, had therefore become “moot.” 825 So. 2d,&para;<br>at 555; see also Record 684.9 But cf. ante, at 10–11, n. 7,&para;<br>16–17, n. 11 (suggesting that there were no Brady viola&para;<br>tions in the murder prosecution because no court had&para;<br>adjudicated any violations).10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Thompson argued that “the State failed to produce police reports&para;<br>‘and other information’ which would have identified ‘eye- and ear&para;<br>witnesses’ whose testimony would have exonerated him and inculpated&para;<br>[Freeman], . . . and would have shown that [Perkins,] . . . who stated&para;<br>[he] heard [Thompson] admit to committing the murder[,] had been&para;<br>promised reward money for [his] testimony.” Thompson, 825 So. 2d, at&para;<br>555. In leaving these arguments unaddressed, the Louisiana Court of&para;<br>Appeal surely did not defer to the Fifth Circuit’s earlier assessment&para;<br>of those claims, made on an anemic record, in Thompson v. Cain, 161&para;<br>F. 3d 802. Nor did the Louisiana Court of Appeal suggest that Thomp&para;<br>son was “belatedly tr[ying] to reverse” the Fifth Circuit’s decision. But&para;<br>cf. ante, at 17, n. 11.&para;<br>10 The Court notes that in Thompson v. Cain, the Fifth Circuit re&para;<br>jected Brady claims raised by Thompson, characterizing one of those&para;<br>claims as “without merit.” Ante, at 17, n. 11 (quoting Thompson, 161&para;<br>F. 3d, at 807); see supra, at 4, n. 2. The Court, however, overlooks the&para;<br>date of that Fifth Circuit decision. It was rendered before revelation of&para;<br>the Brady violations in the armed robbery trial, before Thompson had&para;<br>the opportunity for discovery in his §1983 suit, and before Thompson or&para;<br>any court was aware of the “close cut hair” police reports. See Thomp&para;<br>son, 161 F. 3d, at 812, n. 8. It is these later revelations, not the little&para;<br>Thompson knew in 1998, that should count. For example, the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit, in 1998, believed that Perkins’ statement recorded in the police&para;<br>report did not “differ from Freeman’s trial testimony.” Id., at 808. But&para;<br>evidence put before the jury in 2007 in the §1983 trial showed that the&para;<br>police report, in several material respects, was inconsistent with&para;<br>Freeman’s trial testimony. Tr. 382–383.&para;<br>Connick has never suggested to this Court that the jury in the §1983&para;<br>trial was bound by the Fifth Circuit’s 1998 Brady rulings. That court&para;<br>“afford[ed] great deference to” the state trial court’s findings, made&para;<br>after a 1995 post-conviction relief hearing. Thompson, 161 F. 3d, at&para;<br>805. The jury in the §1983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and&para;<br>accurate information on which to reach its decision. Moreover, as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

The newly&para;<br>produced items included police reports describing the&para;<br>assailant in the murder case as having “close cut” hair, the&para;<br>police report recounting Perkins’ meetings with the Liuzza&para;<br>family, see supra, at 3–4, audio recordings of those meet&para;<br>ings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After&para;<br>deliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson&para;<br>not guilty.&para;<br>On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years&para;<br>in prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was&para;<br>released.&para;<br>II&para;<br>On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action&para;<br>under 42 U.

C. §1983 alleging that Connick, other&para;<br>officials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office,&para;<br>and the Office itself, had violated his constitutional rights&para;<br>by wrongfully withholding Brady evidence. Thompson&para;<br>sought to hold Connick and the District Attorney’s Office&para;<br>liable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concern&para;<br>ing their Brady obligations. Such liability attaches, I&para;<br>agree with the Court, only when the failure “amount[s] to&para;<br>‘deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom&para;<br>the [untrained employees] come into contact.’ ” Ante, at 9&para;<br>(quoting Canton v.

I&para;<br>disagree, however, with the Court’s conclusion that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>earlier noted, the same trial court that made the 1995 findings was, in&para;<br>1999, outraged by the subsequently discovered Brady violations and by&para;<br>Connick’s reluctance to bring those violations to light. See supra, at&para;<br>10–11. Certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that&para;<br>assessed Connick’s deliberate indifference in the §1983 trial to defer to&para;<br>findings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v.

Burget, 486 U.

Record 1917.&para;<br>Over 20 years ago, we observed that a municipality’s&para;<br>failure to provide training may be so egregious that, even&para;<br>without notice of prior constitutional violations, the failure&para;<br>“could properly be characterized as ‘deliberate indiffer&para;<br>ence’ to constitutional rights.” Canton, 489 U. S., at 390,&para;<br>n. 10. “[I]n light of the duties assigned to specific officers&para;<br>or employees,” Canton recognized, “it may happen that . . .&para;<br>the need for more or different training is so obvious, and&para;<br>the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of consti&para;<br>tutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reasonably&para;<br>be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.”&para;<br>Id., at 390.

Tr. 542. The court,&para;<br>however, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor&para;<br>has a “duty . . . to learn of any favorable evidence known&para;<br>to others acting on the government’s behalf in the case,&para;<br>including the police.” Id., at 1095; Record 1614.

The testimony of&para;<br>“high-ranking individuals in the Orleans Parish District&para;<br>Attorney’s Office,” Thompson’s expert explained,12 exposed&para;<br>“complete errors . . . as to what Brady required [prosecu&para;<br>tors] to do.” Id., at 427, 434. “Dubelier had no under&para;<br>standing of his obligations under Brady whatsoever,” id.,&para;<br>at 458, the expert observed, and Williams “is still not sure&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 With no objection from petitioners, the court found Thompson’s&para;<br>expert, Joseph Lawless, qualified to testify as an expert in criminal law&para;<br>and procedure.

Among the Brady&para;<br>related decisions this Court handed down were United States v. Bagley,&para;<br>473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985) (“This Court has rejected any . . . distinction&para;<br>between impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence [in the Brady&para;<br>context].”); Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.

S. 97, 103, 104, 106–107 (1976) (Brady claim may arise&para;<br>when “the undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution’s&para;<br>case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or&para;<br>should have known, of the perjury,” when defense counsel makes “a&para;<br>pretrial request for specific evidence” and the government fails to&para;<br>accede to that request, and when defense counsel makes no request and&para;<br>the government fails to disclose “obviously exculpatory” evidence).&para;<br>These decisions were not referenced in the manual that compiled&para;<br>circulated memoranda.&para;<br>In the same period, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued dozens of&para;<br>opinions discussing Brady, including State v.

First, Connick did not ensure that&para;<br>prosecutors in his Office knew their Brady obligations; he&para;<br>neither confirmed their familiarity with Brady when he&para;<br>hired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his&para;<br>watch. Second, the need for Brady training and monitor&para;<br>ing was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third,&para;<br>Connick’s cavalier approach to his staff’s knowledge and&para;<br>observation of Brady requirements contributed to a cul&para;<br>ture of inattention to Brady in Orleans Parish.&para;<br>As earlier noted, see supra, at 11, Connick resisted an&para;<br>effort to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady compli&para;<br>ance because he felt the effort would “make [his] job more&para;<br>difficult.” Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single&para;<br>prosecutor for violating Brady. Tr. 182–183. The jury was&para;<br>told of this Court’s decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.&para;<br>419 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick’s Office&para;<br>that garnered attention because it featured “so many&para;<br>instances of the state’s failure to disclose exculpatory&para;<br>evidence.” Id., at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring). When&para;<br>questioned about Kyles, Connick told the jury he was&para;<br>satisfied with his Office’s practices and saw no need,&para;<br>occasioned by Kyles, to make any changes. Tr. 184–185.&para;<br>In both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed&para;<br>here was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determi&para;<br>nation that Connick and the prosecutors who served under&para;<br>him were not merely negligent regarding Brady. Rather,&para;<br>they were deliberately indifferent to what the law&para;<br>requires.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In Canton, this Court spoke of circumstances in which&para;<br>the need for training may be “so obvious,” and the lack of&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>prosecution fails, even inadvertently, to disclose bargain with a wit&para;<br>ness).&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>CONNICK v.

This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category&para;<br>Canton marked out.&para;<br>Canton offered an often-cited illustration. “[C]ity poli&para;<br>cymakers know to a moral certainty that their police&para;<br>officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.” Ibid.,&para;<br>n. 10. Those policymakers, Canton observed, equip police&para;<br>officers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. Ibid. The&para;<br>need to instruct armed officers about “constitutional limi&para;<br>tations on the use of deadly force,” Canton said, is “ ‘so&para;<br>obvious,’ that failure to [train the officers] could properly&para;<br>be characterized as ‘deliberate indifference’ to constitu&para;<br>tional rights.” Ibid.&para;<br>The District Court, tracking Canton’s language, in&para;<br>structed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his&para;<br>“deliberate indifference” claim only if the evidence per&para;<br>suaded the jury on three points. First, Connick “was&para;<br>certain that prosecutors would confront the situation&para;<br>where they would have to decide which evidence was&para;<br>required by the Constitution to be provided to the ac&para;<br>cused.” Tr. 1099. Second, “the situation involved a diffi&para;<br>cult choice[,] or one that prosecutors had a history of&para;<br>mishandling, such that additional training, supervision or&para;<br>monitoring was clearly needed.” Ibid. Third, “the wrong&para;<br>choice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently&para;<br>cause a deprivation of an accused’s constitutional rights.”&para;<br>Ibid.; Record 1619–1620; see Canton, 489 U.

See&para;<br>ante, at 14–15. Connick, by his own admission, had such a reason. See&para;<br>supra, at 18–20.&para;<br>27 For example, a prosecutor’s office could be deliberately indifferent if&para;<br>it had a longstanding open-file policy, abandoned that policy, but failed&para;<br>to provide training to show prosecutors how to comply with their Brady&para;<br>obligations in the altered circumstances.
