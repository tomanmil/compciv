MARTIN&para;<br>&para;<br>MULHALL ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[December 10, 2013]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.&para;<br>Section 302(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,&para;<br>1947, 61 Stat. 157, as amended, an antibribery provision,&para;<br>makes it a crime for an employer “to pay, lend, or deliver,&para;<br>or agree to pay, lend, or deliver, any money or other&para;<br>thing of value” to a labor union that represents or seeks to&para;<br>represent its employees. 29 U. S. C. §186(a)(2). Section&para;<br>302(b) makes it a crime “for any person to request [or]&para;<br>demand . . . , or agree to receive or accept, any payment,&para;<br>loan, or delivery of any money or other thing of value&para;<br>prohibited by subsection (a).” §186(b)(1). The question in&para;<br>this case is whether an employer violates §302(a) by making the following promises to a union that seeks to represent its employees: (1) that the employer will remain&para;<br>neutral in respect to the union’s efforts to organize its&para;<br>employees, (2) that the union will be given access (for&para;<br>organizing purposes) to nonpublic areas of the employer’s&para;<br>premises, and (3) that the union will receive a list of employees’ names and contact information (also for organizing purposes). A further question (the other side of the&para;<br>same coin) is whether a union violates §302(b) by requesting that the employer perform its contractual obligations&para;<br>to fulfill these promises.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit held that these items are “thing[s]&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITE HERE LOCAL 355 v. MULHALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of value” and that an employer’s promise to “pay” them in&para;<br>return for something of value from the union violates the&para;<br>Act if the employer intends to use the payment to “corrupt” the union; the Eleventh Circuit also held that a&para;<br>union’s request that an employer make such a payment&para;<br>violates §302(b) if the union intends to “extort” the benefit&para;<br>from the employer. 667 F. 3d 1211, 1215–1216 (2012).&para;<br>Other Circuits have held to the contrary, reasoning that&para;<br>similar promises by an employer to assist a union’s organizing campaign (or merely to avoid opposing the campaign)&para;<br>fall outside the scope of §302. See Adcock v. Freightliner&para;<br>LLC, 550 F. 3d 369 (CA4 2008); Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees Union, Local 57 v. Sage Hospitality&para;<br>Resources, LLC, 390 F. 3d 206 (CA3 2004). We granted&para;<br>certiorari to resolve the conflict.&para;<br>We have received briefs on the issue, and we have heard&para;<br>oral argument. But in considering the briefs and argument, we became aware of two logically antecedent questions that could prevent us from reaching the question of&para;<br>the correct interpretation of §302. First, it is possible that&para;<br>the case is moot because the contract between the employer&para;<br>and union that contained the allegedly criminal promises&para;<br>appears to have expired by the end of 2011, before the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision on the scope of&para;<br>§302. Second, it is arguable that respondent Mulhall, the&para;<br>sole plaintiff in this case, lacks Article III standing.&para;<br>In my view, rather than dismiss the writ of certiorari as&para;<br>improvidently granted, the Court should simply ask for&para;<br>additional briefs addressing these two questions. If it&para;<br>turns out that the federal courts lack jurisdiction either&para;<br>because the case is moot or because Mulhall lacks standing, then we cannot reach the merits. But if that is the&para;<br>case, then we should likely order the Eleventh Circuit’s&para;<br>decision vacated, thereby removing its precedential effect&para;<br>and leaving the merits question open to be resolved in a&para;<br>later case that does fall within the jurisdiction of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>federal courts.&para;<br>I believe we should also ask for further briefing on a&para;<br>third question: the question whether §302 authorizes a&para;<br>private right of action. I recognize that the Court said,&para;<br>long ago and in passing, that §302(e) “permit[s] private&para;<br>litigants to obtain injunctions” for violations of §302.&para;<br>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195, 205&para;<br>(1962), overruled in part on other grounds, Boys Markets,&para;<br>Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 237–238 (1970). But,&para;<br>in light of the Court’s more restrictive views on private&para;<br>rights of action in recent decades, see, e.g., Alexander v.&para;<br>Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286–287 (2001), the legal status&para;<br>of Sinclair Refining’s dictum is uncertain. And if §302 in&para;<br>fact does not provide a right of action to private parties&para;<br>like Mulhall, then courts will not need to reach difficult&para;<br>questions about the scope of §302, as happened in this&para;<br>case, unless the Federal Government decides to prosecute&para;<br>such cases rather than limit its attention to cases that&para;<br>clearly fall within the statute’s core antibribery purpose.&para;<br>Unless resolved, the differences among the Courts of&para;<br>Appeals could negatively affect the collective-bargaining&para;<br>process. This is because the Eleventh Circuit’s decision&para;<br>raises the specter that an employer or union official could&para;<br>be found guilty of a crime that carries a 5-year maximum&para;<br>sentence, see 29 U. S. C. §186(d), if the employer or union&para;<br>official is found to have made certain commonplace organizing assistance agreements with the intent to “corrupt”&para;<br>or “extort.” In my view, given the importance of the question presented to the collective-bargaining process, further&para;<br>briefing, rather than dismissal, is the better course of&para;<br>action.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
