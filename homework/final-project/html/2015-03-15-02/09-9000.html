SWITZER, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR&para;<br>31ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–9000. Argued October 13, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011&para;<br>District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, left unresolved the question whether a convicted state pris&para;<br>oner seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence may assert that&para;<br>claim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 or may assert&para;<br>the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas cor&para;<br>pus under 28 U. S. C. §2254.&para;<br>A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to&para;<br>death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons. He claimed that a&para;<br>potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to com&para;<br>mit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriend’s uncle as the&para;<br>likely perpetrator. In preparation for trial, the State tested some of&para;<br>the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including&para;<br>knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, finger&para;<br>nail clippings, and certain hair samples. More than six years later,&para;<br>Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconvic&para;<br>tion DNA testing in limited circumstances. Invoking Article 64,&para;<br>Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested&para;<br>biological evidence. Both motions were denied. The Texas Court of&para;<br>Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the&para;<br>ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article&para;<br>64.03(a)(2), that he “would not have been convicted if exculpatory re&para;<br>sults had been obtained through DNA testing.” The CCA affirmed&para;<br>the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown,&para;<br>as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previ&para;<br>ously tested “through no fault” on his part.&para;<br>Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief&para;<br>under §1983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v. SWITZER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Attorney who has custody of the evidence that Skinner would like to&para;<br>have tested. Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA&para;<br>testing he requested. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal&para;<br>of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postcon&para;<br>viction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas cor&para;<br>pus, not under §1983. Adopting that recommendation, the District&para;<br>Court dismissed Skinner’s suit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner’s&para;<br>complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under §1983.&para;<br>Pp. 7–15.&para;<br>(a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) generally requires only a&para;<br>plausible “short and plain” statement of the plaintiff’s claim, not an&para;<br>exposition of his legal argument. Skinner stated his due process&para;<br>claim in a paragraph alleging that the State’s refusal “to release the&para;<br>biological evidence for testing . . . deprived [him] of his liberty inter&para;<br>ests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction&para;<br>and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . .” His coun&para;<br>sel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutor’s con&para;<br>duct or the CCA’s decisions; instead, he challenges Texas’ postconvic&para;<br>tion DNA statute “as construed” by the Texas courts. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar Skinner’s suit. This&para;<br>Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it&para;<br>takes its name, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, District of&para;<br>Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462. See Exxon&para;<br>Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280. Given&para;<br>“the narrow ground” the doctrine occupies, id., at 284, the Court has&para;<br>confined Rooker-Feldman “to cases . . . brought by state-court losers&para;<br>. . . inviting district court review and rejection of [a state court’s]&para;<br>judgments.” Ibid. Skinner’s complaint encounters no RookerFeldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s] [an] independent&para;<br>claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction&para;<br>that the “same or a related question” was earlier aired between the&para;<br>parties in state court. Id., at 292–293. A state-court decision is not&para;<br>reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing&para;<br>the decision may be challenged in a federal action. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487. Because Skinner’s federal case—which&para;<br>challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute&para;<br>they authoritatively construed—falls within the latter category, there&para;<br>was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.&para;<br>Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(c) Measured against this Court’s prior holdings, Skinner has prop&para;<br>erly invoked §1983. This Court has several times considered when a&para;<br>state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pur&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sue a civil rights claim under §1983, and when habeas corpus is the&para;<br>prisoner’s sole remedy. The pathmarking decision, Heck v. Hum&para;<br>phrey, 512 U. S. 477, concerned a state prisoner who brought a §1983&para;<br>action for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investi&para;<br>gated, arrested, tried, and convicted. This Court held that §1983 was&para;<br>not an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff’s favor&para;<br>would “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his conviction. See id., at&para;<br>487. In contrast, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, the Court held&para;<br>that prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative&para;<br>decisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under §1983,&para;<br>for they sought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier re&para;<br>lease into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable judgment&para;<br>[would] not ‘necessarily imply’ the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or&para;<br>sentence[s],” ibid. Here, success in Skinner’s suit for DNA testing&para;<br>would not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his conviction. Test&para;<br>results might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevita&para;<br>ble, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.&para;<br>Switzer argues that, although Skinner’s immediate aim is DNA test&para;<br>ing, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for at&para;<br>tacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court&para;<br>has recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought&para;<br>would not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce&para;<br>the custody level. Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her amici, in&para;<br>the Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for DNA testing, there&para;<br>has been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evi&para;<br>dence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment. The pro&para;<br>jected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding&para;<br>DNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected substantive due process&para;<br>as a basis for such claims. More generally, in the Prison Litigation&para;<br>Reform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits&para;<br>in order to prevent sportive federal-court filings. Nor is there cause&para;<br>for concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on&para;<br>Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady, which announced a consti&para;<br>tutional requirement addressed to the prosecution’s conduct pretrial,&para;<br>proscribes withholding evidence “favorable to an accused” and “mate&para;<br>rial to [his] guilt or to punishment.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___.&para;<br>Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or&para;<br>inconclusive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evi&para;<br>dence undermining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within&para;<br>the traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of&para;<br>§1983. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(d) Switzer’s several arguments why Skinner’s complaint should&para;<br>fail for lack of merit, unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for&para;<br>consideration on remand.

Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 12–13): May a convicted state prisoner&para;<br>seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that&para;<br>claim in a civil rights action under 42 U.

The Courts of Appeals have returned&para;<br>diverse responses. Compare McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d&para;<br>89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cogniza­&para;<br>ble under §1983); Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 669 (CA7&para;<br>2006) (same); Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F. 3d 1287, 1290–1291&para;<br>(CA11 2002) (same), with Harvey v. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370,&para;<br>375 (CA4 2002) (claim is not cognizable under §1983) and&para;<br>Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339, 341 (CA5&para;<br>2002) (per curiam) (same).&para;<br>In Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005), we compre­&para;<br>hensively surveyed this Court’s decisions on the respective&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v. SWITZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>provinces of §1983 civil rights actions and §2254 federal&para;<br>habeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we&para;<br>reaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks “immediate or&para;<br>speedier release” from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the&para;<br>prisoner’s claim would not “necessarily spell speedier&para;<br>release,” however, suit may be brought under §1983. Ibid.&para;<br>Adhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon­&para;<br>viction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a&para;<br>§1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner&para;<br>only access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul­&para;<br>patory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a&para;<br>judgment that simply orders DNA tests “necessarily&para;<br>impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State’s custody.” Id., at&para;<br>81. We note, however, that the Court’s decision in Os&para;<br>borne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner&para;<br>may bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten­&para;<br>sion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to&para;<br>show that the governing state law denies him procedural&para;<br>due process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skin­&para;<br>ner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in&para;<br>girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was&para;<br>bludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons&para;<br>were stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the&para;<br>house Busby shared with Skinner.&para;<br>Skinner never denied his presence in the house when&para;<br>the killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was&para;<br>incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.&para;<br>The potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at&para;<br>trial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal&para;<br>murders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a&para;<br>likely perpetrator, Busby’s uncle, Robert Donnell (now&para;<br>deceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).&para;<br>The CCA’s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in&para;<br>detail:&para;<br>“As they approached the house . . . , the police noticed&para;<br>a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the&para;<br>front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear&para;<br>on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.&para;<br>Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila’s&para;<br>dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle&para;<br>stained with blood and hair was leaning against the&para;<br>couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con­&para;<br>taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains&para;<br>on it was laying between the couch and the coffee&para;<br>table.&para;<br>“[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where&para;<br>[Busby’s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The&para;<br>officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the&para;<br>upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. . . . A&para;<br>door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility&para;<br>room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody&para;<br>handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the&para;<br>frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint&para;<br>on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen&para;<br>to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the&para;<br>door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.&para;<br>“[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found&para;<br>him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the kill­&para;<br>ings, Busby had spurned Donnell’s “rude sexual advances.” Skinner v.&para;<br>State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related&para;<br>at a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or&para;<br>two after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his&para;<br>pickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5&para;<br>2008).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v.

State, 122&para;<br>S. W. 3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also&para;<br>tested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence—&para;<br>including bloody palm prints in the room where one victim&para;<br>was killed—implicated Skinner, but “fingerprints on a bag&para;<br>containing one of the knives” did not. Ibid. Items left&para;<br>untested included the knives found on the premises, the&para;<br>axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and addi­&para;<br>tional hair samples. See ibid.2&para;<br>In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuc­&para;<br>cessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.&para;<br>See Skinner v. Quarterman, 576 F. 3d 214 (CA5 2009),&para;<br>cert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010). He also pursued infor­&para;<br>mal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence&para;<br>the police had collected at the scene of the crime.3&para;<br>In 2001, more than six years after Skinner’s conviction,&para;<br>Texas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to&para;<br>gain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 After Skinner’s conviction, the State performed DNA tests on cer­&para;<br>tain additional materials, but Skinner took no part in the selection&para;<br>of those materials or their testing. Skinner maintains that these&para;<br>ex parte tests were inconclusive. See Complaint ¶19, App. 12 (this&para;<br>“testing raised more questions than it answered”). But see Skinner v.&para;<br>State, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were&para;<br>“inculpatory”).&para;<br>3 Skinner’s trial counsel, although aware that biological evidence&para;<br>remained untested, did not request further testing. Postconviction,&para;<br>Skinner sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and finger nail clippings&para;<br>taken from Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby’s&para;<br>body, and biological material on knives and a dish towel recovered at&para;<br>the crime scene.

Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.&para;<br>2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner&para;<br>must meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show&para;<br>that, at trial, testing either was “not available” or was&para;<br>“available, but not technologically capable of providing&para;<br>probative results.” Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he&para;<br>may show that the evidence was not previously tested&para;<br>“through no fault” on his part, and that “the interests of&para;<br>justice” require a postconviction order for testing. Art.&para;<br>64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test­&para;<br>ing, a court must make further findings, prime among&para;<br>them, the movant “would not have been convicted if excul­&para;<br>patory results had been obtained through DNA testing,”&para;<br>and “the [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea­&para;<br>sonably delay the execution of sentence or administration&para;<br>of justice.” Art. 64.03(a)(2).&para;<br>Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,&para;<br>first in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet&para;<br>untested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both&para;<br>motions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner’s&para;<br>first motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon­&para;<br>strate a “reasonable probability . . . that he would not have&para;<br>been . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa­&para;<br>tory.” Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.&para;<br>Skinner’s second motion was bolstered by discovery he&para;<br>had obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the&para;<br>denial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground&para;<br>that Skinner failed to meet the “no fault” requirement.&para;<br>See Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an&para;<br>expert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two&para;<br>sons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby’s right&para;<br>hand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint ¶27, App.&para;<br>18.&para;<br>5 The District Attorney, in response to Skinner’s second motion, in­&para;<br>formed the Texas district court that “[t]o the best of the State’s infor­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v. SWITZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun­&para;<br>sel testified that he had not “ask[ed] for testing because he&para;<br>was afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner’s].” Id.,&para;<br>at 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted “a&para;<br>reasonable trial strategy” that the court had no cause to&para;<br>second-guess. Id., at 209.&para;<br>Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc­&para;<br>tive relief under §1983, naming as defendant respondent&para;<br>Lynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose­&para;<br>cuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner&para;<br>would like to have DNA tested. Skinner’s federal-court&para;<br>complaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for&para;<br>the DNA testing he requested. Complaint ¶33, App. 20–&para;<br>21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the&para;<br>complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can&para;<br>be granted. App. 24–41. Under the governing Circuit&para;<br>precedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,&para;<br>the Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for&para;<br>DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not&para;<br>under §1983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge’s&para;<br>recommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner’s&para;<br>suit. Id., at 44–45.&para;<br>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Fifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per&para;<br>curiam), reiterating that “an action by a prisoner for post­&para;<br>conviction DNA testing is not cognizable under §1983 and&para;<br>must instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas&para;<br>corpus,” id., at 303. On Skinner’s petition,6 we granted&para;<br>——————&para;<br>mation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still&para;<br>available for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in&para;<br>a condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert&para;<br>opinion in that regard.” Record 202. See also Complaint ¶29, App. 19.&para;<br>6 The State of Texas scheduled Skinner’s execution for March 24,&para;<br>2010.

S. 506, 514 (2002). Skinner’s com­&para;<br>plaint is not a model of the careful drafter’s art, but under&para;<br>the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not&para;<br>pin plaintiff’s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.&para;<br>Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener­&para;<br>ally requires only a plausible “short and plain” statement&para;<br>of the plaintiff’s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu­&para;<br>ment. See 5 C. Wright &amp; A.

District Court after the state proceedings&para;<br>ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court&para;<br>judgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of&para;<br>that judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the&para;<br>plaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court&para;<br>to overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,&para;<br>in both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject­&para;<br>matter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. §1257&para;<br>“vests authority to review a state court’s judgment solely&para;<br>in this Court.” See Exxon, 544 U.

As the Court explained in&para;<br>Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544&para;<br>U. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by&para;<br>lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the&para;<br>decision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner’s&para;<br>federal case falls within the latter category. There was,&para;<br>therefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin­&para;<br>ner’s federal suit.11&para;<br>C&para;<br>When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu­&para;<br>tional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under&para;<br>§1983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner’s sole&para;<br>remedy? This Court has several times considered that&para;<br>question. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512&para;<br>U. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state&para;<br>prisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a&para;<br>§1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been&para;<br>unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.&para;<br>Although the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages&para;<br>only, not release from confinement, we ruled that the&para;<br>plaintiff could not proceed under §1983.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,&para;<br>“Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,” Lance v.&para;<br>Dennis, 546 U.

When “a judgment in&para;<br>favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity&para;<br>of his conviction or sentence,” the Court held, §1983 is not&para;<br>an available remedy. Ibid. “But if . . . the plaintiff’s ac­&para;<br>tion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity&para;<br>of [his conviction or sentence], the [§1983] action should be&para;<br>allowed to proceed . . . .” Ibid.&para;<br>We summarized the relevant case law most recently in&para;<br>Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in­&para;<br>volved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of&para;<br>administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.&para;<br>They could proceed under §1983, the Court held, for they&para;<br>sought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier&para;<br>release into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable&para;<br>judgment [would] not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of&para;<br>[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],’ ” ibid. (quoting Heck,&para;<br>512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).&para;<br>Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop­&para;<br>erly invoked §1983. Success in his suit for DNA testing&para;<br>would not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his convic­&para;<br>tion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that&para;<br>outcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see&para;<br>supra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might&para;<br>further incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541&para;<br>U. S. 637, 647 (2004) (“[W]e were careful in Heck to stress&para;<br>the importance of the term ‘necessarily.’ ”).12&para;<br>Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with&para;<br>Fifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,&para;<br>that Skinner’s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if&para;<br>at all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a §1983&para;<br>action.

SWITZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>order requiring DNA testing, his ultimate aim, Switzer&para;<br>urges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking&para;<br>his conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has&para;<br>found no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has&para;<br>recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available&para;<br>one, where the relief sought would “neither terminat[e]&para;<br>custody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from cus­&para;<br>tody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.” Dotson, 544 U.

See Brief for National District Attorneys Associa­&para;<br>tion as Amicus Curiae 8. In particular, they predict a&para;<br>proliferation of federal civil actions “seeking postconviction&para;<br>discovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associ­&para;<br>ated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.”&para;<br>Id., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, post, at 6, are&para;<br>unwarranted.13&para;<br>In the Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for&para;<br>DNA testing, see supra, at 1, no evidence tendered by&para;<br>Switzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v. Dotson,&para;<br>544 U. S. 74 (2005), Switzer urges, claims like Skinner’s require inquiry&para;<br>into the State’s proof at trial and therefore lie at “the core of the crimi­&para;<br>nal proceeding itself.” Tr. of Oral 41; see id., at 33–34. Dotson de­&para;<br>clared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner’s claim&para;<br>would not “necessarily spell speedier release,” that claim does not lie at&para;<br>“the core of habeas corpus,” and may be brought, if at all, under §1983.&para;<br>544 U.

See Strickler, 527 U. S., at&para;<br>296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic­&para;<br>tion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for&para;<br>“immediate or speedier release” from imprisonment. See&para;<br>Dotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have&para;<br>ranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and&para;<br>outside the province of §1983. See Heck, 512 U.

Rodri&para;<br>guez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973); see, e.g., Heck v. Hum&para;<br>phrey, 512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (§1983 should not “expand&para;<br>opportunities for collateral attack”). But this Court has&para;<br>never purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of&para;<br>§1983. Cf. id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each&para;<br>claim as it has come before us, reasoning from first princi&para;<br>ples and our prior decisions.&para;<br>In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Court began with the undis&para;<br>puted proposition that a state prisoner may not use §1983&para;<br>to “challeng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on&para;<br>federal constitutional grounds.” 411 U. S., at 489. This&para;<br>included attacks on the trial procedures. See id., at 486&para;<br>(“den[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial”). From there,&para;<br>the Court reasoned that “immediate release from [physi&para;<br>——————&para;<br>postconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a&para;<br>state habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See&para;<br>Ard v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does&para;<br>not itself “provide a vehicle for obtaining relief,” Ex parte Tuley, 109&para;<br>S. W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex.

If cognizable at all, Skinner’s claim&para;<br>sounds in habeas corpus.&para;<br>First, for the purposes of the Due Process Clause, the&para;<br>process of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all&para;<br>procedures—including collateral review procedures—that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v. SWITZER&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>establish and review the validity of a conviction. This has&para;<br>long been recognized for direct appellate review:&para;<br>“And while the Fourteenth Amendment does not re&para;<br>quire that a State shall provide for an appellate re&para;<br>view in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that&para;<br>where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner&para;<br>has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appel&para;<br>late tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process&para;<br>of law under which he is held in custody by the State,&para;<br>and to be considered in determining any question of&para;<br>alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment.” Frank v. Mangum, 237&para;<br>U. S. 309, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).&para;<br>Similarly, although a State is not required to provide&para;<br>procedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that&para;<br>when state collateral review procedures are provided for,&para;<br>they too are part of the “process of law under which [a&para;<br>prisoner] is held in custody by the State.” Ibid. As this&para;<br>Court has explained, when considering whether the State&para;<br>has provided all the process that is due in depriving an&para;<br>individual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both&para;<br>pre- and post-deprivation process. See Cleveland Bd. of&para;<br>Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 547, n. 12 (1985) (“[T]he&para;<br>existence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the&para;<br>necessary scope of pretermination procedures”); see also&para;<br>National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax&para;<br>Comm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 587 (1995); Mathews v. Eldridge,&para;<br>424 U. S. 319, 349 (1976). There is no principled reason&para;<br>this Court should refuse to allow §1983 suits to challenge&para;<br>part of this process—the trial proceedings—but bless the&para;<br>use of §1983 to challenge other parts.&para;<br>Collateral review procedures are, of course, “not part of&para;<br>the criminal proceeding itself.” Pennsylvania v. Finley,&para;<br>481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987). But like trial and direct appel&para;<br>late procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Trial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner;&para;<br>appellate procedures review the validity of that conviction&para;<br>before it becomes final; and collateral review procedures&para;<br>permit challenge to the conviction after it is final. For&para;<br>purposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds&para;<br>of §1983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all&para;<br>constitutional challenges to procedures concerning the&para;<br>validity of a conviction. See Heck, supra, at 491 (THOMAS,&para;<br>J., concurring) (“[I]t is proper for the Court to devise&para;<br>limitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between&para;<br>habeas and §1983], provided that it does so in a principled&para;<br>fashion”).&para;<br>Second, “principles of federalism and comity [are] at&para;<br>stake” when federal courts review state collateral review&para;<br>procedures, just as when they review state trial proce&para;<br>dures. Osborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring)&para;<br>(slip op., at 2). An attack in federal court on any “state&para;<br>judicial action” concerning a state conviction must proceed&para;<br>with “proper respect for state functions,” because the&para;<br>federal courts are being asked to “tr[y] the regularity of&para;<br>proceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.”&para;<br>Preiser, 411 U. S., at 491 (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>emphasis omitted).&para;<br>Because of these concerns for federal-state comity,&para;<br>Congress has strictly limited the procedures for federal&para;<br>habeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas&para;<br>decisions. Congress requires that before a state prisoner&para;<br>may seek relief in federal court, he must “exhaus[t] the&para;<br>remedies available in the courts of the State.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(b)(1)(A). And state habeas determinations receive&para;<br>significant deference in subsequent federal habeas pro&para;<br>ceedings. §2254(d). These requirements ensure that the&para;<br>state courts have the first opportunity to correct any error&para;<br>with a state conviction and that their rulings receive due&para;<br>respect in subsequent federal challenges.&para;<br>By bringing a procedural challenge under §1983, Skin&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v. SWITZER&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner&para;<br>has never presented his current challenge to Texas’ proce&para;<br>dures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allow&para;<br>ing Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas&para;<br>procedures instead of an attack on state habeas results&para;<br>undercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have&para;<br>placed on federal review of state convictions. See Osborne,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). To&para;<br>allege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on&para;<br>collateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas&para;<br>petition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions&para;<br>and deferential review. But a successful challenge to&para;<br>Texas’ collateral review procedures under §1983 would&para;<br>impeach the result of collateral review without complying&para;<br>with any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.&para;<br>The majority contends that its decision will not “spill&para;<br>over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83&para;<br>(1963).” Ante, at 13; but cf. Osborne, supra, at ___–___&para;<br>(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3–5). In truth, the&para;<br>majority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state&para;<br>habeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under §1983: After&para;<br>state habeas is denied, file a §1983 suit challenging the&para;<br>state habeas process rather than the result. What pris&para;<br>oner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the&para;<br>apple?3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Nor is there any reason to believe that the Court’s holding will be&para;<br>cabined to collateral review procedures. The Court does not discuss&para;<br>whether a State’s direct review process may be subject to challenge&para;<br>under §1983, but it suggests no principled distinction between direct&para;<br>and collateral review. This risks transforming §1983 into a vehicle for&para;<br>direct criminal appeals. Cf. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 486&para;<br>(1994). Just as any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort&para;<br>to §1983 and challenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will&para;<br>unsuccessful appellants turn to §1983 to challenge the state appellate&para;<br>procedures.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>The majority relies on Dotson to reach its conclusion. In&para;<br>that case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in&para;<br>state parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and&para;<br>“a new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally&para;<br>proper procedures.” 544 U. S., at 77. We found the claims&para;<br>cognizable under §1983.&para;<br>Dotson does not control this case. Unlike state collateral&para;<br>review, parole does not evaluate the validity of the under&para;<br>lying state conviction or sentence. Collateral review per&para;<br>mits prisoners to “attack their final convictions.” Osborne,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). In&para;<br>contrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a&para;<br>prisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the&para;<br>underlying conviction or sentence. Whatever the correct&para;<br>ness of Dotson, parole procedures do not review the valid&para;<br>ity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason, permitting&para;<br>review of parole procedures does not similarly risk trans&para;<br>forming §1983 into a vehicle for “challenging the validity&para;<br>of outstanding criminal judgments.” Heck, 512 U. S., at&para;<br>486.&para;<br>Contrary to the majority’s contention, Dotson did not&para;<br>reduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under&para;<br>§1983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner’s claim&para;<br>would “necessarily spell speedier release.” See ante, at 11,&para;<br>12, n. 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).4 As we&para;<br>recognized in Heck, evaluating the boundaries of §1983 is&para;<br>not a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief&para;<br>sought was not “speedier release,” we inquired further&para;<br>and returned to first principles to determine that the chal&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Because parole procedures are unrelated to the validity of a con&para;<br>viction, a “necessarily spell speedier release” test may sufficiently&para;<br>summarize the analysis of §1983 challenges to parole procedures. But&para;<br>“necessarily spell speedier release” cannot be the only limit when a&para;<br>prisoner challenges procedures used to review the validity of the&para;<br>underlying conviction.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SKINNER v. SWITZER&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lenge in that case was not cognizable under §1983.5 See&para;<br>512 U. S., at 486. Dotson does not suggest that the Heck&para;<br>approach, which I would continue to follow here, was&para;<br>incorrect.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>This Court has struggled to limit §1983 and prevent it&para;<br>from intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In&para;<br>crafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seek&para;<br>ing “immediate or speedier release” from confinement fall&para;<br>outside its scope. Dotson, supra, at 82. We found another&para;<br>limit when faced with a civil action in which “a judgment&para;<br>in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the inva&para;<br>lidity of his conviction or sentence.” Heck, supra, at 487.&para;<br>This case calls for yet another: due process challenges to&para;<br>state procedures used to review the validity of a conviction&para;<br>or sentence. Under that rule, Skinner’s claim is not cogni&para;<br>zable under §1983, and the judgment of the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals should be affirmed.
