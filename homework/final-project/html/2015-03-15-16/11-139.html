The Court recognized&para;<br>that such an overstatement wrongly understates a taxpayer’s income,&para;<br>but concluded that the phrase “omits . . . an amount” limited the&para;<br>statute’s scope to situations in which specific receipts are left out of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

The Court also noted that while the&para;<br>statute’s language was not “unambiguous,” id., at 33, the statutory&para;<br>history showed that Congress intended to restrict the extended limitations period to situations that did not include overstatements of basis. Finally, the Court found its conclusion “in harmony with the&para;<br>unambiguous language of §6501(e)(1)(A),” id., at 37, the provision&para;<br>enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and applicable&para;<br>here.

HOME CONCRETE&para;<br>&amp; SUPPLY, LLC, ET AL.&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>[April 25, 2012]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court,&para;<br>except as to Part IV–C.&para;<br>Ordinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency&para;<br>against a taxpayer within “3 years after the return was&para;<br>filed.” 26 U. S. C. §6501(a) (2000 ed.). The 3-year period&para;<br>is extended to 6 years, however, when a taxpayer “omits&para;<br>from gross income an amount properly includible therein&para;<br>which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross&para;<br>income stated in the return.” §6501(e)(1)(A) (emphasis&para;<br>added). The question before us is whether this latter&para;<br>provision applies (and extends the ordinary 3-year limitations period) when the taxpayer overstates his basis in&para;<br>property that he has sold, thereby understating the gain&para;<br>that he received from its sale. Following Colony, Inc. v.&para;<br>Commissioner, 357 U. S. 28 (1958), we hold that the provision does not apply to an overstatement of basis. Hence&para;<br>the 6-year period does not apply.&para;<br>I&para;<br>For present purposes the relevant underlying circumstances are not in dispute. We consequently assume that&para;<br>(1) the respondent taxpayers filed their relevant tax re-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>turns in April 2000; (2) the returns overstated the basis&para;<br>of certain property that the taxpayers had sold; (3) as a&para;<br>result the returns understated the gross income that the&para;<br>taxpayers received from the sale of the property; and&para;<br>(4) the understatement exceeded the statute’s 25% threshold. We also take as undisputed that the Commissioner&para;<br>asserted the relevant deficiency within the extended 6year limitations period, but outside the default 3-year&para;<br>period. Thus, unless the 6-year statute of limitations&para;<br>applies, the Government’s efforts to assert a tax deficiency&para;<br>came too late. Our conclusion—that the extended limitations period does not apply—follows directly from this&para;<br>Court’s earlier decision in Colony.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In Colony this Court interpreted a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the operative language of&para;<br>which is identical to the language now before us. The&para;<br>Commissioner there had determined&para;<br>“that the taxpayer had understated the gross profits&para;<br>on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the ‘basis’ of&para;<br>such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain&para;<br>unallowable items of development expense.” Id., at&para;<br>30.&para;<br>The Commissioner’s assessment came after the ordinary&para;<br>3-year limitations period had run. And, it was consequently timely only if the taxpayer, in the words of the&para;<br>1939 Code, had “omit[ted] from gross income an amount&para;<br>properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return . . . .”&para;<br>26 U. S. C. §275(c) (1940 ed.). The Code provision applicable to this case, adopted in 1954, contains materially&para;<br>indistinguishable language. See §6501(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.)&para;<br>(same, but replacing “per centum” with “percent”). See also&para;<br>Appendix, infra.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In Colony this Court held that taxpayer misstatements,&para;<br>overstating the basis in property, do not fall within the&para;<br>scope of the statute. But the Court recognized the Commissioner’s contrary argument for inclusion. 357 U. S., at&para;<br>32. Then as now, the Code itself defined “gross income” in&para;<br>this context as the difference between gross revenue (often&para;<br>the amount the taxpayer received upon selling the property) and basis (often the amount the taxpayer paid for the&para;<br>property). Compare 26 U. S. C. §§22, 111 (1940 ed.) with&para;<br>§§61(a)(3), 1001(a) (2000 ed.). And, the Commissioner&para;<br>pointed out, an overstatement of basis can diminish the&para;<br>“amount” of the gain just as leaving the item entirely off&para;<br>the return might do. 357 U. S., at 32. Either way, the&para;<br>error wrongly understates the taxpayer’s income.&para;<br>But, the Court added, the Commissioner’s argument did&para;<br>not fully account for the provision’s language, in particular&para;<br>the word “omit.” The key phrase says “omits . . . an&para;<br>amount.” The word “omits” (unlike, say, “reduces” or “understates”) means “ ‘[t]o leave out or unmentioned; not&para;<br>to insert, include, or name.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Webster’s New&para;<br>International Dictionary (2d ed. 1939)). Thus, taken&para;<br>literally, “omit” limits the statute’s scope to situations in&para;<br>which specific receipts or accruals of income are left out&para;<br>of the computation of gross income; to inflate the basis,&para;<br>however, is not to “omit” a specific item, not even of profit.&para;<br>While finding this latter interpretation of the language&para;<br>the “more plausibl[e],” the Court also noted that the language was not “unambiguous.” Colony, 357 U. S., at 33. It&para;<br>then examined various congressional Reports discussing&para;<br>the relevant statutory language. It found in those Reports&para;<br>“persuasive indications that Congress merely had in&para;<br>mind failures to report particular income receipts and&para;<br>accruals, and did not intend the [extended] limitation&para;<br>to apply whenever gross income was understated . . . .”&para;<br>Id., at 35.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>This “history,” the Court said, “shows . . . that the Congress intended an exception to the usual three-year statute of limitations only in the restricted type of situation&para;<br>already described,” a situation that did not include overstatements of basis. Id., at 36.&para;<br>The Court wrote that Congress, in enacting the&para;<br>provision,&para;<br>“manifested no broader purpose than to give the&para;<br>Commissioner an additional two [now three] years to&para;<br>investigate tax returns in cases where, because of a&para;<br>taxpayer’s omission to report some taxable item, the&para;<br>Commissioner is at a special disadvantage . . . [because] the return on its face provides no clue to the existence of the omitted item. . . . [W]hen, as here [i.e.,&para;<br>where the overstatement of basis is at issue], the understatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting&para;<br>an item disclosed on the face of the return the Commissioner is at no such disadvantage . . . whether the&para;<br>error be one affecting ‘gross income’ or one, such as&para;<br>overstated deductions, affecting other parts of the return.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>Finally, the Court noted that Congress had recently&para;<br>enacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. And the&para;<br>Court observed that “the conclusion we reach is in harmony with the unambiguous language of §6501(e)(1)(A),”&para;<br>id., at 37, i.e., the provision relevant in this present case.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In our view, Colony determines the outcome in this case.&para;<br>The provision before us is a 1954 reenactment of the 1939&para;<br>provision that Colony interpreted. The operative language&para;<br>is identical. It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to&para;<br>give the same language here a different interpretation&para;<br>without effectively overruling Colony, a course of action&para;<br>that basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

S. 130, 139 (2008) (“[S]tare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation has special force, for Congress remains&para;<br>free to alter what we have done” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.&para;<br>164, 172–173 (1989).&para;<br>The Government, in an effort to convince us to interpret&para;<br>the operative language before us differently, points to&para;<br>differences in other nearby parts of the 1954 Code. It&para;<br>suggests that these differences counsel in favor of a different interpretation than the one adopted in Colony. For&para;<br>example, the Government points to a new provision,&para;<br>§6501(e)(1)(A)(i), which says:&para;<br>“In the case of a trade or business, the term ‘gross income’ means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services (if such&para;<br>amounts are required to be shown on the return) prior&para;<br>to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.”&para;<br>If the section’s basic phrase “omi[ssion] from gross income”&para;<br>does not apply to overstatements of basis (which is what&para;<br>Colony held), then what need would there be for clause (i),&para;<br>which leads to the same result in a specific subset of&para;<br>cases?&para;<br>And why, the Government adds, does a later paragraph,&para;<br>referring to gifts and estates, speak of a taxpayer who&para;<br>“omits . . . items includible in [the] gross estate”? See&para;<br>§6501(e)(2) (emphasis added). By speaking of “items”&para;<br>there does it not imply that omission of an “amount” covers more than omission of individual items—indeed that&para;<br>it includes overstatements of basis, which, after all, diminish the amount of the profit that should have been reported as gross income?&para;<br>In our view, these points are too fragile to bear the significant argumentative weight the Government seeks to&para;<br>place upon them. For example, at least one plausible&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reason why Congress might have added clause (i) has&para;<br>nothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the&para;<br>general rule. Rather when Congress wrote the 1954 Code&para;<br>(prior to Colony), it did not yet know how the Court would&para;<br>interpret the provision’s operative language. At least one&para;<br>lower court had decided that the provision did not apply to&para;<br>overstatements about the cost of goods that a business&para;<br>later sold. See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner,&para;<br>204 F. 2d 570 (CA3 1953). But see Reis v. Commissioner,&para;<br>142 F. 2d 900, 902–903 (CA6 1944). And Congress could&para;<br>well have wanted to ensure that, come what may in the&para;<br>Supreme Court, Uptegrove’s interpretation would remain&para;<br>the law where a “trade or business” was at issue.&para;<br>Nor does our interpretation leave clause (i) without&para;<br>work to do. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)&para;<br>(noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision “superfluous, void, or insignificant”&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)). That provision also&para;<br>explains how to calculate the denominator for purposes of&para;<br>determining whether a conceded omission amounts to 25%&para;<br>of “gross income.” For example, it tells us that a merchant&para;<br>who fails to include $10,000 of revenue from sold goods&para;<br>has not met the 25% test if total revenue is more than&para;<br>$40,000, regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to&para;<br>acquire those goods. But without clause (i), the general&para;<br>statutory definition of “gross income” requires subtracting&para;<br>the cost from the sales price. See 26 U. S. C. §§61(a)(3),&para;<br>1012. Under such a definition of “gross income,” the calculation would take (1) total revenue from sales, $40,000,&para;<br>minus (2) “the cost of such sales,” say, $25,000. The&para;<br>$10,000 of revenue would thus amount to 67% of the&para;<br>“gross income” of $15,000. And the clause does this work&para;<br>in respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of&para;<br>our interpretation regarding overstatements of basis.&para;<br>The Government’s argument about subsection (e)(2)’s&para;<br>use of the word “item” instead of “amount” is yet weaker.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court in Colony addressed a similar argument about&para;<br>the word “amount.” It wrote:&para;<br>“The Commissioner states that the draftsman’s use&para;<br>of the word ‘amount’ (instead of, for example, ‘item’)&para;<br>suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of&para;<br>the error—that is whether or not gross income was&para;<br>understated by as much as 25%.” 357 U. S., at 32.&para;<br>But the Court, while recognizing the Commissioner’s logic,&para;<br>rejected the argument (and the significance of the word&para;<br>“amount”) as insufficient to prove the Commissioner’s&para;<br>conclusion. And the addition of the word “item” in a different subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive&para;<br>force sufficiently strong to affect our conclusion. The&para;<br>word’s appearance in subsection (e)(2), we concede, is new.&para;<br>But to rely in the case before us on this solitary word&para;<br>change in a different subsection is like hoping that a new&para;<br>batboy will change the outcome of the World Series.&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, the Government points to Treasury Regulation&para;<br>§301.6501(e)–1, which was promulgated in final form in&para;<br>December 2010. See 26 CFR §301.6501(e)–1 (2011). The&para;<br>regulation, as relevant here, departs from Colony and&para;<br>interprets the operative language of the statute in the&para;<br>Government’s favor. The regulation says that “an understated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an&para;<br>omission from gross income.” §301.6501(e)–1(a)(1)(iii). In&para;<br>the Government’s view this new regulation in effect overturns Colony’s interpretation of this statute.&para;<br>The Government points out that the Treasury Regulation constitutes “an agency’s construction of a statute&para;<br>which it administers.” Chevron, U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural&para;<br>Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

Brand X&para;<br>Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982 (2005) (emphasis&para;<br>added). And, as the Government notes, in Colony itself&para;<br>the Court wrote that “it cannot be said that the language&para;<br>is unambiguous.” 357 U. S., at 33. Hence, the Government&para;<br>concludes, Colony cannot govern the outcome in this case.&para;<br>The question, rather, is whether the agency’s construction&para;<br>is a “permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron,&para;<br>supra, at 843. And, since the Government argues that the&para;<br>regulation embodies a reasonable, hence permissible,&para;<br>construction of the statute, the Government believes it&para;<br>must win.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We do not accept this argument. In our view, Colony&para;<br>has already interpreted the statute, and there is no longer&para;<br>any different construction that is consistent with Colony&para;<br>and available for adoption by the agency.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The fatal flaw in the Government’s contrary argument&para;<br>is that it overlooks the reason why Brand X held that a&para;<br>“prior judicial construction,” unless reflecting an “unambiguous” statute, does not trump a different agency construction of that statute. 545 U. S., at 982. The Court&para;<br>reveals that reason when it points out that “it is for agencies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps.” Ibid. The fact that&para;<br>a statute is unambiguous means that there is “no gap for&para;<br>the agency to fill” and thus “no room for agency discre-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Those&para;<br>opinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as&para;<br>that of deciding whether, or when, a particular statute in&para;<br>effect delegates to an agency the power to fill a gap, thereby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a reasonable gap-filling interpretation. Thus, in Chevron the&para;<br>Court said that, when&para;<br>“Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to&para;<br>fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the&para;<br>agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute&para;<br>by regulation. . . . Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit&para;<br>rather than explicit. [But in either instance], a court&para;<br>may not substitute its own construction of a statutory&para;<br>provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the&para;<br>administrator of an agency.” 467 U. S., at 843–844.&para;<br>See also United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229&para;<br>(2001); Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S.&para;<br>735, 741 (1996); INS v.

S. 199, 231 (1974).&para;<br>Chevron and later cases find in unambiguous language&para;<br>a clear sign that Congress did not delegate gap-filling&para;<br>authority to an agency; and they find in ambiguous language at least a presumptive indication that Congress did&para;<br>delegate that gap-filling authority. Thus, in Chevron the&para;<br>Court wrote that a statute’s silence or ambiguity as to&para;<br>a particular issue means that Congress has not “directly&para;<br>addressed the precise question at issue” (thus likely delegating gap-filling power to the agency). 467 U.

There is&para;<br>no reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by&para;<br>Colony reflects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress&para;<br>had delegated gap-filling power to the agency.

And it reached this conclusion despite the fact&para;<br>that, in the years leading up to Colony, the Commissioner&para;<br>had consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit&para;<br>courts. See, e.g., Uptegrove, 204 F. 2d 570; Reis, 142 F. 2d&para;<br>900; Goodenow v. Commisioner, 238 F. 2d 20 (CA8 1956);&para;<br>American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 386&para;<br>(1942). Cf. Slaff v. Commisioner, 220 F. 2d 65 (CA9 1955);&para;<br>Davis v. Hightower, 230 F. 2d 549 (CA5 1956). Thus, the&para;<br>Court was aware it was rejecting the expert opinion of the&para;<br>Commissioner of Internal Revenue. And finally, after&para;<br>completing its analysis, Colony found its interpretation of&para;<br>the 1939 Code “in harmony with the [now] unambiguous&para;<br>language” of the 1954 Code, which at a minimum suggests&para;<br>that the Court saw nothing in the 1954 Code as inconsistent with its conclusion. 357 U. S., at 37.&para;<br>It may be that judges today would use other methods to&para;<br>determine whether Congress left a gap to fill. But that&para;<br>is beside the point. The question is whether the Court in&para;<br>Colony concluded that the statute left such a gap. And, in&para;<br>our view, the opinion (written by Justice Harlan for the&para;<br>Court) makes clear that it did not.&para;<br>Given principles of stare decisis, we must follow that&para;<br>interpretation. And there being no gap to fill, the Government’s gap-filling regulation cannot change Colony’s&para;<br>interpretation of the statute. We agree with the taxpayer&para;<br>that overstatements of basis, and the resulting understatement of gross income, do not trigger the extended&para;<br>limitations period of §6501(e)(1)(A).

In my view, that cannot be: “Once a court has&para;<br>decided upon its de novo construction of the statute, there&para;<br>no longer is a different construction that is consistent with&para;<br>the court’s holding and available for adoption by the agency.” National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v.

That view, of course, did not carry the&para;<br>day in Brand X, and the Government quite reasonably&para;<br>relies on the Brand X majority’s innovative pronouncement that a “court’s prior judicial construction of a statute&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chev­&para;<br>ron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its&para;<br>construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the&para;<br>statute.” Id., at 982.&para;<br>In cases decided pre-Brand X, the Court had no inkling&para;<br>that it must utter the magic words “ambiguous” or “unambiguous” in order to (poof !) expand or abridge executive power, and (poof !) enable or disable administrative&para;<br>contradiction of the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Court&para;<br>was unaware of even the utility (much less the necessity)&para;<br>of making the ambiguous/nonambiguous determination in&para;<br>cases decided pre-Chevron, before that opinion made the&para;<br>so-called “Step 1” determination of ambiguity vel non a&para;<br>customary (though hardly mandatory1) part of judicialreview analysis. For many of those earlier cases, therefore, it will be incredibly difficult to determine whether the&para;<br>decision purported to be giving meaning to an ambiguous,&para;<br>or rather an unambiguous, statute.&para;<br>Thus, one would have thought that the Brand X majority would breathe a sigh of relief in the present case, involving a pre-Chevron opinion that (mirabile dictu) makes&para;<br>it inescapably clear that the Court thought the statute&para;<br>ambiguous: “It cannot be said that the language is unam­&para;<br>biguous.” Colony, supra, at 33 (emphasis added). As&para;<br>today’s plurality opinion explains, Colony “said that the&para;<br>taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument,”&para;<br>ante, at 10 (emphasis added)—not what Brand X requires&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 “Step 1” has never been an essential part of Chevron analysis.&para;<br>Whether a particular statute is ambiguous makes no difference if the&para;<br>interpretation adopted by the agency is clearly reasonable—and it&para;<br>would be a waste of time to conduct that inquiry. See Entergy Corp. v.&para;<br>Riverkeeper, Inc., 556 U. S. 208, 218, and n. 4 (2009). The same would&para;<br>be true if the agency interpretation is clearly beyond the scope of any&para;<br>conceivable ambiguity. It does not matter whether the word “yellow” is&para;<br>ambiguous when the agency has interpreted it to mean “purple.” See&para;<br>Stephenson &amp; Vermeule, Chevron Has Only One Step, 95 Va. L.

See United States v. Mead&para;<br>Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 245–246 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review&para;<br>of Agency Action, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 1443, 1457–1475&para;<br>(2005). Of course there is no doubt that, with regard to&para;<br>the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Department&para;<br>satisfies the Mead requirement of some indication “that&para;<br>Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to&para;<br>make rules carrying the force of law.” 533 U.

S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 11–12). But in order to evade Brand X and yet&para;<br>reaffirm Colony, the plurality would add yet another lopsided story to the ugly and improbable structure that our&para;<br>law of administrative review has become: To trigger the&para;<br>Brand X power of an authorized “gap-filling” agency to&para;<br>give content to an ambiguous text, a pre-Chevron determination that language is ambiguous does not alone suffice;&para;<br>the pre-Chevron Court must in addition have found that&para;<br>Congress wanted the particular ambiguity in question to&para;<br>be resolved by the agency. And here, today’s plurality&para;<br>opinion finds, “[t]here is no reason to believe that the&para;<br>linguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a postChevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gapfilling power to the agency.” Ante, at 10. The notion,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>seemingly, is that post-Chevron a finding of ambiguity is&para;<br>accompanied by a finding of agency authority to resolve&para;<br>the ambiguity, but pre-Chevron that was not so. The&para;<br>premise is false. Post-Chevron cases do not “conclude”&para;<br>that Congress wanted the particular ambiguity resolved&para;<br>by the agency; that is simply the legal effect of ambiguity—a legal effect that should obtain whenever the&para;<br>language is in fact (as Colony found) ambiguous.&para;<br>Does the plurality feel that it ought not give effect to&para;<br>Colony’s determination of ambiguity because the Court did&para;<br>not know, in that era, the importance of that determination—that it would empower the agency to (in effect)&para;<br>revise the Court’s determination of statutory meaning?&para;<br>But as I suggested earlier, that was an ignorance which all&para;<br>of our cases shared not just pre-Chevron, but pre-Brand X.&para;<br>Before then it did not really matter whether the Court was&para;<br>resolving an ambiguity or setting forth the statute’s clear&para;<br>meaning. The opinion might (or might not) advert to&para;<br>that point in the course of its analysis, but either way&para;<br>the Court’s interpretation of the statute would be the law.&para;<br>So it is no small number of still-authoritative cases&para;<br>that today’s plurality opinion would exile to the Land of&para;<br>Uncertainty.&para;<br>Perhaps sensing the fragility of its new approach, the&para;<br>plurality opinion then pivots (as the à la mode vernacular&para;<br>has it)—from focusing on whether Colony concluded that&para;<br>there was gap-filling authority to focusing on whether&para;<br>Colony concluded that there was any gap to be filled: “The&para;<br>question is whether the Court in Colony concluded that&para;<br>the statute left such a gap. And, in our view, the opinion&para;<br>. . . makes clear that it did not.” Ante, at 11. How does the&para;<br>plurality know this? Because Justice Harlan’s opinion&para;<br>“said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual&para;<br>argument”; because it found that legislative history indicated “that Congress intended overstatements of basis to&para;<br>fall outside the statute’s scope”; because it concluded that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the Commissioner’s interpretation would “create a patent&para;<br>incongruity in the tax law”; and because it found its interpretation “in harmony with the [now] unambiguous language” of the 1954 Code. Ante, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted). But these are the sorts of arguments&para;<br>that courts always use in resolving ambiguities. They do&para;<br>not prove that no ambiguity existed, unless one believes&para;<br>that an ambiguity resolved is an ambiguity that never&para;<br>existed in the first place. Colony said unambiguously that&para;<br>the text was ambiguous, and that should be an end of the&para;<br>matter—unless one wants simply to deny stare decisis&para;<br>effect to Colony as a pre-Chevron decision.&para;<br>Rather than making our judicial-review jurisprudence&para;<br>curiouser and curiouser, the Court should abandon the&para;<br>opinion that produces these contortions, Brand X. I join&para;<br>the judgment announced by the Court because it is indisputable that Colony resolved the construction of the statutory language at issue here, and that construction must&para;<br>therefore control. And I join the Court’s opinion except for&para;<br>Part IV–C.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>I must add a word about the peroration of the dissent,&para;<br>which asserts that “[o]ur legal system presumes there&para;<br>will be continuing dialogue among the three branches of&para;<br>Government on questions of statutory interpretation and&para;<br>application,” and that the “constructive discourse,” “ ‘convers[ations],’ ” and “instructive exchanges” would be “foreclosed by an insistence on adhering to earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new, relevant statutory&para;<br>amendments.” Post, at 7–8 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). This&para;<br>passage is reminiscent of Professor K. C. Davis’s vision&para;<br>that administrative procedure is developed by “a partnership between legislators and judges,” who “working [as]&para;<br>partners produce better law than legislators alone could&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>possibly produce.”2 That romantic, judge-empowering&para;<br>image was obliterated by this Court in Vermont Yankee&para;<br>Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun­&para;<br>cil, Inc., 435 U. S. 519 (1978), which held that Congress&para;<br>prescribes and we obey, with no discretion to add to the&para;<br>administrative procedures that Congress has created. It&para;<br>seems to me that the dissent’s vision of a troika partnership (legislative-executive-judicial) is a similar mirage.&para;<br>The discourse, conversation, and exchange that the dissent perceives is peculiarly one-sided. Congress prescribes; and where Congress’s prescription is ambiguous&para;<br>the Executive can (within the scope of the ambiguity)&para;<br>clarify that prescription; and if the product is constitutional the courts obey. I hardly think it amounts to a&para;<br>“discourse” that Congress or (as this Court would allow in&para;<br>its Brand X decision) the Executive can change its prescription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant.&para;<br>What is needed for the system to work is that Congress,&para;<br>the Executive, and the private parties subject to their&para;<br>dispositions, be able to predict the meaning that the courts&para;<br>will give to their instructions. That goal would be obstructed if the judicially established meaning of a technical legal term used in a very specific context could be&para;<br>overturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble&para;<br>as those asserted here.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>K.

Although the main text of the statute remained the same,&para;<br>Congress added new provisions leading to the permissible&para;<br>conclusion that it would have a different meaning going&para;<br>forward.

HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>concluding the Department’s interpretation is permissible,&para;<br>and for this respectful dissent, now follows.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The statute at issue in Colony, 26 U. S. C. §275(c) (1940&para;<br>ed.), was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of&para;<br>1939. It provided for a longer period of limitations if&para;<br>the Government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer&para;<br>who had “omit[ted] from gross income an amount . . . in&para;<br>excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income&para;<br>stated in the return.”&para;<br>There was disagreement in the courts about the meaning of this provision in the statute as first enacted. The&para;<br>Tax Court of the United States, and the United States&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that an overstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross&para;<br>income and could trigger the extended limitations period.&para;<br>See, e.g., Reis v. Commissioner, 142 F. 2d 900, 902–903&para;<br>(1944); American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C.&para;<br>386 (1942). The United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Third Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case&para;<br>where a corporation misreported its income after inflating&para;<br>the cost of goods it sold from inventory. See Uptegrove&para;<br>Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 204 F. 2d 570, 571–573&para;<br>(1953). In the Third Circuit’s view there could be an&para;<br>omission only where the taxpayer had left an entire “item&para;<br>of gain out of his computation of gross income.” Id., at&para;<br>571. In the Colony decision, issued in 1958, this Court&para;<br>resolved that dispute against the Government. Acknowledging that “it cannot be said that the language is unambiguous,” 357 U. S., at 33, and relying in large part on the&para;<br>legislative history of the 1939 Code, the Court concluded&para;<br>that the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an&para;<br>omission from gross income under §275(c).&para;<br>If the Government is to prevail in the instant case the&para;<br>regulation in question must be a proper implementation of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the same language the Court considered in Colony; but the&para;<br>statutory interpretation issue here cannot be resolved, and&para;<br>the Colony decision cannot be deemed controlling, without&para;<br>first considering the inferences that should be drawn from&para;<br>added statutory text. The additional language was not&para;<br>part of the statute that governed the taxpayer’s liability in&para;<br>Colony, and the Court did not consider it in that case.&para;<br>Congress revised the Internal Revenue Code in 1954,&para;<br>several years before Colony was decided but after the tax&para;<br>years in question in that case. Although the interpretation adopted by the Court in Colony can be a proper beginning point for the interpretation of the revised statute,&para;<br>it ought not to be the end.&para;<br>The central language of the new provision remained&para;<br>the same as the old, with the longer period of limitations&para;<br>still applicable where a taxpayer had “omit[ted] from gross&para;<br>income an amount . . . in excess of 25 per[cent] of the&para;<br>amount of gross income stated in the return.” In Colony,&para;<br>however, the Court left open whether Congress had nonetheless “manifested an intention to clarify or to change the&para;<br>1939 Code.” Id., at 37. The 1954 revisions, of course,&para;<br>could not provide a direct response to Colony, which had&para;<br>not yet been decided. But there were indications that,&para;<br>whatever the earlier version of the statute had meant,&para;<br>Congress expected that the overstatement of basis would&para;<br>be considered an omission from gross income as a general&para;<br>rule going forward.&para;<br>For example, the new law created a special exception for&para;<br>businesses by defining their gross income to be “the total&para;<br>of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods&para;<br>or services” without factoring in “the cost of such sales or&para;<br>services.” 26 U. S. C. §6501(e)(1)(A)(i) (1958 ed.) (currently §6501(e)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)). The principal purpose of this provision, perhaps motivated by the&para;<br>facts in the Third Circuit’s Uptegrove decision, seems to have&para;<br>been to ensure that the extended statute of limitations&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

There&para;<br>are, after all, unique complexities involved in calculating&para;<br>inventory costs. See, e.g., O. Whittington &amp; K. Pany,&para;<br>Principles of Auditing and Other Assurance Services 488&para;<br>(15th ed. 2006) (“The audit of inventories presents the&para;<br>auditors with significant risk because: (a) they often represent a very substantial portion of current assets, (b)&para;<br>numerous valuation methods are used for inventories, (c)&para;<br>the valuation of inventories directly affects cost of goods&para;<br>sold, and (d) the determination of inventory quality, condition, and value is inherently complex”); see also Internal&para;<br>Revenue Service, Publication 538, Accounting Periods and&para;<br>Methods 17 (rev. Mar. 2008) (discussing methods for&para;<br>identifying the cost of items in inventory). Congress&para;<br>sought fit to make clear that errors in these kinds of calculations would not extend the limitations period.&para;<br>Colony itself might be classified as a special “business&para;<br>inventory” case. Unlike the taxpayers here, the taxpayer&para;<br>in Colony claimed to be a business with income from the&para;<br>sale of goods, though the “goods” it held for sale were real&para;<br>estate lots. See Intermountain Ins. Serv. of Vail v. Commissioner, 650 F. 3d 691, 703 (CADC 2011) (Tatel, J.)&para;<br>(“Colony described itself as a taxpayer in a trade or business with income from the sale of goods or services—i.e.,&para;<br>as falling within [clause] (i)’s scope had the subsection&para;<br>applied pre-1954 . . .”). The Court, in turn, observed that&para;<br>its construction of the pre-1954 statute in favor of the&para;<br>taxpayer was “in harmony with the unambiguous language of [newly enacted] §6501(e)(1)(A).” 357 U. S., at 37.&para;<br>Clause (i) of the new provision, as just noted, ensured that&para;<br>the extended limitations period would not cover overstated&para;<br>costs of goods sold. The revised statute’s special treatment&para;<br>of these costs suggests that overstatements of basis in&para;<br>other cases could have the effect of extending the limitations period.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>It is also significant that, after 1954, the statute continued to address the omission of a substantial “amount” that&para;<br>should have been included in gross income. In the same&para;<br>round of revisions to the Tax Code, Congress established&para;<br>an extended limitations period in certain cases where&para;<br>“items” had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return.&para;<br>26 U. S. C. §6501(e)(2) (1958 ed.). There is at least some&para;<br>evidence that this term was used at that time to “mak[e]&para;<br>it clear” that the extended limitations period would not&para;<br>apply “merely because of differences between the taxpayer&para;<br>and the Government as to the valuation of property.”&para;<br>Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, Summary of the New Provisions of the Internal&para;<br>Revenue Code of 1954, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 130 (Comm.&para;<br>Print 1955). Congress’s decision not to use the term&para;<br>“items” to achieve the same result when it reenacted the&para;<br>statutory provision at issue is presumed to have been&para;<br>purposeful. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23&para;<br>(1983). This consideration casts further doubt on the&para;<br>premise that the new version of the statute, §6501(e)(1)(A)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV), necessarily has the same meaning as&para;<br>its predecessor.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In the instant case the Court concludes these statutory&para;<br>changes are “too fragile to bear the significant argumentative weight the Government seeks to place upon them.”&para;<br>Ante, at 5. But in this context, the changes are meaningful. Colony made clear that the text of the earlier version&para;<br>of the statute could not be described as unambiguous, although it ultimately concluded that an overstatement of&para;<br>basis was not an omission from gross income. See 357&para;<br>U. S., at 33. The statutory revisions, which were not&para;<br>considered in Colony, may not compel the opposite conclusion under the new statute; but they strongly favor it. As&para;<br>a result, there was room for the Treasury Department to&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>interpret the new provision in that manner. See Chevron&para;<br>U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&para;<br>467 U. S. 837, 843–845 (1984).&para;<br>In an earlier case, and in an unrelated controversy not&para;<br>implicating the Internal Revenue Code, the Court held&para;<br>that a judicial construction of an ambiguous statute did&para;<br>not foreclose an agency’s later, inconsistent interpretation&para;<br>of the same provision. National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,&para;<br>982–983 (2005) (“Only a judicial precedent holding that&para;<br>the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency’s interpretation, and therefore contains no gap for the agency to&para;<br>fill, displaces a conflicting agency construction”). This&para;<br>general rule recognizes that filling gaps left by ambiguities in a statute “involves difficult policy choices that&para;<br>agencies are better equipped to make than courts.” Id., at&para;<br>980. There has been no opportunity to decide whether the&para;<br>analysis would be any different if an agency sought to&para;<br>interpret an ambiguous statute in a way that was inconsistent with this Court’s own, earlier reading of the law.&para;<br>See id., at 1003 (Stevens, J., concurring).&para;<br>These issues are not implicated here. In Colony the&para;<br>Court did interpret the same phrase that must be interpreted in this case. The language was in a predecessor&para;<br>statute, however, and Congress has added new language&para;<br>that, in my view, controls the analysis and should instruct&para;<br>the Court to reach a different outcome today. The Treasury Department’s regulations were promulgated in light of&para;<br>these statutory revisions, which were not at issue in Colony. There is a serious difficulty to insisting, as the Court&para;<br>does today, that an ambiguous provision must continue to&para;<br>be read the same way even after it has been reenacted&para;<br>with additional language suggesting Congress would&para;<br>permit a different interpretation. Agencies with the responsibility and expertise necessary to administer ongoing&para;<br>regulatory schemes should have the latitude and discre-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion to implement their interpretation of provisions reenacted in a new statutory framework. And this is especially&para;<br>so when the new language enacted by Congress seems to&para;<br>favor the very interpretation at issue. The approach taken&para;<br>by the Court instead forecloses later interpretations of a&para;<br>law that has changed in relevant ways. Cf. United States&para;<br>v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 247 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“Worst of all, the majority’s approach will lead&para;<br>to the ossification of large portions of our statutory law.&para;<br>Where Chevron applies, statutory ambiguities remain ambiguities subject to the agency’s ongoing clarification”).&para;<br>The Court goes too far, in my respectful view, in constricting Congress’s ability to leave agencies in charge of filling&para;<br>statutory gaps.&para;<br>Our legal system presumes there will be continuing&para;<br>dialogue among the three branches of Government on&para;<br>questions of statutory interpretation and application. See&para;<br>Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 326 (2004)&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (“Constant, constructive discourse between our courts and our legislatures is an integral and admirable part of the constitutional design”);&para;<br>Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989) (“Our&para;<br>principle of separation of powers anticipates that the&para;<br>coordinate Branches will converse with each other on&para;<br>matters of vital common interest”). In some cases Congress will set out a general principle, to be administered in&para;<br>more detail by an agency in the exercise of its discretion.&para;<br>The agency may be in a proper position to evaluate the&para;<br>best means of implementing the statute in its practical&para;<br>application. Where the agency exceeds its authority, of&para;<br>course, courts must invalidate the regulation. And agency&para;<br>interpretations that lead to unjust or unfair consequences&para;<br>can be corrected, much like disfavored judicial interpretations, by congressional action. These instructive exchanges would be foreclosed by an insistence on adhering&para;<br>to earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE &amp; SUPPLY, LLC&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant statutory amendments. Courts instead should be&para;<br>open to an agency’s adoption of a different interpretation&para;<br>where, as here, Congress has given new instruction by an&para;<br>amended statute.&para;<br>Under the circumstances, the Treasury Department had&para;<br>authority to adopt its reasonable interpretation of the new&para;<br>tax provision at issue. See Mayo Foundation for Medical&para;<br>Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. __, __ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 10). This was also the conclusion reached in&para;<br>well-reasoned opinions issued in several cases before the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals. E.g., Intermountain, 650 F. 3d, at 705–&para;<br>706 (reaching this conclusion “because the Court in Colony&para;<br>never purported to interpret [the new provision]; because&para;<br>[the new provision]’s ‘omits from gross income’ text is at&para;<br>least ambiguous, if not best read to include overstatements of basis; and because neither the section’s structure&para;<br>nor its [history and context] removes this ambiguity”).&para;<br>The Department’s clarification of an ambiguous statute,&para;<br>applicable to these taxpayers, did not upset legitimate&para;<br>settled expectations. Given the statutory changes described above, taxpayers had reason to question whether&para;<br>Colony’s holding extended to the revised §6501(e)(1). See,&para;<br>e.g., CC &amp; F Western Operations L. P. v. Commissioner,&para;<br>273 F. 3d 402, 406, n. 2 (CA1 2001) (“Whether Colony’s&para;<br>main holding carries over to section 6501(e)(1) is at least&para;<br>doubtful”). Having worked no change in the law, and&para;<br>instead having interpreted a statutory provision without&para;<br>an established meaning, the Department’s regulation does&para;<br>not have an impermissible retroactive effect. Cf. Smiley v.&para;<br>Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741, 744,&para;<br>n. 3 (1996) (rejecting retroactivity argument); Manhattan&para;<br>Gen. Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, 297 U.
