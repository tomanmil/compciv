When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.&para;<br>Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses, but was barred from doing so by §3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which amended the Dictionary Act—a&para;<br>law providing rules of construction for over 1,000 federal laws and&para;<br>the whole realm of federal regulations—to define “marriage” and&para;<br>“spouse” as excluding same-sex partners. Windsor paid $363,053 in&para;<br>estate taxes and sought a refund, which the Internal Revenue Service&para;<br>denied. Windsor brought this refund suit, contending that DOMA violates the principles of equal protection incorporated in the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. While the suit was pending, the Attorney General notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would no longer defend §3’s constitutionality. In response, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House of&para;<br>Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to defend §3’s&para;<br>constitutionality. The District Court permitted the intervention. On&para;<br>the merits, the court ruled against the United States, finding §3 unconstitutional and ordering the Treasury to refund Windsor’s tax&para;<br>with interest. The Second Circuit affirmed. The United States has&para;<br>not complied with the judgment.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.&para;<br>This case clearly presented a concrete disagreement between opposing parties that was suitable for judicial resolution in the District&para;<br>Court, but the Executive’s decision not to defend §3’s constitutionali-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ty in court while continuing to deny refunds and assess deficiencies&para;<br>introduces a complication. Given the Government’s concession, amicus contends, once the District Court ordered the refund, the case&para;<br>should have ended and the appeal been dismissed. But this argument elides the distinction between Article III’s jurisdictional requirements and the prudential limits on its exercise, which are “essentially matters of judicial self-governance.” Warth v. Seldin, 422&para;<br>U. S. 490, 500. Here, the United States retains a stake sufficient to&para;<br>support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in this Court. The refund it was ordered to pay Windsor is “a real and immediate economic injury,” Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S.&para;<br>587, 599, even if the Executive disagrees with §3 of DOMA. Windsor’s ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay&para;<br>thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.&para;<br>Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919.&para;<br>Prudential considerations, however, demand that there be “concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon&para;<br>which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.” Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204. Unlike Article&para;<br>III requirements—which must be satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is appropriate—prudential factors that counsel&para;<br>against hearing this case are subject to “countervailing considerations [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.” Warth, supra, at 500–501. One such&para;<br>consideration is the extent to which adversarial presentation of the&para;<br>issues is ensured by the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with vigor the legislative act’s constitutionality. See Chadha,&para;<br>supra, at 940. Here, BLAG’s substantial adversarial argument for&para;<br>§3’s constitutionality satisfies prudential concerns that otherwise&para;<br>might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision with which&para;<br>the principal parties agree. This conclusion does not mean that it is&para;<br>appropriate for the Executive as a routine exercise to challenge statutes in court instead of making the case to Congress for amendment&para;<br>or repeal. But this case is not routine, and BLAG’s capable defense&para;<br>ensures that the prudential issues do not cloud the merits question,&para;<br>which is of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to&para;<br>hundreds of thousands of persons. Pp. 5–13.&para;<br>2. DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the equal liberty of&para;<br>persons that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 13–26.&para;<br>(a) By history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the&para;<br>separate States. Congress has enacted discrete statutes to regulate&para;<br>the meaning of marriage in order to further federal policy, but&para;<br>DOMA, with a directive applicable to over 1,000 federal statutes and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the whole realm of federal regulations, has a far greater reach. Its&para;<br>operation is also directed to a class of persons that the laws of New&para;<br>York, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect. Assessing the&para;<br>validity of that intervention requires discussing the historical and&para;<br>traditional extent of state power and authority over marriage.&para;<br>Subject to certain constitutional guarantees, see, e.g., Loving v.&para;<br>Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, “regulation of domestic relations” is “an area&para;<br>that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the&para;<br>States,” Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 404. The significance of state&para;<br>responsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to&para;<br>the Nation’s beginning; for “when the Constitution was adopted the&para;<br>common understanding was that the domestic relations of husband&para;<br>and wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States,”&para;<br>Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 U. S. 379, 383–384. Marriage laws&para;<br>may vary from State to State, but they are consistent within each&para;<br>State.&para;<br>DOMA rejects this long-established precept. The State’s decision&para;<br>to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a&para;<br>dignity and status of immense import. But the Federal Government&para;<br>uses the state-defined class for the opposite purpose—to impose restrictions and disabilities. The question is whether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty&para;<br>protected by the Fifth Amendment, since what New York treats as&para;<br>alike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure the&para;<br>same class the State seeks to protect. New York’s actions were a&para;<br>proper exercise of its sovereign authority. They reflect both the&para;<br>community’s considered perspective on the historical roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning&para;<br>of equality. Pp. 13–20.&para;<br>(b) By seeking to injure the very class New York seeks to protect,&para;<br>DOMA violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government. The Constitution’s guarantee of&para;<br>equality “must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot” justify disparate&para;<br>treatment of that group. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413&para;<br>U. S. 528, 534–535. DOMA cannot survive under these principles.&para;<br>Its unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting&para;<br>state definitions of marriage operates to deprive same-sex couples of&para;<br>the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of&para;<br>their marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose&para;<br>and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state&para;<br>law. DOMA’s avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a&para;<br>disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter&para;<br>into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of the States.&para;<br>DOMA’s history of enactment and its own text demonstrate that&para;<br>interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, conferred&para;<br>by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than&para;<br>an incidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence. BLAG’s&para;<br>arguments are just as candid about the congressional purpose.&para;<br>DOMA’s operation in practice confirms this purpose. It frustrates&para;<br>New York’s objective of eliminating inequality by writing inequality&para;<br>into the entire United States Code.&para;<br>DOMA’s principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of&para;<br>state-sanctioned marriages. It contrives to deprive some couples&para;<br>married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights&para;<br>and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes&para;<br>within the same State. It also forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of&para;<br>federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic&para;<br>personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and&para;<br>protect.

Edith&para;<br>Windsor and Thea Spyer returned to their home in New&para;<br>York City. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire&para;<br>estate to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the estate tax&para;<br>exemption for surviving spouses. She was barred from&para;<br>doing so, however, by a federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, which excludes a same-sex partner from the&para;<br>definition of “spouse” as that term is used in federal statutes. Windsor paid the taxes but filed suit to challenge&para;<br>the constitutionality of this provision. The United States&para;<br>District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled that this&para;<br>portion of the statute is unconstitutional and ordered the&para;<br>United States to pay Windsor a refund. This Court granted&para;<br>certiorari and now affirms the judgment in Windsor’s&para;<br>favor.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1996, as some States were beginning to consider the&para;<br>concept of same-sex marriage, see, e.g., Baehr v. Lewin, 74&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Haw. 530, 852 P. 2d 44 (1993), and before any State had&para;<br>acted to permit it, Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 110 Stat. 2419. DOMA contains two&para;<br>operative sections: Section 2, which has not been challenged here, allows States to refuse to recognize same-sex&para;<br>marriages performed under the laws of other States. See&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1738C.&para;<br>Section 3 is at issue here. It amends the Dictionary Act&para;<br>in Title 1, §7, of the United States Code to provide a federal definition of “marriage” and “spouse.” Section 3 of&para;<br>DOMA provides as follows:&para;<br>“In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of&para;<br>the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the&para;<br>United States, the word ‘marriage’ means only a&para;<br>legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a&para;<br>person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.”&para;<br>1 U. S. C. §7.&para;<br>The definitional provision does not by its terms forbid&para;<br>States from enacting laws permitting same-sex marriages&para;<br>or civil unions or providing state benefits to residents in&para;<br>that status. The enactment’s comprehensive definition of&para;<br>marriage for purposes of all federal statutes and other&para;<br>regulations or directives covered by its terms, however,&para;<br>does control over 1,000 federal laws in which marital or&para;<br>spousal status is addressed as a matter of federal law. See&para;<br>GAO, D. Shah, Defense of Marriage Act: Update to Prior&para;<br>Report 1 (GAO–04–353R, 2004).&para;<br>Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York City in&para;<br>1963 and began a long-term relationship. Windsor and&para;<br>Spyer registered as domestic partners when New York&para;<br>City gave that right to same-sex couples in 1993. Concerned about Spyer’s health, the couple made the 2007 trip&para;<br>to Canada for their marriage, but they continued to reside&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

See 699 F. 3d 169,&para;<br>177–178 (CA2 2012).&para;<br>Spyer died in February 2009, and left her entire estate&para;<br>to Windsor. Because DOMA denies federal recognition to&para;<br>same-sex spouses, Windsor did not qualify for the marital&para;<br>exemption from the federal estate tax, which excludes&para;<br>from taxation “any interest in property which passes or&para;<br>has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse.” 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §2056(a). Windsor paid $363,053 in estate taxes&para;<br>and sought a refund. The Internal Revenue Service denied the refund, concluding that, under DOMA, Windsor&para;<br>was not a “surviving spouse.”&para;<br>Windsor commenced&para;<br>this refund suit in the United States District Court for&para;<br>the Southern District of New York.&para;<br>She contended&para;<br>that DOMA violates the guarantee of equal protection,&para;<br>as applied to the Federal Government through the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment.&para;<br>While the tax refund suit was pending, the Attorney&para;<br>General of the United States notified the Speaker of the&para;<br>House of Representatives, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §530D,&para;<br>that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the&para;<br>constitutionality of DOMA’s §3. Noting that “the Department has previously defended DOMA against . . . challenges involving legally married same-sex couples,” App.&para;<br>184, the Attorney General informed Congress that “the&para;<br>President has concluded that given a number of factors,&para;<br>including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to&para;<br>a heightened standard of scrutiny.” Id., at 191. The Department of Justice has submitted many §530D letters&para;<br>over the years refusing to defend laws it deems unconstitutional, when, for instance, a federal court has rejected&para;<br>the Government’s defense of a statute and has issued a&para;<br>judgment against it. This case is unusual, however, because the §530D letter was not preceded by an adverse&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>judgment. The letter instead reflected the Executive’s&para;<br>own conclusion, relying on a definition still being debated&para;<br>and considered in the courts, that heightened equal protection scrutiny should apply to laws that classify on the&para;<br>basis of sexual orientation.&para;<br>Although “the President . . . instructed the Department&para;<br>not to defend the statute in Windsor,” he also decided&para;<br>“that Section 3 will continue to be enforced by the Executive Branch” and that the United States had an “interest&para;<br>in providing Congress a full and fair opportunity to participate in the litigation of those cases.” Id., at 191–193. The&para;<br>stated rationale for this dual-track procedure (determination of unconstitutionality coupled with ongoing enforcement) was to “recogniz[e] the judiciary as the final arbiter&para;<br>of the constitutional claims raised.” Id., at 192.&para;<br>In response to the notice from the Attorney General,&para;<br>the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House&para;<br>of Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to&para;<br>defend the constitutionality of §3 of DOMA. The Department of Justice did not oppose limited intervention by&para;<br>BLAG. The District Court denied BLAG’s motion to enter&para;<br>the suit as of right, on the rationale that the United States&para;<br>already was represented by the Department of Justice.&para;<br>The District Court, however, did grant intervention by&para;<br>BLAG as an interested party. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.&para;<br>24(a)(2).&para;<br>On the merits of the tax refund suit, the District Court&para;<br>ruled against the United States. It held that §3 of DOMA&para;<br>is unconstitutional and ordered the Treasury to refund the&para;<br>tax with interest. Both the Justice Department and BLAG&para;<br>filed notices of appeal, and the Solicitor General filed a&para;<br>petition for certiorari before judgment. Before this Court&para;<br>acted on the petition, the Court of Appeals for the Second&para;<br>Circuit affirmed the District Court’s judgment. It applied&para;<br>heightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual&para;<br>orientation, as both the Department and Windsor had&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>urged. The United States has not complied with the judgment. Windsor has not received her refund, and the Executive Branch continues to enforce §3 of DOMA.&para;<br>In granting certiorari on the question of the constitutionality of §3 of DOMA, the Court requested argument&para;<br>on two additional questions: whether the United States’&para;<br>agreement with Windsor’s legal position precludes further&para;<br>review and whether BLAG has standing to appeal the&para;<br>case. All parties agree that the Court has jurisdiction to&para;<br>decide this case; and, with the case in that framework, the&para;<br>Court appointed Professor Vicki Jackson as amicus curiae&para;<br>to argue the position that the Court lacks jurisdiction to&para;<br>hear the dispute. 568 U. S. ___ (2012). She has ably&para;<br>discharged her duties.&para;<br>In an unrelated case, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has also held §3 of DOMA to be&para;<br>unconstitutional. A petition for certiorari has been filed in&para;<br>that case. Pet. for Cert. in Bipartisan Legal Advisory&para;<br>Group v. Gill, O. T. 2012, No. 12–13.&para;<br>II&para;<br>It is appropriate to begin by addressing whether either&para;<br>the Government or BLAG, or both of them, were entitled&para;<br>to appeal to the Court of Appeals and later to seek certiorari and appear as parties here.&para;<br>There is no dispute that when this case was in the&para;<br>District Court it presented a concrete disagreement between opposing parties, a dispute suitable for judicial&para;<br>resolution. “[A] taxpayer has standing to challenge the&para;<br>collection of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional;&para;<br>being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate&para;<br>economic injury to the individual taxpayer.” Hein v. Free­&para;<br>dom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 599&para;<br>(2007) (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted). Windsor&para;<br>suffered a redressable injury when she was required to&para;<br>pay estate taxes from which, in her view, she was exempt&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>but for the alleged invalidity of §3 of DOMA.&para;<br>The decision of the Executive not to defend the constitutionality of §3 in court while continuing to deny refunds&para;<br>and to assess deficiencies does introduce a complication.&para;<br>Even though the Executive’s current position was announced before the District Court entered its judgment,&para;<br>the Government’s agreement with Windsor’s position would&para;<br>not have deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to&para;<br>entertain and resolve the refund suit; for her injury (failure to obtain a refund allegedly required by law) was&para;<br>concrete, persisting, and unredressed. The Government’s&para;<br>position—agreeing with Windsor’s legal contention but&para;<br>refusing to give it effect—meant that there was a justiciable controversy between the parties, despite what the&para;<br>claimant would find to be an inconsistency in that stance.&para;<br>Windsor, the Government, BLAG, and the amicus appear&para;<br>to agree upon that point. The disagreement is over the&para;<br>standing of the parties, or aspiring parties, to take an&para;<br>appeal in the Court of Appeals and to appear as parties in&para;<br>further proceedings in this Court.&para;<br>The amicus’ position is that, given the Government’s&para;<br>concession that §3 is unconstitutional, once the District&para;<br>Court ordered the refund the case should have ended;&para;<br>and the amicus argues the Court of Appeals should have&para;<br>dismissed the appeal. The amicus submits that once&para;<br>the President agreed with Windsor’s legal position and the&para;<br>District Court issued its judgment, the parties were no&para;<br>longer adverse. From this standpoint the United States&para;<br>was a prevailing party below, just as Windsor was. Accordingly, the amicus reasons, it is inappropriate for this&para;<br>Court to grant certiorari and proceed to rule on the merits;&para;<br>for the United States seeks no redress from the judgment&para;<br>entered against it.&para;<br>This position, however, elides the distinction between&para;<br>two principles: the jurisdictional requirements of Article&para;<br>III and the prudential limits on its exercise. See Warth v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975). The latter are “essentially matters of judicial self-governance.” Id., at 500.&para;<br>The Court has kept these two strands separate: “Article&para;<br>III standing, which enforces the Constitution’s case-orcontroversy requirement, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,&para;<br>504 U. S. 555, 559–562 (1992); and prudential standing,&para;<br>which embodies ‘judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,’ Allen [v. Wright,] 468 U. S.&para;<br>[737,] 751 [(1984)].” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.&para;<br>Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 11–12 (2004).&para;<br>The requirements of Article III standing are familiar:&para;<br>“First, the plaintiff must have suffered an ‘injury in&para;<br>fact’—an invasion of a legally protected interest which&para;<br>is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) ‘actual or&para;<br>imminent, not “conjectural or hypothetical.” ’ Second,&para;<br>there must be a causal connection between the injury&para;<br>and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be&para;<br>‘fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the&para;<br>defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.’&para;<br>Third, it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’ ” Lujan, supra, at 560–561 (footnote and&para;<br>citations omitted).&para;<br>Rules of prudential standing, by contrast, are more flexible “rule[s] . . . of federal appellate practice,” Deposit&para;<br>Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333 (1980),&para;<br>designed to protect the courts from “decid[ing] abstract&para;<br>questions of wide public significance even [when] other&para;<br>governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention&para;<br>may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.” Warth,&para;<br>supra, at 500.&para;<br>In this case the United States retains a stake sufficient&para;<br>to support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in pro-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ceedings before this Court. The judgment in question&para;<br>orders the United States to pay Windsor the refund she&para;<br>seeks. An order directing the Treasury to pay money is “a&para;<br>real and immediate economic injury,” Hein, 551 U. S., at&para;<br>599, indeed as real and immediate as an order directing&para;<br>an individual to pay a tax. That the Executive may welcome this order to pay the refund if it is accompanied by&para;<br>the constitutional ruling it wants does not eliminate the&para;<br>injury to the national Treasury if payment is made, or to&para;<br>the taxpayer if it is not. The judgment orders the United&para;<br>States to pay money that it would not disburse but for the&para;<br>court’s order. The Government of the United States has a&para;<br>valid legal argument that it is injured even if the Executive disagrees with §3 of DOMA, which results in Windsor’s liability for the tax. Windsor’s ongoing claim for&para;<br>funds that the United States refuses to pay thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.&para;<br>It would be a different case if the Executive had taken&para;<br>the further step of paying Windsor the refund to which she&para;<br>was entitled under the District Court’s ruling.&para;<br>This Court confronted a comparable case in INS v.&para;<br>Chadha, 462 U.

The INS,&para;<br>however, continued to abide by the statute, and “the INS&para;<br>brief to the Court of Appeals did not alter the agency’s&para;<br>decision to comply with the House action ordering deportation of Chadha.” Ibid.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>satisfy Article III was defined as a requirement that the&para;<br>Court’s “ ‘decision will have real meaning: if we rule for&para;<br>Chadha, he will not be deported; if we uphold [the statute], the INS will execute its order and deport him.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 939–940 (quoting Chadha v. INS, 634 F. 2d 408, 419&para;<br>(CA9 1980)). This conclusion was not dictum. It was a&para;<br>necessary predicate to the Court’s holding that “prior to&para;<br>Congress’ intervention, there was adequate Art. III adverseness.” 462 U. S., at 939. The holdings of cases are&para;<br>instructive, and the words of Chadha make clear its holding that the refusal of the Executive to provide the relief&para;<br>sought suffices to preserve a justiciable dispute as required by Article III. In short, even where “the Government largely agree[s] with the opposing party on the&para;<br>merits of the controversy,” there is sufficient adverseness&para;<br>and an “adequate basis for jurisdiction in the fact that&para;<br>the Government intended to enforce the challenged law&para;<br>against that party.” Id., at 940, n. 12.&para;<br>It is true that “[a] party who receives all that he has&para;<br>sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and cannot appeal from it.” Roper, supra, at&para;<br>333, see also Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 8) (“As a matter of practice and prudence, we&para;<br>have generally declined to consider cases at the request of&para;<br>a prevailing party, even when the Constitution allowed us&para;<br>to do so”). But this rule “does not have its source in the&para;<br>jurisdictional limitations of Art. III. In an appropriate&para;<br>case, appeal may be permitted . . . at the behest of the&para;<br>party who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that&para;<br>party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the requirements of Art. III.” Roper, supra, at 333–334.&para;<br>While these principles suffice to show that this case&para;<br>presents a justiciable controversy under Article III, the&para;<br>prudential problems inherent in the Executive’s unusual&para;<br>position require some further discussion. The Executive’s&para;<br>agreement with Windsor’s legal argument raises the risk&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that instead of a “ ‘real, earnest and vital controversy,’ ”&para;<br>the Court faces a “friendly, non-adversary, proceeding . . .&para;<br>[in which] ‘a party beaten in the legislature [seeks to]&para;<br>transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality&para;<br>of the legislative act.’ ” Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S.&para;<br>288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (quoting Chicago&para;<br>&amp; Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339,&para;<br>345 (1892)). Even when Article III permits the exercise&para;<br>of federal jurisdiction, prudential considerations demand&para;<br>that the Court insist upon “that concrete adverseness&para;<br>which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the&para;<br>court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.” Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204&para;<br>(1962).&para;<br>There are, of course, reasons to hear a case and issue a&para;<br>ruling even when one party is reluctant to prevail in its&para;<br>position. Unlike Article III requirements—which must&para;<br>be satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is&para;<br>appropriate—the relevant prudential factors that counsel&para;<br>against hearing this case are subject to “countervailing&para;<br>considerations [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.” Warth,&para;<br>422 U. S., at 500–501. One consideration is the extent to&para;<br>which adversarial presentation of the issues is assured by&para;<br>the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with&para;<br>vigor the constitutionality of the legislative act. With&para;<br>respect to this prudential aspect of standing as well, the&para;<br>Chadha Court encountered a similar situation. It noted&para;<br>that “there may be prudential, as opposed to Art. III,&para;<br>concerns about sanctioning the adjudication of [this case]&para;<br>in the absence of any participant supporting the validity of&para;<br>[the statute]. The Court of Appeals properly dispelled any&para;<br>such concerns by inviting and accepting briefs from both&para;<br>Houses of Congress.” 462 U. S., at 940. Chadha was not&para;<br>an anomaly in this respect. The Court adopts the practice&para;<br>of entertaining arguments made by an amicus when the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Solicitor General confesses error with respect to a judgment below, even if the confession is in effect an admission&para;<br>that an Act of Congress is unconstitutional. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000).&para;<br>In the case now before the Court the attorneys for BLAG&para;<br>present a substantial argument for the constitutionality&para;<br>of §3 of DOMA. BLAG’s sharp adversarial presentation of&para;<br>the issues satisfies the prudential concerns that otherwise&para;<br>might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision&para;<br>with which the principal parties agree. Were this Court&para;<br>to hold that prudential rules require it to dismiss the case,&para;<br>and, in consequence, that the Court of Appeals erred in&para;<br>failing to dismiss it as well, extensive litigation would&para;<br>ensue. The district courts in 94 districts throughout the&para;<br>Nation would be without precedential guidance not only in&para;<br>tax refund suits but also in cases involving the whole of&para;<br>DOMA’s sweep involving over 1,000 federal statutes and a&para;<br>myriad of federal regulations. For instance, the opinion of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, addressing the&para;<br>validity of DOMA in a case involving regulations of the&para;<br>Department of Health and Human Services, likely would&para;<br>be vacated with instructions to dismiss, its ruling and&para;<br>guidance also then erased. See Massachusetts v. United&para;<br>States Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F. 3d 1&para;<br>(CA1 2012). Rights and privileges of hundreds of thousands of persons would be adversely affected, pending a&para;<br>case in which all prudential concerns about justiciability&para;<br>are absent. That numerical prediction may not be certain,&para;<br>but it is certain that the cost in judicial resources and&para;<br>expense of litigation for all persons adversely affected&para;<br>would be immense. True, the very extent of DOMA’s&para;<br>mandate means that at some point a case likely would&para;<br>arise without the prudential concerns raised here; but the&para;<br>costs, uncertainties, and alleged harm and injuries likely&para;<br>would continue for a time measured in years before the&para;<br>issue is resolved. In these unusual and urgent circum-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stances, the very term “prudential” counsels that it is a&para;<br>proper exercise of the Court’s responsibility to take jurisdiction. For these reasons, the prudential and Article III&para;<br>requirements are met here; and, as a consequence, the&para;<br>Court need not decide whether BLAG would have standing to challenge the District Court’s ruling and its affirmance in the Court of Appeals on BLAG’s own authority.&para;<br>The Court’s conclusion that this petition may be heard&para;<br>on the merits does not imply that no difficulties would&para;<br>ensue if this were a common practice in ordinary cases.&para;<br>The Executive’s failure to defend the constitutionality of&para;<br>an Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet&para;<br>established in judicial decisions has created a procedural&para;<br>dilemma. On the one hand, as noted, the Government’s&para;<br>agreement with Windsor raises questions about the propriety of entertaining a suit in which it seeks affirmance of&para;<br>an order invalidating a federal law and ordering the United&para;<br>States to pay money. On the other hand, if the Executive’s agreement with a plaintiff that a law is unconstitutional is enough to preclude judicial review, then the&para;<br>Supreme Court’s primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law that has inflicted real injury on a plaintiff who has brought a justiciable legal claim would&para;<br>become only secondary to the President’s. This would&para;<br>undermine the clear dictate of the separation-of-powers&para;<br>principle that “when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, ‘[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the&para;<br>law is.’ ” Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)&para;<br>(slip op., at 7) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,&para;<br>177 (1803)). Similarly, with respect to the legislative&para;<br>power, when Congress has passed a statute and a President has signed it, it poses grave challenges to the separation of powers for the Executive at a particular moment to&para;<br>be able to nullify Congress’ enactment solely on its own&para;<br>initiative and without any determination from the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court’s jurisdictional holding, it must be underscored, does not mean the arguments for dismissing this&para;<br>dispute on prudential grounds lack substance. Yet the&para;<br>difficulty the Executive faces should be acknowledged.&para;<br>When the Executive makes a principled determination&para;<br>that a statute is unconstitutional, it faces a difficult&para;<br>choice. Still, there is no suggestion here that it is appropriate for the Executive as a matter of course to challenge&para;<br>statutes in the judicial forum rather than making the case&para;<br>to Congress for their amendment or repeal. The integrity&para;<br>of the political process would be at risk if difficult constitutional issues were simply referred to the Court as a&para;<br>routine exercise. But this case is not routine. And the&para;<br>capable defense of the law by BLAG ensures that these&para;<br>prudential issues do not cloud the merits question, which&para;<br>is one of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to hundreds of thousands of persons. These circumstances support the Court’s decision to proceed to the&para;<br>merits.&para;<br>III&para;<br>When at first Windsor and Spyer longed to marry, neither New York nor any other State granted them that&para;<br>right. After waiting some years, in 2007 they traveled to&para;<br>Ontario to be married there. It seems fair to conclude&para;<br>that, until recent years, many citizens had not even considered the possibility that two persons of the same sex&para;<br>might aspire to occupy the same status and dignity as that&para;<br>of a man and woman in lawful marriage. For marriage&para;<br>between a man and a woman no doubt had been thought&para;<br>of by most people as essential to the very definition of that&para;<br>term and to its role and function throughout the history of&para;<br>civilization. That belief, for many who long have held it,&para;<br>became even more urgent, more cherished when challenged. For others, however, came the beginnings of a&para;<br>new perspective, a new insight. Accordingly some States&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>concluded that same-sex marriage ought to be given&para;<br>recognition and validity in the law for those same-sex&para;<br>couples who wish to define themselves by their commitment to each other. The limitation of lawful marriage&para;<br>to heterosexual couples, which for centuries had been&para;<br>deemed both necessary and fundamental, came to be&para;<br>seen in New York and certain other States as an unjust&para;<br>exclusion.&para;<br>Slowly at first and then in rapid course, the laws of&para;<br>New York came to acknowledge the urgency of this issue for&para;<br>same-sex couples who wanted to affirm their commitment&para;<br>to one another before their children, their family, their&para;<br>friends, and their community. And so New York recognized same-sex marriages performed elsewhere; and then&para;<br>it later amended its own marriage laws to permit samesex marriage. New York, in common with, as of this writing, 11 other States and the District of Columbia, decided&para;<br>that same-sex couples should have the right to marry and&para;<br>so live with pride in themselves and their union and in a&para;<br>status of equality with all other married persons. After a&para;<br>statewide deliberative process that enabled its citizens to&para;<br>discuss and weigh arguments for and against samesex marriage, New York acted to enlarge the definition of&para;<br>marriage to correct what its citizens and elected representatives perceived to be an injustice that they had not&para;<br>earlier known or understood. See Marriage Equality Act,&para;<br>2011 N. Y. Laws 749 (codified at N. Y. Dom. Rel. Law Ann.&para;<br>§§10–a, 10–b, 13 (West 2013)).&para;<br>Against this background of lawful same-sex marriage&para;<br>in some States, the design, purpose, and effect of DOMA&para;<br>should be considered as the beginning point in deciding&para;<br>whether it is valid under the Constitution. By history and&para;<br>tradition the definition and regulation of marriage, as will&para;<br>be discussed in more detail, has been treated as being&para;<br>within the authority and realm of the separate States. Yet&para;<br>it is further established that Congress, in enacting dis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>crete statutes, can make determinations that bear on&para;<br>marital rights and privileges. Just this Term the Court&para;<br>upheld the authority of the Congress to pre-empt state&para;<br>laws, allowing a former spouse to retain life insurance&para;<br>proceeds under a federal program that gave her priority,&para;<br>because of formal beneficiary designation rules, over the&para;<br>wife by a second marriage who survived the husband.&para;<br>Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___ (2013); see also Ridgway&para;<br>v. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46 (1981); Wissner v. Wissner, 338&para;<br>U. S. 655 (1950). This is one example of the general principle that when the Federal Government acts in the exercise of its own proper authority, it has a wide choice of the&para;<br>mechanisms and means to adopt. See McCulloch v. Mary­&para;<br>land, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819). Congress has the power&para;<br>both to ensure efficiency in the administration of its programs and to choose what larger goals and policies to&para;<br>pursue.&para;<br>Other precedents involving congressional statutes which&para;<br>affect marriages and family status further illustrate this&para;<br>point. In addressing the interaction of state domestic&para;<br>relations and federal immigration law Congress determined that marriages “entered into for the purpose of&para;<br>procuring an alien’s admission [to the United States] as an&para;<br>immigrant” will not qualify the noncitizen for that status,&para;<br>even if the noncitizen’s marriage is valid and proper for&para;<br>state-law purposes. 8 U. S. C. §1186a(b)(1) (2006 ed. and&para;<br>Supp. V). And in establishing income-based criteria for&para;<br>Social Security benefits, Congress decided that although&para;<br>state law would determine in general who qualifies as an&para;<br>applicant’s spouse, common-law marriages also should be&para;<br>recognized, regardless of any particular State’s view on&para;<br>these relationships. 42 U. S. C. §1382c(d)(2).&para;<br>Though these discrete examples establish the constitutionality of limited federal laws that regulate the meaning&para;<br>of marriage in order to further federal policy, DOMA has a&para;<br>far greater reach; for it enacts a directive applicable to&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>over 1,000 federal statutes and the whole realm of federal&para;<br>regulations. And its operation is directed to a class of&para;<br>persons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States,&para;<br>have sought to protect. See Goodridge v.

I. Laws ch. 4.&para;<br>In order to assess the validity of that intervention it is&para;<br>necessary to discuss the extent of the state power and authority over marriage as a matter of history and tradition. State laws defining and regulating marriage, of&para;<br>course, must respect the constitutional rights of persons,&para;<br>see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); but, subject&para;<br>to those guarantees, “regulation of domestic relations” is&para;<br>“an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States.” Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>404 (1975).&para;<br>The recognition of civil marriages is central to state&para;<br>domestic relations law applicable to its residents and&para;<br>citizens. See Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287,&para;<br>298 (1942) (“Each state as a sovereign has a rightful and&para;<br>legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders”). The definition of marriage is&para;<br>the foundation of the State’s broader authority to regulate&para;<br>the subject of domestic relations with respect to the&para;<br>“[p]rotection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities.” Ibid. “[T]he states,&para;<br>at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed&para;<br>full power over the subject of marriage and divorce&para;<br>. . . [and] the Constitution delegated no authority to the&para;<br>Government of the United States on the subject of marriage and divorce.” Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562,&para;<br>575 (1906); see also In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593–594&para;<br>(1890) (“The whole subject of the domestic relations of&para;<br>husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws&para;<br>of the States and not to the laws of the United States”).&para;<br>Consistent with this allocation of authority, the Federal&para;<br>Government, through our history, has deferred to statelaw policy decisions with respect to domestic relations. In&para;<br>De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U. S. 570 (1956), for example,&para;<br>the Court held that, “[t]o decide who is the widow or widower of a deceased author, or who are his executors or&para;<br>next of kin,” under the Copyright Act “requires a reference&para;<br>to the law of the State which created those legal relationships” because “there is no federal law of domestic relations.” Id., at 580. In order to respect this principle, the&para;<br>federal courts, as a general rule, do not adjudicate issues&para;<br>of marital status even when there might otherwise be a&para;<br>basis for federal jurisdiction. See Ankenbrandt v. Rich­&para;<br>ards, 504 U. S. 689, 703 (1992). Federal courts will not&para;<br>hear divorce and custody cases even if they arise in diversity because of “the virtually exclusive primacy . . . of the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States in the regulation of domestic relations.” Id., at 714&para;<br>(Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>The significance of state responsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to the Nation’s&para;<br>beginning; for “when the Constitution was adopted the&para;<br>common understanding was that the domestic relations of&para;<br>husband and wife and parent and child were matters&para;<br>reserved to the States.” Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280&para;<br>U. S. 379, 383–384 (1930). Marriage laws vary in some&para;<br>respects from State to State. For example, the required&para;<br>minimum age is 16 in Vermont, but only 13 in New&para;<br>Hampshire. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §5142 (2012),&para;<br>with N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §457:4 (West Supp. 2012).&para;<br>Likewise the permissible degree of consanguinity can vary&para;<br>(most States permit first cousins to marry, but a handful—&para;<br>such as Iowa and Washington, see Iowa Code §595.19&para;<br>(2009); Wash. Rev. Code §26.04.020 (2012)—prohibit the&para;<br>practice). But these rules are in every event consistent&para;<br>within each State.&para;<br>Against this background DOMA rejects the longestablished precept that the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married couples&para;<br>within each State, though they may vary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State to the next. Despite these considerations, it is unnecessary to decide&para;<br>whether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation&para;<br>of the Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance.&para;<br>The State’s power in defining the marital relation is of&para;<br>central relevance in this case quite apart from principles&para;<br>of federalism. Here the State’s decision to give this class&para;<br>of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity&para;<br>and status of immense import. When the State used its&para;<br>historic and essential authority to define the marital&para;<br>relation in this way, its role and its power in making the&para;<br>decision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection&para;<br>of the class in their own community. DOMA, because of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>its reach and extent, departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage. “ ‘[D]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are&para;<br>obnoxious to the constitutional provision.’ ” Romer v.&para;<br>Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 633 (1996) (quoting Louisville Gas &amp;&para;<br>Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37–38 (1928)).&para;<br>The Federal Government uses this state-defined class&para;<br>for the opposite purpose—to impose restrictions and disabilities. That result requires this Court now to address&para;<br>whether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation&para;<br>of an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. What the State of New York treats as alike&para;<br>the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure&para;<br>the same class the State seeks to protect.&para;<br>In acting first to recognize and then to allow same-sex&para;<br>marriages, New York was responding “to the initiative of&para;<br>those who [sought] a voice in shaping the destiny of their&para;<br>own times.” Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 9). These actions were without doubt a&para;<br>proper exercise of its sovereign authority within our federal system, all in the way that the Framers of the Constitution intended. The dynamics of state government in the&para;<br>federal system are to allow the formation of consensus&para;<br>respecting the way the members of a discrete community&para;<br>treat each other in their daily contact and constant interaction with each other.&para;<br>The States’ interest in defining and regulating the&para;<br>marital relation, subject to constitutional guarantees,&para;<br>stems from the understanding that marriage is more than&para;<br>a routine classification for purposes of certain statutory&para;<br>benefits. Private, consensual sexual intimacy between two&para;<br>adult persons of the same sex may not be punished by the&para;<br>State, and it can form “but one element in a personal bond&para;<br>that is more enduring.” Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558,&para;<br>567 (2003). By its recognition of the validity of same-sex&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>marriages performed in other jurisdictions and then by&para;<br>authorizing same-sex unions and same-sex marriages,&para;<br>New York sought to give further protection and dignity to&para;<br>that bond. For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful&para;<br>status. This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship between two people, a&para;<br>relationship deemed by the State worthy of dignity in the&para;<br>community equal with all other marriages. It reflects both&para;<br>the community’s considered perspective on the historical&para;<br>roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning of equality.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to&para;<br>protect. By doing so it violates basic due process and&para;<br>equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; Bolling v. Sharpe,&para;<br>347 U. S. 497 (1954). The Constitution’s guarantee of&para;<br>equality “must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group&para;<br>cannot” justify disparate treatment of that group. Depart­&para;<br>ment of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534–535&para;<br>(1973). In determining whether a law is motived by an&para;<br>improper animus or purpose, “ ‘[d]iscriminations of an unusual character’ ” especially require careful consideration. Supra, at 19 (quoting Romer, supra, at 633). DOMA&para;<br>cannot survive under these principles. The responsibility&para;<br>of the States for the regulation of domestic relations is an&para;<br>important indicator of the substantial societal impact the&para;<br>State’s classifications have in the daily lives and customs&para;<br>of its people. DOMA’s unusual deviation from the usual&para;<br>tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of&para;<br>marriage here operates to deprive same-sex couples of the&para;<br>benefits and responsibilities that come with the federal&para;<br>recognition of their marriages. This is strong evidence of a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of that&para;<br>class. The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law&para;<br>here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate&para;<br>status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex&para;<br>marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of&para;<br>the States.&para;<br>The history of DOMA’s enactment and its own text&para;<br>demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of&para;<br>same-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in&para;<br>the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an&para;<br>incidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence.&para;<br>The House Report announced its conclusion that “it is both&para;<br>appropriate and necessary for Congress to do what it can&para;<br>to defend the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage. . . . H. R. 3396 is appropriately entitled the ‘Defense&para;<br>of Marriage Act.’ The effort to redefine ‘marriage’ to extend to homosexual couples is a truly radical proposal that&para;<br>would fundamentally alter the institution of marriage.”&para;<br>H. R. Rep. No. 104–664, pp. 12–13 (1996). The House&para;<br>concluded that DOMA expresses “both moral disapproval&para;<br>of homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional (especially JudeoChristian) morality.” Id., at 16 (footnote deleted). The&para;<br>stated purpose of the law was to promote an “interest in&para;<br>protecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in&para;<br>heterosexual-only marriage laws.” Ibid. Were there any&para;<br>doubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the Act&para;<br>confirms it: The Defense of Marriage.&para;<br>The arguments put forward by BLAG are just as candid&para;<br>about the congressional purpose to influence or interfere&para;<br>with state sovereign choices about who may be married.&para;<br>As the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its purpose is&para;<br>to discourage enactment of state same-sex marriage laws&para;<br>and to restrict the freedom and choice of couples married&para;<br>under those laws if they are enacted. The congressional&para;<br>goal was “to put a thumb on the scales and influence a&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>state’s decision as to how to shape its own marriage laws.”&para;<br>Massachusetts, 682 F. 3d, at 12–13. The Act’s demonstrated purpose is to ensure that if any State decides to&para;<br>recognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated&para;<br>as second-class marriages for purposes of federal law.&para;<br>This raises a most serious question under the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.&para;<br>DOMA’s operation in practice confirms this purpose.&para;<br>When New York adopted a law to permit same-sex marriage, it sought to eliminate inequality; but DOMA frustrates that objective through a system-wide enactment&para;<br>with no identified connection to any particular area of federal law. DOMA writes inequality into the entire United&para;<br>States Code. The particular case at hand concerns the&para;<br>estate tax, but DOMA is more than a simple determination of what should or should not be allowed as an&para;<br>estate tax refund. Among the over 1,000 statutes and&para;<br>numerous federal regulations that DOMA controls are&para;<br>laws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, criminal sanctions, copyright, and veterans’ benefits.&para;<br>DOMA’s principal effect is to identify a subset of statesanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons&para;<br>like governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as&para;<br>rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.&para;<br>And DOMA contrives to deprive some couples married&para;<br>under the laws of their State, but not other couples, of&para;<br>both rights and responsibilities. By creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State, DOMA&para;<br>forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose&para;<br>of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal&para;<br>law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of&para;<br>basic personal relations the State has found it proper to&para;<br>acknowledge and protect. By this dynamic DOMA undermines both the public and private significance of statesanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages&para;<br>are unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex&para;<br>couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier&para;<br>marriage. The differentiation demeans the couple, whose&para;<br>moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see&para;<br>Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, and whose relationship the State&para;<br>has sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands&para;<br>of children now being raised by same-sex couples. The law&para;<br>in question makes it even more difficult for the children to&para;<br>understand the integrity and closeness of their own family&para;<br>and its concord with other families in their community&para;<br>and in their daily lives.&para;<br>Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their&para;<br>lives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible&para;<br>and public ways. By its great reach, DOMA touches many&para;<br>aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to&para;<br>the profound. It prevents same-sex married couples&para;<br>from obtaining government healthcare benefits they would&para;<br>otherwise receive. See 5 U. S. C. §§8901(5), 8905. It&para;<br>deprives them of the Bankruptcy Code’s special protections for domestic-support obligations. See 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§101(14A), 507(a)(1)(A), 523(a)(5), 523(a)(15). It forces&para;<br>them to follow a complicated procedure to file their state&para;<br>and federal taxes jointly. Technical Bulletin TB–55, 2010&para;<br>Vt.

National Cemetery Administration Directive 3210/1, p. 37 (June 4, 2008).&para;<br>For certain married couples, DOMA’s unequal effects&para;<br>are even more serious. The federal penal code makes it a&para;<br>crime to “assaul[t], kidna[p], or murde[r] . . . a member of&para;<br>the immediate family” of “a United States official, a&para;<br>United States judge, [or] a Federal law enforcement officer,”&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §115(a)(1)(A), with the intent to influence or&para;<br>retaliate against that official, §115(a)(1). Although a&para;<br>“spouse” qualifies as a member of the officer’s “immediate&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>family,” §115(c)(2), DOMA makes this protection inapplicable to same-sex spouses.&para;<br>DOMA also brings financial harm to children of samesex couples. It raises the cost of health care for families&para;<br>by taxing health benefits provided by employers to their&para;<br>workers’ same-sex spouses. See 26 U. S. C. §106; Treas.&para;<br>Reg. §1.106–1, 26 CFR §1.106–1 (2012); IRS Private Letter&para;<br>Ruling 9850011 (Sept. 10, 1998). And it denies or reduces benefits allowed to families upon the loss of a spouse&para;<br>and parent, benefits that are an integral part of family&para;<br>security. See Social Security Administration, Social Security Survivors Benefits 5 (2012) (benefits available to a&para;<br>surviving spouse caring for the couple’s child), online at&para;<br>http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10084.pdf.&para;<br>DOMA divests married same-sex couples of the duties&para;<br>and responsibilities that are an essential part of married&para;<br>life and that they in most cases would be honored to accept&para;<br>were DOMA not in force. For instance, because it is expected that spouses will support each other as they pursue&para;<br>educational opportunities, federal law takes into consideration a spouse’s income in calculating a student’s federal financial aid eligibility. See 20 U. S. C. §1087nn(b).&para;<br>Same-sex married couples are exempt from this requirement. The same is true with respect to federal ethics&para;<br>rules. Federal executive and agency officials are prohibited from “participat[ing] personally and substantially” in&para;<br>matters as to which they or their spouses have a financial&para;<br>interest. 18 U. S. C. §208(a). A similar statute prohibits&para;<br>Senators, Senate employees, and their spouses from accepting high-value gifts from certain sources, see 2&para;<br>U. S. C. §31–2(a)(1), and another mandates detailed financial disclosures by numerous high-ranking officials and&para;<br>their spouses. See 5 U. S. C. App. §§102(a), (e).

This requires&para;<br>the Court to hold, as it now does, that DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.&para;<br>The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due&para;<br>Process Clause contains within it the prohibition against&para;<br>denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.&para;<br>See Bolling, 347 U.

On&para;<br>the merits of the constitutional dispute the Court decides to&para;<br>decide, I also agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that Congress&para;<br>acted constitutionally in passing the Defense of Marriage&para;<br>Act (DOMA). Interests in uniformity and stability amply justified Congress’s decision to retain the definition of&para;<br>marriage that, at that point, had been adopted by every&para;<br>State in our Nation, and every nation in the world. Post,&para;<br>at 19–20 (dissenting opinion).&para;<br>The majority sees a more sinister motive, pointing out&para;<br>that the Federal Government has generally (though not&para;<br>uniformly) deferred to state definitions of marriage in the&para;<br>past. That is true, of course, but none of those prior stateby-state variations had involved differences over something—as the majority puts it—“thought of by most people&para;<br>as essential to the very definition of [marriage] and to&para;<br>its role and function throughout the history of civilization.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13. That the Federal Government treated this&para;<br>fundamental question differently than it treated variations&para;<br>over consanguinity or minimum age is hardly surprising—&para;<br>and hardly enough to support a conclusion that the&para;<br>“principal purpose,” ante, at 22, of the 342 Representa-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tives and 85 Senators who voted for it, and the President&para;<br>who signed it, was a bare desire to harm. Nor do the snippets of legislative history and the banal title of the Act&para;<br>to which the majority points suffice to make such a showing. At least without some more convincing evidence that&para;<br>the Act’s principal purpose was to codify malice, and that&para;<br>it furthered no legitimate government interests, I would&para;<br>not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry.&para;<br>But while I disagree with the result to which the majority’s analysis leads it in this case, I think it more important&para;<br>to point out that its analysis leads no further. The Court&para;<br>does not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does&para;<br>not decide, the distinct question whether the States, in the&para;<br>exercise of their “historic and essential authority to define&para;<br>the marital relation,” ante, at 18, may continue to utilize&para;<br>the traditional definition of marriage.&para;<br>The majority goes out of its way to make this explicit in&para;<br>the penultimate sentence of its opinion. It states that&para;<br>“[t]his opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful&para;<br>marriages,” ante, at 26—referring to same-sex marriages&para;<br>that a State has already recognized as a result of the local&para;<br>“community’s considered perspective on the historical&para;<br>roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning of equality.” Ante, at 20.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA believes this is a “ ‘bald, unreasoned disclaime[r].’ ” Post, at 22. In my view, though, the disclaimer&para;<br>is a logical and necessary consequence of the argument&para;<br>the majority has chosen to adopt. The dominant theme&para;<br>of the majority opinion is that the Federal Government’s&para;<br>intrusion into an area “central to state domestic relations&para;<br>law applicable to its residents and citizens” is sufficiently&para;<br>“unusual” to set off alarm bells. Ante, at 17, 20. I think&para;<br>the majority goes off course, as I have said, but it is undeniable that its judgment is based on federalism.&para;<br>The majority extensively chronicles DOMA’s departure&para;<br>from the normal allocation of responsibility between State&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and Federal Governments, emphasizing that DOMA “rejects the long-established precept that the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married&para;<br>couples within each State.” Ante, at 18. But there is&para;<br>no such departure when one State adopts or keeps a definition of marriage that differs from that of its neighbor,&para;<br>for it is entirely expected that state definitions would&para;<br>“vary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State&para;<br>to the next.” Ibid. Thus, while “[t]he State’s power in&para;<br>defining the marital relation is of central relevance” to the&para;<br>majority’s decision to strike down DOMA here, ibid., that&para;<br>power will come into play on the other side of the board in&para;<br>future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage&para;<br>definitions. So too will the concerns for state diversity and&para;<br>sovereignty that weigh against DOMA’s constitutionality&para;<br>in this case. See ante, at 19.&para;<br>It is not just this central feature of the majority’s analysis that is unique to DOMA, but many considerations on&para;<br>the periphery as well. For example, the majority focuses&para;<br>on the legislative history and title of this particular Act,&para;<br>ante, at 21; those statute-specific considerations will, of&para;<br>course, be irrelevant in future cases about different statutes. The majority emphasizes that DOMA was a “systemwide enactment with no identified connection to any&para;<br>particular area of federal law,” but a State’s definition of&para;<br>marriage “is the foundation of the State’s broader authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations with respect to the ‘[p]rotection of offspring, property interests,&para;<br>and the enforcement of marital responsibilities.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>22, 17. And the federal decision undermined (in the majority’s view) the “dignity [already] conferred by the States&para;<br>in the exercise of their sovereign power,” ante, at 21,&para;<br>whereas a State’s decision whether to expand the definition of marriage from its traditional contours involves no&para;<br>similar concern.&para;<br>We may in the future have to resolve challenges to state&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

And even if we did, we have no power under the&para;<br>Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation. The Court’s errors on both points spring forth&para;<br>from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the&para;<br>role of this institution in America.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court is eager—hungry—to tell everyone its view of&para;<br>the legal question at the heart of this case. Standing in&para;<br>the way is an obstacle, a technicality of little interest to&para;<br>anyone but the people of We the People, who created it as&para;<br>a barrier against judges’ intrusion into their lives. They&para;<br>gave judges, in Article III, only the “judicial Power,” a&para;<br>power to decide not abstract questions but real, concrete&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“Cases” and “Controversies.” Yet the plaintiff and the Government agree entirely on what should happen in this&para;<br>lawsuit. They agree that the court below got it right; and&para;<br>they agreed in the court below that the court below that&para;<br>one got it right as well. What, then, are we doing here?&para;<br>The answer lies at the heart of the jurisdictional portion&para;<br>of today’s opinion, where a single sentence lays bare the&para;<br>majority’s vision of our role. The Court says that we have&para;<br>the power to decide this case because if we did not, then&para;<br>our “primary role in determining the constitutionality of&para;<br>a law” (at least one that “has inflicted real injury on a&para;<br>plaintiff ”) would “become only secondary to the President’s.”&para;<br>Ante, at 12. But wait, the reader wonders—Windsor won&para;<br>below, and so cured her injury, and the President was glad&para;<br>to see it. True, says the majority, but judicial review must&para;<br>march on regardless, lest we “undermine the clear dictate&para;<br>of the separation-of-powers principle that when an Act of&para;<br>Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, it is&para;<br>emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” Ibid. (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and brackets omitted).&para;<br>That is jaw-dropping. It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over the people’s Representatives in Congress&para;<br>and the Executive. It envisions a Supreme Court standing&para;<br>(or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions, always and everywhere “primary” in its role.&para;<br>This image of the Court would have been unrecognizable&para;<br>to those who wrote and ratified our national charter. They&para;<br>knew well the dangers of “primary” power, and so created&para;<br>branches of government that would be “perfectly coordinate by the terms of their common commission,” none&para;<br>of which branches could “pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their respective powers.” The Federalist, No. 49, p. 314 (C. Rossiter&para;<br>ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The people did this to protect&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>themselves. They did it to guard their right to self-rule&para;<br>against the black-robed supremacy that today’s majority&para;<br>finds so attractive. So it was that Madison could confidently state, with no fear of contradiction, that there was&para;<br>nothing of “greater intrinsic value” or “stamped with the&para;<br>authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty” than a&para;<br>government of separate and coordinate powers. Id., No.&para;<br>47, at 301.&para;<br>For this reason we are quite forbidden to say what the&para;<br>law is whenever (as today’s opinion asserts) “ ‘an Act of&para;<br>Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution.’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 12. We can do so only when that allegation will&para;<br>determine the outcome of a lawsuit, and is contradicted by&para;<br>the other party. The “judicial Power” is not, as the majority believes, the power “ ‘to say what the law is,’ ” ibid.,&para;<br>giving the Supreme Court the “primary role in determining the constitutionality of laws.” The majority must have&para;<br>in mind one of the foreign constitutions that pronounces&para;<br>such primacy for its constitutional court and allows that&para;<br>primacy to be exercised in contexts other than a lawsuit.&para;<br>See, e.g., Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany,&para;<br>Art. 93. The judicial power as Americans have understood&para;<br>it (and their English ancestors before them) is the power&para;<br>to adjudicate, with conclusive effect, disputed government claims (civil or criminal) against private persons, and&para;<br>disputed claims by private persons against the government or other private persons. Sometimes (though not&para;<br>always) the parties before the court disagree not with&para;<br>regard to the facts of their case (or not only with regard to&para;<br>the facts) but with regard to the applicable law—in which&para;<br>event (and only in which event) it becomes the “ ‘province&para;<br>and duty of the judicial department to say what the law&para;<br>is.’ ” Ante, at 12.&para;<br>In other words, declaring the compatibility of state or&para;<br>federal laws with the Constitution is not only not the&para;<br>“primary role” of this Court, it is not a separate, free-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>standing role at all. We perform that role incidentally—by&para;<br>accident, as it were—when that is necessary to resolve the&para;<br>dispute before us. Then, and only then, does it become&para;<br>“ ‘the province and duty of the judicial department to say&para;<br>what the law is.’ ” That is why, in 1793, we politely declined the Washington Administration’s request to “say&para;<br>what the law is” on a particular treaty matter that was&para;<br>not the subject of a concrete legal controversy. 3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 486–489 (H.&para;<br>Johnston ed. 1893). And that is why, as our opinions have&para;<br>said, some questions of law will never be presented to this&para;<br>Court, because there will never be anyone with standing&para;<br>to bring a lawsuit. See Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to&para;<br>Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 227 (1974); United States v.&para;<br>Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179 (1974). As Justice Brandeis put it, we cannot “pass upon the constitutionality of&para;<br>legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding”; absent a “ ‘real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals,’ ” we have neither any work to do nor any power to&para;<br>do it.

The further proceedings have&para;<br>been a contrivance, having no object in mind except to elevate a District Court judgment that has no precedential&para;<br>effect in other courts, to one that has precedential effect&para;<br>throughout the Second Circuit, and then (in this Court)&para;<br>precedential effect throughout the United States.&para;<br>We have never before agreed to speak—to “say what the&para;<br>law is”—where there is no controversy before us.

The United States reluctantly conceded that at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20.&para;<br>The closest we have ever come to what the Court blesses&para;<br>today was our opinion in INS v.

But in that case, two parties to the litigation&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 For an even more advanced scavenger hunt, one might search the&para;<br>annals of Anglo-American law for another “Motion to Dismiss” like the&para;<br>one the United States filed in District Court: It argued that the court&para;<br>should agree “with Plaintiff and the United States” and “not dismiss”&para;<br>the complaint. (Emphasis mine.) Then, having gotten exactly what it&para;<br>asked for, the United States promptly appealed.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>disagreed with the position of the United States and with&para;<br>the court below: the House and Senate, which had intervened in the case. Because Chadha concerned the validity&para;<br>of a mode of congressional action—the one-house legislative veto—the House and Senate were threatened with&para;<br>destruction of what they claimed to be one of their institutional powers. The Executive choosing not to defend that&para;<br>power,2 we permitted the House and Senate to intervene.&para;<br>Nothing like that is present here.&para;<br>To be sure, the Court in Chadha said that statutory&para;<br>aggrieved-party status was “not altered by the fact that&para;<br>the Executive may agree with the holding that the statute&para;<br>in question is unconstitutional.” Id., at 930–931. But in&para;<br>a footnote to that statement, the Court acknowledged Article III’s separate requirement of a “justiciable case or&para;<br>controversy,” and stated that this requirement was satisfied “because of the presence of the two Houses of Congress as adverse parties.” Id., at 931, n. 6. Later in its&para;<br>opinion, the Chadha Court remarked that the United&para;<br>States’ announced intention to enforce the statute also&para;<br>sufficed to permit judicial review, even absent congressional participation. Id., at 939. That remark is true, as a&para;<br>description of the judicial review conducted in the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, where the Houses of Congress had not inter——————&para;<br>2 There the Justice Department’s refusal to defend the legislation&para;<br>was in accord with its longstanding (and entirely reasonable) practice of&para;<br>declining to defend legislation that in its view infringes upon Presidential powers. There is no justification for the Justice Department’s&para;<br>abandoning the law in the present case. The majority opinion makes a&para;<br>point of scolding the President for his “failure to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet&para;<br>established in judicial decisions,” ante, at 12. But the rebuke is tonguein-cheek, for the majority gladly gives the President what he wants.&para;<br>Contrary to all precedent, it decides this case (and even decides it the&para;<br>way the President wishes) despite his abandonment of the defense and&para;<br>the consequent absence of a case or controversy.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

(The case originated in the Court of Appeals, since&para;<br>it sought review of agency action under 8 U. S. C. §1105a(a)&para;<br>(1976 ed.).) There, absent a judgment setting aside&para;<br>the INS order, Chadha faced deportation. This passage of our opinion seems to be addressing that initial&para;<br>standing in the Court of Appeals, as indicated by its quotation from the lower court’s opinion, 462 U. S., at 939–&para;<br>940. But if it was addressing standing to pursue the&para;<br>appeal, the remark was both the purest dictum (as congressional intervention at that point made the required&para;<br>adverseness “beyond doubt,” id., at 939), and quite incorrect. When a private party has a judicial decree safely in&para;<br>hand to prevent his injury, additional judicial action requires that a party injured by the decree seek to undo it.&para;<br>In Chadha, the intervening House and Senate fulfilled&para;<br>that requirement. Here no one does.&para;<br>The majority’s discussion of the requirements of Article&para;<br>III bears no resemblance to our jurisprudence. It accuses&para;<br>the amicus (appointed to argue against our jurisdiction) of&para;<br>“elid[ing] the distinction between . . . the jurisdictional&para;<br>requirements of Article III and the prudential limits on its&para;<br>exercise.” Ante, at 6. It then proceeds to call the requirement of adverseness a “prudential” aspect of standing. Of&para;<br>standing. That is incomprehensible. A plaintiff (or appellant) can have all the standing in the world—satisfying all&para;<br>three standing requirements of Lujan that the majority so&para;<br>carefully quotes, ante, at 7—and yet no Article III controversy may be before the court. Article III requires not just&para;<br>a plaintiff (or appellant) who has standing to complain&para;<br>but an opposing party who denies the validity of the complaint. It is not the amicus that has done the eliding of&para;<br>distinctions, but the majority, calling the quite separate&para;<br>Article III requirement of adverseness between the parties&para;<br>an element (which it then pronounces a “prudential” element) of standing. The question here is not whether, as&para;<br>the majority puts it, “the United States retains a stake&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sufficient to support Article III jurisdiction,” ibid. the&para;<br>question is whether there is any controversy (which requires contradiction) between the United States and Ms.&para;<br>Windsor. There is not.&para;<br>I find it wryly amusing that the majority seeks to dismiss the requirement of party-adverseness as nothing&para;<br>more than a “prudential” aspect of the sole Article III&para;<br>requirement of standing. (Relegating a jurisdictional requirement to “prudential” status is a wondrous device,&para;<br>enabling courts to ignore the requirement whenever they&para;<br>believe it “prudent”—which is to say, a good idea.) Half a&para;<br>century ago, a Court similarly bent upon announcing its&para;<br>view regarding the constitutionality of a federal statute&para;<br>achieved that goal by effecting a remarkably similar but&para;<br>completely opposite distortion of the principles limiting our&para;<br>jurisdiction. The Court’s notorious opinion in Flast v.&para;<br>Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 98–101 (1968), held that standing&para;<br>was merely an element (which it pronounced to be a&para;<br>“prudential” element) of the sole Article III requirement&para;<br>of adverseness. We have been living with the chaos created&para;<br>by that power-grabbing decision ever since, see Hein v.&para;<br>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587&para;<br>(2007), as we will have to live with the chaos created by&para;<br>this one.&para;<br>The authorities the majority cites fall miles short of&para;<br>supporting the counterintuitive notion that an Article III&para;<br>“controversy” can exist without disagreement between the&para;<br>parties. In Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445&para;<br>U. S. 326 (1980), the District Court had entered judgment&para;<br>in the individual plaintiff ’s favor based on the defendant&para;<br>bank’s offer to pay the full amount claimed. The plaintiff,&para;<br>however, sought to appeal the District Court’s denial of&para;<br>class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure&para;<br>23. There was a continuing dispute between the parties&para;<br>concerning the issue raised on appeal. The same is true of&para;<br>the other case cited by the majority, Camreta v. Greene,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>563 U. S. ___ (2011). There the District Court found that&para;<br>the defendant state officers had violated the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment, but rendered judgment in their favor because&para;<br>they were entitled to official immunity, application of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment to their conduct not having been clear&para;<br>at the time of violation. The officers sought to appeal&para;<br>the holding of Fourth Amendment violation, which would&para;<br>circumscribe their future conduct; the plaintiff continued&para;<br>to insist that a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred.&para;<br>The “prudential” discretion to which both those cases refer&para;<br>was the discretion to deny an appeal even when a live&para;<br>controversy exists—not the discretion to grant one when it&para;<br>does not. The majority can cite no case in which this&para;<br>Court entertained an appeal in which both parties urged&para;<br>us to affirm the judgment below. And that is because the&para;<br>existence of a controversy is not a “prudential” requirement that we have invented, but an essential element of&para;<br>an Article III case or controversy. The majority’s notion&para;<br>that a case between friendly parties can be entertained so&para;<br>long as “adversarial presentation of the issues is assured&para;<br>by the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend&para;<br>with vigor” the other side of the issue, ante, at 10, effects a&para;<br>breathtaking revolution in our Article III jurisprudence.&para;<br>It may be argued that if what we say is true some Presidential determinations that statutes are unconstitutional&para;<br>will not be subject to our review. That is as it should&para;<br>be, when both the President and the plaintiff agree that&para;<br>the statute is unconstitutional. Where the Executive is enforcing an unconstitutional law, suit will of course lie; but&para;<br>if, in that suit, the Executive admits the unconstitutionality of the law, the litigation should end in an order or a&para;<br>consent decree enjoining enforcement. This suit saw the&para;<br>light of day only because the President enforced the Act&para;<br>(and thus gave Windsor standing to sue) even though he&para;<br>believed it unconstitutional. He could have equally chosen&para;<br>(more appropriately, some would say) neither to enforce&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>nor to defend the statute he believed to be unconstitutional, see Presidential Authority to Decline to Execute Unconstitutional Statutes, 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 199&para;<br>(Nov. 2, 1994)—in which event Windsor would not have&para;<br>been injured, the District Court could not have refereed&para;<br>this friendly scrimmage, and the Executive’s determination of unconstitutionality would have escaped this Court’s&para;<br>desire to blurt out its view of the law. The matter would&para;<br>have been left, as so many matters ought to be left, to a&para;<br>tug of war between the President and the Congress, which&para;<br>has innumerable means (up to and including impeachment) of compelling the President to enforce the laws it&para;<br>has written. Or the President could have evaded presentation of the constitutional issue to this Court simply by&para;<br>declining to appeal the District Court and Court of Appeals dispositions he agreed with. Be sure of this much: If&para;<br>a President wants to insulate his judgment of unconstitutionality from our review, he can. What the views urged&para;<br>in this dissent produce is not insulation from judicial&para;<br>review but insulation from Executive contrivance.&para;<br>The majority brandishes the famous sentence from&para;<br>Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) that “[i]t is&para;<br>emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” Ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that sentence neither says nor&para;<br>implies that it is always the province and duty of the&para;<br>Court to say what the law is—much less that its responsibility in that regard is a “primary” one. The very next&para;<br>sentence of Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion makes the&para;<br>crucial qualification that today’s majority ignores: “Those&para;<br>who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity&para;<br>expound and interpret that rule.” 1 Cranch, at 177 (emphasis added). Only when a “particular case” is before&para;<br>us—that is, a controversy that it is our business to resolve&para;<br>under Article III—do we have the province and duty to&para;<br>pronounce the law. For the views of our early Court more&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>precisely addressing the question before us here, the majority ought instead to have consulted the opinion of Chief&para;<br>Justice Taney in Lord v. Veazie, 8 How. 251 (1850):&para;<br>“The objection in the case before us is . . . that the&para;<br>plaintiff and defendant have the same interest, and&para;<br>that interest adverse and in conflict with the interest&para;<br>of third persons, whose rights would be seriously affected if the question of law was decided in the manner that both of the parties to this suit desire it to be.&para;<br>“A judgment entered under such circumstances, and&para;<br>for such purposes, is a mere form. The whole proceeding was in contempt of the court, and highly reprehensible . . . . A judgment in form, thus procured, in&para;<br>the eye of the law is no judgment of the court. It is a&para;<br>nullity, and no writ of error will lie upon it. This writ&para;<br>is, therefore, dismissed.” Id., at 255–256.&para;<br>There is, in the words of Marbury, no “necessity [to] expound and interpret” the law in this case; just a desire&para;<br>to place this Court at the center of the Nation’s life.&para;<br>1 Cranch, at 177.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A few words in response to the theory of jurisdiction set&para;<br>forth in JUSTICE ALITO’s dissent: Though less far reaching in its consequences than the majority’s conversion of&para;<br>constitutionally required adverseness into a discretionary&para;<br>element of standing, the theory of that dissent similarly&para;<br>elevates the Court to the “primary” determiner of constitutional questions involving the separation of powers, and,&para;<br>to boot, increases the power of the most dangerous branch:&para;<br>the “legislative department,” which by its nature “draw[s]&para;<br>all power into its impetuous vortex.” The Federalist, No.&para;<br>48, at 309 (J. Madison). Heretofore in our national history, the President’s failure to “take Care that the Laws&para;<br>be faithfully executed,” U. S. Const., Art. II, §3, could only be&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>brought before a judicial tribunal by someone whose&para;<br>concrete interests were harmed by that alleged failure.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO would create a system in which Congress&para;<br>can hale the Executive before the courts not only to vindicate its own institutional powers to act, but to correct a&para;<br>perceived inadequacy in the execution of its laws.3 This&para;<br>would lay to rest Tocqueville’s praise of our judicial system&para;<br>as one which “intimately bind[s] the case made for the law&para;<br>with the case made for one man,” one in which legislation&para;<br>is “no longer exposed to the daily aggression of the parties,” and in which “[t]he political question that [the judge]&para;<br>must resolve is linked to the interest” of private litigants.&para;<br>A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 97 (H. Mansfield&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO attempts to limit his argument by claiming that Congress is injured (and can therefore appeal) when its statute is held&para;<br>unconstitutional without Presidential defense, but is not injured when&para;<br>its statute is held unconstitutional despite Presidential defense. I do&para;<br>not understand that line. The injury to Congress is the same whether&para;<br>the President has defended the statute or not. And if the injury is&para;<br>threatened, why should Congress not be able to participate in the suit&para;<br>from the beginning, just as the President can? And if having a statute&para;<br>declared unconstitutional (and therefore inoperative) by a court is an&para;<br>injury, why is it not an injury when a statute is declared unconstitutional by the President and rendered inoperative by his consequent&para;<br>failure to enforce it? Or when the President simply declines to enforce&para;<br>it without opining on its constitutionality? If it is the inoperativeness&para;<br>that constitutes the injury—the “impairment of [the legislative] function,” as JUSTICE ALITO puts it, post, at 4—it should make no difference&para;<br>which of the other two branches inflicts it, and whether the Constitution is the pretext. A principled and predictable system of jurisprudence cannot rest upon a shifting concept of injury, designed to support&para;<br>standing when we would like it. If this Court agreed with JUSTICE&para;<br>ALITO’s distinction, its opinion in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811 (1997),&para;<br>which involved an original suit by Members of Congress challenging an&para;<br>assertedly unconstitutional law, would have been written quite differently; and JUSTICE ALITO’s distinguishing of that case on grounds quite&para;<br>irrelevant to his theory of standing would have been unnecessary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&amp; D. Winthrop eds. 2000). That would be replaced by a&para;<br>system in which Congress and the Executive can pop&para;<br>immediately into court, in their institutional capacity,&para;<br>whenever the President refuses to implement a statute he&para;<br>believes to be unconstitutional, and whenever he implements a law in a manner that is not to Congress’s liking.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO’s notion of standing will likewise enormously shrink the area to which “judicial censure, exercised by the courts on legislation, cannot extend,” ibid.&para;<br>For example, a bare majority of both Houses could bring&para;<br>into court the assertion that the Executive’s implementation of welfare programs is too generous—a failure that no&para;<br>other litigant would have standing to complain about.&para;<br>Moreover, as we indicated in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S.&para;<br>811, 828 (1997), if Congress can sue the Executive for the&para;<br>erroneous application of the law that “injures” its power to&para;<br>legislate, surely the Executive can sue Congress for its&para;<br>erroneous adoption of an unconstitutional law that “injures” the Executive’s power to administer—or perhaps for&para;<br>its protracted failure to act on one of his nominations. The&para;<br>opportunities for dragging the courts into disputes hitherto left for political resolution are endless.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO’s dissent is correct that Raines did not&para;<br>formally decide this issue, but its reasoning does. The&para;<br>opinion spends three pages discussing famous, decadeslong disputes between the President and Congress—&para;<br>regarding congressional power to forbid the Presidential&para;<br>removal of executive officers, regarding the legislative&para;<br>veto, regarding congressional appointment of executive&para;<br>officers, and regarding the pocket veto—that would&para;<br>surely have been promptly resolved by a Congress-vs.-thePresident lawsuit if the impairment of a branch’s powers&para;<br>alone conferred standing to commence litigation. But it&para;<br>does not, and never has; the “enormous power that the&para;<br>judiciary would acquire” from the ability to adjudicate&para;<br>such suits “would have made a mockery of [Hamilton’s]&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

If&para;<br>majorities in both Houses of Congress care enough about&para;<br>the matter, they have available innumerable ways to compel executive action without a lawsuit—from refusing&para;<br>to confirm Presidential appointees to the elimination of&para;<br>funding. (Nothing says “enforce the Act” quite like “. . . or&para;<br>you will have money for little else.”) But the condition is&para;<br>crucial; Congress must care enough to act against the&para;<br>President itself, not merely enough to instruct its lawyers&para;<br>to ask us to do so. Placing the Constitution’s entirely&para;<br>anticipated political arm wrestling into permanent judicial&para;<br>receivership does not do the system a favor.

But no one questions the power of the States to define marriage (with the&para;<br>concomitant conferral of dignity and status), so what is the&para;<br>point of devoting seven pages to describing how long and&para;<br>well established that power is? Even after the opinion has&para;<br>formally disclaimed reliance upon principles of federalism,&para;<br>mentions of “the usual tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage” continue. See, e.g., ante,&para;<br>at 20. What to make of this? The opinion never explains.&para;<br>My guess is that the majority, while reluctant to suggest&para;<br>that defining the meaning of “marriage” in federal statutes is unsupported by any of the Federal Government’s&para;<br>enumerated powers,4 nonetheless needs some rhetorical&para;<br>basis to support its pretense that today’s prohibition of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Such a suggestion would be impossible, given the Federal Government’s long history of making pronouncements regarding marriage—for&para;<br>example, conditioning Utah’s entry into the Union upon its prohibition&para;<br>of polygamy.

But I am only guessing.&para;<br>Equally perplexing are the opinion’s references to “the&para;<br>Constitution’s guarantee of equality.” Ibid. Near the end&para;<br>of the opinion, we are told that although the “equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment makes [the]&para;<br>Fifth Amendment [due process] right all the more specific&para;<br>and all the better understood and preserved”—what can&para;<br>that mean?—“the Fifth Amendment itself withdraws from&para;<br>Government the power to degrade or demean in the way&para;<br>this law does.” Ante, at 25.

House of Representatives&para;<br>(merits) 24–28 (no), with Brief for Respondent Windsor&para;<br>(merits) 17–31 and Brief for United States (merits) 18–36&para;<br>(yes); and compare 699 F. 3d 169, 180–185 (CA2 2012)&para;<br>(yes), with id., at 208–211 (Straub, J., dissenting in part&para;<br>and concurring in part) (no). In accord with my previously&para;<br>expressed skepticism about the Court’s “tiers of scrutiny”&para;<br>approach, I would review this classification only for its&para;<br>rationality. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515,&para;<br>567–570 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). As nearly as I can&para;<br>tell, the Court agrees with that; its opinion does not apply&para;<br>strict scrutiny, and its central propositions are taken from&para;<br>rational-basis cases like Moreno. But the Court certainly&para;<br>does not apply anything that resembles that deferential&para;<br>framework. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993)&para;<br>(a classification “‘must be upheld . . . if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts’ ” that could justify it).&para;<br>The majority opinion need not get into the strict-vs.rational-basis scrutiny question, and need not justify its&para;<br>holding under either, because it says that DOMA is unconstitutional as “a deprivation of the liberty of the person&para;<br>protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution,”&para;<br>ante, at 25; that it violates “basic due process” principles,&para;<br>ante, at 20; and that it inflicts an “injury and indignity” of&para;<br>a kind that denies “an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment,” ante, at 19. The majority&para;<br>never utters the dread words “substantive due process,”&para;<br>perhaps sensing the disrepute into which that doctrine&para;<br>has fallen, but that is what those statements mean. Yet&para;<br>the opinion does not argue that same-sex marriage is&para;<br>“deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,”&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720–721&para;<br>(1997), a claim that would of course be quite absurd. So&para;<br>would the further suggestion (also necessary, under our&para;<br>substantive-due-process precedents) that a world in which&para;<br>DOMA exists is one bereft of “ ‘ordered liberty.’ ” Id., at 721&para;<br>(quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937)).&para;<br>Some might conclude that this loaf could have used a&para;<br>while longer in the oven. But that would be wrong; it is&para;<br>already overcooked. The most expert care in preparation&para;<br>cannot redeem a bad recipe. The sum of all the Court’s&para;<br>nonspecific hand-waving is that this law is invalid (maybe&para;<br>on equal-protection grounds, maybe on substantive-dueprocess grounds, and perhaps with some amorphous federalism component playing a role) because it is motivated&para;<br>by a “ ‘bare . . . desire to harm’ ” couples in same-sex marriages. Ante, at 20. It is this proposition with which I will&para;<br>therefore engage.&para;<br>B&para;<br>As I have observed before, the Constitution does not&para;<br>forbid the government to enforce traditional moral and&para;<br>sexual norms. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 599&para;<br>(2003) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I will not swell the U. S.&para;<br>Reports with restatements of that point. It is enough to&para;<br>say that the Constitution neither requires nor forbids our&para;<br>society to approve of same-sex marriage, much as it neither requires nor forbids us to approve of no-fault divorce,&para;<br>polygamy, or the consumption of alcohol.&para;<br>However, even setting aside traditional moral disapproval of same-sex marriage (or indeed same-sex sex),&para;<br>there are many perfectly valid—indeed, downright boring—justifying rationales for this legislation. Their existence ought to be the end of this case. For they give the lie&para;<br>to the Court’s conclusion that only those with hateful&para;<br>hearts could have voted “aye” on this Act. And more&para;<br>importantly, they serve to make the contents of the legis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

O’Brien, 391&para;<br>U. S. 367, 383 (1968). Or at least it was a familiar principle. By holding to the contrary, the majority has declared&para;<br>open season on any law that (in the opinion of the law’s&para;<br>opponents and any panel of like-minded federal judges)&para;<br>can be characterized as mean-spirited.&para;<br>The majority concludes that the only motive for this Act&para;<br>was the “bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular&para;<br>group.” Ante, at 20. Bear in mind that the object of&para;<br>this condemnation is not the legislature of some onceConfederate Southern state (familiar objects of the Court’s&para;<br>scorn, see, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578&para;<br>(1987)), but our respected coordinate branches, the Congress and Presidency of the United States. Laying such a&para;<br>charge against them should require the most extraordinary evidence, and I would have thought that every&para;<br>attempt would be made to indulge a more anodyne explanation for the statute. The majority does the opposite—&para;<br>affirmatively concealing from the reader the arguments&para;<br>that exist in justification. It makes only a passing mention of the “arguments put forward” by the Act’s defenders,&para;<br>and does not even trouble to paraphrase or describe them.&para;<br>See ante, at 21. I imagine that this is because it is harder&para;<br>to maintain the illusion of the Act’s supporters as unhinged&para;<br>members of a wild-eyed lynch mob when one first describes&para;<br>their views as they see them.&para;<br>To choose just one of these defenders’ arguments,&para;<br>DOMA avoids difficult choice-of-law issues that will now&para;<br>arise absent a uniform federal definition of marriage. See,&para;<br>e.g., Baude, Beyond DOMA: Choice of State Law in Federal Statutes, 64 Stan. L. Rev. 1371 (2012). Imagine a pair&para;<br>of women who marry in Albany and then move to Alabama, which does not “recognize as valid any marriage of&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>parties of the same sex.” Ala. Code §30–1–19(e) (2011).&para;<br>When the couple files their next federal tax return, may it&para;<br>be a joint one? Which State’s law controls, for federal-law&para;<br>purposes: their State of celebration (which recognizes the&para;<br>marriage) or their State of domicile (which does not)?&para;<br>(Does the answer depend on whether they were just visiting in Albany?) Are these questions to be answered as a&para;<br>matter of federal common law, or perhaps by borrowing a&para;<br>State’s choice-of-law rules? If so, which State’s? And what&para;<br>about States where the status of an out-of-state same-sex&para;<br>marriage is an unsettled question under local law? See&para;<br>Godfrey v. Spano, 13 N. Y. 3d 358, 920 N. E. 2d 328&para;<br>(2009). DOMA avoided all of this uncertainty by specifying which marriages would be recognized for federal&para;<br>purposes. That is a classic purpose for a definitional&para;<br>provision.&para;<br>Further, DOMA preserves the intended effects of prior&para;<br>legislation against then-unforeseen changes in circumstance. When Congress provided (for example) that a&para;<br>special estate-tax exemption would exist for spouses, this&para;<br>exemption reached only opposite-sex spouses—those being&para;<br>the only sort that were recognized in any State at the time&para;<br>of DOMA’s passage. When it became clear that changes in&para;<br>state law might one day alter that balance, DOMA’s definitional section was enacted to ensure that state-level&para;<br>experimentation did not automatically alter the basic&para;<br>operation of federal law, unless and until Congress made&para;<br>the further judgment to do so on its own. That is not&para;<br>animus—just stabilizing prudence. Congress has hardly&para;<br>demonstrated itself unwilling to make such further, revising judgments upon due deliberation. See, e.g., Don’t Ask,&para;<br>Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, 124 Stat. 3515.&para;<br>The Court mentions none of this. Instead, it accuses the&para;<br>Congress that enacted this law and the President who&para;<br>signed it of something much worse than, for example,&para;<br>having acted in excess of enumerated federal powers—or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

But the majority says that the supporters of this Act acted with malice—with the “purpose” (ante,&para;<br>at 25) “to disparage and to injure” same-sex couples. It&para;<br>says that the motivation for DOMA was to “demean,”&para;<br>ibid.; to “impose inequality,” ante, at 22; to “impose . . . a&para;<br>stigma,” ante, at 21; to deny people “equal dignity,” ibid.;&para;<br>to brand gay people as “unworthy,” ante, at 23; and to&para;<br>“humiliat[e]” their children, ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>I am sure these accusations are quite untrue. To be&para;<br>sure (as the majority points out), the legislation is called&para;<br>the Defense of Marriage Act. But to defend traditional&para;<br>marriage is not to condemn, demean, or humiliate those&para;<br>who would prefer other arrangements, any more than to&para;<br>defend the Constitution of the United States is to condemn, demean, or humiliate other constitutions. To hurl&para;<br>such accusations so casually demeans this institution. In&para;<br>the majority’s judgment, any resistance to its holding is&para;<br>beyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its&para;<br>high-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute&para;<br>is to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to “disparage,” ”injure,” “degrade,” ”demean,” and “humiliate” our&para;<br>fellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homosexual. All that, simply for supporting an Act that did&para;<br>no more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been&para;<br>unquestioned in our society for most of its existence—&para;<br>indeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for&para;<br>virtually all of human history. It is one thing for a society&para;<br>to elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose&para;<br>change by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani&para;<br>generis, enemies of the human race.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The penultimate sentence of the majority’s opinion is a&para;<br>naked declaration that “[t]his opinion and its holding are&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>confined” to those couples “joined in same-sex marriages&para;<br>made lawful by the State.” Ante, at 26, 25. I have heard&para;<br>such “bald, unreasoned disclaimer[s]” before. Lawrence,&para;<br>539 U. S., at 604. When the Court declared a constitutional right to homosexual sodomy, we were assured that&para;<br>the case had nothing, nothing at all to do with “whether&para;<br>the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.” Id., at&para;<br>578. Now we are told that DOMA is invalid because it&para;<br>“demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the&para;<br>Constitution protects,” ante, at 23—with an accompanying&para;<br>citation of Lawrence. It takes real cheek for today’s majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex&para;<br>marriage is not at issue here—when what has preceded&para;<br>that assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority’s&para;<br>moral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the&para;<br>Congress’s hateful moral judgment against it. I promise&para;<br>you this: The only thing that will “confine” the Court’s&para;<br>holding is its sense of what it can get away with.&para;<br>I do not mean to suggest disagreement with THE CHIEF&para;<br>JUSTICE’s view, ante, p. 2–4 (dissenting opinion), that&para;<br>lower federal courts and state courts can distinguish&para;<br>today’s case when the issue before them is state denial&para;<br>of marital status to same-sex couples—or even that this&para;<br>Court could theoretically do so. Lord, an opinion with such&para;<br>scatter-shot rationales as this one (federalism noises&para;<br>among them) can be distinguished in many ways. And&para;<br>deserves to be. State and lower federal courts should take&para;<br>the Court at its word and distinguish away.&para;<br>In my opinion, however, the view that this Court will&para;<br>take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated&para;<br>beyond mistaking by today’s opinion. As I have said, the&para;<br>real rationale of today’s opinion, whatever disappearing&para;<br>trail of its legalistic argle-bargle one chooses to follow, is&para;<br>that DOMA is motivated by “ ‘bare . . . desire to harm’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

How easy it&para;<br>is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion&para;<br>with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status. Consider how easy (inevitable) it is to make the&para;<br>following substitutions in a passage from today’s opinion&para;<br>ante, at 22:&para;<br>“DOMA’s This state law’s principal effect is to identify&para;<br>a subset of state-sanctioned marriages constitutionally protected sexual relationships, see Lawrence, and&para;<br>make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as rights,&para;<br>enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And&para;<br>DOMA this state law contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State enjoying&para;<br>constitutionally protected sexual relationships, but not&para;<br>other couples, of both rights and responsibilities.”&para;<br>Or try this passage, from ante, at 22–23:&para;<br>“[DOMA] This state law tells those couples, and all&para;<br>the world, that their otherwise valid marriages relationships are unworthy of federal state recognition.&para;<br>This places same-sex couples in an unstable position&para;<br>of being in a second-tier marriage relationship. The&para;<br>differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral&para;<br>and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see&para;<br>Lawrence, . . . .”&para;<br>Or this, from ante, at 23—which does not even require&para;<br>alteration, except as to the invented number:&para;<br>“And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now&para;<br>being raised by same-sex couples.

WINDSOR&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Similarly transposable passages—deliberately transposable, I think—abound. In sum, that Court which finds it&para;<br>so horrific that Congress irrationally and hatefully robbed&para;<br>same-sex couples of the “personhood and dignity” which&para;<br>state legislatures conferred upon them, will of a certitude&para;<br>be similarly appalled by state legislatures’ irrational and&para;<br>hateful failure to acknowledge that “personhood and dignity” in the first place. Ante, at 26. As far as this Court is&para;<br>concerned, no one should be fooled; it is just a matter of&para;<br>listening and waiting for the other shoe.&para;<br>By formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex&para;<br>marriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms&para;<br>well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to&para;<br>its traditional definition. Henceforth those challengers&para;<br>will lead with this Court’s declaration that there is “no&para;<br>legitimate purpose” served by such a law, and will claim&para;<br>that the traditional definition has “the purpose and effect&para;<br>to disparage and to injure” the “personhood and dignity”&para;<br>of same-sex couples, see ante, at 25, 26. The majority’s&para;<br>limiting assurance will be meaningless in the face of language like that, as the majority well knows. That is why&para;<br>the language is there. The result will be a judicial distortion of our society’s debate over marriage—a debate that&para;<br>can seem in need of our clumsy “help” only to a member of&para;<br>this institution.&para;<br>As to that debate: Few public controversies touch an&para;<br>institution so central to the lives of so many, and few&para;<br>inspire such attendant passion by good people on all sides.&para;<br>Few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly&para;<br>the beauty of what our Framers gave us, a gift the Court&para;<br>pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight: a&para;<br>system of government that permits us to rule ourselves.&para;<br>Since DOMA’s passage, citizens on all sides of the question&para;<br>have seen victories and they have seen defeats.

That debate is, at bottom, about the nature&para;<br>of the institution of marriage. Respondent Edith Windsor,&para;<br>supported by the United States, asks this Court to intervene in that debate, and although she couches her argument in different terms, what she seeks is a holding that&para;<br>enshrines in the Constitution a particular understanding&para;<br>of marriage under which the sex of the partners makes&para;<br>no difference. The Constitution, however, does not dictate&para;<br>that choice.

But that is a distinction without a difference: just as&para;<br>the Court of Appeals decision that the Chadha Court&para;<br>affirmed impaired Congress’ power by striking down the&para;<br>one-house veto, so the Second Circuit’s decision here impairs Congress’ legislative power by striking down an Act&para;<br>of Congress. The United States has not explained why the&para;<br>fact that the impairment at issue in Chadha was “special”&para;<br>or “procedural” has any relevance to whether Congress&para;<br>suffered an injury.

Raines is inapposite for two reasons.&para;<br>First, Raines dealt with individual Members of Congress&para;<br>and specifically pointed to the individual Members’ lack&para;<br>of institutional endorsement as a sign of their standing&para;<br>problem: “We attach some importance to the fact that&para;<br>appellees have not been authorized to represent their&para;<br>respective Houses of Congress in this action, and indeed&para;<br>both Houses actively oppose their suit.” Id., at 829; see&para;<br>also ibid., n. 10 (citing cases to the effect that “members of&para;<br>collegial bodies do not have standing to perfect an appeal&para;<br>the body itself has declined to take” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)).&para;<br>Second, the Members in Raines—unlike the state senators in Coleman—were not the pivotal figures whose votes&para;<br>would have caused the Act to fail absent some challenged&para;<br>action.

The modern tiers of scrutiny—on&para;<br>which Windsor and the United States rely so heavily—are&para;<br>a heuristic to help judges determine when classifications&para;<br>have that “fair and substantial relation to the object of the&para;<br>legislation.” Reed, supra, at 76.&para;<br>So, for example, those classifications subject to strict&para;<br>scrutiny—i.e., classifications that must be “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” government interest,&para;<br>Parents Involved in Community Schools v.

In&para;<br>other contexts, however, the Court has found that classifications based on gender are “arbitrary,” Reed, supra, at&para;<br>76, and based on “outmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women,” Cleburne, supra, at 441, as&para;<br>when a State provides that a man must always be preferred to an equally qualified woman when both seek to&para;<br>administer the estate of a deceased party, see Reed, supra,&para;<br>at 76–77.&para;<br>Finally, so-called rational-basis review applies to classifications based on “distinguishing characteristics relevant&para;<br>to interests the State has the authority to implement.”&para;<br>Cleburne, supra, at 441.

Evans, 517 U. S. 620,&para;<br>631 (1996).

That is a striking&para;<br>request and one that unelected judges should pause before&para;<br>granting.

Brief for Respondent BLAG 44–46,&para;<br>49. Others explain the basis for the institution in more&para;<br>philosophical terms. They argue that marriage is essentially the solemnizing of a comprehensive, exclusive, permanent union that is intrinsically ordered to producing&para;<br>new life, even if it does not always do so. See, e.g., Girgis,&para;<br>Anderson, &amp; George, What is Marriage? Man and Woman:&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

While modern cultural changes have&para;<br>weakened the link between marriage and procreation in&para;<br>the popular mind, there is no doubt that, throughout&para;<br>human history and across many cultures, marriage has&para;<br>been viewed as an exclusively opposite-sex institution&para;<br>and as one inextricably linked to procreation and biological kinship.&para;<br>The other, newer view is what I will call the “consentbased” vision of marriage, a vision that primarily defines&para;<br>marriage as the solemnization of mutual commitment—&para;<br>marked by strong emotional attachment and sexual attraction—between two persons. At least as it applies to&para;<br>heterosexual couples, this view of marriage now plays a&para;<br>very prominent role in the popular understanding of the&para;<br>institution. Indeed, our popular culture is infused with&para;<br>this understanding of marriage. Proponents of same-sex&para;<br>marriage argue that because gender differentiation is not&para;<br>relevant to this vision, the exclusion of same-sex couples&para;<br>from the institution of marriage is rank discrimination.&para;<br>The Constitution does not codify either of these views of&para;<br>marriage (although I suspect it would have been hard at&para;<br>the time of the adoption of the Constitution or the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment to find Americans who did not take the traditional view for granted). The silence of the Constitution&para;<br>on this question should be enough to end the matter as&para;<br>far as the judiciary is concerned. Yet, Windsor and the&para;<br>United States implicitly ask us to endorse the consent-based&para;<br>view of marriage and to reject the traditional view, thereby arrogating to ourselves the power to decide a question&para;<br>that philosophers, historians, social scientists, and theologians are better qualified to explore.7 Because our consti——————&para;<br>7 The degree to which this question is intractable to typical judicial&para;<br>processes of decisionmaking was highlighted by the trial in Hol­&para;<br>lingsworth v.

See 13 Tr. in No. C 09–2292 VRW (ND Cal.),&para;<br>pp. 3038–3039.&para;<br>And, if this spectacle were not enough, some professors of constitutional law have argued that we are bound to accept the trial judge’s&para;<br>findings—including those on major philosophical questions and predictions about the future—unless they are “clearly erroneous.” See Brief&para;<br>for Constitutional Law and Civil Procedure Professors as Amici Curiae&para;<br>in Hollingsworth v. Perry, O. T. 2012, No. 12–144, pp. 2–3 (“[T]he&para;<br>district court’s factual findings are compelling and should be given&para;<br>significant weight”); id., at 25 (“Under any standard of review, this&para;<br>Court should credit and adopt the trial court’s findings because they&para;<br>result from rigorous and exacting application of the Federal Rules of&para;<br>Evidence, and are supported by reliable research and by the unanimous&para;<br>consensus of mainstream social science experts”). Only an arrogant&para;<br>legal culture that has lost all appreciation of its own limitations could&para;<br>take such a suggestion seriously.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Legislatures, however, have little choice but to decide&para;<br>between the two views. We have long made clear that&para;<br>neither the political branches of the Federal Government&para;<br>nor state governments are required to be neutral between&para;<br>competing visions of the good, provided that the vision of&para;<br>the good that they adopt is not countermanded by the&para;<br>Constitution. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173,&para;<br>192 (1991) (“[T]he government ‘may make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion’ ” (quoting Maher v.&para;<br>Rue, 432 U. S. 464, 474 (1977))). Accordingly, both Congress and the States are entitled to enact laws recognizing&para;<br>either of the two understandings of marriage. And given&para;<br>the size of government and the degree to which it now&para;<br>regulates daily life, it seems unlikely that either Congress&para;<br>or the States could maintain complete neutrality even if&para;<br>they tried assiduously to do so.&para;<br>Rather than fully embracing the arguments made by&para;<br>Windsor and the United States, the Court strikes down §3&para;<br>of DOMA as a classification not properly supported by its&para;<br>objectives. The Court reaches this conclusion in part&para;<br>because it believes that §3 encroaches upon the States’&para;<br>sovereign prerogative to define marriage. See ante, at 21–&para;<br>22 (“As the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its&para;<br>purpose is to discourage enactment of state same-sex&para;<br>marriage laws and to restrict the freedom and choice of&para;<br>couples married under those laws if they are enacted. The&para;<br>congressional goal was ‘to put a thumb on the scales and&para;<br>influence a state’s decision as to how to shape its own&para;<br>marriage laws’ ” (quoting Massachusetts v. United States&para;<br>Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F. 3d 1, 12–13&para;<br>(CA1 2012))). Indeed, the Court’s ultimate conclusion is&para;<br>that DOMA falls afoul of the Fifth Amendment because it&para;<br>“singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled&para;<br>to recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty”&para;<br>and “imposes a disability on the class by refusing to&para;<br>acknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>proper.” Ante, at 25 (emphasis added).&para;<br>To the extent that the Court takes the position that the&para;<br>question of same-sex marriage should be resolved primarily at the state level, I wholeheartedly agree. I hope that&para;<br>the Court will ultimately permit the people of each State&para;<br>to decide this question for themselves. Unless the Court is&para;<br>willing to allow this to occur, the whiffs of federalism in&para;<br>the today’s opinion of the Court will soon be scattered to&para;<br>the wind.&para;<br>In any event, §3 of DOMA, in my view, does not encroach on the prerogatives of the States, assuming of&para;<br>course that the many federal statutes affected by DOMA&para;<br>have not already done so. Section 3 does not prevent any&para;<br>State from recognizing same-sex marriage or from extending to same-sex couples any right, privilege, benefit, or&para;<br>obligation stemming from state law. All that §3 does is to&para;<br>define a class of persons to whom federal law extends certain special benefits and upon whom federal law imposes&para;<br>certain special burdens. In these provisions, Congress&para;<br>used marital status as a way of defining this class—in&para;<br>part, I assume, because it viewed marriage as a valuable institution to be fostered and in part because it viewed&para;<br>married couples as comprising a unique type of economic&para;<br>unit that merits special regulatory treatment. Assuming&para;<br>that Congress has the power under the Constitution to&para;<br>enact the laws affected by §3, Congress has the power to&para;<br>define the category of persons to whom those laws apply.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For these reasons, I would hold that §3 of DOMA does&para;<br>not violate the Fifth Amendment. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
