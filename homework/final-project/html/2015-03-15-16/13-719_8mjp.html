Dart removed the case to the&para;<br>Federal District Court, invoking the Class Action Fairness Act of&para;<br>2005 (CAFA), which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class actions if the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1332(d)(2). Dart’s notice of removal alleged that the purported underpayments totaled over $8.2 million. Owens moved to remand the&para;<br>case to state court, asserting that the removal notice was “deficient&para;<br>as a matter of law” because it included “no evidence” proving that the&para;<br>amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. In response, Dart submitted an executive’s detailed declaration supporting an amount in&para;<br>controversy in excess of $11 million. The District Court granted Owens’ remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof&para;<br>of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself. Dart petitioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see §1453(c)(1),&para;<br>but that court denied review and rehearing en banc.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. As specified in §1446(a), a defendant’s notice of removal need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain evidentiary submissions.&para;<br>Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. By borrowing Rule&para;<br>8(a)’s “short and plain statement” standard, corroborative history indicates, Congress intended to clarify that courts should “apply the&para;<br>same liberal rules [to removal allegations as] to other matters of&para;<br>pleading.” H. R. Rep. No. 100–889, p. 71. The amount-in-controversy&para;<br>allegation of a plaintiff invoking federal-court jurisdiction is accepted&para;<br>if made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,&para;<br>429 U. S. 274, 276. Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation&para;<br>of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted&para;<br>when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. In the&para;<br>event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant’s allegations, both&para;<br>sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the&para;<br>evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been&para;<br>satisfied, see §1446(c)(2)(B).&para;<br>In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in&para;<br>part, on a purported “presumption” against removal, but no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress&para;<br>enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal&para;<br>court. See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___.&para;<br>Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>2. The District Court erred in remanding this case for want of an&para;<br>evidentiary submission in the notice of removal, and the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision. Pp. 7–&para;<br>14.&para;<br>(a) This Court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes&para;<br>settlement of the question presented: whether evidence supporting&para;<br>the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.&para;<br>The case was “in” the Tenth Circuit because of Dart’s application for&para;<br>leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the&para;<br>Court of Appeals did with that application. See 28 U. S. C. §1254;&para;<br>Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 248. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) While appellate review of a remand order is discretionary, exercise of that discretion is not rudderless, see Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., 572 U.

The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations&para;<br>bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under §1453(c)(1).&para;<br>One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of&para;<br>appeals should inquire whether, if a district court’s remand order&para;<br>remains undisturbed, the case will “leave the ambit of the federal&para;<br>courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant]&para;<br>to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] . . . to have a&para;<br>federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.” BP America, Inc. v.

Thus the Tenth Circuit’s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart’s appeal.&para;<br>In practical effect, the Court of Appeals’ denial of review established&para;<br>the law—the requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the&para;<br>removal notice—not simply for this case, but for future CAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defendants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary&para;<br>submission.&para;<br>The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow&para;<br>Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Dart’s amount-in-controversy&para;<br>allegation failed for want of proof.

S. C. §1446(a). When removal is based on diversity of citizenship, an amount-incontroversy requirement must be met. Ordinarily, “the&para;<br>matter in controversy [must] excee[d] the sum or value of&para;<br>$75,000.” §1332(a). In class actions for which the requirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed, §1332(d)&para;<br>(2)(A)–(C), “the matter in controversy [must] excee[d]&para;<br>the sum or value of $5,000,000,” §1332(d)(2).

The complaint&para;<br>sought “a fair and reasonable amount” to compensate&para;<br>putative class members for “damages” they sustained due&para;<br>to the alleged underpayments.

In response, Dart submitted a&para;<br>declaration by one of its executive officers. The declaration included a detailed damages calculation indicating&para;<br>that the amount in controversy, sans interest, exceeded&para;<br>$11 million.&para;<br>Without challenging Dart’s calculation,&para;<br>Owens urged that Dart’s amount-in-controversy submission&para;<br>came too late. “[The] legally deficient [notice of removal],”&para;<br>Owens maintained, could not be cured by “post-removal&para;<br>evidence about the amount in controversy.” Id., at 100a.&para;<br>Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of&para;<br>the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself,&para;<br>the District Court granted Owens’ remand motion. Dart’s&para;<br>declaration, the District Court held, could not serve to&para;<br>keep the case in federal court. The Tenth Circuit, as the&para;<br>District Court read Circuit precedent, “has consistently&para;<br>held that reference to factual allegations or evidence outside of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted&para;<br>to determine the amount in controversy.” App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 26a, and n. 37 (citing Laughlin v. Kmart Corp.,&para;<br>50 F. 3d 871, 873 (1995); Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.,&para;<br>251 F. 3d 1284, 1291, n. 4 (2001); Oklahoma Farm Bureau&para;<br>Mut. Ins. Co. v. JSSJ Corp., 149 Fed. Appx. 775 (2005)).&para;<br>Ordinarily, remand orders “[are] not reviewable on&para;<br>appeal or otherwise.” §1447(d). There is an exception,&para;<br>however, for cases invoking CAFA. §1453(c)(1). In such&para;<br>cases, “a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an&para;<br>order of a district court granting or denying a motion to&para;<br>remand.” Ibid. Citing this exception, Dart petitioned the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal. “Upon careful&para;<br>consideration of the parties’ submissions, as well as the&para;<br>applicable law,” the Tenth Circuit panel, dividing two-toone, denied review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a–14a.&para;<br>An evenly divided court denied Dart’s petition for en&para;<br>banc review. Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en&para;<br>banc, Judge Hartz observed that the Tenth Circuit “[had]&para;<br>let stand a district-court decision that will in effect impose&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in this circuit requirements for notices of removal that are&para;<br>even more onerous than the code pleading requirements&para;<br>that . . . federal courts abandoned long ago.” 730 F. 3d&para;<br>1234 (2013). The Tenth Circuit was duty-bound to grant&para;<br>Dart’s petition for rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz urged,&para;<br>because the opportunity “to correct the law in our circuit”&para;<br>likely would not arise again. Id., at 1235. Henceforth,&para;<br>Judge Hartz explained, “any diligent attorney . . . would&para;<br>submit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a&para;<br>chance on remand to state court.” Ibid.&para;<br>Dart filed a petition for certiorari in this Court requesting resolution of the following question: “Whether a defendant seeking removal to federal court is required to&para;<br>include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the&para;<br>notice of removal, or is alleging the required ‘short and&para;<br>plain statement of the grounds for removal’ enough?” Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. i. Owens’ brief in opposition raised no impediment to this Court’s review. (Nor, later, did Owens’ merits&para;<br>brief suggest any barrier to our consideration of Dart’s&para;<br>petition.) We granted certiorari to resolve a division&para;<br>among the Circuits on the question presented. 572 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2014). Compare Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., 519 F. 3d 192, 200 (CA4 2008) (a removing party’s&para;<br>notice of removal need not “meet a higher pleading standard than the one imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an&para;<br>initial complaint”), and Spivey v. Vertrue, Inc., 528 F. 3d&para;<br>982, 986 (CA7 2008) (similar), with Laughlin, 50 F. 3d, at&para;<br>873 (“the requisite amount in controversy . . . must be&para;<br>affirmatively established on the face of either the petition&para;<br>or the removal notice”).&para;<br>II&para;<br>As noted above, a defendant seeking to remove a case to&para;<br>a federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of&para;<br>removal “containing a short and plain statement of the&para;<br>grounds for removal.” §1446(a). By design, §1446(a)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule&para;<br>8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 14C C.&para;<br>Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; J. Steinman, Federal&para;<br>Practice and Procedure §3733, pp. 639–641 (4th ed. 2009)&para;<br>(“Section 1446(a) requires only that the grounds for removal be stated in ‘a short and plain statement’—terms&para;<br>borrowed from the pleading requirement set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).”). The legislative history&para;<br>of §1446(a) is corroborative. Congress, by borrowing the&para;<br>familiar “short and plain statement” standard from Rule&para;<br>8(a), intended to “simplify the ‘pleading’ requirements for&para;<br>removal” and to clarify that courts should “apply the same&para;<br>liberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to&para;<br>other matters of pleading.” H. R. Rep. No. 100–889, p. 71&para;<br>(1988). See also ibid. (disapproving decisions requiring&para;<br>“detailed pleading”).&para;<br>When a plaintiff invokes federal-court jurisdiction, the&para;<br>plaintiff ’s amount-in-controversy allegation is accepted if&para;<br>made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.&para;<br>v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 276 (1977) (“ ‘[T]he sum claimed by&para;<br>the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in&para;<br>good faith.’ ”) (quoting St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.&para;<br>Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 288 (1938); alteration in original). Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court&para;<br>adjudication, the defendant’s amount-in-controversy allegation should be accepted when not contested by the&para;<br>plaintiff or questioned by the court. Indeed, the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demanding proof together with the removal notice, recognized that&para;<br>it was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and&para;<br>removing defendants differently with regard to the&para;<br>amount in controversy. See McPhail v. Deere &amp; Co., 529&para;<br>F. 3d 947, 953 (2008) (requiring proof by defendant but not&para;<br>by plaintiff “bears no evident logical relationship either to&para;<br>the purpose of diversity jurisdiction, or to the principle&para;<br>that those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>establish its prerequisites”).&para;<br>If the plaintiff contests the defendant’s allegation,&para;<br>§1446(c)(2)(B) instructs: “[R]emoval . . . is proper on the&para;<br>basis of an amount in controversy asserted” by the defendant “if the district court finds, by the preponderance of the&para;<br>evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds” the&para;<br>jurisdictional threshold.1 This provision, added to §1446&para;<br>as part of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue&para;<br>Clarification Act of 2011 (JVCA), clarifies the procedure in&para;<br>order when a defendant’s assertion of the amount in controversy is challenged. In such a case, both sides submit&para;<br>proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the&para;<br>evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement&para;<br>has been satisfied. As the House Judiciary Committee&para;<br>Report on the JVCA observed:&para;<br>“[D]efendants do not need to prove to a legal certainty&para;<br>that the amount in controversy requirement has been&para;<br>met. Rather, defendants may simply allege or assert&para;<br>that the jurisdictional threshold has been met. Discovery may be taken with regard to that question. In&para;<br>case of a dispute, the district court must make findings of jurisdictional fact to which the preponderance&para;<br>standard applies.” H. R. Rep. No. 112–10, p. 16&para;<br>(2011).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Section 1446(c)(2) applies to removals “sought on the basis of the&para;<br>jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a),” and §1446(c)(2)(B) provides&para;<br>that “removal of the action is proper . . . [if] the amount in controversy&para;<br>exceeds the [in excess of $75,000] amount specified in section 1332(a)”&para;<br>(emphasis added). We assume, without deciding, a point the parties do&para;<br>not dispute: Sections 1446(c)(2) and 1446(c)(2)(B) apply to cases removed under §1332(d)(2), and removal is proper if the amount in&para;<br>controversy exceeds $5 million, the amount specified in §1332(d)(2).&para;<br>See Frederick v.

Co., 585 F. 3d 33,&para;<br>38–39 (CA1 2009)).4 When the CAFA-related question&para;<br>presented in an appeal from a remand order is “important,&para;<br>unsettled, and recurrent,” the First Circuit instructed, a&para;<br>court of appeals should inquire: “Absent an interlocutory&para;<br>appeal, [will the question] in all probability escape meaningful appellate review.” Id., at 39. Or, as phrased by the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit, if a district court’s remand order remains&para;<br>undisturbed, will the case “leave the ambit of the federal&para;<br>courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the&para;<br>defendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] . . . to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the&para;<br>merits.” BP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035. See also Coffey&para;<br>v.

Thus,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent (hereafter dissent) faults Dart for asserting, late in the day, that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, observing that Dart did so only in its reply brief.

OWENS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Tenth Circuit’s own guide weighed heavily in favor of&para;<br>accepting Dart’s appeal. That the Court of Appeals, instead, rejected Dart’s appeal strongly suggests that the&para;<br>panel thought the District Court got it right in requiring&para;<br>proof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.&para;<br>In practical effect, the Court of Appeals’ denial of review&para;<br>established the law not simply for this case, but for future&para;<br>CAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit. The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in&para;<br>which the Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule&para;<br>that both Owens and the District Court ascribed to decisions of the Court of Appeals: Defendants seeking to remove under CAFA must be sent back to state court unless&para;<br>they submit with the notice of removal evidence proving&para;<br>the alleged amount in controversy. See supra, at 3. On&para;<br>this point, Judge Hartz’s observation, dissenting from the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en banc, see supra, at&para;<br>4, bears recounting in full:&para;<br>“After today’s decision any diligent attorney (and one&para;<br>can assume that an attorney representing a defendant&para;<br>in a case involving at least $5 million—the threshold&para;<br>for removal under CAFA—would have substantial incentive to be diligent) would submit to the evidentiary&para;<br>burden rather than take a chance on remand to state&para;<br>court.” 730 F. 3d, at 1235.&para;<br>With no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray,&para;<br>Judge Hartz anticipated, “the issue will not arise again.”&para;<br>Ibid. Consequently, the law applied by the District&para;<br>Court—demanding that the notice of removal contain&para;<br>evidence documenting the amount in controversy—will be&para;<br>frozen in place for all venues within the Tenth Circuit.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent suggests that the Tenth Circuit may have another opportunity to set Circuit precedent straight: A lawyer may be irresponsible or fail to learn from Dart’s experience; or perhaps a lawyer will put&para;<br>in evidence the district court deems insufficient, and then have a go at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

What did the parties submit to the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit? Their presentations urged conflicting views on&para;<br>whether a removing defendant must tender prima facie&para;<br>proof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal&para;<br>notice. And what was “the applicable law” other than the&para;<br>rule recited by the Tenth Circuit in Laughlin and follow-on&para;<br>decisions, i.e., to remove successfully, a defendant must&para;<br>present with the notice of removal evidence proving the&para;<br>amount in controversy.6&para;<br>From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth Circuit’s denial of Dart’s request for review of the remand&para;<br>order was infected by legal error. The District Court erred&para;<br>in ruling that Dart’s amount-in-controversy allegation&para;<br>failed for want of proof, but that error was driven by the&para;<br>District Court’s conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit&para;<br>——————&para;<br>arguing that the evidence was sufficient and, in any event, “no evidence&para;<br>is required at all.” Post, at 5–6. That such a case will occur, and that&para;<br>the Tenth Circuit would then seize the very opportunity it passed up in&para;<br>Dart’s case, is hardly probable.&para;<br>6 The dissent posits that “the applicable law” might have been something other than the law governing the parties’ submissions. Post, at 3,&para;<br>4. That is a strained reading of the Tenth Circuit’s expression. Perhaps the Tenth Circuit found this case a “poor vehicle,” the dissent&para;<br>suggests, post, at 2, but no potential vehicle concerns were urged by&para;<br>Owens, and the dissent identifies none. Or the Tenth Circuit might&para;<br>have doubted its “ability to quickly resolve the issue” within the 60-day&para;<br>time limit provided in §1453(c)(2)–(3). Ibid.; see also post, at 4. Section&para;<br>1453(c)’s timing provision, however, was designed to promote expedition, not to discourage Courts of Appeals from acting on petitions for&para;<br>appeal. As a third “maybe,” the dissent observes that proof of the&para;<br>amount in controversy in removal notices is not “a question unique to&para;<br>[CAFA].” Post, at 3. True, the Tenth Circuit demands such proof in&para;<br>ordinary diversity cases. See Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F. 3d 871,&para;<br>873 (1995).

The parties trained their arguments in the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit, as they did here, on the question whether&para;<br>Dart could successfully remove without detailing in the&para;<br>removal notice evidence of the amount in controversy. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (acknowledgment by Owens’ counsel&para;<br>that “the issues . . . provided to . . . the Tenth Circuit were&para;<br>very similar to what you see in this Court, with the exception of [the question raised by Public Citizen] whether this&para;<br>Court has jurisdiction”). Dissenting from the denial of&para;<br>rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why&para;<br>the Tenth Circuit “owe[d] a duty to the bench and bar” to&para;<br>correct the District Court’s misperception and to state as&para;<br>the Circuit’s law: “[A] defendant seeking removal under&para;<br>CAFA need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its&para;<br>notice of removal and must prove that amount only if the&para;<br>plaintiff challenges the allegation.” 730 F. 3d, at 1234,&para;<br>1238. In this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cautioned against casual rulings on applications like Dart’s.&para;<br>“The decision whether to grant leave to appeal” under&para;<br>§1453(c), the Tenth Circuit stressed, calls for the exercise&para;<br>of the reviewing court’s correctly “informed discretion.”&para;<br>BP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see&para;<br>supra, at 8–9.&para;<br>Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his&para;<br>written submissions to this Court that anything other&para;<br>than the question presented accounts for the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ disposition. If Owens believed that the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit’s denial of leave to appeal rested on some other&para;<br>ground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition or,&para;<br>at least, in his merits brief. See this Court’s Rule 15.2;&para;<br>Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U.

Doing so froze the governing rule in&para;<br>the Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices,&para;<br>with no opportunity for defendants in Dart’s position&para;<br>responsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.&para;<br>That situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who&para;<br>did not think that the amount in controversy in diversity&para;<br>cases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by&para;<br>evidence, not merely credibly allege.7 And if the Circuit&para;<br>precedent on which the District Court relied misstated the&para;<br>law, as we hold it did, then the District Court’s order&para;<br>remanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by&para;<br>legal error.&para;<br>Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues&para;<br>Public Citizen invites us to separate—whether the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit abused its discretion in denying review, and&para;<br>whether the District Court’s remand order was erroneous—do not pose genuinely discrete questions. Instead,&para;<br>resolution of both issues depends on the answer to the&para;<br>very same question: What must the removal notice contain? If the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit abused its discretion in effectively making the&para;<br>opposing view the law of the Circuit. By the same token,&para;<br>the District Court erred in remanding the case for want of&para;<br>an evidentiary submission in the removal notice.

After briefing we discovered a little snag:&para;<br>This case does not present that question. Because we are&para;<br>reviewing the Tenth Circuit’s judgment, the only question&para;<br>before us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District&para;<br>Court’s remand order. Once we found out that the issue&para;<br>presented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to&para;<br>review, the responsible course would have been to confess&para;<br>error and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.&para;<br>The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the&para;<br>District Court erred in remanding this case to state court.&para;<br>How can it do that, one might ask, when the only issue in&para;<br>this case concerns the propriety of the Tenth Circuit’s&para;<br>rejection of Dart’s appeal? The Court hits upon a solution:&para;<br>It concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the&para;<br>appeal because it agreed with the District Court’s analysis.&para;<br>Attributing the District Court’s reasoning to the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit allows the Court to pretend to review the appellate&para;<br>court’s exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the&para;<br>trial court’s legal analysis.&para;<br>There are problems with this approach that are, in a&para;<br>rational world, insuperable. To begin with, the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit’s short order does not tell us why it decided not to&para;<br>hear Dart’s appeal. It might have done so for an impermissible reason—for example, agreement with the District&para;<br>Court’s legal reasoning. But it might instead have done so&para;<br>for countless other, permissible, reasons—for example, a&para;<br>concern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the&para;<br>issue presented by Dart’s appeal, or a concern regarding&para;<br>the court’s ability to quickly resolve the issue, see&para;<br>§1453(c)(2)–(3) (providing that appeals accepted under&para;<br>§1453(c)(1) must be decided within 60 days, absent consent of the parties, with a 10-day extension for “good cause&para;<br>shown and in the interests of justice”).&para;<br>Not long ago we held, unanimously, that “[a]n appellate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>court should not presume that a district court intended an&para;<br>incorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible&para;<br>of a correct reading, particularly when the applicable&para;<br>standard of review is deferential.” Sprint/United Management Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U. S. 379, 386 (2008).&para;<br>There, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely&para;<br>what the Court itself does today in reviewing (deferentially) the Tenth Circuit’s denial of permission to appeal:&para;<br>presuming that the lower court adopted a legally erroneous argument advanced by one party. Id., at 384–385. We&para;<br>explained to the Tenth Circuit that “it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent indication&para;<br>in the District Court’s opinion, that the lower court adopted&para;<br>a party’s incorrect argument.” Id., at 385, n. 2 (emphasis added). Today, however, this Court blatantly violates&para;<br>that rule.&para;<br>The only “indication in the opinion” that the Court relies&para;<br>on is the following language from the order denying permission to appeal: “Upon careful consideration of [1] the&para;<br>parties’ submissions, as well as [2] the applicable law, the&para;<br>Petition [for permission to appeal the remand order] is&para;<br>denied.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a–14a. This, the Court&para;<br>tells us, means the Tenth Circuit must have denied Dart’s&para;<br>petition because it agreed with the District Court’s legal&para;<br>conclusion. Of course it means no such thing.&para;<br>As for point [1], considering a submission is not the&para;<br>same thing as agreeing with that submission. Worse still,&para;<br>correctness of the District Court’s opinion was not the only&para;<br>ground that Owens’ brief in the Tenth Circuit urged to&para;<br>support denial of the petition for review. It noted, for&para;<br>example, that the case addressed the general removal&para;<br>statute, §1446(a), and so did not involve a question unique&para;<br>to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA).

After all, the “applicable law” surely includes&para;<br>the law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal,&para;<br>§1453(c)(1), and that body of law includes countless reasons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to&para;<br>the merits of the underlying district court judgment.&para;<br>“Applicable law” would allow the Tenth Circuit, for example, to deny permission to appeal for reasons not mentioned in the parties’ briefing. It would allow it to deny&para;<br>permission because it would be unable to resolve the issue&para;<br>within 60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an extension). §1453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F. 3d 1234, 1238&para;<br>(Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“It&para;<br>will always be tempting for very busy judges to deny&para;<br>review of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short&para;<br>order”). And “applicable law” would permit numerous&para;<br>other grounds for denial, including those applied by this&para;<br>Court in denying petitions for certiorari. There is, to tell&para;<br>the truth, absolutely nothing in the Tenth Circuit’s order&para;<br>to suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the&para;<br>Court eagerly attributes to it, rather than one of many&para;<br>possible lawful grounds. Thus, as we said in Mendelsohn,&para;<br>“it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court [us] to&para;<br>assume . . . that the lower court adopted a party’s incorrect&para;<br>argument.” 552 U. S., at 385, n. 2.&para;<br>Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of&para;<br>the order, the Court makes one other attempt to demonstrate that the Tenth Circuit’s order was based upon its&para;<br>agreement with the holding of the District Court. It asserts that denying Dart permission to appeal “froz[e] in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>place” the District Court’s rule. Ante, at 10. In light of&para;<br>that denial, the Court says, any “responsible attorney” will&para;<br>include evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of&para;<br>removal, thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice&para;<br>held improper for the reason given by the District Court in&para;<br>this case. As a result, the Tenth Circuit will likely never&para;<br>again be presented with the question whether evidence of&para;<br>jurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.&para;<br>Ibid. The Court then notes that, among the many factors&para;<br>the Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to accept&para;<br>an appeal under §1453(c)(1), is whether the case presents&para;<br>an issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will “leave&para;<br>the ambit of the federal courts for good.” BP America,&para;<br>supra, at 1035. One would have thought that this factor,&para;<br>if it controlled the Tenth Circuit’s denial, means that the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit did not agree with the Court’s perception&para;<br>that this issue will not likely reappear. The Court, however, says (quite illogically) that it means the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit must have agreed with the District Court’s incorrect&para;<br>legal analysis. It is hard to imagine a more obvious non&para;<br>sequitur.&para;<br>And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts&para;<br>reality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth&para;<br>no “responsible attorney” will fail to include evidence&para;<br>supporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of removal.&para;<br>Even discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys,&para;<br>but see, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___ (2012),&para;<br>responsible attorneys, and even responsible judges, sometimes make mistakes, see, e.g., 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (order&para;<br>granting certiorari in this case). Indeed, Dart’s own&para;<br>(seemingly responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence&para;<br>supporting federal jurisdiction, despite what they argue is&para;<br>Circuit precedent supporting the District Court’s holding.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that&para;<br>the District Court’s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit&para;<br>precedent).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v.

S. C. §1254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of&para;<br>jurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals to deny an application for permission to&para;<br>appeal a remand order. But such an application is not a&para;<br>case: It “ ‘does not assert a grievance against anyone, does&para;<br>not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does&para;<br>not even require a “party” on the other side.’ ” Miller-El v.&para;<br>Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 355 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 256&para;<br>(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).&para;<br>To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends&para;<br>an opinion of this Court holding that applications for&para;<br>certificates of appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas&para;<br>context are “cases.” Hohn, supra. Hohn was wrongly&para;<br>decided, and the majority’s uncritical extension of its&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>holding only compounds the error. Hohn rests tenuously&para;<br>on the conclusion that the determination that must be&para;<br>made on an application for a COA is more like a threshold&para;<br>determination than a separate judicial proceeding. See&para;<br>id., at 246–248. The basis for that conclusion, if any exists, must rest on features unique to the COA: “The COA&para;<br>determination . . . requires an overview of the claims in the&para;<br>habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.”&para;<br>Miller-El, supra, at 336 (emphasis added). The best argument one could make in favor of Hohn is that, because a&para;<br>court’s decision on an application for a COA turns on the&para;<br>strength of the applicant’s grievance and his entitlement&para;<br>to relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of&para;<br>the underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.&para;<br>No such osmosis could transform an application for&para;<br>permission to appeal a remand order into a “case.” As&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA explains, the decision whether to permit&para;<br>such an appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a&para;<br>remand order. See ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). The&para;<br>application here is nothing more than a request for discretionary permission to seek review. See Miller-El, supra, at&para;<br>355 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Tenth Circuit having&para;<br>denied that permission, no “case” ever arrived “in the&para;<br>court of appeals.” I would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
