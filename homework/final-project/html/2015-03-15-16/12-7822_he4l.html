CALIFORNIA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,&para;<br>&para;<br>SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 12–7822. Argued November 13, 2013—Decided February 25, 2014&para;<br>Police officers observed a suspect in a violent robbery run into an&para;<br>apartment building, and heard screams coming from one of the&para;<br>apartments. They knocked on the apartment door, which was answered by Roxanne Rojas, who appeared to be battered and bleeding.&para;<br>When the officers asked her to step out of the apartment so that they&para;<br>could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner came to the door and objected. Suspecting that he had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed&para;<br>petitioner from the apartment and placed him under arrest. He was&para;<br>then identified as the perpetrator in the earlier robbery and taken to&para;<br>the police station. An officer later returned to the apartment and, after obtaining Rojas’ oral and written consent, searched the premises,&para;<br>where he found several items linking petitioner to the robbery. The&para;<br>trial court denied petitioner’s motion to suppress that evidence, and&para;<br>he was convicted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. It held&para;<br>that because petitioner was not present when Rojas consented to the&para;<br>search, the exception to permissible warrantless consent searches of&para;<br>jointly occupied premises that arises when one of the occupants present objects to the search, Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, did not&para;<br>apply, and therefore, petitioner’s suppression motion had been&para;<br>properly denied.&para;<br>Held: Randolph does not extend to this situation, where Rojas’ consent&para;<br>was provided well after petitioner had been removed from their&para;<br>apartment. Pp. 5–15.&para;<br>(a) Consent searches are permissible warrantless searches,&para;<br>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 228, 231–232, and are&para;<br>clearly reasonable when the consent comes from the sole occupant of&para;<br>the premises. When multiple occupants are involved, the rule extends to the search of the premises or effects of an absent, noncon-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>senting occupant so long as “the consent of one who possesses common authority over [the] premises or effects” is obtained. United&para;<br>States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 170. However, when “a physically&para;<br>present inhabitan[t]” refuses to consent, that refusal “is dispositive as&para;<br>to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.” Randolph,&para;<br>547 U. S., at 122–123. A controlling factor in Randolph was the objecting occupant’s physical presence. See, e.g., id., at 106, 108, 109,&para;<br>114. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(b) Petitioner contends that, though he was not present when Rojas&para;<br>consented, Randolph nevertheless controls, but neither of his arguments is sound. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(1) He first argues that his absence should not matter since it occurred only because the police had taken him away. Dictum in Randolph suggesting that consent by one occupant might not be sufficient&para;<br>if “there is evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible&para;<br>objection,” 547 U. S., at 121, is best understood to refer to situations&para;<br>in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively reasonable. Petitioner does not contest the fact that the police had reasonable grounds for his removal or the existence of probable cause for&para;<br>his arrest. He was thus in the same position as an occupant absent&para;<br>for any other reason. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(2) Petitioner also argues that the objection he made while at the&para;<br>threshold remained effective until he changed his mind and withdrew&para;<br>it. This is inconsistent with Randolph in at least two important&para;<br>ways. It cannot be squared with the “widely shared social expectations” or “customary social usage” upon which Randolph’s holding&para;<br>was based. 547 U. S., at 111, 121. It also creates the sort of practical&para;<br>complications that Randolph sought to avoid by adopting a “formalis[tic]” rule, id., at 121, e.g., requiring that the scope of an objection’s&para;<br>duration and the procedures necessary to register a continuing objection be defined. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(c) Petitioner claims that his expansive interpretation of Randolph&para;<br>would not hamper law enforcement because in most cases where officers have probable cause to arrest a physically present objector they&para;<br>also have probable cause to obtain a warrant to search the premises&para;<br>that the objector does not want them to enter. But he misunderstands the constitutional status of consent searches, which are permissible irrespective of the availability of a warrant. Requiring officers to obtain a warrant when a warrantless search is justified may&para;<br>interfere with law enforcement strategies and impose an unmerited&para;<br>burden on the person willing to consent to an immediate search.&para;<br>Pp. 14–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>208 Cal.

See United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164&para;<br>(1974). In Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), we&para;<br>recognized a narrow exception to this rule, holding that&para;<br>the consent of one occupant is insufficient when another&para;<br>occupant is present and objects to the search. In this case,&para;<br>we consider whether Randolph applies if the objecting&para;<br>occupant is absent when another occupant consents. Our&para;<br>opinion in Randolph took great pains to emphasize that its&para;<br>holding was limited to situations in which the objecting&para;<br>occupant is physically present. We therefore refuse to&para;<br>extend Randolph to the very different situation in this&para;<br>case, where consent was provided by an abused woman&para;<br>well after her male partner had been removed from the&para;<br>apartment they shared.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 We&para;<br>&para;<br>use the terms “occupant,” “resident,” and “tenant” interchangeably to refer to persons having “common authority” over premises within&para;<br>the meaning of Matlock. See United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164,&para;<br>171, n. 7 (1974).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The events involved in this case occurred in Los Angeles&para;<br>in October 2009. After observing Abel Lopez cash a check,&para;<br>petitioner Walter Fernandez approached Lopez and asked&para;<br>about the neighborhood in which he lived. When Lopez&para;<br>responded that he was from Mexico, Fernandez laughed&para;<br>and told Lopez that he was in territory ruled by the&para;<br>“D.F.S.,” i.e., the “Drifters” gang. App. 4–5. Petitioner&para;<br>then pulled out a knife and pointed it at Lopez’ chest.&para;<br>Lopez raised his hand in self-defense, and petitioner cut&para;<br>him on the wrist.&para;<br>Lopez ran from the scene and called 911 for help, but&para;<br>petitioner whistled, and four men emerged from a nearby&para;<br>apartment building and attacked Lopez. After knocking&para;<br>him to the ground, they hit and kicked him and took his&para;<br>cell phone and his wallet, which contained $400 in cash.&para;<br>A police dispatch reported the incident and mentioned&para;<br>the possibility of gang involvement, and two Los Angeles&para;<br>police officers, Detective Clark and Officer Cirrito, drove&para;<br>to an alley frequented by members of the Drifters. A man&para;<br>who appeared scared walked by the officers and said:&para;<br>“ ‘[T]he guy is in the apartment.’ ” Id., at 5. The officers&para;<br>then observed a man run through the alley and into the&para;<br>building to which the man was pointing. A minute or two&para;<br>later, the officers heard sounds of screaming and fighting&para;<br>coming from that building.&para;<br>After backup arrived, the officers knocked on the door of&para;<br>the apartment unit from which the screams had been&para;<br>heard. Roxanne Rojas answered the door. She was holding a baby and appeared to be crying. Her face was red,&para;<br>and she had a large bump on her nose. The officers also&para;<br>saw blood on her shirt and hand from what appeared to be&para;<br>a fresh injury. Rojas told the police that she had been in a&para;<br>fight. Officer Cirrito asked if anyone else was in the&para;<br>apartment, and Rojas said that her 4-year-old son was the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>only other person present.&para;<br>After Officer Cirrito asked Rojas to step out of the&para;<br>apartment so that he could conduct a protective sweep,&para;<br>petitioner appeared at the door wearing only boxer shorts.&para;<br>Apparently agitated, petitioner stepped forward and said,&para;<br>“ ‘You don’t have any right to come in here. I know my&para;<br>rights.’ ” Id., at 6. Suspecting that petitioner had assaulted&para;<br>Rojas, the officers removed him from the apartment&para;<br>and then placed him under arrest. Lopez identified petitioner as his initial attacker, and petitioner was taken to&para;<br>the police station for booking.&para;<br>Approximately one hour after petitioner’s arrest, Detective Clark returned to the apartment and informed Rojas&para;<br>that petitioner had been arrested. Detective Clark requested and received both oral and written consent from&para;<br>Rojas to search the premises.2 In the apartment, the&para;<br>police found Drifters gang paraphernalia, a butterfly&para;<br>knife, clothing worn by the robbery suspect, and ammunition. Rojas’ young son also showed the officers where&para;<br>petitioner had hidden a sawed-off shotgun.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner was charged with robbery, Cal. Penal Code&para;<br>Ann. §211 (West 2008), infliction of corporal injury on a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Both petitioner and the dissent suggest that Rojas’ consent was&para;<br>coerced. Post, at 9, n. 5 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). But the trial court&para;<br>found otherwise, App. 152, and the correctness of that finding is not&para;<br>before us. In suggesting that Rojas’ consent was coerced, the dissent&para;<br>recites portions of Rojas’ testimony from the suppression hearing that&para;<br>the trial judge appears to have rejected. Ibid. Similarly, the jury&para;<br>plainly did not find Rojas to be credible. At trial, she testified for the&para;<br>defense and told the jury, among other things, that the wounds observed by the officers who came to her door were not inflicted by petitioner but by a woman looking for petitioner during a fight. 208 Cal.&para;<br>App. 4th 100, 109–110, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d 51, 56 (2012).

Petitioner then pleaded nolo contendere to the firearms and ammunition charges. On the remaining counts—for robbery and infliction of corporal&para;<br>injury—he went to trial and was found guilty by a jury.&para;<br>The court sentenced him to 14 years of imprisonment.&para;<br>The California Court of Appeal affirmed. 208 Cal. App.&para;<br>4th 100, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d 51 (2012). Because Randolph&para;<br>did not overturn our prior decisions recognizing that an&para;<br>occupant may give effective consent to search a shared&para;<br>residence, the court agreed with the majority of the federal&para;<br>circuits that an objecting occupant’s physical presence is&para;<br>“indispensible to the decision in Randolph.” Id., at 122,&para;<br>145 Cal.

King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 5). Our cases establish that a warrant is&para;<br>generally required for a search of a home, Brigham City v.&para;<br>Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006), but “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’ ” ibid.;&para;<br>see also Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. 45, 47 (2009) ( per&para;<br>curiam). And certain categories of permissible warrantless searches have long been recognized.&para;<br>Consent searches occupy one of these categories. “Consent searches are part of the standard investigatory&para;<br>techniques of law enforcement agencies” and are “a constitutionally permissible and wholly legitimate aspect of&para;<br>effective police activity.” Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412&para;<br>U. S. 218, 228, 231–232 (1973). It would be unreasonable—&para;<br>indeed, absurd—to require police officers to obtain a warrant when the sole owner or occupant of a house or apartment voluntarily consents to a search. The owner of a&para;<br>home has a right to allow others to enter and examine the&para;<br>premises, and there is no reason why the owner should not&para;<br>be permitted to extend this same privilege to police officers&para;<br>if that is the owner’s choice.

CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that he or she is under suspicion, the owner may want the&para;<br>police to search the premises so that their suspicions are&para;<br>dispelled. This may be particularly important where the&para;<br>owner has a strong interest in the apprehension of the&para;<br>perpetrator of a crime and believes that the suspicions of&para;<br>the police are deflecting the course of their investigation.&para;<br>An owner may want the police to search even where they&para;<br>lack probable cause, and if a warrant were always required, this could not be done. And even where the police&para;<br>could establish probable cause, requiring a warrant despite the owner’s consent would needlessly inconvenience&para;<br>everyone involved—not only the officers and the magistrate but also the occupant of the premises, who would&para;<br>generally either be compelled or would feel a need to stay&para;<br>until the search was completed. Michigan v. Summers,&para;<br>452 U. S. 692, 701 (1981).4&para;<br>While it is clear that a warrantless search is reasonable&para;<br>when the sole occupant of a house or apartment consents,&para;<br>what happens when there are two or more occupants?&para;<br>Must they all consent? Must they all be asked? Is consent&para;<br>by one occupant enough? The Court faced that problem 40&para;<br>years ago in United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164&para;<br>(1974).&para;<br>In that case, Matlock and a woman named Graff were&para;<br>living together in a house that was also occupied by several&para;<br>of Graff ’s siblings and by her mother, who had rented&para;<br>the house. While in the front yard of the house, Matlock&para;<br>was arrested for bank robbery and was placed in a squad&para;<br>car. Although the police could have easily asked him for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 A main theme of the dissent is that the police in this case had probable cause to search the apartment and therefore could have obtained a&para;<br>warrant. Of course, this will not always be so in cases in which one&para;<br>occupant consents to a search and the other objects, and the dissent&para;<br>does not suggest that a warrant should be required only when probable&para;<br>cause is present. As a result, the dissent’s repeated references to the&para;<br>availability of a warrant in this case are beside the point.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Instead, they knocked on the door and&para;<br>obtained Graff ’s permission to search. The search yielded&para;<br>incriminating evidence, which the defendant sought to&para;<br>suppress, but this Court held that Graff ’s consent justified&para;<br>the warrantless search. As the Court put it, “the consent&para;<br>of one who possesses common authority over premises or&para;<br>effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared.” Id., at 170.&para;<br>In Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177 (1990), the Court&para;<br>reaffirmed and extended the Matlock holding. In Rodriguez, a woman named Fischer told police officers that she&para;<br>had been assaulted by Rodriguez in what she termed “ ‘our’&para;<br>apartment.” 497 U. S., at 179. She also informed the&para;<br>officers that Rodriguez was asleep in the apartment, and&para;<br>she then accompanied the officers to that unit. When they&para;<br>arrived, the officers could have knocked on the door and&para;<br>awakened Rodriguez, and had they done so, Rodriguez&para;<br>might well have surrendered at the door and objected to&para;<br>the officers’ entry. Instead, Fischer unlocked the door, the&para;<br>officers entered without a warrant, and they saw drug&para;<br>paraphernalia and containers filled with white powder in&para;<br>plain view.&para;<br>After the search, the police learned that Fischer no&para;<br>longer resided at the apartment, and this Court held that&para;<br>she did not have common authority over the premises at&para;<br>the time in question. The Court nevertheless held that&para;<br>the warrantless entry was lawful because the police reasonably believed that Fischer was a resident. Id., at 188–&para;<br>189.&para;<br>B&para;<br>While consent by one resident of jointly occupied premises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless search,&para;<br>we recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.&para;<br>Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006). In that case, police offi-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cers responded to the Randolphs’ home after receiving a&para;<br>report of a domestic dispute. When the officers arrived,&para;<br>Janet Randolph informed the officers that her estranged&para;<br>husband, Scott Randolph, was a cocaine user and that&para;<br>there were “items of drug evidence” in the house. Id., at&para;<br>107 (internal quotation marks omitted). The officers first&para;<br>asked Scott for consent to search, but he “unequivocally&para;<br>refused.” Ibid. The officers then turned to Janet, and she&para;<br>consented to the search, which produced evidence that was&para;<br>later used to convict Scott for possession of cocaine.&para;<br>Without questioning the prior holdings in Matlock and&para;<br>Rodriguez, this Court held that Janet Randolph’s consent&para;<br>was insufficient under the circumstances to justify the&para;<br>warrantless search. The Court reiterated the proposition&para;<br>that a person who shares a residence with others assumes&para;<br>the risk that “any one of them may admit visitors, with&para;<br>the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may nevertheless be admitted in his absence by another.” 547 U. S.,&para;<br>at 111. But the Court held that “a physically present&para;<br>inhabitant’s express refusal of consent to a police search&para;<br>[of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the&para;<br>consent of a fellow occupant.” Id., at 122–123 (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>The Court’s opinion went to great lengths to make clear&para;<br>that its holding was limited to situations in which the&para;<br>objecting occupant is present. Again and again, the opinion of the Court stressed this controlling factor. See id., at&para;<br>106 (“present at the scene”); ibid. (“physically present”);&para;<br>id., at 108 (“a co-tenant who is present”); id., at 109&para;<br>(“physically present”); id., at 114 (“a present and objecting&para;<br>co-tenant”); id., at 119 (a co-tenant “standing at the door&para;<br>and expressly refusing consent”); id., at 120 (“a physically&para;<br>present resident”), id., at 121 (“a physically present fellow&para;<br>tenant objects”); ibid. (“[A] potential defendant with selfinterest in objecting is at the door and objects”); id., at 122&para;<br>(“[A] physically present inhabitant’s express refusal of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

The&para;<br>Court’s opinion could hardly have been clearer on this&para;<br>point, and the separate opinion filed by JUSTICE BREYER,&para;<br>whose vote was decisive, was equally unambiguous. See&para;<br>id., at 126 (concurring) (“The Court’s opinion does not&para;<br>apply where the objector is not present ‘and object[ing]’ ”).&para;<br>III&para;<br>In this case, petitioner was not present when Rojas&para;<br>consented, but petitioner still contends that Randolph is&para;<br>controlling. He advances two main arguments. First, he&para;<br>claims that his absence should not matter since he was&para;<br>absent only because the police had taken him away.&para;<br>Second, he maintains that it was sufficient that he objected&para;<br>to the search while he was still present. Such an objection, he says, should remain in effect until the objecting&para;<br>party “no longer wishes to keep the police out of his home.”&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 8. Neither of these arguments is&para;<br>sound.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We first consider the argument that the presence of the&para;<br>objecting occupant is not necessary when the police are&para;<br>responsible for his absence. In Randolph, the Court suggested in dictum that consent by one occupant might not&para;<br>be sufficient if “there is evidence that the police have&para;<br>removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.” 547&para;<br>U. S., at 121. We do not believe the statement should be&para;<br>read to suggest that improper motive may invalidate&para;<br>objectively justified removal. Hence, it does not govern&para;<br>here.&para;<br>The Randolph dictum is best understood not to require&para;<br>an inquiry into the subjective intent of officers who detain&para;<br>or arrest a potential objector but instead to refer to situations in which the removal of the potential objector is not&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>objectively reasonable. As petitioner acknowledges, see&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 25, our Fourth Amendment cases&para;<br>“have repeatedly rejected” a subjective approach.&para;<br>Brigham City, 547 U.

Brief for Petitioner 9. It simply&para;<br>accepts Randolph on its own terms. The Randolph holding unequivocally requires the presence of the objecting&para;<br>occupant in every situation other than the one mentioned&para;<br>in the dictum discussed above.&para;<br>B&para;<br>This brings us to petitioner’s second argument, viz., that&para;<br>his objection, made at the threshold of the premises that&para;<br>the police wanted to search, remained effective until he&para;<br>changed his mind and withdrew his objection. This argu-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment is inconsistent with Randolph’s reasoning in at least&para;<br>two important ways. First, the argument cannot be&para;<br>squared with the “widely shared social expectations” or&para;<br>“customary social usage” upon which the Randolph holding was based. See 547 U. S., at 111, 121. Explaining&para;<br>why consent by one occupant could not override an objection by a physically present occupant, the Randolph Court&para;<br>stated:&para;<br>“[I]t is fair to say that a caller standing at the door of&para;<br>shared premises would have no confidence that one&para;<br>occupant’s invitation was a sufficiently good reason to&para;<br>enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying, ‘stay&para;<br>out.’ Without some very good reason, no sensible person would go inside under those conditions.” Id., at&para;<br>113.&para;<br>It seems obvious that the calculus of this hypothetical&para;<br>caller would likely be quite different if the objecting tenant&para;<br>was not standing at the door. When the objecting occupant is standing at the threshold saying “stay out,” a&para;<br>friend or visitor invited to enter by another occupant can&para;<br>expect at best an uncomfortable scene and at worst violence if he or she tries to brush past the objector. But&para;<br>when the objector is not on the scene (and especially when&para;<br>it is known that the objector will not return during the&para;<br>course of the visit), the friend or visitor is much more&para;<br>likely to accept the invitation to enter.5 Thus, petitioner’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Although the dissent intimates that “customary social usage” goes&para;<br>further than this, see post, at 4, the dissent provides no support for this&para;<br>doubtful proposition. In the present case, for example, suppose that&para;<br>Rojas had called a relative, a friend, a supportive neighbor, or a person&para;<br>who works for a group that aids battered women and had invited that&para;<br>individual to enter and examine the premises while petitioner was in&para;<br>jail. Would any of those invitees have felt that it was beyond Rojas’&para;<br>authority to extend that invitation over petitioner’s objection?&para;<br>Instead of attempting to show that such persons would have felt it&para;<br>improper to accept this invitation, the dissent quickly changes the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>argument is inconsistent with Randolph’s reasoning.&para;<br>Second, petitioner’s argument would create the very sort&para;<br>of practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid.&para;<br>The Randolph Court recognized that it was adopting a&para;<br>“formalis[tic]” rule, but it did so in the interests of “simple&para;<br>clarity” and administrability. Id., at 121, 122.&para;<br>The rule that petitioner would have us adopt would&para;<br>produce a plethora of practical problems. For one thing,&para;<br>there is the question of duration. Petitioner argues that&para;<br>an objection, once made, should last until it is withdrawn&para;<br>by the objector, but such a rule would be unreasonable.&para;<br>Suppose that a husband and wife owned a house as joint&para;<br>tenants and that the husband, after objecting to a search&para;<br>of the house, was convicted and sentenced to a 15-year&para;<br>prison term. Under petitioner’s proposed rule, the wife&para;<br>would be unable to consent to a search of the house 10&para;<br>years after the date on which her husband objected. We&para;<br>refuse to stretch Randolph to such strange lengths.&para;<br>Nor are we persuaded to hold that an objection lasts for&para;<br>a “reasonable” time. “[I]t is certainly unusual for this&para;<br>Court to set forth precise time limits governing police&para;<br>action,” Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. 98, 110 (2010), and&para;<br>what interval of time would be reasonable in this context?&para;<br>A week? A month? A year? Ten years?&para;<br>Petitioner’s rule would also require the police and ultimately the courts to determine whether, after the passage&para;<br>of time, an objector still had “common authority” over the&para;<br>premises, and this would often be a tricky question. Suppose that an incarcerated objector and a consenting cooccupant were joint tenants on a lease. If the objector,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>subject and says that “conjectures about social behavior shed little light&para;<br>on the constitutionality” of the search in this case. Post, at 4. But the&para;<br>holding in Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), was based on&para;<br>“widely shared social expectations” and “customary social usage.” See&para;<br>Id., at 111, 121.

Could an objection be made preemptively? Could a person like Scott Randolph, suspecting that his estranged wife might invite the police to view&para;<br>his drug stash and paraphernalia, register an objection in&para;<br>advance? Could this be done by posting a sign in front of&para;<br>the house? Could a standing objection be registered by&para;<br>serving notice on the chief of police?&para;<br>Finally, there is the question of the particular law enforcement officers who would be bound by an objection.&para;<br>Would this set include just the officers who were present&para;<br>when the objection was made? Would it also apply to&para;<br>other officers working on the same investigation?

Would it be limited by law enforcement&para;<br>agency?&para;<br>If Randolph is taken at its word—that it applies only&para;<br>when the objector is standing in the door saying “stay out”&para;<br>when officers propose to make a consent search—all of&para;<br>these problems disappear.&para;<br>In response to these arguments, petitioner argues that&para;<br>Randolph’s requirement of physical presence is not without its own ambiguity. And we acknowledge that if, as we&para;<br>conclude, Randolph requires presence on the premises to&para;<br>be searched, there may be cases in which the outer bound-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v.

Having held that a premises&para;<br>rule is workable in that context, we see no ground for&para;<br>reaching a different conclusion here.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Petitioner argues strenuously that his expansive interpretation of Randolph would not hamper law enforcement&para;<br>because in most cases where officers have probable cause&para;<br>to arrest a physically present objector they also have&para;<br>probable cause to search the premises that the objector&para;<br>does not want them to enter, see Brief for Petitioner 20–&para;<br>23, but this argument misunderstands the constitutional&para;<br>status of consent searches. A warrantless consent search&para;<br>is reasonable and thus consistent with the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment irrespective of the availability of a warrant.&para;<br>Even with modern technological advances, the warrant&para;<br>procedure imposes burdens on the officers who wish to&para;<br>search, the magistrate who must review the warrant&para;<br>application, and the party willing to give consent.

The police officers in Randolph were confronted&para;<br>with a scenario closely resembling the situation presented&para;<br>here. Once the police arrived at Janet and Scott Randolph’s shared residence, Scott Randolph “unequivocally&para;<br>refused” an officer’s request for permission to search their&para;<br>home. Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 107 (2006).&para;<br>The officer then asked Janet Randolph for her consent to&para;<br>the search, which she “readily gave.” Ibid. The sequence&para;<br>here was similar. After Walter Fernandez, while physically present at his home, rebuffed the officers’ request to&para;<br>come in, the police removed him from the premises and&para;<br>then arrested him, albeit with cause to believe he had&para;<br>assaulted his cohabitant, Roxanne Rojas. At the time of&para;<br>the arrest, Rojas said nothing to contradict Fernandez’&para;<br>refusal. About an hour later, however, and with no attempt to obtain a search warrant, the police returned to&para;<br>the apartment and prevailed upon Rojas to sign a consent&para;<br>form authorizing search of the premises. See infra, at 9,&para;<br>n. 5.&para;<br>The circumstances triggering “the Fourth Amendment’s&para;<br>traditional hostility to police entry into a home without a&para;<br>warrant,” 547 U. S., at 126 (BREYER, J., concurring), are at&para;<br>least as salient here as they were in Randolph. In both&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Here, moreover, with the objector in custody,&para;<br>there was scant danger to persons on the premises, or risk&para;<br>that evidence might be destroyed or concealed, pending&para;<br>request for, and receipt of, a warrant. See id., at 126.&para;<br>Despite these marked similarities, the Court removes&para;<br>this case from Randolph’s ambit. The Court does so principally by seizing on the fact that Fernandez, unlike Scott&para;<br>Randolph, was no longer present and objecting when the&para;<br>police obtained the co-occupant’s consent. Ante, at 8–9.&para;<br>But Fernandez was present when he stated his objection&para;<br>to the would-be searchers in no uncertain terms. See App.&para;<br>6 (“You don’t have any right to come in here. I know my&para;<br>rights.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The officers&para;<br>could scarcely have forgotten, one hour later, that Fernandez refused consent while physically present.

Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 121 (2006). Here, as in&para;<br>Randolph, no one disputes that the police had probable cause to place&para;<br>the objecting tenant under arrest. But had the objector’s arrest been&para;<br>illegal, Randolph suggested, the remaining occupant’s consent to the&para;<br>search would not suffice. The suggestion in Randolph, as the Court&para;<br>recognizes, see ante, at 9–10, is at odds with today’s decision. For “[i]f&para;<br>the police cannot prevent a co-tenant from objecting to a search through&para;<br>arrest, surely they cannot arrest a co-tenant and then seek to ignore an&para;<br>objection he has already made.” United States v.

Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Randolph’s discussion of social expectations,&para;<br>however, does not hinge on the objector’s physical presence vel non at the time of the search. “[W]hen people&para;<br>living together disagree over the use of their common&para;<br>quarters,” Randolph observes, “a resolution must come&para;<br>through voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to&para;<br>authority.” 547 U. S., at 113–114. See also id., at 114&para;<br>(“[T]here is no common understanding that one co-tenant&para;<br>generally has a right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of&para;<br>the curtains or invitations to outsiders.”); id., at 115&para;<br>(“[T]he cooperative occupant’s invitation adds nothing to&para;<br>the government’s side to counter the force of an objecting&para;<br>individual’s claim to security against the government’s&para;<br>intrusion into his dwelling place.”).&para;<br>Randolph thus&para;<br>trained on whether a joint occupant had conveyed an&para;<br>objection to a visitor’s entry, and did not suggest that the&para;<br>objection could be ignored if the police reappeared post the&para;<br>objector’s arrest.&para;<br>A visitor might be less reluctant to enter over a joint&para;<br>occupant’s objection, the Court speculates, if that visitor&para;<br>knows the objector will not be there.

Jardines, 569 U. S. 1, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7).&para;<br>Similarly here, even if shared tenancy were understood&para;<br>to entail the prospect of visits by unwanted social&para;<br>callers while the objecting resident was gone, that unwelcome visitor’s license would hardly include free rein to&para;<br>rummage through the dwelling in search of evidence and&para;<br>contraband.2&para;<br>Next, the Court cautions, applying Randolph to these&para;<br>facts would pose “a plethora of practical problems.” Ante,&para;<br>at 12. For instance, the Court asks, must a cotenant’s&para;<br>objection, once registered, be respected indefinitely? Yet it&para;<br>blinks reality to suppose that Fernandez, by withholding&para;<br>consent, could stop police in their tracks eternally. Cf.&para;<br>ante, at 12–13 (imagining an objector behind bars serving&para;<br>his sentence, still refusing permission to search his&para;<br>residence). To mount the prosecution eventuating in a&para;<br>conviction, of course, the State would first need to obtain&para;<br>incriminating evidence, and could get it easily simply by&para;<br>applying for a warrant. Warrant in police hands, the&para;<br>Court’s practical problems disappear.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Remarkably, the Court thinks my disagreement with its account of&para;<br>the applicable social norms distances me from Randolph’s understanding of social expectations. See ante, at 11–12, n. 5. Quite the opposite.&para;<br>Randolph considered whether “customary social understanding accords&para;<br>the consenting tenant authority powerful enough to prevail over the cotenant’s objection”; social practice in such circumstances, the Court&para;<br>held, provided no cause to depart from the “ ‘centuries-old principle of&para;<br>respect for privacy of the home.’ ” 547 U. S., at 115, 121 (quoting Wilson&para;<br>v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610 (1999)). See also 547 U. S., at 115 (“Disputed permission is . . . no match for this central value of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment . . . .”). I would so hold here. Today’s decision, by contrast,&para;<br>provides police with ready means to nullify a cotenant’s objection, and&para;<br>therefore “fails to come to grips with the reasoning of [Randolph].”&para;<br>Ante, at 12, n. 5.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 13–14,&para;<br>reading Randolph to require continuous physical presence&para;<br>poses administrative difficulties of its own. Does an occupant’s refusal to consent lose force as soon as she absents&para;<br>herself from the doorstep, even if only for a moment? Are&para;<br>the police free to enter the instant after the objector leaves&para;<br>the door to retire for a nap, answer the phone, use the&para;<br>bathroom, or speak to another officer outside? See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 28. Hypothesized practical considerations,&para;<br>in short, provide no cause for today’s drastic reduction of&para;<br>Randolph’s holding and attendant disregard for the warrant requirement.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In its zeal to diminish Randolph, today’s decision overlooks the warrant requirement’s venerable role as the&para;<br>“bulwark of Fourth Amendment protection.” Franks v.&para;<br>Delaware, 438 U. S. 154, 164 (1978). Reducing Randolph&para;<br>to a “narrow exception,” the Court declares the main rule&para;<br>to be that “consent by one resident of jointly occupied&para;<br>premises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless&para;<br>search.” Ante, at 7. That declaration has it backwards, for&para;<br>consent searches themselves are a “ ‘jealously and carefully drawn’ exception” to “the Fourth Amendment rule&para;<br>ordinarily prohibiting the warrantless entry of a person’s&para;<br>house as unreasonable per se.” Randolph, 547 U. S., at&para;<br>109 (quoting Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 499&para;<br>(1958)). See also Jardines, 569 U.

New York, 445 U.

See ante,&para;<br>at 5–6. Where multiple persons occupy the premises, it is true, this&para;<br>Court has upheld warrantless home searches based on one tenant’s&para;<br>consent; those cases, however, did not involve, as this case does, an&para;<br>occupant who told the police they could not enter. See United States v.&para;<br>Matlock, 415 U. S. 164 (1974) (police relied on cotenant’s consent to&para;<br>search when other tenant had already been detained in a nearby squad&para;<br>car); Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177 (1990) (same, when the other&para;<br>tenant was asleep in the bedroom). The Court’s rationale for allowing a&para;<br>search to proceed in those instances—that co-occupants “assum[e] the&para;<br>risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be&para;<br>searched,” Matlock, 415 U. S., at 171, n. 7—does not apply where, as&para;<br>here, an occupant on the premises explicitly tells the police they cannot&para;<br>search his home sans warrant. See United States v. Henderson, 536&para;<br>F. 3d 776, 788 (CA7 2008) (Rovner, J., dissenting) (in such circumstances, the objector “has not assumed the risk that his co-tenant may&para;<br>subsequently admit the visitor, because all choice has been taken from&para;<br>him in his involuntary removal from the premises”).&para;<br>4 The Court dismisses as “beside the point” the undeniable fact that&para;<br>the police easily could have obtained a warrant. Ante, at 6, n. 4. There&para;<br>may be circumstances, the Court observes, in which the police, faced&para;<br>with a cotenant’s objection, will lack probable cause to obtain a warrant. That same argument was considered and rejected by the Court in&para;<br>Randolph, which recognized that “alternatives to disputed consent will&para;<br>not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect&para;<br>is inside.” 547 U. S., at 120. Moreover, it is unlikely that police,&para;<br>possessing an objective basis to arrest an objecting tenant, will nevertheless lack probable cause to obtain a search warrant. Probable cause&para;<br>to arrest, I recognize, calls for a showing discrete from the showing&para;<br>needed to establish probable cause to search a home. But “where, as&para;<br>here, a suspect is arrested at or near his residence, it will often ‘be&para;<br>permissible to infer that the instrumentalities and fruits of th[e] crime&para;<br>are presently in that person’s residence.’ ” Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 25 (quoting 2 W.&para;<br>LaFave, Search and Seizure §3.1(b) (5th ed. 2011)). And as the Court&para;<br>observed in Randolph, if a warrant may be impeded by a tenant’s&para;<br>refusal to consent, “[a] co-tenant acting on [her] own initiative may be&para;<br>able to deliver evidence to the police, and . . . tell the police what [s]he&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not dispute this, but instead disparages the warrant requirement as inconvenient, burdensome, entailing delay&para;<br>“[e]ven with modern technological advances.” Ante, at 14.&para;<br>Shut from the Court’s sight is the ease and speed with&para;<br>which search warrants nowadays can be obtained. See&para;<br>Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at&para;<br>11) (observing that technology now “allow[s] for the more&para;<br>expeditious processing of warrant applications,” and citing&para;<br>state statutes permitting warrants to be obtained “remotely&para;<br>through various means, including telephonic or radio&para;<br>communication, electronic communication . . . , and video&para;<br>conferencing”). See also Brief for National Association of&para;<br>Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 29 (describing California’s procedures for electronic warrant applications). With these developments in view, dilution of the&para;<br>warrant requirement should be vigilantly resisted.&para;<br>Although the police have probable cause and could&para;<br>obtain a warrant with dispatch, if they can gain the consent of someone other than the suspect, why should the&para;<br>law insist on the formality of a warrant? Because the&para;<br>Framers saw the neutral magistrate as an essential part&para;<br>of the criminal process shielding all of us, good or bad,&para;<br>saint or sinner, from unchecked police activity. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 13–14 (1948) (“The&para;<br>point of the Fourth Amendment . . . is not that it denies&para;<br>law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which&para;<br>reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a&para;<br>neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged&para;<br>by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise&para;<br>of ferreting out crime.”). “The investigation of crime,” of&para;<br>course, “would always be simplified if warrants were&para;<br>unnecessary.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.” 547 U.

See&para;<br>also Randolph, 547 U.

See ante, at 15 (“Denying someone in Rojas’&para;<br>position the right to allow the police to enter her home&para;<br>would also show disrespect for her independence.”).5&para;<br>Rojas’ situation is not distinguishable from Janet Randolph’s in this regard.

At the evidentiary hearing&para;<br>on Fernandez’ motion to suppress, Rojas testified that the police, upon&para;<br>returning to the residence about an hour after Fernandez’ arrest, began&para;<br>questioning her four-year-old son without her permission. App. 81, 93.&para;<br>Rojas asked to remain present during that questioning, but the police&para;<br>officer told her that their investigation was “going to determine whether&para;<br>or not we take your kids from you right now or not.” Id., at 93. See&para;<br>also ibid. (“I felt like [the police] were going to take my kids away from&para;<br>me.”). Rojas thus maintained that she felt “pressured” into giving&para;<br>consent. Id., at 93–94. See also id., at 93 (“I felt like I had no rights.”).&para;<br>After about 20 or 30 minutes, Rojas acceded to the officer’s request that&para;<br>she sign a consent form. Rojas testified that she “didn’t want to sign&para;<br>[the form],” but did so because she “just wanted it to just end.” Id., at&para;<br>100.&para;<br>The trial court found Rojas’ testimony at the suppression hearing&para;<br>“believable at points and unbelievable at other points,” and concluded&para;<br>that the police conduct did not amount to “duress or coercion.” Id., at&para;<br>152. The trial court agreed, however, that Rojas “may have felt pressured.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FERNANDEZ v.
