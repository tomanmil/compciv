CITY OF SHELBY,&para;<br>&para;<br>MISSISSIPPI &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–1318. Decided November 10, 2014 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, worked as police&para;<br>officers for the city of Shelby, Mississippi. They allege&para;<br>that they were fired by the city’s board of aldermen, not&para;<br>for deficient performance, but because they brought to&para;<br>light criminal activities of one of the aldermen. Charging&para;<br>violations of their Fourteenth Amendment due process&para;<br>rights, they sought compensatory relief from the city.&para;<br>Summary judgment was entered against them in the&para;<br>District Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to invoke 42 U. S. C. §1983 in their complaint.&para;<br>We summarily reverse. Federal pleading rules call for&para;<br>“a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the&para;<br>pleader is entitled to relief,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2);&para;<br>they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for&para;<br>imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the&para;<br>claim asserted. See Advisory Committee Report of October 1955, reprinted in 12A C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane,&para;<br>R. Marcus, and A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure, p. 644 (2014 ed.) (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&para;<br>“are designed to discourage battles over mere form of&para;<br>statement”); 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, §1215, p. 172 (3d ed.&para;<br>2002) (Rule 8(a)(2) “indicates that a basic objective of the&para;<br>rules is to avoid civil cases turning on technicalities”). In&para;<br>particular, no heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs&para;<br>seeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to&para;<br>invoke §1983 expressly in order to state a claim. See&para;<br>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. CITY OF SHELBY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164 (1993) (a federal&para;<br>court may not apply a standard “more stringent than the&para;<br>usual pleading requirements of Rule 8(a)” in “civil rights&para;<br>cases alleging municipal liability”); Swierkiewicz v. Sorema&para;<br>N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 512 (2002) (imposing a “heightened pleading standard in employment discrimination&para;<br>cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure&para;<br>8(a)(2)”).&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit defended its requirement that complaints expressly invoke §1983 as “not a mere pleading&para;<br>formality.” 743 F. 3d 59, 62 (2013) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The requirement serves a notice function,&para;<br>the Fifth Circuit said, because “[c]ertain consequences&para;<br>flow from claims under §1983, such as the unavailability&para;<br>of respondeat superior liability, which bears on the qualified immunity analysis.” Ibid. This statement displays&para;<br>some confusion in the Fifth Circuit’s perception of petitioners’ suit. No “qualified immunity analysis” is implicated here, as petitioners asserted a constitutional claim&para;<br>against the city only, not against any municipal officer.&para;<br>See Owen v. Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 638 (1980) (a&para;<br>“municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers&para;<br>or agents as a defense to liability under §1983”).&para;<br>Our decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550&para;<br>U. S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662&para;<br>(2009), are not in point, for they concern the factual allegations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to&para;<br>dismiss. A plaintiff, they instruct, must plead facts sufficient to show that her claim has substantive plausibility.&para;<br>Petitioners’ complaint was not deficient in that regard.&para;<br>Petitioners stated simply, concisely, and directly events&para;<br>that, they alleged, entitled them to damages from the city.&para;<br>Having informed the city of the factual basis for their&para;<br>complaint, they were required to do no more to stave off&para;<br>threshold dismissal for want of an adequate statement&para;<br>of their claim. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2) and (3),&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>(d)(1), (e). For clarification and to ward off further insistence on a punctiliously stated “theory of the pleadings,”&para;<br>petitioners, on remand, should be accorded an opportunity&para;<br>to add to their complaint a citation to §1983. See 5 Wright&para;<br>&amp; Miller, supra, §1219, at 277–278 (“The federal rules&para;<br>effectively abolish the restrictive theory of the pleadings&para;<br>doctrine, making it clear that it is unnecessary to set out a&para;<br>legal theory for the plaintiff’s claim for relief.” (footnotes&para;<br>omitted)); Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 15(a)(2) (“The court should&para;<br>freely give leave [to amend a pleading] when justice so&para;<br>requires.”).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons stated, the petition for certiorari is&para;<br>granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
