HANA BANK ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–1211. Argued December 3, 2014—Decided January 21, 2015&para;<br>Petitioner, Hana Financial, Inc., and respondent Hana Bank both provide financial services to individuals in the United States. When&para;<br>Hana Financial sued Hana Bank for trademark infringement, Hana&para;<br>Bank invoked in defense the tacking doctrine, under which lower&para;<br>courts have provided that a trademark user may make certain modifications to its mark over time while, in limited circumstances, retaining its priority position. Petitioner’s claim was tried before a jury, and the District Court adopted in substantial part the jury&para;<br>instruction on tacking proposed by petitioner. The jury returned a&para;<br>verdict in respondent’s favor. Affirming, the Ninth Circuit explained&para;<br>that the tacking inquiry was an exceptionally limited and highly factsensitive matter reserved for juries, not judges.&para;<br>Held: Whether two trademarks may be tacked for purposes of determining priority is a question for the jury. Pp. 3–8.&para;<br>(a) Lower courts have held that two marks may be tacked when&para;<br>they are considered to be “legal equivalents,” i.e., they “create the&para;<br>same, continuing commercial impression.” Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v.&para;<br>Wear-Guard Corp. 926 F. 2d 1156, 1159. And “commercial impression” “must be viewed through the eyes of a consumer.” DuoProSS&para;<br>Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Medical Devices, Ltd., 695 F. 3d 1247, 1253.&para;<br>When the relevant question is how an ordinary person or community&para;<br>would make an assessment, the jury is generally the decisionmaker&para;<br>that ought to provide the fact-intensive answer. See, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>(b) Each of petitioner’s four arguments in support of its view that&para;<br>tacking is a question of law to be resolved by a judge is unpersuasive.&para;<br>First, it may be true that the “legal equivalents” test involves a legal&para;<br>standard, but such “ ‘mixed question[s] of law and fact,’ [have] typi-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cally been resolved by juries.” Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 512. And any&para;<br>concern that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard&para;<br>can be remedied by crafting careful jury instructions. Second, petitioner offers no support for its claim that tacking determinations create new law in a unique way that requires those determinations to be&para;<br>reserved for judges. Third, petitioner worries that the predictability&para;<br>required for a functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking&para;<br>questions are assigned to juries, but offers no reason why trademark&para;<br>tacking should be treated differently from the tort, contract, and&para;<br>criminal justice systems, where juries answer often-dispositive factual questions or make dispositive applications of legal standards to&para;<br>facts. Finally, in arguing that judges have historically resolved tacking disputes, petitioner points to cases arising in the contexts of&para;<br>bench trials, summary judgment, and the like, in which it is undisputed that judges may resolve tacking disputes.

HANA &para;<br>&para;<br>BANK, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 21, 2015]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Rights in a trademark are determined by the date of the&para;<br>mark’s first use in commerce. The party who first uses a&para;<br>mark in commerce is said to have priority over other&para;<br>users. Recognizing that trademark users ought to be&para;<br>permitted to make certain modifications to their marks&para;<br>over time without losing priority, lower courts have provided that, in limited circumstances, a party may clothe a&para;<br>new mark with the priority position of an older mark.&para;<br>This doctrine is called “tacking,” and lower courts have&para;<br>found tacking to be available when the original and revised marks are “legal equivalents” in that they create the&para;<br>same, continuing commercial impression. The question&para;<br>presented here is whether a judge or a jury should determine whether tacking is available in a given case. Because the tacking inquiry operates from the perspective of&para;<br>an ordinary purchaser or consumer, we hold that a jury&para;<br>should make this determination.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner, Hana Financial, and respondent Hana Bank,&para;<br>a subsidiary of respondent Hana Financial Group, both&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>provide financial services to individuals in the United&para;<br>States. Hana Bank (hereinafter respondent) was established in 1971 as a Korean entity called Korea Investment&para;<br>Finance Corporation. In 1991, that entity changed its&para;<br>name to “Hana Bank” and began using this name in Korea. In 1994, it established a service called Hana Overseas Korean Club to provide financial services to Korean&para;<br>expatriates, and specifically advertised that service in the&para;<br>United States. Those advertisements used the name&para;<br>“Hana Overseas Korean Club” in both English and Korean, and included the name “Hana Bank” in Korean and&para;<br>respondent’s “dancing man” logo. See App. 206. In 2000,&para;<br>respondent changed the name of the Hana Overseas Korean Club to “Hana World Center.” In 2002, respondent&para;<br>began operating a bank in the United States under the&para;<br>name “Hana Bank.” This enterprise amounted to respondent’s first physical presence in the United States.&para;<br>Petitioner was established in 1994 as a California corporation called Hana Financial. It began using that name&para;<br>and an associated trademark in commerce in 1995. In&para;<br>1996, it obtained a federal trademark registration for a&para;<br>pyramid logo with the name “Hana Financial” for use in&para;<br>connection with financial services.&para;<br>In 2007, petitioner sued respondent, alleging infringement of its “Hana Financial” mark. As relevant here,&para;<br>respondent denied infringement by invoking the tacking&para;<br>doctrine and claiming that it had priority. The District&para;<br>Court initially granted summary judgment to respondent&para;<br>on the infringement claim, but the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there were genuine issues of material fact as to priority. On remand, the&para;<br>infringement claim was tried before a jury. The District&para;<br>Court adopted in substantial part the jury instruction&para;<br>proposed by petitioner, and, without objection from petitioner, instructed the jury as follows:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“A party may claim priority in a mark based on the&para;<br>first use date of a similar but technically distinct&para;<br>mark where the previously used mark is the legal&para;<br>equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguishable therefrom such that consumers consider both as&para;<br>the same mark. This is called ‘tacking.’ The marks&para;<br>must create the same, continuing commercial impression, and the later mark should not materially differ&para;<br>from or alter the character of the mark attempted&para;<br>to be tacked.” App. 173; see id., at 140 (proposed&para;<br>instruction).&para;<br>The jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, and the&para;<br>District Court denied petitioner’s motion for judgment as a&para;<br>matter of law.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>The court explained that, although tacking applies only in&para;<br>“exceptionally narrow circumstances,” 735 F. 3d 1158,&para;<br>1160 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), it “ ‘requires a highly fact-sensitive inquiry’ ” that is “reserved for&para;<br>the jury,” ibid. (quoting One Industries, LLC v. Jim O’Neal&para;<br>Distributing, Inc., 578 F. 3d 1154, 1160 (CA9 2009)). The&para;<br>court acknowledged, however, that whether tacking&para;<br>should be decided by juries or judges “is the subject of a&para;<br>circuit split.” 735 F. 3d, at 1164, n. 5 (noting that the&para;<br>Federal and Sixth Circuits “evaluate tacking as a question&para;<br>of law”); see Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v.

McCarthy, Trademarks and&para;<br>Unfair Competition §17:26, p. 17–71 (4th ed. 2014)&para;<br>(“ ‘Commercial impression,’ like most issues in trademark&para;<br>law, should be determined from the perspective of the&para;<br>ordinary purchaser of these kinds of goods or services”).&para;<br>Application of a test that relies upon an ordinary consumer’s understanding of the impression that a mark&para;<br>conveys falls comfortably within the ken of a jury. Indeed,&para;<br>we have long recognized across a variety of doctrinal&para;<br>contexts that, when the relevant question is how an ordinary person or community would make an assessment, the&para;<br>jury is generally the decisionmaker that ought to provide&para;<br>the fact-intensive answer. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512 (1995) (recognizing that “ ‘delicate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable [decisionmaker]’ would draw . . . [are] peculiarly one[s] for the&para;<br>trier of fact’ ” (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway,&para;<br>Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450 (1976); first alteration in original);&para;<br>id., at 450, n. 12 (observing that the jury has a “unique&para;<br>competence in applying the ‘reasonable man’ standard”);&para;<br>Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 104–105 (1974)&para;<br>(emphasizing “the ability of the juror to ascertain the&para;<br>sense of the ‘average person’ ” by drawing upon “his own&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The parties do not question the existence of the tacking doctrine or&para;<br>this substantive standard.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

Stout, 17 Wall. 657, 664 (1874) (“It is&para;<br>assumed that twelve men know more of the common&para;<br>affairs of life than does one man, [and] that they can draw&para;<br>wiser and safer conclusions from admitted facts thus&para;<br>occurring than can a single judge”).&para;<br>This is certainly not to say that a judge may never&para;<br>determine whether two marks may be tacked. If the facts&para;<br>warrant it, a judge may decide a tacking question on a&para;<br>motion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter&para;<br>of law. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50, 56(a). And if the&para;<br>parties have opted to try their case before a judge, the&para;<br>judge may of course decide a tacking question in his or her&para;<br>factfinding capacity. We hold only that, when a jury trial&para;<br>has been requested and when the facts do not warrant&para;<br>entry of summary judgment or judgment as a matter of&para;<br>law, the question whether tacking is warranted must be&para;<br>decided by a jury.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Attempting to overcome our conclusion, petitioner offers&para;<br>four reasons why, in its view, tacking is a question of law&para;<br>that should be resolved by a judge. None persuades us.&para;<br>Petitioner first observes that the “legal equivalents” test&para;<br>involves the application of a legal standard. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 20. True enough, but “the application-of-legalstandard-to-fact sort of question . . . , commonly called a&para;<br>‘mixed question of law and fact,’ has typically been resolved by juries.” Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 512; see id., at 514&para;<br>(“[T]he jury’s constitutional responsibility is not merely to&para;<br>determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and&para;<br>draw the ultimate conclusion . . .”); Miller v. Fenton, 474&para;<br>U. S. 104, 113 (1985) (“[A]n issue does not lose its factual&para;<br>character merely because its resolution is dispositive of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the ultimate . . . question”). The “mixed” analysis that&para;<br>takes place during the tacking inquiry is no different. And&para;<br>insofar as petitioner is concerned that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard, the solution is to&para;<br>craft careful jury instructions that make that standard&para;<br>clear. Here, however, petitioner can hardly criticize the&para;<br>instruction the District Court gave the jury, as it was&para;<br>essentially the instruction petitioner proposed.&para;<br>Second, petitioner argues that tacking determinations&para;<br>will “create new law that will guide future tacking disputes”—a task reserved for judges. Brief for Petitioner 21.&para;<br>It is not at all clear, however, why a tacking determination&para;<br>in a particular case will “create new law” any more than&para;<br>will a jury verdict in a tort case, a contract dispute, or a&para;<br>criminal proceeding. Petitioner insists that tacking questions “have to be” resolved by comparing two marks in a&para;<br>given case “against those addressed in other tacking cases,”&para;<br>id., at 22, but we do not agree. Of course, in deciding&para;<br>summary judgment motions, or in making rulings in&para;<br>bench trials, judges may look to past cases holding that&para;<br>trademark owners either were or were not entitled to&para;<br>tacking as a matter of law. But petitioner offers no support for the claim that tacking cases “have to be” resolved&para;<br>by reliance on precedent. Indeed, in many of the cases&para;<br>petitioner cites in support of this argument, the courts in&para;<br>question relied on precedent only to define the relevant&para;<br>legal standard. See, e.g., Specht v. Google Inc., 758&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 570, 583–585 (ND Ill. 2010), aff ’d, 747 F. 3d&para;<br>929 (CA7 2014); Children’s Legal Servs. PLLC v. Kresch,&para;<br>2008 WL 1901245, *1–*2 (ED Mich., Apr. 25, 2008), aff ’d&para;<br>sub nom. Children’s Legal Servs., P. L. L. C. v. Saiontz,&para;<br>Kirk &amp; Miles, P. A., 2009 WL 1868809 (CA6, June 18,&para;<br>2009).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Our decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.&para;<br>370 (1996), is not to the contrary. In Markman, we held that the task&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Third, and related, petitioner worries that the predictability required for a functioning trademark system will be&para;<br>absent if tacking questions are assigned to juries. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 25–27. But, again, the same could be&para;<br>said about the tort, contract, and criminal justice systems:&para;<br>In all of these areas, juries answer often-dispositive factual questions or make dispositive applications of legal&para;<br>standards to facts. The fact that another jury, hearing the&para;<br>same case, might reach a different conclusion may make&para;<br>the system “unpredictable,” but it has never stopped us&para;<br>from employing juries in these analogous contexts. Petitioner has offered no reason why trademark tacking ought&para;<br>to be treated differently. Moreover, decisionmaking in&para;<br>fact-intensive disputes necessarily requires judgment&para;<br>calls. Regardless of whether those judgment calls are&para;<br>made by juries or judges, they necessarily involve some&para;<br>degree of uncertainty, particularly when they have to do&para;<br>with how reasonable persons would behave.&para;<br>Finally, petitioner argues that, as a historical matter,&para;<br>judges have resolved tacking disputes. See Brief for Petitioner 30–35. But petitioner relies on cases in which&para;<br>judges have resolved tacking disputes in bench trials, at&para;<br>summary judgment, or the like. See, e.g., Drexel Enterprises, Inc. v. Richardson, 312 F. 2d 525, 526 (CA10 1962)&para;<br>(“[This action] was tried without a jury”); Perfectform&para;<br>Corp. v. Perfect Brassiere Co., 256 F. 2d 736, 738 (CA3&para;<br>1958) (“The district court dismissed the complaint”); John&para;<br>——————&para;<br>of construing patent terms falls to judges and not to juries. We held as&para;<br>much because “[t]he construction of written instruments is one of those&para;<br>things that judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors&para;<br>unburdened by training in exegesis.” Id., at 388; see Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., v. Sandoz, Inc., ante, at 5. The tacking inquiry, by&para;<br>contrast, involves a factual judgment about whether two marks give the&para;<br>same impression to consumers. Making that kind of judgment is, as&para;<br>discussed above, not “one of those things that judges often do” better&para;<br>than jurors.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v.

Lorillard Co., 299 F. 834, 835 (NJ 1924)&para;<br>(equitable claims tried solely before a judge). As we have&para;<br>noted, it is undisputed that judges may resolve tacking&para;<br>disputes in those contexts. But recognizing as much does&para;<br>not gainsay our conclusion that, when a jury is to be empaneled and when the facts warrant neither summary&para;<br>judgment nor judgment as a matter of law, tacking is a&para;<br>question for the jury.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit correctly held that whether two&para;<br>marks may be tacked for purposes of determining priority&para;<br>is a question for the jury.
