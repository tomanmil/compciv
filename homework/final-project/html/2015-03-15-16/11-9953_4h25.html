The premise of that question is&para;<br>that a breakdown in Louisiana’s system for paying the&para;<br>attorneys representing petitioner, an indigent defendant&para;<br>who was charged with a capital offense, caused most of&para;<br>the lengthy delay between his arrest and trial. Because the&para;<br>record shows otherwise, I agree that the writ of certiorari&para;<br>was improvidently granted.&para;<br>In February 2002, petitioner and his brother were&para;<br>hitchhiking in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. Petitioner&para;<br>robbed and murdered a driver who picked them up. After&para;<br>enlisting his brother to help him cover up the crime, petitioner fled to Florida, where he was captured about a&para;<br>month later. The evidence of petitioner’s guilt was overwhelming. He gave the police a detailed statement describing the murder; his brother, an eyewitness, agreed to&para;<br>testify about the crime; multiple other members of petitioner’s family told police that they had heard petitioner&para;<br>confess; and petitioner’s fingerprints were found in the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v. LOUISIANA&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>victim’s truck.&para;<br>Louisiana prosecutors announced that they would seek&para;<br>the death penalty, and the state court appointed Thomas&para;<br>Lorenzi, an experienced trial attorney, to serve as petitioner’s primary defense counsel. For the next five years,&para;<br>Mr. Lorenzi led petitioner’s defense, but he was assisted at&para;<br>all times by at least one highly credentialed but less experienced attorney from the Louisiana Capital Assistance&para;<br>Center (LCAC).&para;<br>The attorneys from the LCAC were paid by the State,&para;<br>but there was confusion about which branch of the state&para;<br>government was responsible for paying Mr. Lorenzi’s fees.&para;<br>The trial court promptly scheduled a hearing on that preliminary matter, but the hearing was repeatedly put off&para;<br>at the urging of the defense. Over the course of more&para;<br>than three years, the defense requested that the hearing&para;<br>be continued on eight separate occasions, causing a total&para;<br>delay of approximately 20 months. The trial court also&para;<br>issued several other continuances without any objection&para;<br>from the defense, delaying the hearing an additional 15&para;<br>months. And just when it seemed that the hearing would&para;<br>finally be held, Hurricane Rita forced the Calcasieu Parish&para;<br>Courthouse to close.&para;<br>The trial court held the hearing on March 27, 2006, and&para;<br>at that time it became clear that Mr. Lorenzi’s fees could&para;<br>not be fully paid until the start of the next fiscal year. Ten&para;<br>months later, the State broke the resulting impasse by&para;<br>announcing that it would no longer seek the death penalty. That greatly reduced the complexity and cost of petitioner’s defense and allowed his case to proceed. Mr.&para;<br>Lorenzi withdrew, and attorneys from the LCAC accepted&para;<br>the role of lead counsel.&para;<br>From that point, the case proceeded at a plodding pace.&para;<br>Petitioner filed voluminous pretrial motions, took multiple&para;<br>interlocutory appeals, and twice demanded the recusal of&para;<br>the trial judge.

At last, despite petitioner’s&para;<br>contention that he needed still more time to prepare, the&para;<br>trial began on September 22, 2009. A jury found petitioner guilty of second-degree murder and armed robbery.&para;<br>In sum, the record shows that the single largest share&para;<br>of the delay in this case was the direct result of defense&para;<br>requests for continuances, that other defense motions&para;<br>caused substantial additional delay, and that much of the&para;<br>rest of the delay was caused by events beyond anyone’s&para;<br>control. It is also quite clear that the delay caused by the&para;<br>defense likely worked in petitioner’s favor. The state court&para;<br>observed that petitioner’s assertions of his speedy trial&para;<br>right were “more perfunctory than aggressive.” 2010–693,&para;<br>p. 34 (La. App. 3 Cir. 2/2/11), 56 So. 3d 1119, 1143. And&para;<br>what started out as a very strong case of first-degree&para;<br>murder ended up, after much delay, in a conviction for&para;<br>lesser offenses.&para;<br>The dissent would ignore what the record plainly shows&para;<br>based largely on the Louisiana Court of Appeals’ observation that “[t]he majority of the seven-year delay was&para;<br>caused by the ‘lack of funding.’ ” Id., at 1142. See post, at&para;<br>5, 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But when this statement&para;<br>is read in context, what it most likely means is not that&para;<br>the delay in question was caused by the State’s failure to&para;<br>provide funding but simply that the delay was attributable&para;<br>to the funding issue. And as noted, most of this delay was&para;<br>caused by the many defense requests for continuances of&para;<br>hearings on the issue of funding. If the defense had not&para;<br>sought and obtained those continuances, the trial might&para;<br>well have commenced at a much earlier date—and might&para;<br>have reached a conclusion far less favorable to the&para;<br>defense.*&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The dissent also claims that “Louisiana conceded below that most of&para;<br>the delay resulted from the lack of funding for Boyer’s defense.” Post,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v.

But the dissent’s only citation is to the State’s&para;<br>argument in the alternative that even if the legislature’s failure to&para;<br>appropriate funds for the defense caused the delay, that delay should&para;<br>not count against the prosecution for purposes of Louisiana’s statutory&para;<br>speedy trial requirement. The State in no way conceded that it caused&para;<br>the delay in this case. Indeed, the very next paragraph of the State’s&para;<br>brief argued that “the defendant sought to delay the inception of his&para;<br>trial via his funding motion.” App. 317a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The Louisiana Court of Appeal rejected Boyer’s&para;<br>claim that this delay violated his right to a speedy trial.&para;<br>In doing so, the court found that most of the delay in&para;<br>Boyer’s case was caused by the State’s failure to pay for&para;<br>his defense due to a “ ‘funding crisis’ experienced by the&para;<br>State of Louisiana.” 2010–693, p. 32 (La. App. 3 Cir.&para;<br>2/2/11), 56 So. 3d 1119, 1142. Nevertheless, the court did&para;<br>not weigh that part of the delay against the State in assessing the merits of Boyer’s claim, reasoning that it was&para;<br>“ ‘out of the State’s control.’ ” Id., at 1145.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide whether a delay caused&para;<br>by a State’s failure to fund counsel for an indigent’s defense should be weighed against the State in determining&para;<br>whether there was a deprivation of a defendant’s Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right to a speedy trial. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>Rather than dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, I&para;<br>would simply address this question. Our precedents provide a clear answer: Such a delay should weigh against the&para;<br>State. It is important for States to understand that they&para;<br>have an obligation to protect a defendant’s constitutional&para;<br>right to a speedy trial. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v. LOUISIANA&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>The decision below describes the facts as follows. On&para;<br>February 4, 2002, Boyer and his brother were walking by&para;<br>the side of the road in Sulphur, Louisiana. Bradlee Marsh&para;<br>stopped his truck and gave the two men a ride. Once&para;<br>inside the truck, Boyer demanded money. When Marsh&para;<br>refused, Boyer shot him three times in the head and then&para;<br>took some cash and a silver chain from his person. Marsh&para;<br>eventually died of his wounds. On March, 8, 2002, Boyer&para;<br>was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, and was indicted&para;<br>in Louisiana for first-degree murder on June 6, 2002, in&para;<br>violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:30 (West 1997). Louisiana sought the death penalty.&para;<br>Boyer filed a motion to determine the source of funds for&para;<br>his defense in November 2002. A hearing on the motion&para;<br>was held on August 15, 2003, which was continued until a&para;<br>later date. From that point on, “the only matters that&para;<br>came before the trial court concerned the source of funding.” 56 So. 3d, at 1142. Boyer and the State filed numerous continuances over the next two years that further&para;<br>postponed the funding hearing.&para;<br>On July 7, 2005, Boyer filed a motion to quash the indictment as a violation of his right to a speedy trial under&para;<br>the Louisiana Constitution, the State’s speedy trial statute, and the Sixth Amendment.1 This hearing was itself&para;<br>postponed. Among other things, disruptions caused by&para;<br>Hurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in further delay.&para;<br>When a hearing on the motion to quash was finally held,&para;<br>defense counsel moved to dismiss Boyer’s federal speedy&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Under the relevant statute, “no trial shall be commenced . . . [i]n&para;<br>capital cases after three years from the date of the institution of the&para;<br>prosecution.” La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 578(1) (West 2003). The&para;<br>trial court may dismiss the indictment upon the expiration of the 3-year&para;<br>period. See Art. 581. Boyer brought this motion to quash soon after&para;<br>the limitations period under the statute had elapsed. See 56 So. 3d, at&para;<br>1142.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>trial claim without prejudice.2 The trial court denied the&para;<br>motion on November 20, 2006, reaching only Boyer’s statelaw claims. It concluded that under Louisiana’s speedy&para;<br>trial statute, such delays could not be attributed to the&para;<br>prosecution because they were “beyond [its] control” and&para;<br>rested instead with the “legislature.” App. 703a. The&para;<br>Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed. 56 So.&para;<br>3d, at 1142.&para;<br>On May 21, 2007, Louisiana amended the indictment to&para;<br>reduce the charge to second-degree murder, which is a&para;<br>noncapital offense. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:30.1(B)&para;<br>(West 1997). The same day, the State filed a bill of information charging Boyer with armed robbery with a firearm, a violation of §14:64.&para;<br>On January 22, 2008, Boyer filed a second motion to&para;<br>quash the indictment and bill of information on the&para;<br>grounds that the pretrial delay violated his right to a&para;<br>speedy trial under the Louisiana Constitution and the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment. The trial court denied the motion. On&para;<br>July 19, 2008, the court found Boyer incompetent to stand&para;<br>trial, but later found his competency restored on April 15,&para;<br>2009. A trial commenced on September 22, 2009, more&para;<br>than seven years after Boyer’s arrest. A week later, the&para;<br>jury entered a verdict finding Boyer guilty of seconddegree murder and armed robbery.&para;<br>The Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed&para;<br>Boyer’s conviction, finding, as relevant here, that there&para;<br>had been no violation of Boyer’s right to a speedy trial&para;<br>under the Sixth Amendment. 56 So. 3d, at 1139–1145.&para;<br>Applying our decision in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514&para;<br>(1972), the court recognized that the more than seven&para;<br>years from the date of arrest to trial was “presumptively&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Boyer’s counsel moved to dismiss the constitutional claim because&para;<br>he lacked the “resources . . . to be able to prove prejudice [in] an evidentiary hearing.” App. 688a.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v. LOUISIANA&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>prejudicial.” 56 So. 3d, at 1144. It then went on to consider&para;<br>the reason for the delay, and found that the “majority of&para;<br>the . . . delay was caused by the ‘lack of funding’ ” for Boyer’s defense. Id., at 1142.&para;<br>The court, however, declined to weigh this period of the&para;<br>delay against the State at all for the purposes of its analysis under Barker. 56 So. 3d, at 1145. It found that “[t]he&para;<br>first three years he was incarcerated, [while Boyer] was&para;<br>charged with first degree murder . . . the progression of&para;<br>the prosecution was ‘out of the State’s control.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added). The Louisiana Supreme Court denied&para;<br>review. 2011–0769 (La. 1/20/12), 78 So. 3d 138, 139.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal&para;<br>prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy&para;<br>. . . trial.” In Barker, we explained that whether there has&para;<br>been a violation of a defendant’s right to a speedy trial&para;<br>turns on a balancing test that “compels courts to approach&para;<br>speedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis.” 407 U. S., at 530.&para;<br>We identified four factors that courts should consider as&para;<br>part of that inquiry. These include the “[l]ength of delay,&para;<br>the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his&para;<br>right, and prejudice to the defendant.” Ibid.&para;<br>While each of the factors is relevant, “[t]he flag all litigants seek to capture is the second factor, the reason for&para;<br>delay.” United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 315&para;<br>(1986). We have explained that “different weights should&para;<br>be assigned to different reasons.” Barker, 407 U. S., at&para;<br>531. “A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to&para;<br>hamper the defense” is particularly serious, and “should&para;<br>be weighted heavily against the government.” Ibid. “A&para;<br>more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded&para;<br>courts should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless&para;<br>should be considered since the ultimate responsibility for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>such circumstances must rest with the government rather&para;<br>than with the defendant.” Ibid. At the other end of the&para;<br>spectrum, “a valid reason, such as a missing witness,&para;<br>should serve to justify appropriate delay.” Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Louisiana court found that the “majority of the&para;<br>seven-year delay” in Boyer’s case was caused by the “ ‘lack&para;<br>of funding’ ” made available for the defense, see 56 So. 3d,&para;<br>at 1142, and I defer to that factual determination, see&para;<br>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 366 (1991) (plurality&para;<br>opinion).3 The question is whether, once the Louisiana&para;<br>court found that most of the delay in Boyer’s case was&para;<br>caused by the State’s failure to fund Boyer’s defense, the&para;<br>court was required to weigh that period of the delay&para;<br>against the State for the purposes of its analysis under&para;<br>Barker. The court’s conclusion that for the first three&para;<br>years of Boyer’s case, the “progression of the prosecution&para;<br>was ‘out of the State’s control’ ” makes clear that it did not.&para;<br>56 So. 3d, at 1145.&para;<br>Our reasoning in Barker, however, requires that a delay&para;<br>caused by a State’s failure to provide funding for an indigent’s defense must count against the State, and not the&para;<br>accused. As noted, we held there that even a more “neutral reason” for a delay such as “overcrowded courts”&para;<br>should be weighed against the State, because “the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances” lies squarely&para;<br>with the state system as a whole. 407 U. S., at 531. Ap——————&para;<br>3 Louisiana&para;<br>&para;<br>previously conceded that the delay was caused by a lack&para;<br>of funding. See Brief in Opposition to Defendant’s Writ Application in&para;<br>No. KW–07–00085 (La. App. 3 Cir.), App. 317a (“In this case, because&para;<br>the defendant was without properly funded counsel for so long, the&para;<br>State simply could not ethically or legally bring him to trial. The indigent defense representation and funding situation is beyond the&para;<br>ability of the State to control”); see also Brief for Louisiana in No. KA–&para;<br>10–693 etc. (La. App. 3 Cir.), App. 198a (same).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v. LOUISIANA&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>plying similar logic, we recently indicated that “[d]elay&para;<br>resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender&para;<br>system, could be charged to the State” as well. Vermont v.&para;<br>Brillon, 556 U. S. 81, 94 (2009) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>and citation omitted).&para;<br>A State’s failure to provide adequate funding for an&para;<br>indigent’s defense that prevents a case from going to trial&para;<br>is no different. Where a State has failed to provide funding for the defense and that lack of funding causes a delay,&para;<br>the defendant cannot reasonably be faulted. See Barker,&para;<br>407 U. S., at 531. Placing the consequences of such a&para;<br>delay squarely on the State’s shoulders is proper for the&para;<br>simple reason that an indigent defendant has no control&para;<br>over whether a State has set aside funds to pay his lawyer&para;<br>or fund any necessary investigation. The failure to fund&para;<br>an indigent’s defense is not as serious as a deliberate&para;<br>effort by a State to cause delay. Ibid. But States routinely&para;<br>make tradeoffs in the allocation of limited resources, and&para;<br>it is reasonable that a State bear the consequences of&para;<br>these choices.&para;<br>The Louisiana court’s analysis under Barker was therefore based on a critical misapprehension of our precedents:&para;<br>It did not attribute responsibility for the delay to the&para;<br>State, and thus incorrectly applied the factor that we have&para;<br>found to be especially significant. See Loud Hawk, 474&para;<br>U. S., at 315. We have explained that, in every case,&para;<br>“courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process,” and “none of the four factors [is] either a&para;<br>necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial.” Barker, 407 U. S., at&para;<br>533. Because the Barker factors must be viewed collectively, this error could very well have affected the outcome. “[T]he balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily&para;<br>would not prompt this Court’s review,” but the Louisiana&para;<br>court’s misattribution of the reason for the delay was a&para;<br>“fundamental error . . . that calls for this Court’s correc-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion.” Brillon, 556 U. S., at 91.&para;<br>Our precedents therefore point the way to a straightforward resolution of this case. I take no view as to how&para;<br>the other elements of the Barker inquiry should be weighed,&para;<br>or the ultimate issue whether the delay violated Boyer’s&para;<br>right to a speedy trial. Instead, I would decide only&para;<br>the narrow question on which we granted certiorari and&para;<br>hold that, under Barker, any delay that results from a&para;<br>State’s failure to provide funding for an indigent’s defense&para;<br>weighs against the State. On remand, the Louisiana court&para;<br>could conduct the Barker analysis under the correct legal&para;<br>standard.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Louisiana’s primary arguments are either unpersuasive&para;<br>or are more appropriately addressed on remand. They&para;<br>provide no barrier to the Court’s resolution of the question&para;<br>presented.&para;<br>Louisiana’s procedures require that capital defendants&para;<br>be appointed two capital-qualified attorneys. See La. Sup.&para;<br>Ct. Rule 31(A)(1)(a) (2012). In Louisiana’s view, the fact&para;<br>that there may have been insufficient funds for a second&para;<br>lawyer did not contribute to the delay. See Brief for Respondent 31–33. It contends that these procedural rules&para;<br>did not create an affirmative right to two lawyers, so that&para;<br>Boyer could have forgone the second lawyer at any time&para;<br>and gone to trial if he had so desired. See id., at 32 (citing&para;<br>La. Sup. Ct. Rules 31(A)(1)(a), (B)).&para;<br>The Louisiana court treated it as a given that Boyer&para;<br>could not proceed to trial during the period of the funding&para;<br>crisis. We therefore have no need to address how these&para;<br>state-law procedures might have affected the overall&para;<br>reason for the delay. Cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.&para;<br>684, 690–691 (1975); General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503&para;<br>U. S. 181, 187 (1992). To the extent Louisiana disputes&para;<br>the lower court’s conclusions about how state-law princi-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v. LOUISIANA&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ples influenced the delay, these points could have been&para;<br>addressed in state court on remand. And in fact, Boyer&para;<br>alleged that there were substantial costs other than the&para;<br>appointment of a second lawyer, such as the expenses&para;<br>associated with pretrial investigation, that necessitated&para;<br>additional resources before any counsel—one or two—&para;<br>could have gone to trial. App. 377a.&para;<br>Louisiana also contends that the delay was mostly&para;<br>attributable to Boyer, because he failed to move the case&para;<br>forward. Brief for Respondent 28–38. The Louisiana&para;<br>court did not so find. And Boyer disputes this view; he&para;<br>contends that statutory procedures and their time limitations under Louisiana law prevented him from bringing&para;<br>his speedy trial claim any earlier than he did. Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 28. In any event, the question of how Boyer’s&para;<br>diligence, or lack thereof, affects the overall balance of&para;<br>the Barker factors would be an appropriate subject for&para;<br>remand.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence largely adopts Louisiana’s&para;<br>arguments, and contends that the majority of the delay&para;<br>should be attributed to Boyer’s requests for continuances&para;<br>in the trial court, and not the funding crisis. See ante, at&para;<br>3. It is a mistake to second-guess the state court’s findings&para;<br>on this point, particularly because Louisiana conceded&para;<br>below that most of the delay resulted from the lack of&para;<br>funding for Boyer’s defense. See n. 3, supra. Contrary to&para;<br>the concurrence’s assertion, see ante, at 3–4, n. 1, this&para;<br>concession was not made arguendo. The most reasonable&para;<br>reading of the state court’s opinion is that it simply accepted Louisiana’s concession when it found that the&para;<br>“majority of the seven-year delay was caused by the ‘lack&para;<br>of funding.’ ” 56 So. 3d, at 1142. There is no reason this&para;<br>Court should comb through the record to allow Louisiana&para;<br>to turn its back on this prior position, and risk substituting this Court’s judgment for that of a state court on a&para;<br>question that is closely intertwined with state procedural&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

These matters of state law are better suited for the&para;<br>Louisiana court to address in the first instance on remand.&para;<br>Louisiana’s arguments accordingly provide no reason to&para;<br>decline to address the question of federal law on which we&para;<br>granted certiorari and which the parties argued.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Court’s failure to resolve this case is especially&para;<br>regrettable, because it does not seem to be an isolated one.&para;<br>Rather, Boyer’s case appears to be illustrative of larger,&para;<br>systemic problems in Louisiana.&para;<br>The Louisiana Supreme Court has suggested on multiple occasions that the State’s failure to provide funding for&para;<br>indigent defense contributes to extended pretrial detentions. See State v. Citizen, 2004–1841, pp. 14–17 (La.&para;<br>4/1/05), 898 So. 2d 325, 336–338; State v. Wigley, 624&para;<br>So. 2d 425, 429 (La. 1993); State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780,&para;<br>791 (La. 1993). There is also empirical evidence supporting that assessment. In New Orleans Parish, for example,&para;<br>a recent study found that more than 22 percent of pending&para;<br>criminal cases were more than one year old. Metropolitan Crime Commission, 2011 Orleans Parish Judicial Accountability Report 1 (July 2012). Another study found&para;<br>that the average time between felony arrest and trial in&para;<br>Calcasieu Parish, the jurisdiction where Boyer was tried,&para;<br>was 501 days in the years before Boyer’s arrest. M. Kurth&para;<br>&amp; D. Burckel, Defending the Indigent in Southwest Louisiana 27 (2003). More broadly, the public defender system&para;<br>seems to be significantly understaffed. See E. Lewis &amp; D.&para;<br>Goyette, Report on the Evaluation of the Office of the&para;<br>Orleans Public Defenders 28–29 (July 2012) (noting that&para;<br>in New Orleans, public defenders handle approximately&para;<br>277 felonies per year, which is nearly twice the number&para;<br>recommended by ABA standards (citing ABA Formal&para;<br>Opinion 06–441 (2006))); National Legal Aid &amp; Defender&para;<br>Association, In Defense of Public Access to Justice, An&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BOYER v.

Conditions of this kind cannot&para;<br>persist without endangering constitutional rights.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal made a&para;<br>serious error: It did not charge the State’s failure to pay&para;<br>Boyer’s lawyer against the State in determining whether&para;<br>there was a violation of his right to a speedy trial. Because a State bears the ultimate responsibility for funding&para;<br>adequately an indigent’s defense, our precedents require a&para;<br>court to count this delay against the State and not the&para;<br>criminal defendant.&para;<br>Rather than dismiss the writ, I would answer the&para;<br>question on which we granted certiorari and remand for&para;<br>the Louisiana court to conduct the Barker analysis anew.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment of&para;<br>dismissal.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
