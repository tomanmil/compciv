MARSHALL, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF&para;<br>MARSHALL&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–179.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued January 18, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Article III, §1, of the Constitution mandates that “[t]he judicial Power&para;<br>of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in&para;<br>such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain&para;<br>and establish,” and provides that the judges of those constitutional&para;<br>courts “shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour” and “receive&para;<br>for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ] [that] shall not be diminished”&para;<br>during their tenure. The questions presented in this case are&para;<br>whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and&para;<br>salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S. C. §157 and Arti&para;<br>cle III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn&para;<br>Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall&para;<br>(whose estate is the respondent) in Vickie’s bankruptcy proceedings.&para;<br>Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierce’s father, approxi&para;<br>mately a year before his death. Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie&para;<br>filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J.&para;<br>Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tor&para;<br>tiously interfered with that gift. After J. Howard died, Vickie filed&para;<br>for bankruptcy in federal court. Pierce filed a proof of claim in that&para;<br>proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from&para;<br>Vickie’s bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by induc&para;<br>ing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in con&para;<br>trolling his father’s assets. Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim&para;<br>for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the&para;<br>defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of&para;<br>dollars in damages on her counterclaim. Pierce objected that the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on&para;<br>that counterclaim because it was not a “core proceeding” as defined&para;<br>by 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(C). As set forth in §157(a), Congress has di&para;<br>vided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that&para;<br>“aris[e] under title 11”; those that “aris[e] in” a Title 11 case; and&para;<br>those that are “related to a case under title 11.” District courts may&para;<br>refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district,&para;<br>and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in “all core pro&para;<br>ceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.”&para;<br>§§157(a), (b)(1). In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy&para;<br>judge may only “submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of&para;<br>law to the district court.” §157(c)(1). Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 cate&para;<br>gories of core proceedings, including “counterclaims by the estate&para;<br>against persons filing claims against the estate.” §157(b)(2)(C).&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickie’s counterclaim was a&para;<br>core proceeding. The District Court reversed, reading this Court’s&para;<br>precedent in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line&para;<br>Co., 458 U. S. 50, to “suggest[ ] that it would be unconstitutional to&para;<br>hold that any and all counterclaims are core.” The court held that&para;<br>Vickie’s counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat re&para;<br>lated to Pierce’s claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court’s judgment as proposed, not final. Although the Texas state&para;<br>court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the par&para;<br>ties’ dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce’s favor, the District&para;<br>Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickie’s favor. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals ultimately reversed. It held that the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickie’s counter&para;<br>claim because the claim was not “so closely related to [Pierce’s] proof&para;<br>of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to re&para;<br>solve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.” Because that&para;<br>holding made the Texas probate court’s judgment the earliest final&para;<br>judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held&para;<br>that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclu&para;<br>sive effect.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to&para;<br>enter judgment on Vickie’s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional&para;<br>authority to do so. Pp. 6–38.&para;<br>1. Section 157(b) authorized the Bankruptcy Court to enter final&para;<br>judgment on Vickie’s counterclaim. Pp. 8–16.&para;<br>(a) The Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter&para;<br>final judgment on Vickie’s counterclaim as a core proceeding under&para;<br>§157(b)(2)(C). Pierce argues that §157(b) authorizes bankruptcy&para;<br>courts to enter final judgments only in those proceedings that are&para;<br>both core and either arise in a Title 11 case or arise under Title 11 it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>self. But that reading necessarily assumes that there is a category of&para;<br>core proceedings that do not arise in a bankruptcy case or under&para;<br>bankruptcy law, and the structure of §157 makes clear that no such&para;<br>category exists. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(b) In the alternative, Pierce argues that the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>lacked jurisdiction to resolve Vickie’s counterclaim because his defa&para;<br>mation claim is a “personal injury tort” that the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>lacked jurisdiction to hear under §157(b)(5). The Court agrees with&para;<br>Vickie that §157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and Pierce consented to&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Court’s resolution of the defamation claim. The&para;<br>Court is not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional&para;<br>bar when they are not framed as such. See generally Henderson v.&para;<br>Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___; Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500. Sec&para;<br>tion 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree,&para;<br>and the statutory context belies Pierce’s claim that it is jurisdictional.&para;<br>Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court’s resolution of the defama&para;<br>tion claim by repeatedly advising that court that he was happy to&para;<br>litigate his claim there. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>2. Although §157 allowed the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judg&para;<br>ment on Vickie’s counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution did not.&para;<br>Pp. 16–38.&para;<br>(a) Article III is “an inseparable element of the constitutional&para;<br>system of checks and balances” that “both defines the power and pro&para;<br>tects the independence of the Judicial Branch.” Northern Pipeline,&para;<br>458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion). Article III protects liberty not&para;<br>only through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but&para;<br>also by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges to&para;<br>protect the integrity of judicial decisionmaking.&para;<br>This is not the first time the Court has faced an Article III chal&para;<br>lenge to a bankruptcy court’s resolution of a debtor’s suit. In North&para;<br>ern Pipeline, the Court considered whether bankruptcy judges serv&para;<br>ing under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978—who also lacked the tenure&para;<br>and salary guarantees of Article III—could “constitutionally be&para;<br>vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim” against&para;<br>an entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.&para;<br>Id., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion). The plurality in Northern&para;<br>Pipeline recognized that there was a category of cases involving “pub&para;<br>lic rights” that Congress could constitutionally assign to “legislative”&para;<br>courts for resolution. A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing&para;<br>on the scope of that exception, concluded that the doctrine did not en&para;<br>compass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case, and&para;<br>rejected the debtor’s argument that the Bankruptcy Court’s exercise&para;<br>of jurisdiction was constitutional because the bankruptcy judge was&para;<br>acting merely as an adjunct of the district court or court of appeals.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Id., at 69–72; see id., at 90–91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judg&para;<br>ment). After the decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress revised the&para;<br>statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.&para;<br>With respect to the “core” proceedings listed in §157(b)(2), however,&para;<br>the bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Fed&para;<br>eral Judgeship Act of 1984 exercise the same powers they wielded&para;<br>under the 1978 Act. The authority exercised by the newly consti&para;<br>tuted courts over a counterclaim such as Vickie’s exceeds the bounds&para;<br>of Article III. Pp. 16–22.&para;<br>(b) Vickie’s counterclaim does not fall within the public rights ex&para;<br>ception, however defined. The Court has long recognized that, in&para;<br>general, Congress may not “withdraw from judicial cognizance any&para;<br>matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common&para;<br>law, or in equity, or admiralty.” Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp;&para;<br>Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284. The Court has also recognized&para;<br>that “[a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights,&para;<br>. . . which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which con&para;<br>gress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the&para;<br>United States, as it may deem proper.” Ibid. Several previous deci&para;<br>sions have contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights ex&para;<br>ception—those arising “between the Government and persons subject&para;<br>to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitu&para;<br>tional functions of the executive or legislative departments”—and&para;<br>those that are instead matters “of private right, that is, of the liabil&para;<br>ity of one individual to another under the law as defined.” Crowell v.&para;<br>Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50, 51.&para;<br>Shortly after Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected the limitation of&para;<br>the public rights exception to actions involving the Government as a&para;<br>party. The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to&para;<br>cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory&para;<br>scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert Government&para;<br>agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within&para;<br>the agency’s authority. In other words, it is still the case that what&para;<br>makes a right “public” rather than private is that the right is inte&para;<br>grally related to particular Federal Government action. See United&para;<br>States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U. S. ___, ___–___ (slip op., at&para;<br>10–11); Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473&para;<br>U. S. 568, 584; Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor,&para;<br>478 U. S. 833, 844, 856.&para;<br>In Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, the most recent&para;<br>case considering the public rights exception, the Court rejected a&para;<br>bankruptcy trustee’s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action&para;<br>filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a&para;<br>bankruptcy proceeding fell within the exception. Vickie’s counter&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>claim is similar. It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace&para;<br>of the other branches, as in Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 284; it does&para;<br>not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S., at&para;<br>584–585; and it is not “completely dependent upon” adjudication of a&para;<br>claim created by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856. This case&para;<br>involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of&para;<br>a final, binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdic&para;<br>tion, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither de&para;<br>rives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime. If such&para;<br>an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Arti&para;<br>cle III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous “public&para;<br>right,” then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of in&para;<br>dividual liberty and separation of powers the Court has long recog&para;<br>nized into mere wishful thinking. Pp. 22–29.&para;<br>(c) The fact that Pierce filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy&para;<br>proceedings did not give the Bankruptcy Court the authority to adju&para;<br>dicate Vickie’s counterclaim. Initially, Pierce’s defamation claim does&para;<br>not affect the nature of Vickie’s tortious interference counterclaim as&para;<br>one at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy&para;<br>estate—the type of claim that, under Northern Pipeline and Granfi&para;<br>nanciera, must be decided by an Article III court. The cases on which&para;<br>Vickie relies, Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, and Langenkamp v.&para;<br>Culp, 498 U. S. 42 (per curiam), are inapposite. Katchen permitted a&para;<br>bankruptcy referee to exercise jurisdiction over a trustee’s voidable&para;<br>preference claim against a creditor only where there was no question&para;<br>that the referee was required to decide whether there had been a&para;<br>voidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to al&para;<br>low the creditor’s claim. The Katchen Court “intimate[d] no opinion&para;<br>concerning whether” the bankruptcy referee would have had “sum&para;<br>mary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee&para;<br>for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for&para;<br>which ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the&para;<br>[creditor’s proof of ] claim.” 382 U. S., at 333, n. 9. The per curiam&para;<br>opinion in Langenkamp is to the same effect. In this case, by con&para;<br>trast, the Bankruptcy Court—in order to resolve Vickie’s counter&para;<br>claim—was required to and did make several factual and legal de&para;<br>terminations that were not “disposed of in passing on objections” to&para;<br>Pierce’s proof of claim. In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover,&para;<br>the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of re&para;<br>covery created by federal bankruptcy law. Vickie’s claim is instead a&para;<br>state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy pro&para;<br>ceeding. Pp. 29–34.&para;<br>(d) The bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are not “adjuncts”&para;<br>of the district courts. The new bankruptcy courts, like the courts&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>considered in Northern Pipeline, do not “ma[k]e only specialized, nar&para;<br>rowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized&para;<br>area of law” or engage in “statutorily channeled factfinding func&para;<br>tions.” 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion). Whereas the adjunct&para;<br>agency in Crowell v. Benson “possessed only a limited power to issue&para;<br>compensation orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the&para;<br>district court,” ibid., a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim un&para;<br>der §157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter “appropriate orders and&para;<br>judgments”—including final judgments—subject to review only if a&para;<br>party chooses to appeal, see §§157(b)(1), 158(a)–(b). Such a court is&para;<br>an adjunct of no one. Pp. 34–36.&para;<br>(e) Finally, Vickie and her amici predict that restrictions on a&para;<br>bankruptcy court’s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory&para;<br>counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional&para;<br>costs on the bankruptcy process. It goes without saying that “the fact&para;<br>that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in&para;<br>facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if&para;<br>it is contrary to the Constitution.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,&para;<br>944. In addition, the Court is not convinced that the practical conse&para;<br>quences of such limitations are as significant as Vickie suggests. The&para;<br>framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates&para;<br>that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by&para;<br>state courts and district courts, see §§157(c), 1334(c), and the Court&para;<br>does not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie’s from&para;<br>core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of la&para;<br>bor in the statute. Pp. 36–38.&para;<br>&para;<br>600 F. 3d 1037, affirmed.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which SCALIA,&para;<br>KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., joined.

Innumerable children have been born into&para;<br>the cause: innumerable young people have married into&para;<br>it;” and, sadly, the original parties “have died out of it.” A&para;<br>“long procession of [judges] has come in and gone out” dur­&para;<br>ing that time, and still the suit “drags its weary length&para;<br>before the Court.”&para;<br>Those words were not written about this case, see&para;<br>C. Dickens, Bleak House, in 1 Works of Charles Dickens&para;<br>4–5 (1891), but they could have been. This is the second&para;<br>time we have had occasion to weigh in on this long­&para;<br>running dispute between Vickie Lynn Marshall and E.&para;<br>Pierce Marshall over the fortune of J. Howard Marshall II,&para;<br>a man believed to have been one of the richest people in&para;<br>Texas. The Marshalls’ litigation has worked its way&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>through state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and&para;<br>California, and two of those courts—a Texas state probate&para;<br>court and the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District&para;<br>of California—have reached contrary decisions on its mer­&para;<br>its. The Court of Appeals below held that the Texas state&para;<br>decision controlled, after concluding that the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a&para;<br>counterclaim that Vickie brought against Pierce in her&para;<br>bankruptcy proceeding.1 To determine whether the Court&para;<br>of Appeals was correct in that regard, we must resolve two&para;<br>issues: (1) whether the Bankruptcy Court had the statu­&para;<br>tory authority under 28 U. S. C. §157(b) to issue a final&para;<br>judgment on Vickie’s counterclaim; and (2) if so, whether&para;<br>conferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is&para;<br>constitutional.&para;<br>Although the history of this litigation is complicated, its&para;<br>resolution ultimately turns on very basic principles. Arti­&para;<br>cle III, §1, of the Constitution commands that “[t]he judi­&para;<br>cial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one&para;<br>supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con­&para;<br>gress may from time to time ordain and establish.” That&para;<br>Article further provides that the judges of those courts&para;<br>shall hold their offices during good behavior, without&para;<br>diminution of salary. Ibid. Those requirements of Article&para;<br>III were not honored here. The Bankruptcy Court in this&para;<br>case exercised the judicial power of the United States by&para;<br>entering final judgment on a common law tort claim, even&para;<br>though the judges of such courts enjoy neither tenure&para;<br>during good behavior nor salary protection. We conclude&para;<br>that, although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory&para;<br>authority to enter judgment on Vickie’s counterclaim, it&para;<br>lacked the constitutional authority to do so.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Because both Vickie and Pierce passed away during this litigation,&para;<br>the parties in this case are Vickie’s estate and Pierce’s estate. We&para;<br>continue to refer to them as “Vickie” and “Pierce.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Because we have already recounted the facts and proce­&para;<br>dural history of this case in detail, see Marshall v. Mar&para;<br>shall, 547 U. S. 293, 300–305 (2006), we do not repeat&para;<br>them in full here. Of current relevance are two claims&para;<br>Vickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J. Howard’s&para;<br>fortune. Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith,&para;<br>Vickie was J. Howard’s third wife and married him about&para;<br>a year before his death. Id., at 300; see In re Marshall,&para;<br>392 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004). Although J. Howard&para;<br>bestowed on Vickie many monetary and other gifts during&para;<br>their courtship and marriage, he did not include her in&para;<br>his will. 547 U. S., at 300. Before J. Howard passed away,&para;<br>Vickie filed suit in Texas state probate court, asserting&para;<br>that Pierce—J. Howard’s younger son—fraudulently in­&para;<br>duced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did not include&para;<br>her, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his&para;<br>property. Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and de­&para;<br>fended the validity of J. Howard’s trust and, eventually,&para;<br>his will. 392 F. 3d, at 1122–1123, 1125.&para;<br>After J. Howard’s death, Vickie filed a petition for bank­&para;<br>ruptcy in the Central District of California. Pierce filed a&para;<br>complaint in that bankruptcy proceeding, contending that&para;<br>Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell&para;<br>members of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain&para;<br>control of his father’s assets. 547 U. S., at 300–301; In re&para;<br>Marshall, 600 F. 3d 1037, 1043–1044 (CA9 2010). The&para;<br>complaint sought a declaration that Pierce’s defamation&para;<br>claim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceed­&para;<br>ings. Ibid.; see 11 U. S. C. §523(a). Pierce subsequently&para;<br>filed a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning&para;<br>that he sought to recover damages for it from Vickie’s&para;<br>bankruptcy estate. See §501(a). Vickie responded to&para;<br>Pierce’s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to&para;<br>the alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for&para;<br>tortious interference with the gift she expected from J.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Howard. As she had in state court, Vickie alleged that&para;<br>Pierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking&para;<br>the legal steps necessary to provide her with half his&para;<br>property. 547 U. S., at 301.&para;<br>On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued&para;<br>an order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce’s&para;<br>claim for defamation. On September 27, 2000, after a&para;<br>bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment&para;<br>on Vickie’s counterclaim in her favor. The court later&para;<br>awarded Vickie over $400 million in compensatory dam­&para;<br>ages and $25 million in punitive damages. 600 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1045; see 253 B. R. 550, 561–562 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.&para;<br>2000); 257 B. R. 35, 39–40 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000).&para;<br>In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie’s counter­&para;<br>claim. In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made&para;<br>earlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court’s authority over the counterclaim was limited be­&para;<br>cause Vickie’s counterclaim was not a “core proceeding”&para;<br>under 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(C). See 257 B. R., at 39. As&para;<br>explained below, bankruptcy courts may hear and enter final judgments in “core proceedings” in a bankruptcy&para;<br>case.

The&para;<br>District Court accordingly concluded that a “counterclaim&para;<br>should not be characterized as core” when it “is only&para;<br>somewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted,&para;<br>and when the unique characteristics and context of the&para;<br>counterclaim place it outside of the normal type of set-off&para;<br>or other counterclaims that customarily arise.” 264 B.

With&para;<br>those concerns in mind, the court concluded that “a coun­&para;<br>terclaim under §157(b)(2)(C) is properly a ‘core’ proceeding&para;<br>‘arising in a case under’ the [Bankruptcy] Code only if the&para;<br>counterclaim is so closely related to [a creditor’s] proof of&para;<br>claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary&para;<br>to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim it­&para;<br>self.” Id., at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted;&para;<br>second brackets added). The court ruled that Vickie’s&para;<br>counterclaim did not meet that test. Id., at 1059. That&para;<br>holding made “the Texas probate court’s judgment . . . the&para;<br>earliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this&para;<br>proceeding,” and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded&para;<br>that the District Court should have “afford[ed] preclusive&para;<br>effect” to the Texas “court’s determination of relevant legal&para;<br>and factual issues.” Id., at 1064–1065.2&para;<br>We again granted certiorari. 561 U.

The “aris­&para;<br>ing under” and “arising in” phrases might, as Pierce sug­&para;<br>gests, be read as referring to a limited category of those&para;<br>core proceedings that are addressed in that section. On&para;<br>the other hand, the phrases might be read as simply de­&para;<br>scribing what core proceedings are: matters arising under&para;<br>Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. In this case the structure&para;<br>and context of §157 contradict Pierce’s interpretation of&para;<br>§157(b)(1).&para;<br>As an initial matter, Pierce’s reading of the statute&para;<br>necessarily assumes that there is a category of core pro­&para;<br>ceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a&para;<br>Title 11 case. The manner in which the statute delineates&para;<br>the bankruptcy courts’ authority, however, makes plain&para;<br>that no such category exists. Section 157(b)(1) authorizes&para;<br>bankruptcy judges to enter final judgments in “core pro­&para;<br>ceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under&para;<br>title 11.” Section 157(c)(1) instructs bankruptcy judges to&para;<br>instead submit proposed findings in “a proceeding that is&para;<br>not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a&para;<br>case under title 11.” Nowhere does §157 specify what&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v.

To the contrary,&para;<br>§157(b)(3) only instructs a bankruptcy judge to “deter­&para;<br>mine, on the judge’s own motion or on timely motion of a&para;<br>party, whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under&para;<br>this subsection or is a proceeding that is otherwise related&para;<br>to a case under title 11.” Two options.

MARSHALL &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>&para;<br>Pierce argues, as another alternative to reaching the&para;<br>constitutional question, that the Bankruptcy Court lacked&para;<br>jurisdiction to enter final judgment on his defamation&para;<br>claim. Section 157(b)(5) provides that “[t]he district court&para;<br>shall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death&para;<br>claims shall be tried in the district court in which the&para;<br>bankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the&para;<br>district in which the claim arose.” Pierce asserts that&para;<br>his defamation claim is a “personal injury tort,” that the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court therefore had no jurisdiction over that&para;<br>claim, and that the court therefore necessarily lacked&para;<br>jurisdiction over Vickie’s counterclaim as well. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 65–66.&para;<br>Vickie objects to Pierce’s statutory analysis across the&para;<br>board. To begin, Vickie contends that §157(b)(5) does not&para;<br>address subject matter jurisdiction at all, but simply&para;<br>specifies the venue in which “personal injury tort and&para;<br>wrongful death claims” should be tried. See Reply Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 16–17, 19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (Dep­&para;<br>uty Solicitor General) (Section “157(b)(5) is in [the United&para;<br>States’] view not jurisdictional”). Given the limited scope&para;<br>of that provision, Vickie argues, a party may waive or for­&para;<br>feit any objections under §157(b)(5), in the same way that&para;<br>a party may waive or forfeit an objection to the bank­&para;<br>ruptcy court finally resolving a non-core claim.

Vickie asserts that in&para;<br>this case Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court’s&para;<br>adjudication of his defamation claim, and forfeited any&para;<br>argument to the contrary, by failing to seek withdrawal of&para;<br>the claim until he had litigated it before the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court for 27 months.

Had Pierce preserved his argument under that provi­&para;<br>sion, we would have been confronted with several questions on which&para;<br>there is little consensus or precedent. Those issues include: (1) the&para;<br>scope of the phrase “personal injury tort”—a question over which there&para;<br>is at least a three-way divide, see In re Arnold, 407 B. R. 849, 851–853&para;<br>(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2009); (2) whether, as Vickie argued in the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, the requirement that a personal injury tort claim be “tried” in&para;<br>the district court nonetheless permits the bankruptcy court to resolve&para;<br>the claim short of trial, see Appellee’s/Cross-Appellant’s Supplemental&para;<br>Brief in No. 02–56002 etc. (CA9), p. 24; see also In re Dow Corning&para;<br>Corp., 215 B. R. 346, 349–351 (Bkrtcy. Ct.

Arbaugh v.&para;<br>Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U.

S. C. §1367, over pendent state-law claims”). We express no opinion&para;<br>on any of these issues and simply note that the §157(b)(5) question is&para;<br>not as straightforward as Pierce would have it.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a juris­&para;<br>dictional decree. To begin, the statutory text does not&para;<br>refer to either district court or bankruptcy court “jurisdic­&para;<br>tion,” instead addressing only where personal injury tort&para;<br>claims “shall be tried.”&para;<br>The statutory context also belies Pierce’s jurisdictional&para;<br>claim. Section 157 allocates the authority to enter final&para;<br>judgment between the bankruptcy court and the district&para;<br>court. See §§157(b)(1), (c)(1). That allocation does not&para;<br>implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction. See&para;<br>§157(c)(2) (parties may consent to entry of final judgment&para;<br>by bankruptcy judge in non-core case).&para;<br>By the same&para;<br>token, §157(b)(5) simply specifies where a particular cate­&para;<br>gory of cases should be tried. Pierce does not explain why&para;<br>that statutory limitation may not be similarly waived.&para;<br>We agree with Vickie that Pierce not only could but did&para;<br>consent to the Bankruptcy Court’s resolution of his defa­&para;<br>mation claim. Before the Bankruptcy Court, Vickie ob­&para;<br>jected to Pierce’s proof of claim for defamation, arguing&para;<br>that Pierce’s claim was unenforceable and that Pierce&para;<br>should not receive any amount for it. See 29 Court of&para;<br>Appeals Supplemental Excerpts of Record 6031, 6035&para;<br>(hereinafter Supplemental Record). Vickie also noted&para;<br>that the Bankruptcy Court could defer ruling on her objec­&para;<br>tion, given the litigation posture of Pierce’s claim before&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Court. See id., at 6031. Vickie’s filing&para;<br>prompted Pierce to advise the Bankruptcy Court that “[a]ll&para;<br>parties are in agreement that the amount of the contin­&para;<br>gent Proof of Claim filed by [Pierce] shall be determined&para;<br>by the adversary proceedings” that had been commenced&para;<br>in the Bankruptcy Court. 31 Supplemental Record 6801.&para;<br>Pierce asserted that Vickie’s objection should be overruled&para;<br>or, alternatively, that any ruling on the objection “should&para;<br>be continued until the resolution of the pending adversary&para;<br>proceeding litigation.” Ibid. Pierce identifies no point in&para;<br>the record where he argued to the Bankruptcy Court that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>it lacked the authority to adjudicate his proof of claim be­&para;<br>cause the claim sought recompense for a personal injury tort.&para;<br>Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to any court&para;<br>that §157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from&para;<br>resolving his defamation claim until over two years—and&para;<br>several adverse discovery rulings—after he filed that&para;<br>claim in June 1996. The first filing Pierce cites as raising that objection is his September 22, 1998 motion to the&para;<br>District Court to withdraw the reference of the case to the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court. See Brief for Respondent 26–27. The&para;<br>District Court did initially withdraw the reference as&para;<br>requested, but it then returned the proceeding to the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce “implicated the&para;<br>jurisdiction of that bankruptcy court. He chose to be a&para;<br>party to that litigation.” App. 129. Although Pierce had&para;<br>objected in July 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court’s exercise of&para;<br>jurisdiction over Vickie’s counterclaim, he advised the&para;<br>court at that time that he was “happy to litigate [his]&para;<br>claim” there. 29 Supplemental Record 6101. Counsel&para;<br>stated that even though Pierce thought it was “probably&para;<br>cheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce’s claim] were sent back&para;<br>or joined back with the State Court litigation,” Pierce “did&para;<br>choose” the Bankruptcy Court forum and “would be more&para;<br>than pleased to do it [t]here.” Id., at 6101–6102; see also&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 266, n. 17 (District Court referring to&para;<br>these statements).&para;<br>Given Pierce’s course of conduct before the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court, we conclude that he consented to that court’s reso­&para;<br>lution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument&para;<br>to the contrary). We have recognized “the value of waiver&para;<br>and forfeiture rules” in “complex” cases, Exxon Shipping&para;<br>Co. v. Baker, 554 U. S. 471, 487–488, n. 6 (2008), and&para;<br>this case is no exception. In such cases, as here, the&para;<br>consequences of “a litigant . . . ‘sandbagging’ the court—&para;<br>remaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising&para;<br>the error only if the case does not conclude in his favor,”&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 5) (some internal quotation marks omitted)—can be&para;<br>particularly severe. If Pierce believed that the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Court lacked the authority to decide his claim for&para;<br>defamation, then he should have said so—and said so&para;<br>promptly. See United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731&para;<br>(1993) (“ ‘No procedural principle is more familiar to this&para;<br>Court than that a constitutional right,’ or a right of any&para;<br>other sort, ‘may be forfeited . . . by the failure to make&para;<br>timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having&para;<br>jurisdiction to determine it’ ” (quoting Yakus v. United&para;<br>States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944))). Instead, Pierce repeat­&para;<br>edly stated to the Bankruptcy Court that he was happy&para;<br>to litigate there. We will not consider his claim to the&para;<br>contrary, now that he is sad.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although we conclude that §157(b)(2)(C) permits the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickie’s&para;<br>counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution does not.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Article III, §1, of the Constitution mandates that “[t]he&para;<br>judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one&para;<br>supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con­&para;<br>gress may from time to time ordain and establish.” The&para;<br>same section provides that the judges of those constitu­&para;<br>tional courts “shall hold their Offices during good Behav­&para;<br>iour” and “receive for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ]&para;<br>[that] shall not be diminished” during their tenure.&para;<br>As its text and our precedent confirm, Article III is “an&para;<br>inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks&para;<br>and balances” that “both defines the power and protects&para;<br>the independence of the Judicial Branch.” Northern Pipe&para;<br>line, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion). Under “the basic&para;<br>concept of separation of powers . . . that flow[s] from the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

S. 683, 704 (1974) (quoting U. S. Const.,&para;<br>Art. III, §1).&para;<br>In establishing the system of divided power in the Con­&para;<br>stitution, the Framers considered it essential that “the&para;<br>judiciary remain[ ] truly distinct from both the legislature and the executive.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 466&para;<br>(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). As Hamilton put it,&para;<br>quoting Montesquieu, “ ‘there is no liberty if the power of&para;<br>judging be not separated from the legislative and execu­&para;<br>tive powers.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 1 Montesquieu, Spirit of&para;<br>Laws 181).&para;<br>We have recognized that the three branches are not&para;<br>hermetically sealed from one another, see Nixon v. Admin&para;<br>istrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977), but&para;<br>it remains true that Article III imposes some basic limita­&para;<br>tions that the other branches may not transgress. Those&para;<br>limitations serve two related purposes. “Separation-of­&para;<br>powers principles are intended, in part, to protect each&para;<br>branch of government from incursion by the others. Yet&para;<br>the dynamic between and among the branches is not the&para;<br>only object of the Constitution’s concern. The structural&para;<br>principles secured by the separation of powers protect the&para;<br>individual as well.” Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>Article III protects liberty not only through its role in&para;<br>implementing the separation of powers, but also by speci­&para;<br>fying the defining characteristics of Article III judges. The&para;<br>colonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand&para;<br>of the Crown, and the Framers knew the main reasons&para;<br>why: because the King of Great Britain “made Judges&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices,&para;<br>and the amount and payment of their salaries.” The&para;<br>Declaration of Independence ¶11. The Framers undertook&para;<br>in Article III to protect citizens subject to the judicial&para;<br>power of the new Federal Government from a repeat of&para;<br>those abuses. By appointing judges to serve without term&para;<br>limits, and restricting the ability of the other branches to&para;<br>remove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers&para;<br>sought to ensure that each judicial decision would be&para;<br>rendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with&para;<br>Congress or the Executive, but rather with the “[c]lear&para;<br>heads . . . and honest hearts” deemed “essential to good&para;<br>judges.” 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed.&para;<br>1896).&para;<br>Article III could neither serve its purpose in the system&para;<br>of checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of judi­&para;<br>cial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal&para;<br>Government could confer the Government’s “judicial&para;<br>Power” on entities outside Article III. That is why we&para;<br>have long recognized that, in general, Congress may not&para;<br>“withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,&para;<br>from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,&para;<br>or in equity, or admiralty.” Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken&para;<br>Land &amp; Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284 (1856). When&para;<br>a suit is made of “the stuff of the traditional actions at&para;<br>common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789,”&para;<br>Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 90 (Rehnquist, J., concur­&para;<br>ring in judgment), and is brought within the bounds of&para;<br>federal jurisdiction, the responsibility for deciding that&para;<br>suit rests with Article III judges in Article III courts. The&para;<br>Constitution assigns that job—resolution of “the mundane&para;<br>as well as the glamorous, matters of common law and&para;<br>statute as well as constitutional law, issues of fact as well&para;<br>as issues of law”—to the Judiciary.

The Court&para;<br>concluded that assignment of such state law claims for&para;<br>resolution by those judges “violates Art. III of the Con­&para;<br>stitution.” Id., at 52, 87 (plurality opinion); id., at 91&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>The plurality in Northern Pipeline recognized that&para;<br>there was a category of cases involving “public rights”&para;<br>that Congress could constitutionally assign to “legislative”&para;<br>courts for resolution. That opinion concluded that this&para;<br>“public rights” exception extended “only to matters arising&para;<br>between” individuals and the Government “in connection&para;<br>with the performance of the constitutional functions of the&para;<br>executive or legislative departments . . . that historically&para;<br>could have been determined exclusively by those”&para;<br>branches. Id., at 67–68 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on&para;<br>the scope of the exception, concluded that the doctrine did&para;<br>not encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue&para;<br>in that case. Id., at 69–72; see id., at 90–91 (Rehnquist, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (“None of the [previous cases&para;<br>addressing Article III power] has gone so far as to sanction&para;<br>the type of adjudication to which Marathon will be sub­&para;<br>jected . . . .

Id., at 71–72, 81–86&para;<br>(plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (“the bankruptcy court is not an ‘adjunct’ of&para;<br>either the district court or the court of appeals”).&para;<br>After our decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress re­&para;<br>vised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and&para;<br>bankruptcy judges. In the 1984 Act, Congress provided&para;<br>that the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be&para;<br>appointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which&para;<br>their districts are located. 28 U. S. C. §152(a). And, as we&para;<br>have explained, Congress permitted the newly constituted&para;<br>bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in “core”&para;<br>proceedings. See supra, at 7–8.&para;<br>With respect to such “core” matters, however, the bank­&para;<br>ruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same pow­&para;<br>ers they wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978&para;<br>Act), 92 Stat. 2549. As in Northern Pipeline, for example,&para;<br>the newly constituted bankruptcy courts are charged&para;<br>under §157(b)(2)(C) with resolving “[a]ll matters of fact&para;<br>and law in whatever domains of the law to which” a coun­&para;<br>terclaim may lead. 458 U.

And, as in Northern Pipeline, the&para;<br>district courts review the judgments of the bankruptcy&para;<br>courts in core proceedings only under the usual limited&para;<br>appellate standards. That requires marked deference to,&para;<br>among other things, the bankruptcy judges’ findings of&para;<br>fact. See §158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013 (findings of&para;<br>fact “shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous”).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Vickie and the dissent argue that the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court’s entry of final judgment on her state common law&para;<br>counterclaim was constitutional, despite the similarities&para;<br>between the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act and&para;<br>those exercising core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act. We&para;<br>disagree. It is clear that the Bankruptcy Court in this&para;<br>case exercised the “judicial Power of the United States” in&para;<br>purporting to resolve and enter final judgment on a state&para;<br>common law claim, just as the court did in Northern Pipe&para;<br>line. No “public right” exception excuses the failure to&para;<br>comply with Article III in doing so, any more than in&para;<br>Northern Pipeline. Vickie argues that this case is different&para;<br>because the defendant is a creditor in the bankruptcy.&para;<br>But the debtors’ claims in the cases on which she relies&para;<br>were themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law,&para;<br>which would be completely resolved in the bankruptcy&para;<br>process of allowing or disallowing claims. Here Vickie’s&para;<br>claim is a state law action independent of the federal&para;<br>bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling&para;<br>on the creditor’s proof of claim in bankruptcy. Northern&para;<br>Pipeline and our subsequent decision in Granfinanciera,&para;<br>492 U. S. 33, rejected the application of the “public rights”&para;<br>exception in such cases.&para;<br>Nor can the bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act be&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dismissed as mere adjuncts of Article III courts, any more&para;<br>than could the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act. The&para;<br>judicial powers the courts exercise in cases such as this&para;<br>remain the same, and a court exercising such broad pow­&para;<br>ers is no mere adjunct of anyone.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Vickie’s counterclaim cannot be deemed a matter of&para;<br>“public right” that can be decided outside the Judicial&para;<br>Branch. As explained above, in Northern Pipeline we&para;<br>rejected the argument that the public rights doctrine&para;<br>permitted a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law&para;<br>suit brought by a debtor against a company that had not&para;<br>filed a claim against the estate. See 458 U. S., at 69–72&para;<br>(plurality opinion); id., at 90–91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring&para;<br>in judgment). Although our discussion of the public rights&para;<br>exception since that time has not been entirely consistent,&para;<br>and the exception has been the subject of some debate,&para;<br>this case does not fall within any of the various formula­&para;<br>tions of the concept that appear in this Court’s opinions.&para;<br>We first recognized the category of public rights in Mur&para;<br>ray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., 18&para;<br>How. 272 (1856). That case involved the Treasury De­&para;<br>partment’s sale of property belonging to a customs collec­&para;<br>tor who had failed to transfer payments to the Federal&para;<br>Government that he had collected on its behalf. Id., at&para;<br>274, 275. The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land&para;<br>through a different transfer, objected that the Treasury&para;<br>Department’s calculation of the deficiency and sale of the&para;<br>property was void, because it was a judicial act that could&para;<br>not be assigned to the Executive under Article III. Id., at&para;<br>274–275, 282–283.&para;<br>“To avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject,” the&para;<br>Court laid out the principles guiding its analysis. Id., at&para;<br>284. It confirmed that Congress cannot “withdraw from&para;<br>judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or&para;<br>admiralty.” Ibid. The Court also recognized that “[a]t the&para;<br>same time there are matters, involving public rights,&para;<br>which may be presented in such form that the judicial&para;<br>power is capable of acting on them, and which are suscep­&para;<br>tible of judicial determination, but which congress may or&para;<br>may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the&para;<br>United States, as it may deem proper.” Ibid.&para;<br>As an example of such matters, the Court referred to&para;<br>“[e]quitable claims to land by the inhabitants of ceded&para;<br>territories” and cited cases in which land issues were&para;<br>conclusively resolved by Executive Branch officials. Ibid.&para;<br>(citing Foley v. Harrison, 15 How. 433 (1854); Burgess v.&para;<br>Gray, 16 How. 48 (1854)). In those cases “it depends upon&para;<br>the will of congress whether a remedy in the courts shall&para;<br>be allowed at all,” so Congress could limit the extent to&para;<br>which a judicial forum was available. Murray’s Lessee, 18&para;<br>How., at 284. The challenge in Murray’s Lessee to the&para;<br>Treasury Department’s sale of the collector’s land likewise&para;<br>fell within the “public rights” category of cases, because it&para;<br>could only be brought if the Federal Government chose to&para;<br>allow it by waiving sovereign immunity. Id., at 283–284.&para;<br>The point of Murray’s Lessee was simply that Congress&para;<br>may set the terms of adjudicating a suit when the suit&para;<br>could not otherwise proceed at all.&para;<br>Subsequent decisions from this Court contrasted cases&para;<br>within the reach of the public rights exception—those&para;<br>arising “between the Government and persons subject to&para;<br>its authority in connection with the performance of the&para;<br>constitutional functions of the executive or legislative&para;<br>departments”—and those that were instead matters “of&para;<br>private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to&para;<br>another under the law as defined.” Crowell v.

In other words, it is&para;<br>still the case that what makes a right “public” rather than&para;<br>private is that the right is integrally related to particular&para;<br>federal government action.

This Court held that the&para;<br>scheme did not violate Article III, explaining that “[a]ny&para;<br>right to compensation . . . results from [the statute] and&para;<br>does not depend on or replace a right to such compensa­&para;<br>tion under state law.” Id., at 584.&para;<br>Commodity Futures Trading Commission v.

This Court&para;<br>disagreed, but only after observing that (1) the claim and&para;<br>the counterclaim concerned a “single dispute”—the same&para;<br>account balance; (2) the CFTC’s assertion of authority&para;<br>involved only “a narrow class of common law claims” in&para;<br>a “ ‘particularized area of law’ ”; (3) the area of law in&para;<br>question was governed by “a specific and limited federal&para;<br>regulatory scheme” as to which the agency had “obvious&para;<br>expertise”; (4) the parties had freely elected to resolve&para;<br>their differences before the CFTC; and (5) CFTC orders&para;<br>were “enforceable only by order of the district court.” Id.,&para;<br>at 844, 852–855 (quoting Northern Pipeline, 458 U.

Most signifi­&para;<br>cantly, given that the customer’s reparations claim before&para;<br>the agency and the broker’s counterclaim were competing&para;<br>claims to the same amount, the Court repeatedly empha­&para;<br>sized that it was “necessary” to allow the agency to exer­&para;<br>cise jurisdiction over the broker’s claim, or else “the&para;<br>reparations procedure would have been confounded.”&para;<br>Id., at 856.&para;<br>The most recent case in which we considered application&para;<br>of the public rights exception—and the only case in which&para;<br>we have considered that doctrine in the bankruptcy con­&para;<br>text since Northern Pipeline—is Granfinanciera, S.

We explained&para;<br>that, “[i]f a statutory right is not closely intertwined with&para;<br>a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact,&para;<br>and if that right neither belongs to nor exists against the&para;<br>Federal Government, then it must be adjudicated by an&para;<br>Article III court.” Id., at 54–55. We reasoned that fraudu­&para;<br>lent conveyance suits were “quintessentially suits at com­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mon law that more nearly resemble state law contract&para;<br>claims brought by a bankrupt corporation to augment the&para;<br>bankruptcy estate than they do creditors’ hierarchically&para;<br>ordered claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res.”&para;<br>Id., at 56. As a consequence, we concluded that fraudulent&para;<br>conveyance actions were “more accurately characterized as&para;<br>a private rather than a public right as we have used those&para;<br>terms in our Article III decisions.” Id., at 55.7&para;<br>Vickie’s counterclaim—like the fraudulent conveyance&para;<br>claim at issue in Granfinanciera—does not fall within any&para;<br>of the varied formulations of the public rights exception in&para;<br>this Court’s cases. It is not a matter that can be pursued&para;<br>only by grace of the other branches, as in Murray’s Lessee,&para;<br>18 How., at 284, or one that “historically could have been&para;<br>determined exclusively by” those branches, Northern&para;<br>Pipeline, supra, at 68 (citing Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279&para;<br>U. S., at 458). The claim is instead one under state com­&para;<br>mon law between two private parties. It does not “de­&para;<br>pend[ ] on the will of congress,” Murray’s Lessee, supra, at&para;<br>284; Congress has nothing to do with it.&para;<br>In addition, Vickie’s claimed right to relief does not flow&para;<br>from a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S.,&para;<br>at 584–585, or Atlas Roofing, 430 U. S., at 458. It is not&para;<br>“completely dependent upon” adjudication of a claim cre­&para;<br>ated by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856. And in&para;<br>contrast to the objecting party in Schor, id., at 855–856,&para;<br>Pierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie’s claim&para;<br>in the bankruptcy court proceedings. He had nowhere else&para;<br>to go if he wished to recover from Vickie’s estate. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We noted that we did not mean to “suggest that the restructuring of&para;<br>debtor-creditor relations is in fact a public right.” 492 U. S., at 56,&para;<br>n. 11. Our conclusion was that, “even if one accepts this thesis,” Con­&para;<br>gress could not constitutionally assign resolution of the fraudulent&para;<br>conveyance action to a non-Article III court. Ibid. Because neither&para;<br>party asks us to reconsider the public rights framework for bankruptcy,&para;<br>we follow the same approach here.&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Granfinanciera, supra, at 59, n. 14 (noting that “[p]arallel&para;<br>reasoning [to Schor] is unavailable in the context of bank­&para;<br>ruptcy proceedings, because creditors lack an alternative&para;<br>forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their&para;<br>claims”).8&para;<br>Furthermore, the asserted authority to decide Vickie’s&para;<br>claim is not limited to a “particularized area of the law,”&para;<br>as in Crowell, Thomas, and Schor. Northern Pipeline, 458&para;<br>U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion). We deal here not with an&para;<br>agency but with a court, with substantive jurisdiction&para;<br>reaching any area of the corpus juris. See ibid.; id., at 91&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). This is not a&para;<br>situation in which Congress devised an “expert and inex­&para;<br>pensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact&para;<br>which are particularly suited to examination and determi­&para;<br>nation by an administrative agency specially assigned to&para;<br>that task.” Crowell, 285 U. S., at 46; see Schor, supra, at&para;<br>855–856. The “experts” in the federal system at resolving&para;<br>common law counterclaims such as Vickie’s are the Article&para;<br>III courts, and it is with those courts that her claim must&para;<br>stay.&para;<br>The dissent reads our cases differently, and in particu­&para;<br>lar contends that more recent cases view Northern Pipe&para;<br>line as “ ‘establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in&para;<br>a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render&para;<br>final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional&para;<br>contract action arising under state law, without consent of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Contrary to the claims of the dissent, see post, at 12–13, Pierce did&para;<br>not have another forum in which to pursue his claim to recover from&para;<br>Vickie’s pre-bankruptcy assets, rather than take his chances with&para;<br>whatever funds might remain after the Title 11 proceedings. Creditors&para;<br>who possess claims that do not satisfy the requirements for nondis­&para;<br>chargeability under 11 U. S. C. §523 have no choice but to file their&para;<br>claims in bankruptcy proceedings if they want to pursue the claims at&para;<br>all. That is why, as we recognized in Granfinanciera, the notion of&para;<br>“consent” does not apply in bankruptcy proceedings as it might in other&para;<br>contexts.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate re­&para;<br>view.’ ” Post, at 6 (quoting Thomas, supra, at 584). Just&para;<br>so: Substitute “tort” for “contract,” and that statement&para;<br>directly covers this case.&para;<br>We recognize that there may be instances in which the&para;<br>distinction between public and private rights—at least as&para;<br>framed by some of our recent cases—fails to provide con­&para;<br>crete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular&para;<br>agency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive&para;<br>regulatory scheme. Given the extent to which this case is&para;<br>so markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the&para;<br>public rights exception in the context of such a regime,&para;<br>however, we do not in this opinion express any view on&para;<br>how the doctrine might apply in that different context.&para;<br>What is plain here is that this case involves the most&para;<br>prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final,&para;<br>binding judgment by a court with broad substantive juris­&para;<br>diction, on a common law cause of action, when the action&para;<br>neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regula­&para;<br>tory regime. If such an exercise of judicial power may&para;<br>nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply&para;<br>by deeming it part of some amorphous “public right,” then&para;<br>Article III would be transformed from the guardian of&para;<br>individual liberty and separation of powers we have long&para;<br>recognized into mere wishful thinking.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Vickie and the dissent next attempt to distinguish&para;<br>Northern Pipeline and Granfinanciera on the ground that&para;<br>Pierce, unlike the defendants in those cases, had filed a&para;<br>proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Given&para;<br>Pierce’s participation in those proceedings, Vickie argues,&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Court had the authority to adjudicate her&para;<br>counterclaim under our decisions in Katchen v. Landy, 382&para;<br>U. S. 323 (1966), and Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U. S. 42&para;<br>(1990) (per curiam).&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We do not agree. As an initial matter, it is hard to see&para;<br>why Pierce’s decision to file a claim should make any&para;<br>difference with respect to the characterization of Vickie’s&para;<br>counterclaim. “ ‘[P]roperty interests are created and de­&para;<br>fined by state law,’ and ‘[u]nless some federal interest&para;<br>requires a different result, there is no reason why such&para;<br>interests should be analyzed differently simply because an&para;<br>interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.”&para;<br>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas&para;<br>&amp; Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443, 451 (2007) (quoting Butner v.&para;<br>United States, 440 U. S. 48, 55 (1979)). Pierce’s claim for&para;<br>defamation in no way affects the nature of Vickie’s coun­&para;<br>terclaim for tortious interference as one at common law&para;<br>that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate—&para;<br>the very type of claim that we held in Northern Pipeline&para;<br>and Granfinanciera must be decided by an Article III court.&para;<br>Contrary to Vickie’s contention, moreover, our decisions&para;<br>in Katchen and Langenkamp do not suggest a different&para;<br>result. Katchen permitted a bankruptcy referee acting&para;<br>under the Bankruptcy Acts of 1898 and 1938 (akin to a&para;<br>bankruptcy court today) to exercise what was known as&para;<br>“summary jurisdiction” over a voidable preference claim&para;<br>brought by the bankruptcy trustee against a creditor who&para;<br>had filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.&para;<br>See 382 U. S., at 325, 327–328. A voidable preference&para;<br>claim asserts that a debtor made a payment to a particu­&para;<br>lar creditor in anticipation of bankruptcy, to in effect&para;<br>increase that creditor’s proportionate share of the estate.&para;<br>The preferred creditor’s claim in bankruptcy can be disal­&para;<br>lowed as a result of the preference, and the amounts paid&para;<br>to that creditor can be recovered by the trustee. See id., at&para;<br>330; see also 11 U. S. C. §§502(d), 547(b).&para;<br>Although the creditor in Katchen objected that the&para;<br>preference issue should be resolved through a “plenary&para;<br>suit” in an Article III court, this Court concluded that&para;<br>summary adjudication in bankruptcy was appropriate,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>because it was not possible for the referee to rule on the&para;<br>creditor’s proof of claim without first resolving the void­&para;<br>able preference issue. 382 U. S., at 329–330, 332–333, and&para;<br>n. 9, 334. There was no question that the bankruptcy&para;<br>referee could decide whether there had been a voidable&para;<br>preference in determining whether and to what extent&para;<br>to allow the creditor’s claim. Once the referee did that,&para;<br>“nothing remains for adjudication in a plenary suit”; such&para;<br>a suit “would be a meaningless gesture.” Id., at 334. The&para;<br>plenary proceeding the creditor sought could be brought&para;<br>into the bankruptcy court because “the same issue [arose]&para;<br>as part of the process of allowance and disallowance of&para;<br>claims.” Id., at 336.&para;<br>It was in that sense that the Court stated that “he who&para;<br>invokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof&para;<br>of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the&para;<br>consequences of that procedure.” Id., at 333, n. 9. In&para;<br>Katchen one of those consequences was resolution of the&para;<br>preference issue as part of the process of allowing or disal­&para;<br>lowing claims, and accordingly there was no basis for the&para;<br>creditor to insist that the issue be resolved in an Article&para;<br>III court. See id., at 334. Indeed, the Katchen Court&para;<br>expressly noted that it “intimate[d] no opinion concerning&para;<br>whether” the bankruptcy referee would have had “sum­&para;<br>mary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bank­&para;<br>ruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial&para;<br>factual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed&para;<br>of in passing on objections to the [creditor’s proof of]&para;<br>claim.” Id., at 333, n. 9.&para;<br>Our per curiam opinion in Langenkamp is to the same&para;<br>effect. We explained there that a preferential transfer&para;<br>claim can be heard in bankruptcy when the allegedly&para;<br>favored creditor has filed a claim, because then “the ensu­&para;<br>ing preference action by the trustee become[s] integral to&para;<br>the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.” 498&para;<br>U. S., at 44. If, in contrast, the creditor has not filed a&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>proof of claim, the trustee’s preference action does not&para;<br>“become[ ] part of the claims-allowance process” subject to&para;<br>resolution by the bankruptcy court. Ibid.; see id., at 45.&para;<br>In ruling on Vickie’s counterclaim, the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court was required to and did make several factual and&para;<br>legal determinations that were not “disposed of in passing on objections” to Pierce’s proof of claim for defamation, which the court had denied almost a year earlier.&para;<br>Katchen, supra, at 332, n. 9. There was some overlap&para;<br>between Vickie’s counterclaim and Pierce’s defamation&para;<br>claim that led the courts below to conclude that the coun­&para;<br>terclaim was compulsory, 600 F. 3d, at 1057, or at least in&para;<br>an “attenuated” sense related to Pierce’s claim, 264 B. R.,&para;<br>at 631. But there was never any reason to believe that the&para;<br>process of adjudicating Pierce’s proof of claim would neces­&para;<br>sarily resolve Vickie’s counterclaim. See id., at 631, 632&para;<br>(explaining that “the primary facts at issue on Pierce’s&para;<br>claim were the relationship between Vickie and her attor­&para;<br>neys and her knowledge or approval of their statements,”&para;<br>and “the counterclaim raises issues of law entirely dif­&para;<br>ferent from those raise[d] on the defamation claim”). The&para;<br>United States acknowledges the point. See Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae, p. (I) (question presented&para;<br>concerns authority of a bankruptcy court to enter final&para;<br>judgment on a compulsory counterclaim “when adjudica­&para;<br>tion of the counterclaim requires resolution of issues that&para;<br>are not implicated by the claim against the estate”); id.,&para;<br>at 26.&para;<br>The only overlap between the two claims in this case&para;<br>was the question whether Pierce had in fact tortiously&para;<br>taken control of his father’s estate in the manner alleged&para;<br>by Vickie in her counterclaim and described in the alleg­&para;<br>edly defamatory statements. From the outset, it was clear&para;<br>that, even assuming the Bankruptcy Court would (as it&para;<br>did) rule in Vickie’s favor on that question, the court could&para;<br>not enter judgment for Vickie unless the court additionally&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ruled on the questions whether Texas recognized tortious&para;<br>interference with an expected gift as a valid cause of&para;<br>action, what the elements of that action were, and&para;<br>whether those elements were met in this case. 275 B. R.,&para;<br>at 50–53. Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted&para;<br>by other jurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to&para;<br>prove, above and beyond Pierce’s tortious interference, (1)&para;<br>the existence of an expectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable&para;<br>certainty that the expectancy would have been realized&para;<br>but for the interference; and (3) damages. Id., at 51; see&para;<br>253 B. R., at 558–561. Also, because Vickie sought puni­&para;<br>tive damages in connection with her counterclaim, the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the case in&para;<br>Vickie’s favor without determining whether to subject&para;<br>Pierce to the sort of “retribution,” “punishment[,] and&para;<br>deterrence,” Exxon Shipping Co., 554 U. S., at 492, 504&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted), those damages are&para;<br>designed to impose. There thus was never reason to&para;<br>believe that the process of ruling on Pierce’s proof of&para;<br>claim would necessarily result in the resolution of Vickie’s&para;<br>counterclaim.&para;<br>In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover, the trus­&para;<br>tee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of&para;<br>recovery created by federal bankruptcy law. In Langen&para;<br>kamp, we noted that “the trustee instituted adversary&para;<br>proceedings under 11 U. S. C. §547(b) to recover, as avoid­&para;<br>able preferences,” payments respondents received from the&para;<br>debtor before the bankruptcy filings. 498 U. S., at 43; see,&para;<br>e.g., §547(b)(1) (“the trustee may avoid any transfer of an&para;<br>interest of the debtor in property—(1) to or for the benefit&para;<br>of a creditor”). In Katchen, “[t]he Trustee . . . [asserted]&para;<br>that the payments made [to the creditor] were preferences&para;<br>inhibited by Section 60a of the Bankruptcy Act.” Memo­&para;<br>randum Opinion (Feb. 8, 1963), Tr. of Record in O. T.&para;<br>1965, No. 28, p. 3; see 382 U. S., at 334 (considering im­&para;<br>pact of the claims allowance process on “action by the&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>trustee under §60 to recover the preference”); 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§96(b) (1964 ed.) (§60(b) of the then-applicable Bankruptcy&para;<br>Act) (“preference may be avoided by the trustee if the&para;<br>creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby . . . has, at&para;<br>the time when the transfer is made, reasonable cause to&para;<br>believe that the debtor is insolvent”). Vickie’s claim, in&para;<br>contrast, is in no way derived from or dependent upon&para;<br>bankruptcy law; it is a state tort action that exists without&para;<br>regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.&para;<br>In light of all the foregoing, we disagree with the dissent&para;<br>that there are no “relevant distinction[s]” between Pierce’s&para;<br>claim in this case and the claim at issue in Langenkamp.&para;<br>Post, at 14. We see no reason to treat Vickie’s counter­&para;<br>claim any differently from the fraudulent conveyance&para;<br>action in Granfinanciera. 492 U. S., at 56. Granfinanci&para;<br>era’s distinction between actions that seek “to augment&para;<br>the bankruptcy estate” and those that seek “a pro rata&para;<br>share of the bankruptcy res,” ibid., reaffirms that Con­&para;<br>gress may not bypass Article III simply because a proceed­&para;<br>ing may have some bearing on a bankruptcy case; the&para;<br>question is whether the action at issue stems from the bank­&para;<br>ruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the&para;<br>claims allowance process. Vickie has failed to demon­&para;<br>strate that her counterclaim falls within one of the “lim­&para;<br>ited circumstances” covered by the public rights exception,&para;<br>particularly given our conclusion that, “even with respect&para;<br>to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the ‘public&para;<br>rights’ doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art. III&para;<br>courts.” Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 69, n. 23, 77,&para;<br>n. 29 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>3&para;<br>Vickie additionally argues that the Bankruptcy Court’s&para;<br>final judgment was constitutional because bankruptcy&para;<br>courts under the 1984 Act are properly deemed “adjuncts”&para;<br>of the district courts. Brief for Petitioner 61–64. We&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rejected a similar argument in Northern Pipeline, see 458&para;<br>U. S., at 84–86 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist,&para;<br>J., concurring in judgment), and our reasoning there holds&para;<br>true today.&para;<br>To begin, as explained above, it is still the bankruptcy&para;<br>court itself that exercises the essential attributes of judi­&para;<br>cial power over a matter such as Vickie’s counterclaim.&para;<br>See supra, at 20. The new bankruptcy courts, like the old,&para;<br>do not “ma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual&para;<br>determinations regarding a particularized area of law”&para;<br>or engage in “statutorily channeled factfinding functions.”&para;<br>Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Instead, bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act resolve&para;<br>“[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the&para;<br>law to which” the parties’ counterclaims might lead. Id.,&para;<br>at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>In addition, whereas the adjunct agency in Crowell v.&para;<br>Benson “possessed only a limited power to issue compensa­&para;<br>tion orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the&para;<br>district court,” Northern Pipeline, supra, at 85, a bank­&para;<br>ruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter “appropriate orders&para;<br>and judgments”—including final judgments—subject to&para;<br>review only if a party chooses to appeal, see §§157(b)(1),&para;<br>158(a)–(b). It is thus no less the case here than it was in&para;<br>Northern Pipeline that “[t]he authority—and the respon­&para;<br>sibility—to make an informed, final determination . . .&para;<br>remains with” the bankruptcy judge, not the district court.&para;<br>458 U. S., at 81 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Given that authority, a bankruptcy court&para;<br>can no more be deemed a mere “adjunct” of the district&para;<br>court than a district court can be deemed such an “ad­&para;<br>junct” of the court of appeals. We certainly cannot accept&para;<br>the dissent’s notion that judges who have the power to&para;<br>enter final, binding orders are the “functional[ ]” equiva­&para;<br>lent of “law clerks[ ] and the Judiciary’s administrative&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>officials.” Post, at 11. And even were we wrong in this&para;<br>regard, that would only confirm that such judges should&para;<br>not be in the business of entering final judgments in the&para;<br>first place.&para;<br>It does not affect our analysis that, as Vickie notes,&para;<br>bankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed by&para;<br>the Article III courts, rather than the President. See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 59. If—as we have concluded—the bank­&para;<br>ruptcy court itself exercises “the essential attributes of&para;<br>judicial power [that] are reserved to Article III courts,”&para;<br>Schor, 478 U. S., at 851 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted), it does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy&para;<br>judge or authorized the judge to render final judgments in&para;<br>such proceedings. The constitutional bar remains. See The&para;<br>Federalist No. 78, at 471 (“Periodical appointments, however&para;<br>regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or&para;<br>other, be fatal to [a judge’s] necessary independence”).&para;<br>D&para;<br>Finally, Vickie and her amici predict as a practical&para;<br>matter that restrictions on a bankruptcy court’s ability to&para;<br>hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will&para;<br>create significant delays and impose additional costs on&para;<br>the bankruptcy process. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 34–&para;<br>36, 57–58; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29–&para;<br>30. It goes without saying that “the fact that a given law&para;<br>or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facili­&para;<br>tating functions of government, standing alone, will not&para;<br>save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.” INS v.&para;<br>Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944 (1983).&para;<br>In addition, we are not convinced that the practical&para;<br>consequences of such limitations on the authority of bank­&para;<br>ruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as significant as&para;<br>Vickie and the dissent suggest. See post, at 16–17. The&para;<br>dissent asserts that it is important that counterclaims&para;<br>such as Vickie’s be resolved “in a bankruptcy court,” and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>37&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that, “to be effective, a single tribunal must have broad&para;<br>authority to restructure [debtor-creditor] relations.” Post,&para;<br>at 14, 15 (emphasis deleted). But the framework Congress&para;<br>adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain&para;<br>state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by&para;<br>judges other than those of the bankruptcy courts. Section&para;<br>1334(c)(2), for example, requires that bankruptcy courts&para;<br>abstain from hearing specified non-core, state law claims&para;<br>that “can be timely adjudicated[ ] in a State forum of ap­&para;<br>propriate jurisdiction.” Section 1334(c)(1) similarly pro­&para;<br>vides that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing&para;<br>any proceeding, including core matters, “in the interest of&para;<br>comity with State courts or respect for State law.”&para;<br>As described above, the current bankruptcy system also&para;<br>requires the district court to review de novo and enter&para;<br>final judgment on any matters that are “related to” the&para;<br>bankruptcy proceedings, §157(c)(1), and permits the dis­&para;<br>trict court to withdraw from the bankruptcy court any&para;<br>referred case, proceeding, or part thereof, §157(d). Pierce&para;<br>has not argued that the bankruptcy courts “are barred&para;<br>from ‘hearing’ all counterclaims” or proposing findings of&para;<br>fact and conclusions of law on those matters, but rather&para;<br>that it must be the district court that “finally decide[s]”&para;<br>them. Brief for Respondent 61. We do not think the re­&para;<br>moval of counterclaims such as Vickie’s from core bank­&para;<br>ruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of&para;<br>labor in the current statute; we agree with the United&para;<br>States that the question presented here is a “narrow” one.&para;<br>Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.&para;<br>If our decision today does not change all that much, then&para;<br>why the fuss? Is there really a threat to the separation of&para;<br>powers where Congress has conferred the judicial power&para;<br>outside Article III only over certain counterclaims in&para;<br>bankruptcy?

I count at least seven different reasons given in&para;<br>the Court’s opinion for concluding that an Article III judge&para;<br>was required to adjudicate this lawsuit: that it was one&para;<br>“under state common law” which was “not a matter that&para;<br>can be pursued only by grace of the other branches,” ante,&para;<br>at 27; that it was “not ‘completely dependent upon’ adjudi&para;<br>cation of a claim created by federal law,” ibid.; that “Pierce&para;<br>did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie’s claim in the&para;<br>bankruptcy court proceedings,” ibid.; that “the asserted&para;<br>authority to decide Vickie’s claim is not limited to a ‘par&para;<br>ticularized area of the law,’ ” ante, at 28; that “there was&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v.

For example, Article III gives no indication&para;<br>that state-law claims have preferential entitlement to an&para;<br>Article III judge; nor does it make pertinent the extent to&para;<br>which the area of the law is “particularized.” The multi&para;<br>factors relied upon today seem to have entered our juris&para;<br>prudence almost randomly.&para;<br>Leaving aside certain adjudications by federal adminis&para;<br>trative agencies, which are governed (for better or worse)&para;<br>by our landmark decision in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.&para;<br>22 (1932), in my view an Article III judge is required in all&para;<br>federal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established&para;<br>historical practice to the contrary. For that reason—and&para;<br>not because of some intuitive balancing of benefits and&para;<br>harms—I agree that Article III judges are not required in&para;<br>the context of territorial courts, courts-martial, or true&para;<br>“public rights” cases. See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v.&para;<br>Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 71 (1982) (plurality&para;<br>opinion).

The&para;<br>question before us is whether the Bankruptcy Court pos­&para;<br>sessed jurisdiction to adjudicate Vickie Marshall’s coun­&para;<br>terclaim.

The Court found&para;<br>evidence in common law of “summary method[s] for the&para;<br>recovery of debts due to the crown, and especially those&para;<br>due from receivers of the revenues,” 18 How., at 277, and&para;<br>it analogized the Government’s summary attachment&para;<br>process to the kind of self-help remedies available to pri­&para;<br>vate parties, id., at 283. In the course of its opinion, the&para;<br>Court wrote:&para;<br>“[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw&para;<br>from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or&para;<br>in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it&para;<br>bring under the judicial power a matter which, from&para;<br>its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination.&para;<br>At the same time there are matters, involving public&para;<br>rights, which may be presented in such form that the&para;<br>judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which&para;<br>are susceptible of judicial determination, but which&para;<br>congress may or may not bring within the cognizance&para;<br>of the courts of the United States, as it may deem&para;<br>proper.” Id., at 284.&para;<br>The majority reads the first part of the statement’s first&para;<br>sentence as authoritatively defining the boundaries of&para;<br>Article III. Ante, at 18. I would read the statement in a&para;<br>less absolute way. For one thing, the statement is in effect&para;<br>dictum. For another, it is the remainder of the statement,&para;<br>announcing a distinction between “public rights” and&para;<br>“private rights,” that has had the more lasting impact.&para;<br>Later Courts have seized on that distinction when uphold&para;<br>ing non-Article III adjudication, not when striking it&para;<br>down.

But in that case&para;<br>there was no majority. And a plurality, not a majority,&para;<br>read the statement roughly in the way the Court does&para;<br>today. See 458 U. S., at 67–70.&para;<br>B&para;<br>At the same time, I believe the majority places insuf­&para;<br>ficient weight on Crowell, a seminal case that clarified the&para;<br>scope of the dictum in Murray’s Lessee. In that case,&para;<br>the Court considered whether Congress could grant to an&para;<br>Article I administrative agency the power to adjudicate an&para;<br>employee’s workers’ compensation claim against his em­&para;<br>ployer. The Court assumed that an Article III court would&para;<br>review the agency’s decision de novo in respect to ques­&para;<br>tions of law but it would conduct a less searching review&para;<br>(looking to see only if the agency’s award was “supported&para;<br>by evidence in the record”) in respect to questions of fact.&para;<br>Crowell, 285 U. S., at 48–50. The Court pointed out that&para;<br>the case involved a dispute between private persons (a&para;<br>matter of “private rights”) and (with one exception not&para;<br>relevant here) it upheld Congress’ delegation of primary&para;<br>factfinding authority to the agency.&para;<br>Justice Brandeis, dissenting (from a here-irrelvant por­&para;<br>tion of the Court’s holding), wrote that the adjudicatory&para;<br>scheme raised only a due process question: When does due&para;<br>process require decision by an Article III judge? He an­&para;<br>swered that question by finding constitutional the stat­&para;<br>ute’s delegation of adjudicatory authority to an agency.&para;<br>Id., at 87.&para;<br>Crowell has been hailed as “the greatest of the cases&para;<br>validating administrative adjudication.” Bator, The Con­&para;<br>stitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative&para;<br>Courts Under Article III, 65 Ind.

C. §3612(b).&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority, in my view, overemphasizes the preceden­&para;<br>tial effect of the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline.&para;<br>Ante, at 19–21. There, the Court held unconstitutional the&para;<br>jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978&para;<br>granting adjudicatory authority to bankruptcy judges who&para;<br>lack the protections of tenure and compensation that&para;<br>Article III provides. Four Members of the Court wrote&para;<br>that Congress could grant adjudicatory authority to a nonArticle III judge only where (1) the judge sits on a “territo­&para;<br>rial cour[t]” (2) the judge conducts a “courts-martial,” or&para;<br>(3) the case involves a “public right,” namely, a “matter”&para;<br>that “at a minimum arise[s] ‘between the government and&para;<br>others.’ ” 458 U. S., at 64–70 (plurality opinion) (quoting&para;<br>Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451). Two other Mem­&para;<br>bers of the Court, without accepting these limitations,&para;<br>agreed with the result because the case involved a breach­&para;<br>of-contract claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee on&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>behalf of the bankruptcy estate against a third party who&para;<br>was not part of the bankruptcy proceeding, and none of&para;<br>the Court’s preceding cases (which, the two Members&para;<br>wrote, “do not admit of easy synthesis”) had “gone so far as&para;<br>to sanction th[is] type of adjudication.” 458 U. S., at 90–91&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J. concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Three years later, the Court held that Northern Pipeline&para;<br>“establishes only that Congress may not vest in a nonArticle III court the power to adjudicate, render final&para;<br>judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional&para;<br>contract action arising under state law, without con­&para;<br>sent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary ap­&para;<br>pellate review.” Thomas, 473 U. S., at 584.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Rather than leaning so heavily on the approach taken&para;<br>by the plurality in Northern Pipeline, I would look to this&para;<br>Court’s more recent Article III cases Thomas and Schor—&para;<br>cases that commanded a clear majority. In both cases&para;<br>the Court took a more pragmatic approach to the constitu­&para;<br>tional question. It sought to determine whether, in the&para;<br>particular instance, the challenged delegation of adjudica­&para;<br>tory authority posed a genuine and serious threat that one&para;<br>branch of Government sought to aggrandize its own con­&para;<br>stitutionally delegated authority by encroaching upon a&para;<br>field of authority that the Constitution assigns exclusively&para;<br>to another branch.&para;<br>1&para;<br>In Thomas, the Court focused directly upon the nature&para;<br>of the Article III problem, illustrating how the Court&para;<br>should determine whether a delegation of adjudicatory&para;<br>authority to a non-Article III judge violates the Constitu­&para;<br>tion. The statute in question required pesticide manufac­&para;<br>turers to submit to binding arbitration claims for compen­&para;<br>sation owed for the use by one manufacturer of the data of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>another to support its federal pesticide registration. After&para;<br>describing Northern Pipeline’s holding in the language I&para;<br>have set forth above, supra, at 6, the Court stated that&para;<br>“practical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire&para;<br>reliance on formal categories should inform application of&para;<br>Article III.” Thomas, 473 U. S., at 587 (emphasis added).&para;<br>It indicated that Article III’s requirements could not be&para;<br>“determined” by “the identity of the parties alone,” ibid.,&para;<br>or by the “private rights”/“public rights” distinction, id., at&para;<br>585–586. And it upheld the arbitration provision of the&para;<br>statute.&para;<br>The Court pointed out that the right in question was&para;<br>created by a federal statute, it “represent[s] a pragmatic&para;<br>solution to the difficult problem of spreading [certain]&para;<br>costs,” and the statute “does not preclude review of the&para;<br>arbitration proceeding by an Article III court.” Id., at&para;<br>589–592. The Court concluded:&para;<br>“Given the nature of the right at issue and the con­&para;<br>cerns motivating the Legislature, we do not think this&para;<br>system threatens the independent role of the Judici­&para;<br>ary in our constitutional scheme.” Id., at 590.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Most recently, in Schor, the Court described in greater&para;<br>detail how this Court should analyze this kind of Article&para;<br>III question. The question at issue in Schor involved a&para;<br>delegation of authority to an agency to adjudicate a coun­&para;<br>terclaim. A customer brought before the Commodity&para;<br>Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a claim for repara­&para;<br>tions against his commodity futures broker. The customer&para;<br>noted that his brokerage account showed that he owed the&para;<br>broker money, but he said that the broker’s unlawful&para;<br>actions had produced that debit balance, and he sought&para;<br>damages. The broker brought a counterclaim seeking the&para;<br>money that the account showed the customer owed. This&para;<br>Court had to decide whether agency adjudication of such a&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>counterclaim is consistent with Article III.&para;<br>In doing so, the Court expressly “declined to adopt&para;<br>formalistic and unbending rules.” Schor, 478 U. S., at 851.&para;<br>Rather, it “weighed a number of factors, none of which has&para;<br>been deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical&para;<br>effect that the congressional action will have on the consti­&para;<br>tutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.” Ibid.&para;<br>Those relevant factors include (1) “the origins and im­&para;<br>portance of the right to be adjudicated”; (2) “the extent to&para;<br>which the non-Article III forum exercises the range of ju­&para;<br>risdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III&para;<br>courts”; (3) the extent to which the delegation nonetheless&para;<br>reserves judicial power for exercise by Article III courts;&para;<br>(4) the presence or “absence of consent to an initial adjudi­&para;<br>cation before a non-Article III tribunal”; and (5) “the con­&para;<br>cerns that drove Congress to depart from” adjudication in&para;<br>an Article III court. Id., at 849, 851.&para;<br>The Court added that where “private rights,” rather&para;<br>than “public rights” are involved, the “danger of encroach­&para;<br>ing on the judicial powers” is greater. Id., at 853–854&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while nonArticle III adjudication of “private rights” is not necessar­&para;<br>ily unconstitutional, the Court’s constitutional “examina­&para;<br>tion” of such a scheme must be more “searching.” Ibid.&para;<br>Applying this analysis, the Court upheld the agency’s&para;<br>authority to adjudicate the counterclaim. The Court con­&para;<br>ceded that the adjudication might be of a kind tradi­&para;<br>tionally decided by a court and that the rights at issue&para;<br>were “private,” not “public.” Id., at 853. But, the Court&para;<br>said, the CFTC deals only with a “ ‘particularized area of&para;<br>law’ ”; the decision to invoke the CFTC forum is “left en­&para;<br>tirely to the parties”; Article III courts can review the&para;<br>agency’s findings of fact under “the same ‘weight of the&para;<br>evidence’ standard sustained in Crowell” and review its&para;<br>“legal determinations . . . de novo”; and the agency’s “coun­&para;<br>terclaim jurisdiction” was necessary to make “workable” a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The Court concluded that for these and other&para;<br>reasons “the magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial&para;<br>Branch can only be termed de minimis.” Id., at 856.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>This case law, as applied in Thomas and Schor, requires&para;<br>us to determine pragmatically whether a congressional&para;<br>delegation of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III&para;<br>judge violates the separation-of-powers principles inherent&para;<br>in Article III. That is to say, we must determine through&para;<br>an examination of certain relevant factors whether that&para;<br>delegation constitutes a significant encroachment by the&para;<br>Legislative or Executive Branches of Government upon&para;<br>the realm of authority that Article III reserves for exercise&para;<br>by the Judicial Branch of Government. Those factors&para;<br>include (1) the nature of the claim to be adjudicated; (2)&para;<br>the nature of the non-Article III tribunal; (3) the extent to&para;<br>which Article III courts exercise control over the proceed­&para;<br>ing; (4) the presence or absence of the parties’ consent; and&para;<br>(5) the nature and importance of the legislative purpose&para;<br>served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal&para;<br>with judges who lack Article III’s tenure and compensa­&para;<br>tion protections. The presence of “private rights” does not&para;<br>automatically determine the outcome of the question but&para;<br>requires a more “searching” examination of the relevant&para;<br>factors. Schor, supra, at 854.&para;<br>Insofar as the majority would apply more formal stan­&para;<br>dards, it simply disregards recent, controlling precedent.&para;<br>Thomas, supra, at 587 (“[P]ractical attention to substance&para;<br>rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories&para;<br>should inform application of Article III”); Schor, supra, at&para;<br>851 (“[T]he Court has declined to adopt formalistic and&para;<br>unbending rules” for deciding Article III cases).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>Applying Schor’s approach here, I conclude that the&para;<br>delegation of adjudicatory authority before us is consti­&para;<br>tutional.

S., at&para;<br>853, a delegation of authority to a non-Article III judge to&para;<br>adjudicate a claim of that kind poses a heightened risk of&para;<br>encroachment on the Federal Judiciary, id., at 854.&para;<br>At the same time the significance of this factor is miti­&para;<br>gated here by the fact that bankruptcy courts often decide&para;<br>claims that similarly resemble various common-law ac­&para;<br>tions. Suppose, for example, that ownership of 40 acres of&para;<br>land in the bankruptcy debtor’s possession is disputed by a&para;<br>creditor. If that creditor brings a claim in the bankruptcy&para;<br>court, resolution of that dispute requires the bankruptcy&para;<br>court to apply the same state property law that would&para;<br>govern in a state court proceeding. This kind of dispute&para;<br>arises with regularity in bankruptcy proceedings.&para;<br>Of course, in this instance the state-law question is&para;<br>embedded in a debtor’s counterclaim, not a creditor’s&para;<br>claim. But the counterclaim is “compulsory.” It “arises&para;<br>out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject&para;<br>matter of the opposing party’s claim.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.&para;<br>13(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7013. Thus, resolution of&para;<br>the counterclaim will often turn on facts identical to, or at&para;<br>least related to, those at issue in a creditor’s claim that is&para;<br>undisputedly proper for the bankruptcy court to decide.&para;<br>Second, the nature of the non-Article III tribunal argues&para;<br>in favor of constitutionality. That is because the tribunal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>is made up of judges who enjoy considerable protection&para;<br>from improper political influence. Unlike the 1978 Act&para;<br>which provided for the appointment of bankruptcy judges&para;<br>by the President with the advice and consent of the&para;<br>Senate, 28 U. S. C. §152 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), current&para;<br>law provides that the federal courts of appeals appoint fed­&para;<br>eral bankruptcy judges, §152(a)(1) (2006 ed.). Bankruptcy&para;<br>judges are removable by the circuit judicial counsel (made&para;<br>up of federal court of appeals and district court judges)&para;<br>and only for cause. §152(e). Their salaries are pegged to&para;<br>those of federal district court judges, §153(a), and the cost&para;<br>of their courthouses and other work-related expenses are&para;<br>paid by the Judiciary, §156. Thus, although Congress&para;<br>technically exercised its Article I power when it created&para;<br>bankruptcy courts, functionally, bankruptcy judges can be&para;<br>compared to magistrate judges, law clerks, and the Judi­&para;<br>ciary’s administrative officials, whose lack of Article III&para;<br>tenure and compensation protections do not endanger the&para;<br>independence of the Judicial Branch.&para;<br>Third, the control exercised by Article III judges over&para;<br>bankruptcy proceedings argues in favor of constitutional­&para;<br>ity. Article III judges control and supervise the bank­&para;<br>ruptcy court’s determinations—at least to the same degree&para;<br>that Article III judges supervised the agency’s determina­&para;<br>tions in Crowell, if not more so. Any party may appeal&para;<br>those determinations to the federal district court, where&para;<br>the federal judge will review all determinations of fact for&para;<br>clear error and will review all determinations of law de&para;<br>novo. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013; 10 Collier on Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy ¶8013.04 (16th ed. 2011). But for the here­&para;<br>irrelevant matter of what Crowell considered to be special&para;<br>“constitutional” facts, the standard of review for factual&para;<br>findings here (“clearly erroneous”) is more stringent than&para;<br>the standard at issue in Crowell (whether the agency’s&para;<br>factfinding was “supported by evidence in the record”).&para;<br>285 U. S., at 48; see Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>152, 153 (1999) (“unsupported by substantial evidence”&para;<br>more deferential than “clearly erroneous” (internal quota­&para;<br>tion marks omitted)). And, as Crowell noted, “there is no&para;<br>requirement that, in order to maintain the essential at­&para;<br>tributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in&para;<br>constitutional courts shall be made by judges.” 285 U. S.,&para;<br>at 51.&para;<br>Moreover, in one important respect Article III judges&para;<br>maintain greater control over the bankruptcy court pro­&para;<br>ceedings at issue here than they did over the relevant&para;<br>proceedings in any of the previous cases in which this&para;<br>Court has upheld a delegation of adjudicatory power. The&para;<br>District Court here may “withdraw, in whole or in part,&para;<br>any case or proceeding referred [to the Bankruptcy Court]&para;<br>. . . on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for&para;<br>cause shown.” 28 U. S. C. §157(d); cf. Northern Pipeline,&para;<br>458 U. S., at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion) (contrasting&para;<br>pre-1978 law where “power to withdraw the case from&para;<br>the [bankruptcy] referee” gave district courts “control”&para;<br>over case with the unconstitutional 1978 statute, which&para;<br>provided no such district court authority).&para;<br>Fourth, the fact that the parties have consented to Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Court jurisdiction argues in favor of constitutional­&para;<br>ity, and strongly so. Pierce Marshall, the counterclaim&para;<br>defendant, is not a stranger to the litigation, forced to&para;<br>appear in Bankruptcy Court against his will. Cf. id., at 91&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) (suit was litigated&para;<br>in Bankruptcy Court “over [the defendant’s] objection”).&para;<br>Rather, he appeared voluntarily in Bankruptcy Court as&para;<br>one of Vickie Marshall’s creditors, seeking a favorable&para;<br>resolution of his claim against Vickie Marshall to the&para;<br>detriment of her other creditors. He need not have filed a&para;<br>claim, perhaps not even at the cost of bringing it in the&para;<br>future, for he says his claim is “nondischargeable,” in&para;<br>which case he could have litigated it in a state or federal&para;<br>court after distribution. See 11 U. S. C. §523(a)(6). Thus,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Pierce Marshall likely had “an alternative forum to the&para;<br>bankruptcy court in which to pursue [his] clai[m].” Gran&para;<br>financiera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 59, n. 14&para;<br>(1989).&para;<br>The Court has held, in a highly analogous context, that&para;<br>this type of consent argues strongly in favor of using ordi­&para;<br>nary bankruptcy court proceedings. In Granfinanciera,&para;<br>the Court held that when a bankruptcy trustee seeks to&para;<br>void a transfer of assets from the debtor to an individual&para;<br>on the ground that the transfer to that individual consti­&para;<br>tutes an unlawful “preference,” the question of whether&para;<br>the individual has a right to a jury trial “depends upon&para;<br>whether the creditor has submitted a claim against the&para;<br>estate.” Id., at 58. The following year, in Langenkamp v.&para;<br>Culp, 498 U. S. 42 (1990) (per curiam), the Court empha­&para;<br>sized that when the individual files a claim against the&para;<br>estate, that individual has&para;<br>“trigger[ed] the process of ‘allowance and disallowance&para;<br>of claims,’ thereby subjecting himself to the bank­&para;<br>ruptcy court’s equitable power. If the creditor is met,&para;<br>in turn, with a preference action from the trustee,&para;<br>that action becomes part of the claims-allowance proc­&para;<br>ess which is triable only in equity. In other words, the&para;<br>creditor’s claim and the ensuing preference action by&para;<br>the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the&para;<br>debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy&para;<br>court’s equity jurisdiction.” Id., at 44 (quoting Granfi&para;<br>nanciera, 492 U. S., at 58; citations omitted).&para;<br>As we have recognized, the jury trial question and the&para;<br>Article III question are highly analogous. See id., at 52–&para;<br>53. And to that extent, Granfinanciera’s and Langen&para;<br>kamp’s basic reasoning and conclusion apply here: Even&para;<br>when private rights are at issue, non-Article III adjudica­&para;<br>tion may be appropriate when both parties consent. Cf.&para;<br>Northern Pipeline, supra, at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion)&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(noting the importance of consent to bankruptcy juris­&para;<br>diction). See also Schor, 478 U. S., at 849 (“[A]bsence of&para;<br>consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III&para;<br>tribunal was relied on [in Northern Pipeline] as a signifi­&para;<br>cant factor in determining that Article III forbade such&para;<br>adjudication”). The majority argues that Pierce Marshall&para;<br>“did not truly consent” to bankruptcy jurisdiction, ante, at&para;<br>27–28, but filing a proof of claim was sufficient in Lan&para;<br>genkamp and Granfinanciera, and there is no relevant&para;<br>distinction between the claims filed in those cases and the&para;<br>claim filed here.&para;<br>Fifth, the nature and importance of the legislative pur&para;<br>pose served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to&para;<br>bankruptcy tribunals argues strongly in favor of constitu­&para;<br>tionality. Congress’ delegation of adjudicatory powers&para;<br>over counterclaims asserted against bankruptcy claimants&para;<br>constitutes an important means of securing a constitu­&para;<br>tionally authorized end. Article I, §8, of the Constitution&para;<br>explicitly grants Congress the “Power To . . . establish . . .&para;<br>uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout&para;<br>the United States.” James Madison wrote in the Federal­&para;<br>ist Papers that the&para;<br>“power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is&para;<br>so intimately connected with the regulation of com­&para;<br>merce, and will prevent so many frauds where the&para;<br>parties or their property may lie or be removed into&para;<br>different States, that the expediency of it seems not&para;<br>likely to be drawn into question.” The Federalist No.&para;<br>42, p. 271 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).&para;<br>Congress established the first Bankruptcy Act in 1800.&para;<br>2 Stat. 19. From the beginning, the “core” of federal bank­&para;<br>ruptcy proceedings has been “the restructuring of debtor­&para;<br>creditor relations.” Northern Pipeline, supra, at 71 (plu­&para;<br>rality opinion). And, to be effective, a single tribunal must&para;<br>have broad authority to restructure those relations, “hav­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing jurisdiction of the parties to controversies brought&para;<br>before them,” “decid[ing] all matters in dispute,” and&para;<br>“decree[ing] complete relief.” Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S.&para;<br>323, 335 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The restructuring process requires a creditor to file a&para;<br>proof of claim in the bankruptcy court. 11 U. S. C. §501;&para;<br>Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3002(a). In doing so, the creditor&para;<br>“triggers the process of ‘allowance and disallowance of&para;<br>claims,’ thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy&para;<br>court’s equitable power.” Langenkamp, supra, at 44 (quot­&para;<br>ing Granfinanciera, supra, at 58). By filing a proof of&para;<br>claim, the creditor agrees to the bankruptcy court’s resolu­&para;<br>tion of that claim, and if the creditor wins, the creditor will&para;<br>receive a share of the distribution of the bankruptcy es­&para;<br>tate. When the bankruptcy estate has a related claim&para;<br>against that creditor, that counterclaim may offset the&para;<br>creditor’s claim, or even yield additional damages that&para;<br>augment the estate and may be distributed to the other&para;<br>creditors.&para;<br>The consequent importance to the total bankruptcy&para;<br>scheme of permitting the trustee in bankruptcy to assert&para;<br>counterclaims against claimants, and resolving those&para;<br>counterclaims in a bankruptcy court, is reflected in the&para;<br>fact that Congress included “counterclaims by the estate&para;<br>against persons filing claims against the estate” on its list&para;<br>of “[c]ore proceedings.” 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(C). And it&para;<br>explains the difference, reflected in this Court’s opinions,&para;<br>between a claimant’s and a nonclaimant’s constitutional&para;<br>right to a jury trial. Compare Granfinanciera, supra, at&para;<br>58–59 (“Because petitioners . . . have not filed claims&para;<br>against the estate” they retain “their Seventh Amendment&para;<br>right to a trial by jury”), with Langenkamp, supra, at 45&para;<br>(“Respondents filed claims against the bankruptcy estate”&para;<br>and “[c]onsequently, they were not entitled to a jury&para;<br>trial”).&para;<br>Consequently a bankruptcy court’s determination of&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>STERN v. MARSHALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>such matters has more than “some bearing on a bank­&para;<br>ruptcy case.” Ante, at 34 (emphasis deleted). It plays a&para;<br>critical role in Congress’ constitutionally based effort to&para;<br>create an efficient, effective federal bankruptcy system.&para;<br>At the least, that is what Congress concluded. We owe&para;<br>deference to that determination, which shows the absence&para;<br>of any legislative or executive motive, intent, purpose, or&para;<br>desire to encroach upon areas that Article III reserves&para;<br>to judges to whom it grants tenure and compensation&para;<br>protections.&para;<br>Considering these factors together, I conclude that, as in&para;<br>Schor, “the magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial&para;<br>Branch can only be termed de minimis.” 478 U. S., at 856.&para;<br>I would similarly find the statute before us constitutional.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The majority predicts that as a “practical matter” to­&para;<br>day’s decision “does not change all that much.” Ante, at&para;<br>36–37. But I doubt that is so. Consider a typical case:&para;<br>A tenant files for bankruptcy. The landlord files a claim&para;<br>for unpaid rent. The tenant asserts a counterclaim for&para;<br>damages suffered by the landlord’s (1) failing to fulfill his&para;<br>obligations as lessor, and (2) improperly recovering pos­&para;<br>session of the premises by misrepresenting the facts in&para;<br>housing court. (These are close to the facts presented in&para;<br>In re Beugen, 81 B. R. 994 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Cal. 1988).)&para;<br>This state-law counterclaim does not “ste[m] from the&para;<br>bankruptcy itself,” ante, at 34, it would not “necessarily be&para;<br>resolved in the claims allowance process,” ibid., and it&para;<br>would require the debtor to prove damages suffered by the&para;<br>lessor’s failures, the extent to which the landlord’s repre­&para;<br>sentations to the housing court were untrue, and damages&para;<br>suffered by improper recovery of possession of the prem­&para;<br>ises, cf. ante, at 33-33. Thus, under the majority’s holding,&para;<br>the federal district judge, not the bankruptcy judge, would&para;<br>have to hear and resolve the counterclaim.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Why is that a problem? Because these types of disputes&para;<br>arise in bankruptcy court with some frequency. See, e.g.,&para;<br>In re CBI Holding Co., 529 F. 3d 432 (CA2 2008) (state­&para;<br>law claims and counterclaims); In re Winstar Communica&para;<br>tions, Inc., 348 B. R. 234 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2005) (same);&para;<br>In re Ascher, 128 B. R. 639 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1991)&para;<br>(same); In re Sun West Distributors, Inc., 69 B. R. 861&para;<br>(Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Cal. 1987) (same). Because the volume of&para;<br>bankruptcy cases is staggering, involving almost 1.6 mil­&para;<br>lion filings last year, compared to a federal district court&para;<br>docket of around 280,000 civil cases and 78,000 criminal&para;<br>cases. Administrative Office of the United States Courts,&para;<br>J. Duff, Judicial Business of the United States Courts:&para;<br>Annual Report of the Director 14 (2010).

Because under these circumstances, a&para;<br>constitutionally required game of jurisdictional ping-pong&para;<br>between courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost,&para;<br>delay, and needless additional suffering among those faced&para;<br>with bankruptcy.&para;<br>For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
