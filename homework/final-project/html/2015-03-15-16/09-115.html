S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). Employers that vio&para;<br>late that prohibition may be subjected to federal civil and criminal&para;<br>sanctions. IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat em&para;<br>ployment of unauthorized workers; the Act expressly preempts “any&para;<br>State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than&para;<br>through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or re&para;<br>cruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.”&para;<br>§1324a(h)(2).&para;<br>IRCA also requires employers to take steps to verify an employee’s&para;<br>eligibility for employment. In an attempt to improve that verification&para;<br>process in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsi&para;<br>bility Act (IIRIRA), Congress created E-Verify—an internet-based&para;<br>system employers can use to check the work authorization status of&para;<br>employees.&para;<br>Against this statutory background, several States have recently&para;<br>enacted laws attempting to impose sanctions for the employment of&para;<br>unauthorized aliens through, among other things, “licensing and&para;<br>similar laws.” Arizona is one of them. The Legal Arizona Workers&para;<br>Act provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or&para;<br>intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain cir&para;<br>cumstances must be, suspended or revoked. That law also requires&para;<br>that all Arizona employers use E-Verify.&para;<br>The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and various busi&para;<br>ness and civil rights organizations (collectively Chamber) filed this&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>federal preenforcement suit against those charged with administer&para;<br>ing the Arizona law, arguing that the state law’s license suspension&para;<br>and revocation provisions were both expressly and impliedly pre&para;<br>empted by federal immigration law, and that the mandatory use of EVerify was impliedly preempted. The District Court found that the&para;<br>plain language of IRCA’s preemption clause did not invalidate the&para;<br>Arizona law because the law did no more than impose licensing con&para;<br>ditions on businesses operating within the State. Nor was the state&para;<br>law preempted with respect to E-Verify, the court concluded, because&para;<br>although Congress had made the program voluntary at the national&para;<br>level, it had expressed no intent to prevent States from mandating&para;<br>participation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>558 F. 3d 856, affirmed.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect&para;<br>to Parts I and II–A, concluding that Arizona’s licensing law is not ex&para;<br>pressly preempted.&para;<br>Arizona’s licensing law falls well within the confines of the author&para;<br>ity Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not ex&para;<br>pressly preempted. While IRCA prohibits States from imposing “civil&para;<br>or criminal sanctions” on those who employ unauthorized aliens, it&para;<br>preserves state authority to impose sanctions “through licensing and&para;<br>similar laws.” §1324a(h)(2). That is what the Arizona law does—it&para;<br>instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state&para;<br>employers that employ unauthorized aliens. The definition of “li&para;<br>cense” contained in the Arizona statute largely parrots the definition&para;<br>of “license” that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure&para;<br>Act (APA).&para;<br>The state statute also includes within its definition of “license”&para;<br>documents such as articles of incorporation, certificates of partner&para;<br>ship, and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact busi&para;<br>ness in the State, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(9), each of which has&para;<br>clear counterparts in APA and dictionary definitions of the word “li&para;<br>cense.” And even if a law regulating articles of incorporation and the&para;<br>like is not itself a “licensing law,” it is at the very least “similar” to&para;<br>one, and therefore comfortably within the savings clause. The&para;<br>Chamber’s argument that the Arizona law is not a “licensing” law be&para;<br>cause it operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than to&para;<br>grant them is without basis in law, fact, or logic.&para;<br>The Chamber contends that the savings clause should apply only to&para;<br>certain types of licenses or only to license revocation following an&para;<br>IRCA adjudication because Congress, when enacting IRCA, elimi&para;<br>nated unauthorized worker prohibitions and associated adjudication&para;<br>procedures in another federal statute. But no such limits are even&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>remotely discernible in the statutory text.&para;<br>The Chamber’s reliance on IRCA’s legislative history to bolster its&para;<br>textual and structural arguments is unavailing given the Court’s&para;<br>conclusion that Arizona’s law falls within the plain text of the savings&para;<br>clause. Pp. 9–15.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,&para;<br>and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Part II–B:&para;<br>The Arizona licensing law is not impliedly preempted by federal&para;<br>law. At its broadest, the Chamber’s argument is that Congress in&para;<br>tended the federal system to be exclusive. But Arizona’s procedures&para;<br>simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed the&para;<br>States to pursue through licensing laws. Given that Congress spe&para;<br>cifically preserved such authority for the States, it stands to reason&para;<br>that Congress did not intend to prevent the States from using appro&para;<br>priate tools to exercise that authority.&para;<br>And here Arizona’s law closely tracks IRCA’s provisions in all ma&para;<br>terial respects. For example, it adopts the federal definition of who&para;<br>qualifies as an “unauthorized alien,” compare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3)&para;<br>with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(11); provides that state investiga&para;<br>tors must verify the work authorization of an allegedly unauthorized&para;<br>alien with the Federal Government, making no independent deter&para;<br>mination of the matter, §23–212(B); and requires a state court to&para;<br>“consider only the federal government’s determination,” §23–212(H).&para;<br>The Chamber’s more general contention that the Arizona law is&para;<br>preempted because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to&para;<br>strike in IRCA also fails. The cases on which the Chamber relies in&para;<br>making this argument all involve uniquely federal areas of interest,&para;<br>see, e.g., Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341.&para;<br>Regulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not such an&para;<br>area. And those cases all concern state actions that directly inter&para;<br>fered with the operation of a federal program, see, e.g., id., at 351.&para;<br>There is no similar interference here.&para;<br>The Chamber asserts that employers will err on the side of dis&para;<br>crimination rather than risk the “ ‘business death penalty’ ” by “hir&para;<br>ing unauthorized workers.” That is not the choice. License termina&para;<br>tion is not an available sanction for merely hiring unauthorized&para;<br>workers, but is triggered only by far more egregious violations. And&para;<br>because the Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional viola&para;<br>tions, an employer acting in good faith need not fear the law’s sanc&para;<br>tions. Moreover, federal and state antidiscrimination laws protect&para;<br>against employment discrimination and provide employers with a&para;<br>strong incentive not to discriminate. Employers also enjoy safe har&para;<br>bors from liability when using E-Verify as required by the Arizona&para;<br>law. The most rational path for employers is to obey both the law&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>barring the employment of unauthorized aliens and the law prohibit&para;<br>ing discrimination. There is no reason to suppose that Arizona em&para;<br>ployers will choose not to do so. Pp. 15–22.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect&para;<br>to Part III–A, concluding that Arizona’s E-Verify mandate is not im&para;<br>pliedly preempted.&para;<br>Arizona’s requirement that employers use E-Verify is not impliedly&para;<br>preempted. The IIRIRA provision setting up E-Verify contains no&para;<br>language circumscribing state action. It does, however, constrain&para;<br>federal action: absent a prior violation of federal law, “the Secretary&para;<br>of Homeland Security may not require any person or . . . entity” out&para;<br>side the Federal Government “to participate in” E-Verify. IIRIRA,&para;<br>§402(a), (e). The fact that the Federal Government may require the&para;<br>use of E-Verify in only limited circumstances says nothing about&para;<br>what the States may do. The Government recently argued just that&para;<br>in another case and approvingly referenced Arizona’s law as an ex&para;<br>ample of a permissible use of E-Verify when doing so.&para;<br>Moreover, Arizona’s use of E-Verify does not conflict with the fed&para;<br>eral scheme. The state law requires no more than that an employer,&para;<br>after hiring an employee, “verify the employment eligibility of the&para;<br>employee” through E-Verify. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214(A). And&para;<br>the consequences of not using E-Verify are the same under the state&para;<br>and federal law—an employer forfeits an otherwise available rebut&para;<br>table presumption of compliance with the law. Pp. 23–24.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,&para;<br>and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Part III–B:&para;<br>Arizona’s requirement that employers use E-Verify in no way ob&para;<br>structs achieving the aims of the federal program. In fact, the Gov&para;<br>ernment has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of EVerify, and Congress has directed that E-Verify be made available in&para;<br>all 50 States. And the Government has expressly rejected the Cham&para;<br>ber’s claim that the Arizona law, and those like it, will overload the&para;<br>federal system. Pp. 24–25.&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). IRCA defines an&para;<br>“unauthorized alien” as an alien who is not “lawfully&para;<br>admitted for permanent residence” or not otherwise au&para;<br>thorized by the Attorney General to be employed in the&para;<br>United States. §1324a(h)(3).&para;<br>To facilitate compliance with this prohibition, IRCA&para;<br>requires that employers review documents establishing&para;<br>an employee’s eligibility for employment. §1324a(b). An&para;<br>employer can confirm an employee’s authorization to work&para;<br>by reviewing the employee’s United States passport, resi&para;<br>dent alien card, alien registration card, or other document&para;<br>approved by the Attorney General; or by reviewing a&para;<br>combination of other documents such as a driver’s license&para;<br>and social security card. §1324a(b)(1)(B)–(D).

The form I–9&para;<br>itself “and any information contained in or appended to [it]&para;<br>. . . may not be used for purposes other than for enforce&para;<br>ment of” IRCA and other specified provisions of federal&para;<br>law. §1324a(b)(5).&para;<br>Employers that violate IRCA’s strictures may be sub&para;<br>jected to both civil and criminal sanctions. Immigration&para;<br>and Customs Enforcement, an entity within the Depart&para;<br>ment of Homeland Security, is authorized to bring charges&para;<br>against a noncompliant employer under §1324a(e). De&para;<br>pending on the circumstances of the violation, a civil fine&para;<br>ranging from $250 to $16,000 per unauthorized worker&para;<br>may be imposed. See §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10136&para;<br>(2008). Employers that engage in a pattern or practice&para;<br>of violating IRCA’s requirements can be criminally prose&para;<br>cuted, fined, and imprisoned for up to six months.&para;<br>§1324a(f)(1). The Act also imposes fines for engaging in&para;<br>“unfair immigration-related employment practice[s]” such&para;<br>as discriminating on the basis of citizenship or national&para;<br>origin. §1324b(a)(1); see §1324b(g)(2)(B).

S. 658, 664 (1993).&para;<br>IRCA expressly preempts States from imposing “civil or&para;<br>criminal sanctions” on those who employ unauthorized&para;<br>aliens, “other than through licensing and similar laws.” 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). The Arizona law, on its face, pur&para;<br>ports to impose sanctions through licensing laws. The&para;<br>state law authorizes state courts to suspend or revoke an&para;<br>employer’s business licenses if that employer knowingly or&para;<br>intentionally employs an unauthorized alien. Ariz. Rev.&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §23–212(A) and (F); §23–212.01(A) and (F).&para;<br>The Arizona law defines “license” as “any agency permit,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v.

That definition largely parrots&para;<br>the definition of “license” that Congress codified in the&para;<br>Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)&para;<br>(“ ‘license’ includes the whole or a part of an agency per&para;<br>mit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, member&para;<br>ship, statutory exemption or other form of permission”).&para;<br>Apart from that general definition, the Arizona law&para;<br>specifically includes within its definition of “license” docu&para;<br>ments such as articles of incorporation, certificates of&para;<br>partnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies&para;<br>to transact business in the State. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§23–211(9). These examples have clear counterparts in&para;<br>the APA definition just quoted. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)&para;<br>(defining “license” as including a “registration” or “charter”).&para;<br>A license is “a right or permission granted in accordance&para;<br>with law . . . to engage in some business or occupation, to&para;<br>do some act, or to engage in some transaction which but&para;<br>for such license would be unlawful.” Webster’s Third New&para;<br>International Dictionary 1304 (2002). Articles of incorpo&para;<br>ration and certificates of partnership allow the formation&para;<br>of legal entities and permit them as such to engage in&para;<br>business and transactions “which but for such” authoriza&para;<br>tion “would be unlawful.” Ibid.; see Ariz. Rev. Stat.

As for state-issued authorizations for&para;<br>foreign businesses to operate within a State, we have re&para;<br>peatedly referred to those as “licenses.” See, e.g., Heli&para;<br>copteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.&para;<br>408, 417 (1984); G. D. Searle &amp; Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404,&para;<br>413, n. 8 (1982); Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Curtis Brown&para;<br>Co., 260 U.

S. C.&para;<br>§1324a(h)(2).5&para;<br>The Chamber and the United States as amicus argue&para;<br>that the Arizona law is not a “licensing” law because it&para;<br>operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than&para;<br>to grant them. Again, this construction of the term runs&para;<br>contrary to the definition that Congress itself has codified.&para;<br>See 5 U. S. C. §551(9) (“ ‘licensing’ includes agency process&para;<br>respecting the grant, renewal, denial, revocation, sus&para;<br>pension, annulment, withdrawal, limitation, amendment,&para;<br>modification, or conditioning of a license” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). It is also contrary to common sense. There is no&para;<br>basis in law, fact, or logic for deeming a law that grants&para;<br>licenses a licensing law, but a law that suspends or re&para;<br>vokes those very licenses something else altogether.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 JUSTICE BREYER recognizes that Arizona’s definition of the word&para;<br>“license” comports with dictionaries’ treatment of the term, but argues&para;<br>that “license” must be read in a more restricted way so as not to include&para;<br>things such as “marriage licenses” and “dog licens[es].” Post, at 2, 12&para;<br>(dissenting opinion). Luckily, we need not address such fanciful hy&para;<br>potheticals; Arizona limits its definition of “license” to those state per&para;<br>missions issued “for the purposes of operating a business” in the&para;<br>State. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(9)(a) (West Supp. 2010).&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER’s primary concern appears to be that state permis&para;<br>sions such as articles of incorporation and partnership certificates are&para;<br>treated as “licensing and similar laws.” Because myriad other licenses&para;<br>are required to operate a business, that concern is largely academic.&para;<br>See §42–5005(A) (West 2006) (Corporations that receive “gross proceeds&para;<br>of sales or gross income upon which a privilege tax is imposed . . . shall&para;<br>make application to the department for a privilege license.” Such a&para;<br>corporation “shall not engage or continue in business until the [corpora&para;<br>tion] has obtained a privilege license.”). Suspending or revoking an&para;<br>employer’s articles of incorporation will often be entirely redundant.&para;<br>See §§42–5010, 5061–5076 (West 2006 and West Supp. 2010) (describ&para;<br>ing when transaction privilege tax licenses are required).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>The Chamber also submits that the manner in which&para;<br>Congress amended a related statute when enacting IRCA&para;<br>supports a narrow interpretation of the savings clause.&para;<br>The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection&para;<br>Act (AWPA), 29 U. S. C. §1801 et seq., requires employers&para;<br>to secure a registration certificate from the Department&para;<br>of Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting&para;<br>activity.” §1811(a). Prior to IRCA, AWPA had contained&para;<br>its own prohibition on hiring unauthorized workers, with&para;<br>accompanying adjudication procedures. See §1813(a);&para;<br>§1816(a) (1982 ed.) (repealed by IRCA, 100 Stat. 3372);&para;<br>§1851(a)–(b) (1982 ed.) (amended by IRCA, 100 Stat.&para;<br>3372). When Congress enacted IRCA, it repealed AWPA’s&para;<br>separate unauthorized worker prohibition and eliminated&para;<br>the associated adjudication process. Under the current&para;<br>state of the law, an AWPA certification may be denied&para;<br>based on a prior IRCA violation. §1813(a)(6) (2006 ed.).&para;<br>And once obtained, that certification can be revoked be&para;<br>cause of the employment of an unauthorized alien only&para;<br>following a finding of an IRCA violation. Ibid.&para;<br>The Chamber asserts that IRCA’s amendment of AWPA&para;<br>shows that Congress meant to allow state licensing sanc&para;<br>tions only after a federal IRCA adjudication, just as ad&para;<br>verse action under AWPA can now be taken only through&para;<br>IRCA’s procedures. But the text of IRCA’s savings clause&para;<br>says nothing about state licensing sanctions being contin&para;<br>gent on prior federal adjudication, or indeed about state&para;<br>licensing processes at all. The simple fact that federal law&para;<br>creates procedures for federal investigations and adjudica&para;<br>tions culminating in federal civil or criminal sanctions&para;<br>does not indicate that Congress intended to prevent States&para;<br>from establishing their own procedures for imposing&para;<br>their own sanctions through licensing. Were AWPA not&para;<br>amended to conform with IRCA, two different federal&para;<br>agencies would be responsible for administering two dif&para;<br>ferent unauthorized alien employment laws. The conform&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing amendments eliminated that potential redundancy&para;<br>and centralized federal adjudicatory authority. That&para;<br>hardly supports a conclusion that any state licensing&para;<br>programs must also be contingent on the central federal&para;<br>system.&para;<br>In much the same vein, the Chamber argues that Con&para;<br>gress’s repeal of “AWPA’s separate prohibition concerning&para;<br>unauthorized workers belies any suggestion that IRCA&para;<br>meant to authorize each of the 50 States . . . to impose&para;<br>its own separate prohibition,” and that Congress instead&para;<br>wanted uniformity in immigration law enforcement. Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 36. JUSTICE BREYER also objects to the&para;<br>departure from “one centralized enforcement scheme”&para;<br>under federal law. Post, at 7 (dissenting opinion). But&para;<br>Congress expressly preserved the ability of the States to&para;<br>impose their own sanctions through licensing; that—like&para;<br>our federal system in general—necessarily entails the&para;<br>prospect of some departure from homogeneity. And as for&para;<br>“separate prohibition[s],” it is worth recalling that the&para;<br>Arizona licensing law is based exclusively on the federal&para;<br>prohibition—a court reviewing a complaint under the&para;<br>Arizona law may “consider only the federal government’s&para;<br>determination” with respect to “whether an employee is an&para;<br>unauthorized alien.” §23–212(H).&para;<br>Even more boldly, the Chamber contends that IRCA’s&para;<br>savings clause was intended to allow States to impose&para;<br>licensing sanctions solely on AWPA-related farm contract&para;<br>ing licensees. AWPA specifically recognized that federal&para;<br>regulation of farm contracting licensing was only “in&para;<br>tended to supplement State law,” 29 U. S. C. §1871, and&para;<br>the Chamber argues that the purpose of IRCA’s savings&para;<br>clause was limited to preserving existing state farm con&para;<br>tractor licensing programs. But here again no such limit&para;<br>is remotely discernible in the statutory text. Absent any&para;<br>textual basis, we are not inclined to limit so markedly&para;<br>the otherwise broad phrasing of the savings clause.

We&para;<br>have already concluded that Arizona’s law falls within the&para;<br>plain text of IRCA’s savings clause.

Whatever the usefulness of&para;<br>relying on legislative history materials in general, the&para;<br>arguments against doing so are particularly compelling&para;<br>here. Beyond verbatim recitation of the statutory text, all&para;<br>of the legislative history documents related to IRCA save&para;<br>one fail to discuss the savings clause at all. The Senate&para;<br>Judiciary Committee Report on the Senate version of&para;<br>the law does not comment on it. See S. Rep. No. 99–132&para;<br>(1985). Only one of the four House Reports on the law&para;<br>touches on the licensing exception, see H. R. Rep. No. 99–&para;<br>682, pt. 1, p. 58 (1986), and we have previously dismissed&para;<br>that very report as “a rather slender reed” from “one&para;<br>House of a politically divided Congress.” Hoffman, supra,&para;<br>at 149–150, n. 4. And the Conference Committee Report&para;<br>does not discuss the scope of IRCA’s preemption provision&para;<br>in any way. See H. Conf. Rep.

We hold that Arizona’s licensing&para;<br>law falls well within the confines of the authority Con&para;<br>gress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not&para;<br>expressly preempted.&para;<br>B&para;<br>As an alternative to its express preemption argument,&para;<br>the Chamber contends that Arizona’s law is impliedly&para;<br>preempted because it conflicts with federal law. At its&para;<br>broadest level, the Chamber’s argument is that Congress&para;<br>“intended the federal system to be exclusive,” and that any&para;<br>state system therefore necessarily conflicts with federal&para;<br>law. Brief for Petitioners 39. But Arizona’s procedures&para;<br>simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly&para;<br>allowed Arizona to pursue through licensing laws. Given&para;<br>that Congress specifically preserved such authority for the&para;<br>States, it stands to reason that Congress did not intend to&para;<br>prevent the States from using appropriate tools to exercise&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Congress had intended such limited exceptions to its prohibition on&para;<br>state sanctions, it did not simply say so, instead of excepting “licensing&para;<br>and similar laws” generally?&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR takes a different tack. Invoking arguments that&para;<br>resemble those found in our implied preemption cases, she concludes&para;<br>that the Arizona law “falls outside” the savings clause and is expressly&para;<br>preempted because it allows “state courts to determine whether a&para;<br>person has employed an unauthorized alien.” Post, at 2 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). While JUSTICE BREYER would add language to the statute&para;<br>narrowly limiting the phrase “licensing and similar laws” to specific&para;<br>types of licenses, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR creates an entirely new statutory&para;<br>requirement: She would allow States to impose sanctions through&para;<br>“licensing and similar laws” only after a federal adjudication. Such a&para;<br>requirement is found nowhere in the text, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR does&para;<br>not even attempt to link it to a specific textual provision.&para;<br>It should not be surprising that the two dissents have sharply differ&para;<br>ent views on how to read the statute.

J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that authority.&para;<br>And here Arizona went the extra mile in ensuring that&para;<br>its law closely tracks IRCA’s provisions in all material&para;<br>respects. The Arizona law begins by adopting the federal&para;<br>definition of who qualifies as an “unauthorized alien.”&para;<br>Compare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3) (an “unauthorized alien”&para;<br>is an alien not “lawfully admitted for permanent resi&para;<br>dence” or not otherwise authorized by federal law to be&para;<br>employed) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(11) (adopt&para;<br>ing the federal definition of “unauthorized alien”); see De&para;<br>Canas, 424 U. S., at 363 (finding no preemption of state&para;<br>law that operates “only with respect to individuals whom&para;<br>the Federal Government has already declared cannot work&para;<br>in this country”).&para;<br>Not only that, the Arizona law expressly provides that&para;<br>state investigators must verify the work authorization of&para;<br>an allegedly unauthorized alien with the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment, and “shall not attempt to independently make a&para;<br>final determination on whether an alien is authorized to&para;<br>work in the United States.” §23–212(B). What is more, a&para;<br>state court “shall consider only the federal government’s&para;<br>determination” when deciding “whether an employee is an&para;<br>unauthorized alien.” §23–212(H) (emphasis added). As a&para;<br>result, there can by definition be no conflict between state&para;<br>and federal law as to worker authorization, either at the&para;<br>investigatory or adjudicatory stage.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 After&para;<br>&para;<br>specifying that a state court may consider “only” the federal&para;<br>determination, the Arizona law goes on to provide that the federal&para;<br>determination is “a rebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful&para;<br>status,” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H) (West Supp. 2010). Arizona&para;<br>explains that this provision does not permit the State to establish&para;<br>unlawful status apart from the federal determination—the provision&para;<br>could hardly do that, given the foregoing. It instead operates to “en&para;<br>sur[e] that the employer has an opportunity to rebut the evidence&para;<br>presented to establish a worker’s unlawful status.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dents 49 (emphasis added). Only in that sense is the federal determi&para;<br>nation a “rebuttable presumption.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47. Giving&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Post, at 10 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). But if a §1373(c) inquiry reveals that someone is&para;<br>a United States citizen, that certainly answers the ques&para;<br>tion whether that individual is authorized to work. The&para;<br>same would be true if the response to a §1373(c) query&para;<br>disclosed that the individual was a lawful permanent&para;<br>resident alien or, on the other hand, had been ordered&para;<br>removed.

But they are typical attributes of a licensing re&para;<br>gime. Numerous Arizona laws provide for the suspension&para;<br>or revocation of licenses for failing to comply with specified&para;<br>state laws. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat.

License termina&para;<br>tion is not an available sanction simply for “hiring unau&para;<br>thorized workers.” Only far more egregious violations of&para;<br>the law trigger that consequence. The Arizona law covers&para;<br>only knowing or intentional violations. The law’s perma&para;<br>nent licensing sanctions do not come into play until a&para;<br>second knowing or intentional violation at the same busi&para;<br>ness location, and only if the second violation occurs while&para;<br>the employer is still on probation for the first. These&para;<br>limits ensure that licensing sanctions are imposed only&para;<br>when an employer’s conduct fully justifies them. An&para;<br>employer acting in good faith need have no fear of the&para;<br>sanctions.&para;<br>As the Chamber points out, IRCA has its own anti&para;<br>discrimination provisions, see 8 U. S.

Other federal&para;<br>laws, and Arizona anti-discrimination laws, provide fur&para;<br>ther protection against employment discrimination—and&para;<br>strong incentive for employers not to discriminate.

The provision of&para;<br>IIRIRA setting up the program that includes E-Verify&para;<br>contains no language circumscribing state action. It does,&para;<br>however, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation&para;<br>of federal law, “the Secretary of Homeland Security may&para;<br>not require any person or other entity [outside of the&para;<br>Federal Government] to participate in a pilot program”&para;<br>such as E-Verify. IIRIRA §402(a), 110 Stat. 3009–656.&para;<br>That provision limits what the Secretary of Homeland&para;<br>Security may do—nothing more.&para;<br>The Federal Government recently argued just that, and&para;<br>approvingly referenced Arizona’s E-Verify law when doing&para;<br>so.

Order&para;<br>No. 13465, 73 Fed. Reg. 33286 (2008). When that Order&para;<br>and its implementing regulation were challenged, the&para;<br>Government pointed to Arizona’s E-Verify mandate as an&para;<br>example of a permissible use of that system: “[T]he State&para;<br>of Arizona has required all public and private employers&para;<br>in that State to use E-Verify . . . .

Thus&para;<br>the state law falls within the federal Act’s general pre&para;<br>emption rule and is pre-empted—unless it also falls within&para;<br>that rule’s exception for “licensing and similar laws.”&para;<br>Unlike the Court, I do not believe the state law falls&para;<br>within this exception, and I consequently would hold it&para;<br>pre-empted.&para;<br>Arizona calls its state statute a “licensing law,” and the&para;<br>statute uses the word “licensing.” But the statute strays&para;<br>beyond the bounds of the federal licensing exception, for&para;<br>it defines “license” to include articles of incorporation and&para;<br>partnership certificates, indeed virtually every state-law&para;<br>authorization for any firm, corporation, or partnership to&para;<br>do business in the State. §23–211(9)(a); cf. §23–211(9)(c)&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>(excepting professional licenses, and water and environ&para;<br>mental permits). Congress did not intend its “licensing”&para;<br>language to create so broad an exemption, for doing so&para;<br>would permit States to eviscerate the federal Act’s pre&para;<br>emption provision, indeed to subvert the Act itself, by&para;<br>undermining Congress’ efforts (1) to protect lawful work&para;<br>ers from national-origin-based discrimination and (2) to&para;<br>protect lawful employers against erroneous prosecution or&para;<br>punishment.&para;<br>Dictionary definitions of the word “licensing” are, as the&para;<br>majority points out, broad enough to include virtually any&para;<br>permission that the State chooses to call a “license.” See&para;<br>ante, at 10 (relying on a dictionary and the federal Admin&para;<br>istrative Procedure Act). But neither dictionary defini&para;<br>tions nor the use of the word “license” in an unrelated&para;<br>statute can demonstrate what scope Congress intended&para;<br>the word “licensing” to have as it used that word in this&para;<br>federal statute. Instead, statutory context must ultimately&para;<br>determine the word’s coverage. Context tells a driver that&para;<br>he cannot produce a partnership certificate when a po&para;<br>liceman stops the car and asks for a license. Context tells&para;<br>all of us that “licensing” as used in the Act does not in&para;<br>clude marriage licenses or the licensing of domestic ani&para;<br>mals. And context, which includes statutory purposes,&para;<br>language, and history, tells us that the federal statute’s&para;<br>“licensing” language does not embrace Arizona’s overly&para;<br>broad definition of that term. That is to say, ordinary&para;<br>corporate charters, certificates of partnership, and the like&para;<br>do not fall within the scope of the word “licensing” as used&para;<br>in this federal exception. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546&para;<br>U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (statutory interpretation requires&para;<br>courts to “rea[d] the whole statutory text, conside[r] the&para;<br>purpose and context of the statute, and consul[t] any&para;<br>precedents or authorities that inform the analysis”);&para;<br>United States v.

Ordinarily, an express pre-emption provision&para;<br>in a federal statute indicates a particular congressional&para;<br>interest in preventing States from enacting laws that&para;<br>might interfere with Congress’ statutory objectives. See&para;<br>International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494&para;<br>(1987). The majority’s reading of the provision’s “licens&para;<br>ing” exception, however, does the opposite. It facilitates&para;<br>the creation of “ ‘obstacle[s] to the accomplishment and&para;<br>execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.’ ”&para;<br>Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363,&para;<br>373 (2000) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.

And in doing so,&para;<br>the Act balances three competing goals. First, it seeks to&para;<br>discourage American employers from hiring aliens not&para;<br>authorized to work in the United States. H. R. Rep. No.&para;<br>99–682, pt. 1, p. 56 (1986).&para;<br>Second, Congress wished to avoid “placing an undue&para;<br>burden on employers,” id., at 90, and the Act seeks to&para;<br>prevent the “harassment” of “innocent employers,” S. Rep.&para;<br>No. 99–132, p. 35 (1985).&para;<br>Third, the Act seeks to prevent employers from disfavor&para;<br>ing job applicants who appear foreign. Reiterating long&para;<br>standing antidiscrimination concerns, the House Commit&para;<br>tee Report explained:&para;<br>“Numerous witnesses . . . have expressed their deep&para;<br>concern that the imposition of employer sanctions will&para;<br>cause extensive employment discrimination against&para;<br>Hispanic-Americans and other minority group mem&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>bers. These witnesses are genuinely concerned that&para;<br>employers, faced with the possibility of civil and&para;<br>criminal penalties, will be extremely reluctant to hire&para;<br>persons because of their linguistic or physical charac&para;<br>teristics.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 68.&para;<br>See also 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1) (making it an “unlaw&para;<br>ful employment practice” for an employer to discriminate&para;<br>against an individual “because of such individual’s race,&para;<br>color, religion, sex, or national origin”); U.

The&para;<br>Committee concluded that “every effort must be taken to&para;<br>minimize the potentiality of discrimination.” H. R. Rep.&para;<br>No. 99–682, at 68.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Act reconciles these competing objectives in several&para;<br>ways:&para;<br>First, the Act prohibits employers from hiring an alien&para;<br>knowing that the alien is unauthorized to work in the&para;<br>United States. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A).&para;<br>Second, the Act provides an easy-to-use mechanism that&para;<br>will allow employers to determine legality: the I–9 form.&para;<br>In completing an I–9 form, the employer certifies that he&para;<br>or she has examined one or two documents (e.g., a pass&para;<br>port, or a driver’s license along with a Social Security&para;<br>card) that tend to confirm the worker’s identity and em&para;<br>ployability. §1324a(b)(1). Completion of the form in good&para;<br>faith immunizes the employer from liability, even if the&para;<br>worker turns out to be unauthorized. §§1324a(a)(3),&para;<br>1324a(b)(6).&para;<br>A later amendment to the law also allows an employer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

If the em&para;<br>ployer does so, he or she will receive the benefit of a rebut&para;<br>table presumption of compliance. Illegal Immigration Re&para;<br>form and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA),&para;<br>§402(b), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–657, note following 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1324a, p. 331 (Pilot Programs for Employment&para;<br>Eligibility Confirmation).&para;<br>Third, the Act creates a central enforcement mecha&para;<br>nism. The Act directs the Attorney General to establish a&para;<br>single set of procedures for receiving complaints, investi&para;<br>gating those complaints that “have a substantial proba&para;<br>bility of validity,” and prosecuting violations. 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1324a(e)(1).&para;<br>The relevant immigration officials and&para;<br>administrative law judges have the power to access neces&para;<br>sary evidence and witnesses, §1324a(e)(2), and the em&para;<br>ployer has the right to seek discovery from the Federal&para;<br>Government, 28 CFR §68.18 (2010). The employer also&para;<br>has the right to administrative and judicial review of the&para;<br>administrative law judge’s decision. §§68.54, 68.56.&para;<br>Fourth, the Act makes it “an unfair immigration-related&para;<br>employment practice . . . to discriminate against any&para;<br>individual” in respect to employment “because of such&para;<br>individual’s national origin.” 8 U. S. C. §1324b(a).&para;<br>Fifth, the Act sets forth a carefully calibrated sanction&para;<br>system. The penalties for hiring unauthorized aliens are&para;<br>graduated to prevent the Act from unduly burdening&para;<br>employers who are not serious offenders. As adjusted for&para;<br>inflation, civil penalties for a first violation of the employ&para;<br>ment restrictions range from $375–$3,200 per worker,&para;<br>and rise to $3,200–$16,000 per worker for repeat offend&para;<br>ers. §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133 (2008); see also&para;<br>§1324a(f) (imposing criminal fines of not more than $3,000&para;<br>per worker and imprisonment for up to six months for&para;<br>“pattern or practice” violators of employment restrictions).&para;<br>As importantly, the Act limits or removes any incentive&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>to discriminate on the basis of national origin by setting&para;<br>antidiscrimination fines at equivalent levels: $375–$3,200&para;<br>per worker for first-time offenders, and $3,200–$16,000&para;<br>per worker for repeat offenders. §1324b(g)(2)(B)(iv); 73&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 10134. The Act then ties its unlawful employ&para;<br>ment and antidiscrimination provisions together by pro&para;<br>viding that, should the antihiring provisions terminate,&para;<br>the antidiscrimination provisions will also terminate,&para;<br>§1324b(k), “the justification for them having been re&para;<br>moved,” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000, p. 87 (1986).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Now, compare and contrast Arizona’s statute. As I have&para;<br>said, that statute applies to virtually all business-related&para;<br>licenses, other than professional licenses. Ariz. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §23–211(9). Like the federal Act, the state law for&para;<br>bids the employment of unauthorized aliens. §§23–212(A),&para;<br>23–212.01(A). It also provides employers with somewhat&para;<br>similar defenses. §§23–212(I)–(J), 23–212.01(I)–(J). But&para;<br>thereafter the state and federal laws part company.&para;<br>First, the state statute seriously threatens the federal&para;<br>Act’s antidiscriminatory objectives by radically skewing&para;<br>the relevant penalties. For example, in the absence of the&para;<br>Arizona statute, an Arizona employer who intentionally&para;<br>hires an unauthorized alien for the second time would risk&para;<br>a maximum penalty of $6,500. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(e)(4)&para;<br>(A)(ii); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133. But the Arizona statute sub&para;<br>jects that same employer (in respect to the same two&para;<br>incidents) to mandatory, permanent loss of the right to do&para;<br>business in Arizona–a penalty that Arizona’s Governor&para;<br>has called the “business death penalty.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §23–212.01(F)(2); News Release, Governor Signs&para;<br>Employer Sanctions Bill (2007), App. 399. At the same&para;<br>time, the state law leaves the other side of the punishment&para;<br>balance—the antidiscrimination side—unchanged.&para;<br>This is no idle concern. Despite the federal Act’s efforts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to prevent discriminatory practices, there is evidence that&para;<br>four years after it had become law, discrimination was a&para;<br>serious problem. In 1990, the General Accounting Office&para;<br>identified “widespread discrimination . . . as a result of”&para;<br>the Act. Report to the Congress, Immigration Reform:&para;<br>Employer Sanctions and the Question of Discrimination 3,&para;<br>37, 80. Sixteen percent of employers in Los Angeles ad&para;<br>mitted that they applied the I–9 requirement “only to&para;<br>foreign-looking or foreign-sounding persons,” and 22 per&para;<br>cent of Texas employers reported that they “began a prac&para;<br>tice to (1) hire only persons born in the United States or&para;<br>(2) not hire persons with temporary work eligibility docu&para;<br>ments” because of the Act. Id., at 41–43. If even the&para;<br>federal Act (with its carefully balanced penalties) can&para;<br>result in some employers discriminating, how will employ&para;<br>ers behave when erring on the side of discrimination leads&para;<br>only to relatively small fines, while erring on the side of&para;<br>hiring unauthorized workers leads to the “business death&para;<br>penalty”?&para;<br>Second, Arizona’s law subjects lawful employers to in&para;<br>creased burdens and risks of erroneous prosecution. In&para;<br>addition to the Arizona law’s severely burdensome sanc&para;<br>tions, the law’s procedures create enforcement risks not&para;<br>present in the federal system. The federal Act creates one&para;<br>centralized enforcement scheme, run by officials versed in&para;<br>immigration law and with access to the relevant federal&para;<br>documents. The upshot is an increased likelihood that&para;<br>federal officials (or the employer) will discover whether&para;<br>adverse information flows from an error-prone source and&para;<br>that they will proceed accordingly, thereby diminishing&para;<br>the likelihood that burdensome proceedings and liability&para;<br>reflect documentary mistakes.&para;<br>Contrast the enforcement system that Arizona’s statute&para;<br>creates. Any citizen of the State can complain (anony&para;<br>mously or otherwise) to the state attorney general (or any&para;<br>county attorney), who then “shall investigate,” Ariz. Rev.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §23–212(B) (emphasis added), and, upon a&para;<br>determination that that the “complaint is not false and&para;<br>frivolous . . . shall notify the appropriate county attorney&para;<br>to bring an action,” §23–212(C)(3). This mandatory lan&para;<br>guage, the lower standard (“not frivolous” instead of&para;<br>“substantial”), and the removal of immigration officials&para;<br>from the state screening process (substituting numerous,&para;<br>elected county attorneys) increase the likelihood that&para;<br>suspicious circumstances will lead to prosecutions and&para;<br>liability of employers—even where more careful investiga&para;<br>tion would have revealed that there was no violation.&para;<br>Again, this matter is far from trivial. Studies of one&para;<br>important source of Government information—the EVerify system—describe how the federal administrative&para;<br>process corrected that system’s tentative “unemployable”&para;<br>indications 18% of the time. This substantial error rate is&para;<br>not a function of a small sample size. See ante, at 26, n.&para;<br>12. Rather, data from one fiscal year showed 46,921&para;<br>workers initially rejected but later “confirmed as work&para;<br>authorized”—all while E-Verify was used by only a frac&para;<br>tion of the Nation’s employers. U. S. Citizenship and&para;<br>Immigration Services, Statistics and Reports, http://&para;<br>www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9a&para;<br>c89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextchannel=7c579589cdb76210V&para;<br>gnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD (Feb. 4, 2011) (as visited&para;<br>May 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).&para;<br>That is to say nearly one-in-five times that the E-Verify&para;<br>system suggested that an individual was not lawfully&para;<br>employable (i.e., returned a tentative nonconfirmation of&para;<br>work authorization), the system was wrong; and subse&para;<br>quent review in the federal administrative process deter&para;<br>mined as much. (And those wrongly identified were likely&para;<br>to be persons of foreign, rather than domestic, origin, by a&para;<br>ratio of approximately 20 to 1.) See Westat, Findings of&para;<br>the E-Verify Program Evaluation xxxi, 210, 246 (Dec.&para;<br>2009) (assessing data from April to June 2008). E-Verify’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

The state statute says that&para;<br>in “determining whether an employee is an unauthorized&para;<br>alien, the court shall consider only the federal govern&para;<br>ment’s determination pursuant to 8 [U. S. C.] §1373(c).”&para;<br>Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H). But the federal provi&para;<br>sion to which the state law refers, 8 U. S. C. §1373(c), says&para;<br>only that the Federal Government, upon a State’s request,&para;<br>shall verify a person’s “citizenship or immigration status.”&para;<br>It says nothing about work authorization. See post, at 7–&para;<br>10 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). It says nothing about the&para;<br>source of the Federal Government’s information. It im&para;<br>poses no duty upon the Federal Government or anyone&para;<br>else to investigate the validity of that information, which&para;<br>may falsely implicate an employer 18% of the time.&para;<br>So what is the employer to do? What statute gives an&para;<br>employer whom the State proceeds against in state court&para;<br>the right to conduct discovery against the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment? The Arizona statute, like the federal statute,&para;<br>says that the employer’s use of an I–9 form provides a&para;<br>defense. But there is a hitch. The federal Act says that&para;<br>neither the I–9 form, nor “any information contained&para;<br>in or appended to” the form, “may . . . be used for pur&para;<br>poses other than for enforcement of this” federal Act.&para;<br>§1324a(b)(5). So how can the employer present a defense,&para;<br>say, that the Government’s information base is flawed?&para;<br>The majority takes the view that the forms are not neces­&para;<br>sary to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense. Ante,&para;<br>at 18, n. 9. But the I–9 form would surely be the em&para;<br>ployer’s most effective evidence. See also post, at 11&para;<br>(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the unavail&para;<br>ability of I–9 forms to defend against state-court charges&para;<br>means that Congress “intended no such” proceedings).&para;<br>Nor does the Arizona statute facilitate the presentation&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>of a defense when it immediately follows (1) its statement&para;<br>that “the court shall consider only the federal govern&para;<br>ment’s determination” when it considers “whether an&para;<br>employee is an unauthorized alien” with (2) its statement&para;<br>that “[t]he federal government’s determination creates a&para;<br>rebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful status.”&para;<br>Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H) (emphasis added). The&para;<br>two statements sound as if they mean that a Federal&para;<br>Government determination that the worker is unlawful&para;<br>is conclusive against the employer, but its determination&para;<br>that the worker’s employment is lawful is subject to rebut&para;<br>tal by the State. Arizona tells us that the statute means&para;<br>the opposite. See ante, at 16, n. 7. But the legal briefs of&para;<br>Arizona’s attorney general do not bind the state courts.&para;<br>And until the matter is cleared up, employers, despite I–9&para;<br>checks, despite efforts to use E-Verify, will hesitate to hire&para;<br>those they fear will turn out to lack the right to work in&para;<br>the United States.&para;<br>And that is my basic point. Either directly or through&para;<br>the uncertainty that it creates, the Arizona statute will&para;<br>impose additional burdens upon lawful employers and&para;<br>consequently lead those employers to erect ever stronger&para;<br>safeguards against the hiring of unauthorized aliens—&para;<br>without counterbalancing protection against unlawful&para;<br>discrimination. And by defining “licensing” so broadly, by&para;<br>bringing nearly all businesses within its scope, Arizona’s&para;<br>statute creates these effects statewide.&para;<br>Why would Congress, after deliberately limiting ordi&para;<br>nary penalties to the range of a few thousand dollars per&para;<br>illegal worker, want to permit far more drastic state pen&para;<br>alties that would directly and mandatorily destroy entire&para;<br>businesses? Why would Congress, after carefully balanc&para;<br>ing sanctions to avoid encouraging discrimination, want to&para;<br>allow States to destroy that balance? Why would Con&para;<br>gress, after creating detailed procedural protections for&para;<br>employers, want to allow States to undermine them? Why&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would Congress want to write into an express pre-emption&para;<br>provision—a provision designed to prevent States from&para;<br>undercutting federal statutory objectives—an exception&para;<br>that could so easily destabilize its efforts? The answer to&para;<br>these questions is that Congress would not have wanted to&para;<br>do any of these things. And that fact indicates that the&para;<br>majority’s reading of the licensing exception—a reading&para;<br>that would allow what Congress sought to forbid—is&para;<br>wrong.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The federal licensing exception cannot apply to a state&para;<br>statute that, like Arizona’s statute, seeks to bring virtually&para;<br>all articles of incorporation and partnership certificates&para;<br>within its scope. I would find the scope of the exception&para;<br>to federal pre-emption to be far more limited. Context,&para;<br>purpose, and history make clear that the “licensing and&para;<br>similar laws” at issue involve employment-related licensing&para;<br>systems.&para;<br>The issuance of articles of incorporation and partnership&para;<br>certificates and the like have long had little or nothing to&para;<br>do with hiring or “employment.” Indeed, Arizona provides&para;<br>no evidence that any State, at the time the federal Act was&para;<br>enacted, had refused to grant or had revoked, say, part&para;<br>nership certificates, in light of the partners’ hiring prac&para;<br>tices of any kind, much less the hiring of unauthorized&para;<br>aliens. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §29–308 (limited part&para;<br>nership formed upon the filing of a certificate of partner&para;<br>ship providing names and addresses); §29–345 (providing&para;<br>for dissolution of a limited partnership “[o]n application by&para;<br>or for a partner or assignee . . . whenever it is not rea&para;<br>sonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity&para;<br>with the partnership agreement”).&para;<br>To read the exception as covering laws governing corpo&para;<br>rate charters and partnership certificates (which are not&para;<br>usually called “licensing” laws) is to permit States to turn&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v.

The State need only&para;<br>call the permission a “license” and revoke the license should&para;<br>its holder hire an unauthorized alien. If what was not&para;<br>previously an employment-related licensing law can be&para;<br>come one simply by using it as a sanction for hiring unau&para;<br>thorized aliens or simply by state definition, indeed, if the&para;<br>State can call a corporate charter an employment-related&para;<br>licensing law, then why not an auto licensing law&para;<br>(amended to revoke the driver’s licenses of those who hire&para;<br>unauthorized aliens)? Why not a dog licensing law? Or&para;<br>why not “impute” a newly required license to conduct any&para;<br>business to every human being in the State, withdrawing&para;<br>that license should that individual hire an unauthorized&para;<br>alien? See S. C.

Otherwise we read the federal “licens&para;<br>ing” exception as authorizing a State to undermine, if not&para;<br>to swallow up, the federal pre-emption rule.&para;<br>III&para;<br>I would therefore read the words “licensing and similar&para;<br>laws” as covering state licensing systems applicable pri&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

This reading is&para;<br>consistent with the provision’s history and language, and&para;<br>it minimizes the risk of harm of the kind just described.&para;<br>The Act’s history supports this interpretation. Ever&para;<br>since 1964, the Federal Government has administered&para;<br>statutes that create a federal licensing scheme for agricul&para;<br>tural labor contractors, firms that specialize in recruiting&para;<br>agricultural workers and referring them to farmers for a&para;<br>fee. Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963&para;<br>(FLCRA), 78 Stat. 920; Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural&para;<br>Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. The stat&para;<br>utes require agricultural labor contractors to register with&para;<br>the federal Secretary of Labor, to obtain a registration&para;<br>certificate (in effect a license), and to require the contrac&para;<br>tor’s employees to carry that certificate with them when&para;<br>engaging in agricultural labor contracting activities.&para;<br>AWPA §101; FLCRA §4. The statutes list a host of forbid&para;<br>den activities, one of which (prior to 1986) was hiring&para;<br>unauthorized aliens. See AWPA §§103, 106; FLCRA §5(b).&para;<br>Prior to 1986, if the federal Labor Department believed&para;<br>a firm had violated these substantive provisions, it could&para;<br>institute administrative proceedings within the Labor&para;<br>Department. And if the Secretary found the labor con&para;<br>tracting firm had violated the provisions, the Secretary&para;<br>could impose monetary penalties or withdraw the firm’s&para;<br>registration. AWPA §§103, 503; FLCRA §§5(b), 9.&para;<br>Most important, and unlike the 1986 Act before us, the&para;<br>earlier agricultural labor contracting statutes did not pre­&para;<br>empt similar state laws. To the contrary, the earlier Acts&para;<br>were “intended to supplement State law” and did not&para;<br>“excuse any person from compliance with appropriate&para;<br>State law and regulation.” AWPA §521; see FLCRA §12.&para;<br>By 1986, nearly a dozen States had developed state licens&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>ing systems for agricultural labor contractors, i.e., firms&para;<br>that recruited and referred farm (and sometimes forestry)&para;<br>workers for a fee; some of these laws provided that state&para;<br>licenses could be revoked if the contractors hired unau&para;<br>thorized aliens. See, e.g., Cal. Lab. Code §1690(f) (Deering&para;<br>Supp. 1991); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§1301.503(4), 1301.505(3)&para;<br>(1965–1983 Supp. Pamphlet); Ore. Rev. Stat. §§658.405(1),&para;<br>658.440(2)(d) (1987) (covering forestry workers).&para;<br>In 1986, Congress (when enacting the Act now before&para;<br>us) focused directly upon the earlier federal agricultural&para;<br>labor contractor licensing system. And it changed that&para;<br>earlier system by including a series of conforming&para;<br>amendments in the Act. One amendment removes from&para;<br>the earlier statutes the specific prohibition against hiring&para;<br>unauthorized aliens. It thereby makes agricultural labor&para;<br>contractors subject to the Act’s similar general prohibition&para;<br>against such hiring. IRCA §101(b)(1)(C) (repealing AWPA&para;<br>§106). Another amendment takes from the Secretary of&para;<br>Labor most of the Secretary’s enforcement powers in&para;<br>respect to the hiring of unauthorized aliens. It thereby&para;<br>leaves agricultural labor contractors subject to the same&para;<br>single unified enforcement system that the immigration&para;<br>Act applies to all employers. See 29 U. S. C. §1853. A&para;<br>third amendment, however, leaves with the Secretary of&para;<br>Labor the power to withdraw the federal registration&para;<br>certificate from an agricultural labor contractor that hired&para;<br>unauthorized aliens. IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1813(a)(6). Thus, the Act leaves this subset of employers&para;<br>(i.e., agricultural labor contractors but not other employ&para;<br>ers) subject to a federal licensing scheme.&para;<br>So far, the conforming amendments make sense. But&para;<br>have they not omitted an important matter? Prior to&para;<br>1986, States as well as the Federal Government could&para;<br>license agricultural labor contractors. Should the 1986&para;<br>statute not say whether Congress intended that dual&para;<br>system to continue? The answer is that the 1986 Act does&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not omit this matter. It answers the coexistence question&para;<br>directly with the parenthetical phrase we are now consid&para;<br>ering, namely, the phrase, “other than through licensing&para;<br>and similar laws,” placed in the middle of the Act’s pre&para;<br>emption provision. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). That phrase&para;<br>refers to agricultural labor contractors, and it says that,&para;<br>in respect to those licensing schemes, dual state/federal&para;<br>licensing can continue.&para;<br>As of 1986, there were strong reasons for permitting&para;<br>that dual system to continue in this specialized area. Dual&para;<br>enforcement had proved helpful in preventing particularly&para;<br>serious employment abuses. See, e.g., 128 Cong. Rec.&para;<br>24090 (1982) (reflecting concerns that agricultural work&para;<br>ers were “housed in hovels; . . . subjected to physical abuse&para;<br>and kept in virtual slavery”). And because the contractors’&para;<br>business consists of providing labor forces, their hiring of&para;<br>authorized workers is closely related to their general&para;<br>fitness to do business. See S. Rep. No. 202, 88th Cong.,&para;<br>1st Sess., 1 (1963) (explaining that farm labor contractor&para;<br>registration laws are needed to prevent “irresponsible&para;<br>crew leaders” from “exploit[ing] . . . farmers”); Martin,&para;<br>Good Intentions Gone Awry: IRCA and U. S. Agriculture,&para;<br>534 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. &amp; Soc. Sci. 44, 49 (1994) (de&para;<br>scribing how farmers who relied on contractors risked&para;<br>losing their labor forces to immigration raids). Dual en&para;<br>forcement would not create a federal/state penalty dispar&para;<br>ity, for federal systems as well as state systems provide for&para;<br>license revocation. Experience had shown that dual en&para;<br>forcement had not created any serious conflict or other&para;<br>difficulty. And in light of the specialized nature and com&para;<br>paratively small set of businesses subject to dual enforce&para;<br>ment, to permit licensing of that set of businesses would&para;<br>not seriously undermine the objectives of the Act or its&para;<br>pre-emption provision.&para;<br>Thus, it is not surprising that the legislative history of&para;<br>the 1986 Act’s pre-emption provision says that the licens&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v. WHITING &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>ing exception is about the licensing of agricultural labor&para;<br>contractors. The House Report on the Act, referring to the&para;<br>licensing exception, states that the Committee did “not&para;<br>intend to preempt licensing or ‘fitness to do business laws,’&para;<br>such as state farm labor contractor laws or forestry laws,&para;<br>which specifically require such licensee or contractor to&para;<br>refrain from hiring, recruiting or referring undocumented&para;<br>aliens.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Act’s language, while not requiring this interpreta&para;<br>tion, is nonetheless consistent with limiting the scope of&para;<br>the phrase in this way. Context can limit the application&para;<br>of the term “licensing” to particular types of licensing. The&para;<br>Act’s subject matter itself limits the term to employment&para;<br>related licensing. And the Act’s specific reference to those&para;<br>who “recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthor&para;<br>ized aliens,” is consistent with employment-related li&para;<br>censing that focuses primarily upon labor contracting&para;<br>businesses.&para;<br>Thus, reading the phrase as limited in scope to laws&para;<br>licensing businesses that recruit or refer workers for&para;<br>employment is consistent with the statute’s language,&para;<br>with the relevant history, and with other statutory provi&para;<br>sions in the Act. That reading prevents state law from&para;<br>undermining the Act and from turning the pre-emption&para;<br>clause on its head. That is why I consider it the better&para;<br>reading of the statute.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Another section of the Arizona statute requires “every&para;<br>employer, after hiring an employee,” to “verify the em&para;<br>ployment eligibility of the employee” through the Federal&para;<br>Government’s E-Verify program. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§23–214. This state provision makes participation in the&para;<br>federal E-Verify system mandatory for virtually all Ari&para;<br>zona employers. The federal law governing the E-Verify&para;<br>program, however, creates a program that is voluntary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S.,&para;<br>at 373 (quoting Hines, 312 U. S., at 67). And it is conse&para;<br>quently pre-empted.&para;<br>The federal statute itself makes clear that participation&para;<br>in the E-Verify program is voluntary. The statute’s rele&para;<br>vant section bears the title “Voluntary Election to Partici&para;<br>pate in a Pilot Program.” IIRIRA §402, note following 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1324a, p. 331. A subsection bears the further&para;<br>title, “Voluntary Election.” §402(a). And within that&para;<br>subsection, the statute says that employers “may elect to&para;<br>participate.” (Emphasis added.) The statute elsewhere&para;<br>requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to “widely&para;<br>publicize . . . the voluntary nature” of the program.&para;<br>§402(d)(2); see also §402(d)(3)(A) (requiring the designa&para;<br>tion of local officials to advertise the “voluntary nature” of&para;<br>the program). It adds that employers may “terminate”&para;<br>their “election” to participate by following certain proce&para;<br>dures. §402(c)(3). And it tells the Secretary of Homeland&para;<br>Security (as an earlier version told the Attorney General)&para;<br>that she “may not require any person or other entity to&para;<br>participate.” §402(a); see also §402(e) (creating exceptions,&para;<br>none of which is applicable here, that require federal&para;<br>employers and certain others to participate in E-Verify or&para;<br>another pilot program).&para;<br>Congress had strong reasons for insisting on the volun&para;<br>tary nature of the program. E-Verify was conceived as,&para;<br>and remains, a pilot program. Its database consists of&para;<br>tens of millions of Social Security and immigration records&para;<br>kept by the Federal Government. These records are prone&para;<br>to error. See, e.g., Office of the Inspector General, Social&para;<br>Security Administration, Congressional Response Report:&para;<br>Accuracy of the Social Security Administration’s Nu&para;<br>mident File 12 (2006) (hereinafter Social Security Report)&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v.

The effects of&para;<br>the program’s efforts to take account of, and correct for,&para;<br>potential errors remain uncertain. Congress could decide&para;<br>that, based on the results of the pilot, E-Verify should&para;<br>become a mandatory program. But it has not yet made&para;<br>that determination. And in making that decision, it will&para;<br>have to face a number of questions: Will workers receiving&para;<br>tentative negative verdicts understand the possibility of&para;<br>administrative challenge? Will they make the effort to&para;<br>invoke that process, say traveling from a farm to an urban&para;<br>Social Security office? Will employers prove willing to&para;<br>undergo the financial burden of supporting a worker who&para;<br>might lose the challenge? Will employers hesitate to train&para;<br>those workers during the time they bring their challenges?&para;<br>Will employers simply hesitate to hire workers who might&para;<br>receive an initial negative verdict—more likely those who&para;<br>look or sound foreign? Or will they find ways to dismiss&para;<br>those workers? These and other unanswered questions&para;<br>convinced Congress to make E-Verify a pilot program, to&para;<br>commission continuous study and evaluation, and to insist&para;<br>that participation be voluntary.&para;<br>In co-opting a federal program and changing the key&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Crosby, supra, at 373 (quoting&para;<br>Hines, supra, at 67).&para;<br>The majority reaches a contrary conclusion by pointing&para;<br>out (1) that Congress has renewed the E-Verify program&para;<br>several times, each time expanding its coverage, to the&para;<br>point where it now encompasses all 50 States; (2) that the&para;<br>E-Verify database has become more accurate; (3) that&para;<br>the Executive Branch has itself mandated participation&para;<br>for federal contractors; and (4) that the statute’s language&para;<br>tells the Secretary of Homeland Security, not the States, to&para;<br>maintain the program as voluntary.&para;<br>The short, and, I believe, conclusive answers to these&para;<br>objections are: (1) Congress has kept the language of the&para;<br>statute—and the voluntary nature of the program—the&para;<br>same throughout its program renewals. See 115 Stat.&para;<br>2407; 117 Stat. 1944; §547, 123 Stat. 2177. And it is up to&para;<br>Congress, not to Arizona or this Court, to decide when&para;<br>participation in the program should cease to be voluntary.&para;<br>(2) The studies and reports have repeatedly found both&para;<br>(a) that the E-Verify program had achieved greater accu&para;<br>racy, but (b) that problems remain. See, e.g., Social Secu&para;<br>rity Report 11 (estimating that Social Security records&para;<br>contain 4.8 million “discrepancies that could require the&para;<br>numberholder to visit [the Social Security Administration]&para;<br>. . . before employment eligibility would be confirmed”);&para;<br>GAO Report 19 (estimating that, if E-Verify were made&para;<br>mandatory nationwide, 164,000 newly hired workers each&para;<br>year would erroneously be adjudged ineligible to work&para;<br>because of name mismatches, as when the worker’s “first&para;<br>or last name is incorrectly spelled in government data&para;<br>bases or on identification documents”).

For the&para;<br>Federal Government to mandate that a special group&para;<br>participate in the E-Verify program tells us little or noth&para;<br>ing about the effects of a State’s mandating that nearly&para;<br>every employer within the State participate—as Arizona&para;<br>has done. And insofar as we have not determined whether&para;<br>the Executive was authorized by Congress to mandate EVerify for federal contractors, it says nothing about Con&para;<br>gress’ intent.&para;<br>(4) There is no reason to imply negatively from language&para;<br>telling the Secretary not to make the program mandatory,&para;<br>permission for the States to do so. There is no presump&para;<br>tion that a State may modify the operation of a uniquely&para;<br>federal program like E-Verify. Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plain­&para;<br>tiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U.

As the major­&para;<br>ity explains, IRCA makes it “unlawful for a person or&para;<br>other entity to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for&para;<br>employment in the United States an alien knowing the&para;<br>alien is an unauthorized alien.” §1324a(a)(1)(A); ante, at&para;<br>3. IRCA also requires employers to verify that they have&para;<br>reviewed documents establishing an employee’s eligibility&para;<br>for employment. See §1324a(b); ante, at 3–4. These two&para;<br>provisions are the foundation of IRCA’s “comprehensive&para;<br>scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the&para;<br>United States.” Hoffman, 535 U.

Congress struc­&para;<br>tured IRCA’s provisions in a number of ways to accom­&para;<br>plish this goal of uniform enforcement.&para;<br>First, and most obviously, Congress expressly displaced&para;<br>the myriad state laws that imposed civil and criminal&para;<br>sanctions on employers who hired unauthorized aliens.&para;<br>See §1324a(h)(2); see also H.

IRCA instructs the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v.

IRCA also instructs the Attor­&para;<br>ney General to establish procedures for receiving com­&para;<br>plaints, investigating complaints having “a substantial&para;<br>probability of validity,” and investigating other violations.&para;<br>§1324a(e)(1); see also 8 CFR §274a.9 (2010). Upon con­&para;<br>cluding that a person has violated IRCA, the Attorney&para;<br>General must provide the person with notice and an op­&para;<br>portunity for a hearing before a federal administrative law&para;<br>judge (ALJ). 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(e)(3)(A), (B). If the person&para;<br>does not request a hearing, the Attorney General may&para;<br>impose a final, nonappealable order requiring payment of&para;<br>sanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(B). If the person requests a hear­&para;<br>ing, the ALJ is required to hold a hearing and, upon find­&para;<br>ing that the person has violated IRCA, must order the&para;<br>payment of sanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(C). The ALJ’s order is&para;<br>the final agency order, unless the affected person requests&para;<br>and obtains further administrative appellate review.&para;<br>§1324a(e)(7); see also 28 CFR §68.54 (2010). IRCA grants&para;<br>immigration officers and ALJs “reasonable access to&para;<br>examine evidence of any person or entity being investi­&para;<br>gated” and provides them with extensive subpoena powers.&para;<br>§1324a(e)(2). And the immigration officers investigating&para;<br>suspected violations obviously have access to the relevant&para;<br>federal information concerning the work authorization&para;<br>status of the employee in question.4&para;<br>Third, Congress provided persons “adversely affected”&para;<br>by an agency order with a right of review in the federal&para;<br>courts of appeals. §1324a(e)(8); see also §1324a(e)(9)&para;<br>(directing the Attorney General in cases of noncompliance&para;<br>to file suit in federal district court to enforce a final order&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 By regulation, the Attorney General has conferred on parties&para;<br>charged with violating IRCA the right to obtain discovery from the&para;<br>Federal Government in a hearing before an ALJ.

In this way, Congress ensured&para;<br>that administrative orders finding violations of IRCA&para;<br>would be reviewed by federal judges with experience&para;<br>adjudicating immigration-related matters.&para;<br>Fourth, Congress created a uniquely federal system by&para;<br>which employers must verify the work authorization&para;<br>status of new hires. Under this system, an employer must&para;<br>attest under penalty of perjury on a form designated by&para;<br>the Attorney General (the I–9 form) that it has examined&para;<br>enumerated identification documents to verify that a new&para;<br>hire is not an unauthorized alien. §1324a(b)(1)(A); see&para;<br>also 8 CFR §274a.2; ante, at 3–4. Good-faith compliance&para;<br>with this verification requirement entitles an employer to&para;<br>an affirmative defense if charged with violating IRCA.&para;<br>§1324a(a)(3); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 57. Nota­&para;<br>bly, however, IRCA prohibits use of the I–9 form for any&para;<br>purpose other than enforcement of IRCA and various&para;<br>provisions of federal criminal law. §1324a(b)(5); 8 CFR&para;<br>§274a.2(b)(4). Use of the I–9 form is thus limited to fed&para;<br>eral proceedings, as the majority acknowledges. See ante,&para;<br>at 18, n. 9.&para;<br>Finally, Congress created no mechanism for States to&para;<br>access information regarding an alien’s work authoriza­&para;<br>tion status for purposes of enforcing state prohibitions on&para;<br>the employment of unauthorized aliens. The relevant&para;<br>sections of IRCA make no provision for the sharing of&para;<br>work authorization information between federal and state&para;<br>authorities even though access to that information would&para;<br>be critical to a State’s ability to determine whether an&para;<br>employer has employed an unauthorized alien. In stark&para;<br>contrast, a separate provision in the same title of IRCA&para;<br>creates a verification system by which States can ascer­&para;<br>tain the immigration status of aliens applying for benefits&para;<br>under programs such as Medicaid and the food stamp&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v.

The existence of a verification system in one&para;<br>provision of IRCA, coupled with its absence in the provi­&para;<br>sion governing employment of unauthorized aliens, sug­&para;<br>gests strongly that Congress did not contemplate any role&para;<br>for the States in adjudicating questions regarding em­&para;<br>ployment of unauthorized aliens. Cf. Bates v. United&para;<br>States, 522 U. S. 23, 29–30 (1997) (“Where Congress in­&para;<br>cludes particular language in one section of a statute but&para;<br>omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally&para;<br>presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely&para;<br>in the disparate inclusion or exclusion” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and brackets omitted)).&para;<br>In an attempt to show that Congress intended for the&para;<br>Federal Government to share immigration-related in­&para;<br>formation with the States, Arizona points to a federal&para;<br>statute, 8 U.

Section&para;<br>1373(c), however, merely requires the Government to&para;<br>respond to inquiries from state agencies “seeking to verify&para;<br>or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any&para;<br>individual within the jurisdiction of the agency.” It does&para;<br>not require the provision of information regarding an&para;<br>alien’s work authorization status, which is not necessarily synonymous with immigration status. See 8 CFR&para;<br>§274a.12(c) (identifying categories of legal aliens “who&para;<br>must apply for employment authorization”).5 Arizona has&para;<br>not identified any federal statute or regulation requiring&para;<br>the Federal Government to provide information regarding&para;<br>an alien’s work authorization status to a State.6 More&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 For example, spouses and minor children of persons working in the&para;<br>United States as exchange visitors must apply for employment authori­&para;<br>zation even though they have lawful immigration status as dependents&para;<br>of the exchange visitor.

See Jones v. United States, 526 U.

S. C. §1324a(h)(2).&para;<br>C&para;<br>IRCA’s saving clause must be construed against this&para;<br>backdrop. Focusing primarily on the text of the saving&para;<br>clause, Arizona and the majority read the clause to permit&para;<br>States to determine themselves whether a person has&para;<br>employed an unauthorized alien, so long as they do so in&para;<br>connection with licensing sanctions. See ante, at 12–13.&para;<br>This interpretation overlooks the broader statutory con­&para;<br>text and renders the statutory scheme “[in]coherent and&para;<br>[in]consistent.” Ali, 552 U.

The majority’s holding also permits&para;<br>state courts and other tribunals to adjudicate the question&para;<br>whether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien.&para;<br>The Arizona Act illustrates the problems with reading the&para;<br>saving clause to permit such state action. The Act directs&para;<br>prosecutors to verify an employee’s work authorization&para;<br>with the Federal Government pursuant to §1373(c), e.g.,&para;<br>Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Even&para;<br>when Arizona prosecutors obtain information regarding&para;<br>an alien’s immigration status pursuant to §1373(c), the&para;<br>prosecutors and state court will have to determine the&para;<br>significance of that information to an alien’s work authori&para;<br>zation status, which will often require deciding technical questions of immigration law. See, e.g., 8 CFR&para;<br>§§274a.12(a)–(c) (dividing 62 different classes of aliens&para;<br>into those authorized for employment incident to immigra­&para;<br>tion status, those authorized for employment with a spe­&para;<br>cific employer incident to immigration status, and those&para;<br>who must apply for work authorization). And, as dis­&para;<br>cussed above, that information may not shed light at all on&para;<br>an alien’s work authorization status, which is oftentimes&para;<br>distinct from immigration status. See supra, at 8, and&para;<br>n. 5. As a result, in many cases state decisions—made by&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 However, the “federal government’s determination creates [only] a&para;<br>rebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful status.” E.g., §23–&para;<br>212(H).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

I can discern no reason why Congress would&para;<br>have intended for state courts inexperienced in immigra­&para;<br>tion matters to adjudicate, in the context of licensing&para;<br>sanctions, the very same question that IRCA commits to&para;<br>federal officers, ALJs, and the courts of appeals.&para;<br>Equally problematic is the fact that employers charged&para;<br>under a state enforcement scheme with hiring unauthor­&para;<br>ized aliens are foreclosed from using I–9 forms in their&para;<br>defense in the state proceedings. Like IRCA, the Arizona&para;<br>Act confers an affirmative defense on employers who&para;<br>comply in good faith with IRCA’s verification requirement.&para;<br>See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§23–212(J), 23–212.01(J). As&para;<br>discussed above, however, IRCA prohibits an employer&para;<br>from using the I–9 form to establish that affirmative&para;<br>defense under Arizona law. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(b)(5); 8&para;<br>CFR §274a.2(b)(4).

Reading the sav­&para;<br>ing clause as the majority does subjects employers to a&para;<br>patchwork of enforcement schemes similar to the one that&para;<br>Congress sought to displace when it enacted IRCA. Hav­&para;<br>ing carefully constructed a uniform federal scheme for&para;<br>determining whether a person has employed an unauthor­&para;<br>ized alien, Congress could not plausibly have meant to&para;<br>create such a gaping hole in that scheme through the&para;<br>undefined, parenthetical phrase “licensing and similar&para;<br>laws.” See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,&para;<br>531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress . . . does not, one&para;<br>might say, hide elephants in mouseholes”).&para;<br>In sum, the statutory scheme as a whole defeats Ari­&para;<br>zona’s and the majority’s reading of the saving clause.&para;<br>Congress would not sensibly have permitted States to&para;<br>determine for themselves whether a person has employed&para;<br>an unauthorized alien, while at the same time creating a&para;<br>specialized federal procedure for making such a determi­&para;<br>nation, withholding from the States the information nec­&para;<br>essary to make such a determination, and precluding use&para;<br>of the I–9 forms in nonfederal proceedings. See United&para;<br>States v. Locke, 529 U.

S., at 106. It also&para;<br>makes sense as a practical matter. In enacting IRCA’s&para;<br>pre-emption clause, Congress vested in the Federal Gov­&para;<br>ernment the authority to impose civil and criminal sanc­&para;<br>tions on persons who employ unauthorized aliens. Licens­&para;<br>ing and other types of business-related permissions are&para;<br>typically a matter of state law, however. See, e.g., Kamen&para;<br>v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 98 (1991)&para;<br>(noting that “[c]orporation law” is an area traditionally&para;<br>“governed by state-law standards”); Chicago Title &amp; Trust&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 This reading of the saving clause finds support in IRCA’s legislative&para;<br>history. The House Committee on the Judiciary reported that IRCA&para;<br>was “not intended to preempt or prevent lawful state or local processes&para;<br>concerning the suspension, revocation or refusal to reissue a license to&para;<br>any person who has been found to have violated the sanctions pro­&para;<br>visions in this legislation.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis&para;<br>added). The Committee’s reference to “this legislation” is, of course, a&para;<br>reference to IRCA, and only federal officers, ALJs, and courts have&para;<br>authority under IRCA to find that a person has violated the statute’s&para;<br>sanctions provisions.&para;<br>My reading is also consistent with, though not compelled by, the&para;<br>provisions in IRCA that amended the Migrant and Seasonal Agricul­&para;<br>tural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. As JUSTICE&para;<br>BREYER discusses in detail, see ante, at 13–15 (dissenting opinion),&para;<br>AWPA requires entities to secure a certificate of registration from the&para;<br>Department of Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting&para;<br>activity.” AWPA §101, 96 Stat. 2587, 29 U. S. C. §1811(a). Before 1986,&para;<br>AWPA prohibited farm labor contractors from hiring unauthorized&para;<br>aliens, and it permitted the Department of Labor to institute adminis­&para;<br>trative proceedings to enforce this prohibition. See §§103(a)(3), 103(b),&para;<br>106(a), 96 Stat. 2588–2590. In IRCA, Congress repealed this pro­&para;<br>hibition, IRCA §101(b)(1)(C), but authorized the Secretary of Labor to&para;<br>withdraw a contractor’s federal registration certificate upon a finding of&para;<br>an IRCA violation, IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 100 Stat. 3372, 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1813(a)(6). Thus, IRCA made AWPA’s licensing sanctions turn on a&para;<br>prior federal adjudication of a violation of IRCA.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA v.

I write separately to offer a few addi­&para;<br>tional observations.&para;<br>As we have recently recognized, that a state law makes&para;<br>mandatory something that federal law makes voluntary&para;<br>does not mean, in and of itself, that the state law “stands&para;<br>as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the&para;<br>full purposes and objectives of Congress,” Crosby v. Na&para;<br>tional Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 373 (2000)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). See Williamson v.&para;<br>Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 1–2) (concluding that a federal regulation&para;<br>permitting manufacturers to choose between two seatbelt&para;<br>options did not pre-empt state tort liability based on a&para;<br>decision to install one of those options); see also id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 2) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (“[T]he mere&para;<br>fact that an agency regulation allows manufacturers a&para;<br>choice between options is insufficient to justify implied&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Because I believe that the Arizona Act does not fall within IRCA’s&para;<br>saving clause for this reason, I have no reason to consider the separate question whether the Act’s definition of “license” sweeps too&para;<br>broadly.

Here, the Arizona Act directly&para;<br>regulates the relationship between the Federal Govern­&para;<br>ment and private parties by mandating use of a federally&para;<br>created and administered resource. This case thus impli­&para;<br>cates the “uniquely federal interes[t]” in managing use of a&para;<br>federal resource. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487&para;<br>U.

In addition to&para;<br>those discussed by JUSTICE BREYER, see ante, at 17–19&para;<br>(dissenting opinion), I note that Congress considered the&para;<br>cost of a mandatory program. In 2003, when Congress&para;<br>elected to expand E-Verify to all 50 States but declined to&para;<br>require its use, it cited a congressionally mandated report&para;<br>concluding that the annual cost of the pilot program was&para;<br>$6 million, the annual cost of a nationwide voluntary&para;<br>program would be $11 million, and the annual cost of a&para;<br>nationwide mandatory program would be $11.7 billion.&para;<br>H.
