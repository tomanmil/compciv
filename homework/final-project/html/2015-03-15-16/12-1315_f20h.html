METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC., ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–1315. Argued January 21, 2014—Decided May 19, 2014&para;<br>The Copyright Act (Act) protects copyrighted works published before&para;<br>1978 for an initial period of 28 years, renewable for a period of up to&para;<br>67 years. 17 U. S. C. §304(a). The author’s heirs inherit the renewal&para;<br>rights. See §304(a)(1)(C)(ii)–(iv). When an author who has assigned&para;<br>her rights away “dies before the renewal period, . . . the assignee may&para;<br>continue to use the original work only if the author’s successor transfers the renewal rights to the assignee,” Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S.&para;<br>207, 221. The Act provides both equitable and legal remedies for infringement: an injunction “on such terms as [a court] may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright,” §502(a);&para;<br>and, at the copyright owner’s election, either (1) the “owner’s actual&para;<br>damages and any additional profits of the infringer,” §504(a)(1),&para;<br>which petitioner seeks in this case, or (2) specified statutory damages, §504(c). The Act’s statute of limitations provides: “No civil action&para;<br>shall be maintained under the [Act] unless it is commenced within&para;<br>three years after the claim accrued.” §507(b). A claim ordinarily accrues when an infringing act occurs. Under the separate-accrual rule&para;<br>that attends the copyright statute of limitations, when a defendant&para;<br>has committed successive violations, each infringing act starts a new&para;<br>limitations period. However, under §507(b), each infringement is actionable only within three years of its occurrence.&para;<br>Here, the allegedly infringing work is the motion picture Raging&para;<br>Bull, based on the life of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who, with&para;<br>Frank Petrella, told his story in, inter alia, a screenplay copyrighted&para;<br>in 1963. In 1976, the pair assigned their rights and renewal rights,&para;<br>which were later acquired by respondent United Artists Corporation,&para;<br>a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively,&para;<br>MGM). In 1980, MGM released, and registered a copyright in, the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>film Raging Bull, and it continues to market the film today. Frank&para;<br>Petrella died during the initial copyright term, so renewal rights reverted to his heirs. Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella&para;<br>(Petrella), his daughter, renewed the 1963 copyright in 1991, becoming its sole owner. Seven years later, she advised MGM that its exploitation of Raging Bull violated her copyright and threatened suit.&para;<br>Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, she filed an infringement&para;<br>suit, seeking monetary and injunctive relief limited to acts of infringement occurring on or after January 6, 2006. Invoking the equitable doctrine of laches, MGM moved for summary judgment. Petrella’s 18-year delay in filing suit, MGM argued, was unreasonable&para;<br>and prejudicial to MGM. The District Court granted MGM’s motion,&para;<br>holding that laches barred Petrella’s complaint. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Laches cannot be invoked as a bar to Petrella’s pursuit of a claim&para;<br>for damages brought within §507(b)’s three-year window. Pp. 11–19.&para;<br>(a) By permitting a successful plaintiff to gain retrospective relief&para;<br>only three years back from the time of suit, the copyright statute of&para;<br>limitations itself takes account of delay. Brought to bear here,&para;<br>§507(b) directs that Petrella cannot reach MGM’s returns on its investment in Raging Bull in years before 2006. Moreover, if infringement within the three-year window is shown, a defendant may offset&para;<br>against profits made in that period expenses incurred in generating&para;<br>those profits. See §504(b). In addition, a defendant may retain the&para;<br>return on investment shown to be attributable to its own enterprise,&para;<br>as distinct from the value created by the infringed work. See ibid.&para;<br>Both before and after the merger of law and equity in 1938, this&para;<br>Court has cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal relief. See,&para;<br>e.g., Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395, 396. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(b) MGM’s principal arguments regarding the contemporary&para;<br>scope of the laches defense are unavailing. Pp. 14–19.&para;<br>(1) MGM urges that, because laches is listed in Federal Rule of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 8(c) as an affirmative defense discrete from a statute&para;<br>of limitations defense, the plea should be “available . . . in every civil&para;<br>action” to bar all forms of relief. Such an expansive role careens&para;<br>away from understandings, past and present, of the essentially gapfilling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches. This Court has&para;<br>never applied laches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete&para;<br>wrongs occurring within a federally prescribed limitations period.&para;<br>Inviting individual judges to set a time limit other than the one Congress prescribed would tug against the uniformity Congress sought to&para;<br>achieve in enacting §507(b). Pp. 14–15.&para;<br>(2) MGM contends that laches, like equitable tolling, should be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“read into every federal statute of limitation,” Holmberg, 327 U. S., at&para;<br>397. However, tolling lengthens the time for commencing a civil action where there is a statute of limitations and is, in effect, a rule of&para;<br>interpretation tied to that statutory limit. See, e.g., Young v. United&para;<br>States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50. In contrast, laches, which originally&para;<br>served as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled, can&para;<br>scarcely be described as a rule for interpreting a statutory prescription. Pp. 15–16.&para;<br>(3) MGM insists that the laches defense must be available to&para;<br>prevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing nothing, waiting to&para;<br>see what the outcome of an alleged infringer’s investment will be. It&para;<br>is hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to challenge each&para;<br>and every actionable infringement. And there is nothing untoward&para;<br>about waiting to see whether an infringer’s exploitation undercuts&para;<br>the value of the copyrighted work, has no effect on that work, or even&para;<br>complements it. Section 507(b)’s limitations period, coupled to the&para;<br>separate-accrual rule, allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she&para;<br>can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle. Pp. 16–17.&para;<br>(4) MGM is concerned that evidence needed or useful to defend&para;<br>against liability will be lost during a copyright owner’s inaction. But&para;<br>Congress must have been aware that the passage of time and the author’s death could cause evidentiary issues when it provided for reversionary renewal rights that an author’s heirs can exercise long after a work was written and copyrighted. Moreover, because a&para;<br>copyright plaintiff bears the burden of proving infringement, any&para;<br>hindrance caused by evidence unavailability is as likely to affect&para;<br>plaintiffs as defendants. The need for extrinsic evidence is also reduced by the registration mechanism, under which both the certificate and the original work must be on file with the Copyright Office&para;<br>before a copyright owner can sue for infringement. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(5) Finally, when a copyright owner engages in intentionally&para;<br>misleading representations concerning his abstention from suit, and&para;<br>the alleged infringer detrimentally relies on such deception, the doctrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owner’s claims completely,&para;<br>eliminating all potential remedies. The gravamen of estoppel, a defense long recognized as available in actions at law, is wrongdoing,&para;<br>overt misleading, and consequent loss. Estoppel does not undermine&para;<br>the statute of limitations, for it rests on misleading, whether engaged&para;<br>in early on, or later in time. P. 19.&para;<br>2. While laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a&para;<br>claim for damages brought within the Act’s three-year window, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may, at the very outset of the litigation, curtail the relief equitably awarded. For example, where&para;<br>owners of a copyrighted architectural design, although aware of an&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>allegedly infringing housing project, delayed suit until the project&para;<br>was substantially constructed and partially occupied, an order mandating destruction of the project would not be tolerable. See Chirco v.&para;<br>Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F. 3d 227, 236. Nor, in the face of&para;<br>an unexplained delay in commencing suit, would it be equitable to&para;<br>order “total destruction” of a book already printed, packed, and&para;<br>shipped. See New Era Publications Int’l v. Henry Holt &amp; Co., 873&para;<br>F. 2d 576, 584–585. No such extraordinary circumstance is present&para;<br>here. Petrella notified MGM of her copyright claims before MGM invested millions of dollars in creating a new edition of Raging Bull,&para;<br>and the equitable relief she seeks—e.g., disgorgement of unjust gains&para;<br>and an injunction against future infringement—would not result in&para;<br>anything like “total destruction” of the film. Allowing Petrella’s suit&para;<br>to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has&para;<br>earned during the more than three decades Raging Bull has been&para;<br>marketed and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties.&para;<br>Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the District Court,&para;<br>in determining appropriate injunctive relief and assessing profits,&para;<br>may take account of Petrella’s delay in commencing suit. In doing so,&para;<br>however, the court must closely examine MGM’s alleged reliance on&para;<br>Petrella’s delay, taking account of MGM’s early knowledge of her&para;<br>claims, the protection MGM might have achieved through a declaratory judgment action, the extent to which MGM’s investment was&para;<br>protected by the separate-accrual rule, the court’s authority to order&para;<br>injunctive relief “on such terms as it may deem reasonable,” §502(a),&para;<br>and any other relevant considerations.

METRO-&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC., ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[May 19, 2014]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Copyright Act provides that “[n]o civil action shall&para;<br>be maintained under the [Act] unless it is commenced&para;<br>within three years after the claim accrued.” 17 U. S. C.&para;<br>§507(b). This case presents the question whether the&para;<br>equitable defense of laches (unreasonable, prejudicial&para;<br>delay in commencing suit) may bar relief on a copyright&para;<br>infringement claim brought within §507(b)’s three-year&para;<br>limitations period. Section 507(b), it is undisputed, bars&para;<br>relief of any kind for conduct occurring prior to the threeyear limitations period. To the extent that an infringement suit seeks relief solely for conduct occurring within&para;<br>the limitations period, however, courts are not at liberty to&para;<br>jettison Congress’ judgment on the timeliness of suit.&para;<br>Laches, we hold, cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the three-year&para;<br>window. As to equitable relief, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may bar at the very threshold the particular relief requested by the plaintiff. And a plaintiff ’s delay&para;<br>can always be brought to bear at the remedial stage, in&para;<br>determining appropriate injunctive relief, and in assessing&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the “profits of the infringer . . . attributable to the infringement.” §504(b).1&para;<br>Petitioner Paula Petrella, in her suit for copyright infringement, sought no relief for conduct occurring outside&para;<br>§507(b)’s three-year limitations period. Nevertheless, the&para;<br>courts below held that laches barred her suit in its entirety, without regard to the currency of the conduct of&para;<br>which Petrella complains. That position, we hold, is contrary to §507(b) and this Court’s precedent on the province&para;<br>of laches.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Copyright Act (Act), 17 U. S. C. §101 et seq., grants&para;<br>copyright protection to original works of authorship.&para;<br>§102(a). Four aspects of copyright law bear explanation at&para;<br>the outset.&para;<br>First, the length of a copyright term. Under the Act, a&para;<br>copyright “vests initially in the author or authors of the&para;<br>work,” who may transfer ownership to a third party. §201.&para;<br>The Act confers on a copyright owner certain exclusive&para;<br>rights, including the rights to reproduce and distribute the&para;<br>work and to develop and market derivative works. §106.&para;<br>Copyrighted works published before 1978—as was the&para;<br>work at issue—are protected for an initial period of 28&para;<br>years, which may be—and in this case was—extended for&para;<br>a renewal period of up to 67 years. §304(a). From and&para;<br>after January 1, 1978, works are generally protected from&para;<br>the date of creation until 70 years after the author’s death.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 As infringement remedies, the Copyright Act provides for injunctions, §502, impoundment and disposition of infringing articles, §503,&para;<br>damages and profits, §504, costs and attorney’s fees, §505. Like other&para;<br>restitutional remedies, recovery of profits “is not easily characterized as&para;<br>legal or equitable,” for it is an “amalgamation of rights and remedies&para;<br>drawn from both systems.” Restatement (Third) of Restitution and&para;<br>Unjust Enrichment §4, Comment b, p. 28 (2010). Given the “protean&para;<br>character” of the profits-recovery remedy, see id., Comment c, at 30, we&para;<br>regard as appropriate its treatment as “equitable” in this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§302(a).&para;<br>Second, copyright inheritance. For works copyrighted&para;<br>under the pre-1978 regime in which an initial period of&para;<br>protection may be followed by a renewal period, Congress&para;<br>provided that the author’s heirs inherit the renewal rights.&para;<br>See §304(a)(1)(C)(ii)–(iv). We held in Stewart v. Abend,&para;<br>495 U. S. 207 (1990), that if an author who has assigned&para;<br>her rights away “dies before the renewal period, then the&para;<br>assignee may continue to use the original work [to produce&para;<br>a derivative work] only if the author’s successor transfers&para;<br>the renewal rights to the assignee.” Id., at 221.2&para;<br>Third, remedies. The Act provides a variety of civil&para;<br>remedies for infringement, both equitable and legal. See&para;<br>§§502–505, described supra, at 2, n. 1. A court may issue&para;<br>an injunction “on such terms as it may deem reasonable to&para;<br>prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.” §502(a).&para;<br>At the election of the copyright owner, a court may also&para;<br>award either (1) “the copyright owner’s actual damages&para;<br>and any additional profits of the infringer,” §504(a)(1),&para;<br>which petitioner seeks in the instant case, or (2) statutory&para;<br>damages within a defined range, §504(c).&para;<br>Fourth, and most significant here, the statute of limitations. Until 1957, federal copyright law did not include a&para;<br>statute of limitations for civil suits. Federal courts therefore used analogous state statutes of limitations to determine the timeliness of infringement claims. See S. Rep.&para;<br>No. 1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1957) (hereinafter&para;<br>Senate Report). And they sometimes invoked laches to&para;<br>abridge the state-law prescription. As explained in Teamsters &amp; Employers Welfare Trust of Ill. v. Gorman Bros.&para;<br>Ready Mix, 283 F. 3d 877, 881 (CA7 2002): “When Congress fails to enact a statute of limitations, a [federal]&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 For post-1978 works, heirs still have an opportunity to recapture&para;<br>rights of the author. See 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Copyright&para;<br>§11.01[A], p. 11–4 (2013) (hereinafter Nimmer).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>court that borrows a state statute of limitations but permits it to be abridged by the doctrine of laches is not invading congressional prerogatives. It is merely filling a&para;<br>legislative hole.” (internal citation omitted). In 1957,&para;<br>Congress addressed the matter and filled the hole; it&para;<br>prescribed a three-year look-back limitations period for all&para;<br>civil claims arising under the Copyright Act. See Act of&para;<br>Sept. 7, 1957, Pub. L. 85–313, 71 Stat. 633, 17 U. S. C.&para;<br>§115(b) (1958 ed.). The provision, as already noted, reads:&para;<br>“No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions&para;<br>of this title unless it is commenced within three years&para;<br>after the claim accrued.” §507(b).3&para;<br>The federal limitations prescription governing copyright&para;<br>suits serves two purposes: (1) to render uniform and certain the time within which copyright claims could be&para;<br>pursued; and (2) to prevent the forum shopping invited by&para;<br>disparate state limitations periods, which ranged from one&para;<br>to eight years. Senate Report 2; see H. R. Rep. No. 2419,&para;<br>84th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1956). To comprehend how the&para;<br>Copyright Act’s limitations period works, one must understand when a copyright infringement claim accrues.&para;<br>A claim ordinarily accrues “when [a] plaintiff has a&para;<br>complete and present cause of action.” Bay Area Laundry&para;<br>and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of&para;<br>Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). In other words, the limitations period generally&para;<br>begins to run at the point when “the plaintiff can file suit&para;<br>and obtain relief.” Ibid. A copyright claim thus arises or&para;<br>“accrue[s]” when an infringing act occurs.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Copyright Act was pervasively revised in 1976, but the threeyear look-back statute of limitations has remained materially unchanged. See Act of Oct. 19, 1976, §101, 90 Stat. 2586.&para;<br>4 Although we have not passed on the question, nine Courts of Appeals have adopted, as an alternative to the incident of injury rule, a&para;<br>“discovery rule,” which starts the limitations period when “the plaintiff&para;<br>discovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the injury that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>It is widely recognized that the separate-accrual rule&para;<br>attends the copyright statute of limitations.5 Under that&para;<br>rule, when a defendant commits successive violations, the&para;<br>statute of limitations runs separately from each violation.&para;<br>Each time an infringing work is reproduced or distributed,&para;<br>the infringer commits a new wrong. Each wrong gives rise&para;<br>to a discrete “claim” that “accrue[s]” at the time the wrong&para;<br>occurs.6 In short, each infringing act starts a new limitations period. See Stone v. Williams, 970 F. 2d 1043, 1049&para;<br>(CA2 1992) (“Each act of infringement is a distinct harm&para;<br>giving rise to an independent claim for relief.”).&para;<br>Under the Act’s three-year provision, an infringement is&para;<br>actionable within three years, and only three years, of its&para;<br>occurrence. And the infringer is insulated from liability&para;<br>for earlier infringements of the same work. See 3 M.&para;<br>Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Copyright §12.05[B][1][b], p. 12–&para;<br>150.4 (2013) (“If infringement occurred within three years&para;<br>prior to filing, the action will not be barred even if prior&para;<br>——————&para;<br>forms the basis for the claim.” William A.

Patry, Copyright §20:19, p. 20–28 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (“The&para;<br>overwhelming majority of courts use discovery accrual in copyright&para;<br>cases.”).&para;<br>5 See generally id., §20:23, at 20–44; 3 Nimmer §12.05[B][1][b], at 12–&para;<br>150.2 to 12–150.4.

New World Pictures, Ltd., 19 F. 3d 479, 481 (CA9 1994).&para;<br>6 Separately accruing harm should not be confused with harm from&para;<br>past violations that are continuing. Compare Klehr v. A. O. Smith&para;<br>Corp., 521 U. S. 179, 190 (1997) (for separately accruing harm, each&para;<br>new act must cause “harm [to the plaintiff] over and above the harm&para;<br>that the earlier acts caused”), with Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,&para;<br>455 U. S. 363, 380–381 (1982) (“[W]here a plaintiff . . . challenges . . . an&para;<br>unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the complaint is timely when it is filed within [the limitations period, measured&para;<br>from] the last asserted occurrence of that practice.” (footnote omitted)).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>infringements by the same party as to the same work are&para;<br>barred because they occurred more than three years previously.”). Thus, when a defendant has engaged (or is&para;<br>alleged to have engaged) in a series of discrete infringing&para;<br>acts, the copyright holder’s suit ordinarily will be timely&para;<br>under §507(b) with respect to more recent acts of infringement (i.e., acts within the three-year window), but&para;<br>untimely with respect to prior acts of the same or similar&para;<br>kind.7&para;<br>In sum, Congress provided two controlling time prescriptions: the copyright term, which endures for decades,&para;<br>and may pass from one generation to another; and&para;<br>§507(b)’s limitations period, which allows plaintiffs during&para;<br>that lengthy term to gain retrospective relief running only&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7A&para;<br>&para;<br>case arising outside of the copyright context is illustrative. In Bay&para;<br>Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of&para;<br>Cal., 522 U.

The trustees filed suit just over six years after the first&para;<br>missed payment, barely outside of the applicable six-year statute of&para;<br>limitations. See id., at 198. Because the first missed payment in the&para;<br>series fell outside the statute of limitations, the employer argued that&para;<br>the subsequent missed payments were also time barred. See id., at&para;<br>206. We rejected that argument. The remaining claims were timely,&para;<br>we held, because “each missed payment create[d] a separate cause of&para;<br>action with its own six-year limitations period.” Ibid. Cf.

After retiring from the&para;<br>ring, LaMotta worked with his longtime friend, Frank&para;<br>Petrella, to tell the story of the boxer’s career. Their&para;<br>venture resulted in three copyrighted works: two screenplays, one registered in 1963, the other in 1973, and a&para;<br>book, registered in 1970. This case centers on the screenplay registered in 1963. The registration identified Frank&para;<br>Petrella as sole author, but also stated that the screenplay&para;<br>was written “in collaboration with” LaMotta. App. 164.&para;<br>In 1976, Frank Petrella and LaMotta assigned their&para;<br>rights in the three works, including renewal rights, to&para;<br>Chartoff-Winkler Productions, Inc. Two years later, respondent United Artists Corporation, a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively, MGM), acquired the motion picture rights to the book and both&para;<br>screenplays, rights stated by the parties to be “exclusiv[e]&para;<br>and forever, including all periods of copyright and renewals and extensions thereof.” Id., at 49. In 1980, MGM&para;<br>released, and registered a copyright in, the film Raging&para;<br>Bull, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De&para;<br>Niro, who won a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of LaMotta. MGM continues to market the film,&para;<br>and has converted it into formats unimagined in 1980,&para;<br>including DVD and Blu-ray.&para;<br>Frank Petrella died in 1981, during the initial terms of&para;<br>the copyrights in the screenplays and book. As this&para;<br>Court’s decision in Stewart confirmed, Frank Petrella’s&para;<br>renewal rights reverted to his heirs, who could renew the&para;<br>copyrights unburdened by any assignment previously&para;<br>made by the author.

Learning of this Court’s&para;<br>decision in Stewart, Petrella engaged an attorney who, in&para;<br>1991, renewed the copyright in the 1963 screenplay.&para;<br>Because the copyrights in the 1973 screenplay and the&para;<br>1970 book were not timely renewed, the infringement&para;<br>claims in this case rest exclusively on the screenplay&para;<br>registered in 1963. Petrella is now sole owner of the copyright in that work.8&para;<br>In 1998, seven years after filing for renewal of the copyright in the 1963 screenplay, Petrella’s attorney informed&para;<br>MGM that Petrella had obtained the copyright to that&para;<br>screenplay. Exploitation of any derivative work, including&para;<br>Raging Bull, the attorney asserted, infringed on the copyright now vested in Petrella. During the next two years,&para;<br>counsel for Petrella and MGM exchanged letters in which&para;<br>MGM denied the validity of the infringement claims, and&para;<br>Petrella repeatedly threatened to take legal action.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, Petrella filed&para;<br>a copyright infringement suit in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Central District of California. She alleged&para;<br>that MGM violated and continued to violate her copyright&para;<br>in the 1963 screenplay by using, producing, and distributing Raging Bull, a work she described as derivative of&para;<br>the 1963 screenplay. Petrella’s complaint sought monetary and injunctive relief. Because the statute of limitations for copyright claims requires commencement of suit&para;<br>“within three years after the claim accrued,” §507(b),&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Petrella’s&para;<br>&para;<br>attorney filed the renewal application on behalf of Frank&para;<br>Petrella’s heirs. When Petrella’s mother died and her brother assigned&para;<br>his rights to her, Petrella became the sole owner of all rights in the&para;<br>1963 screenplay.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

No relief, she recognizes,&para;<br>can be awarded for infringing acts prior to that date.&para;<br>MGM moved for summary judgment on several grounds,&para;<br>among them, the equitable doctrine of laches. Petrella’s&para;<br>18-year delay, from the 1991 renewal of the copyright on&para;<br>which she relied, until 2009, when she commenced suit,&para;<br>MGM maintained, was unreasonable and prejudicial to&para;<br>MGM.

See App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 28a–48a. As to the merits of the infringement claims, the court found, disputed issues of material&para;<br>fact precluded summary adjudication. See id., at 34a–42a.&para;<br>Even so, the court held, laches barred Petrella’s complaint.&para;<br>Id., at 42a–48a. Petrella had unreasonably delayed suit&para;<br>by not filing until 2009, the court concluded, and further&para;<br>determined that MGM was prejudiced by the delay. Id., at&para;<br>42a–46a. In particular, the court stated, MGM had shown&para;<br>“expectations-based prejudice,” because the company had&para;<br>“made significant investments in exploiting the film”; in&para;<br>addition, the court accepted that MGM would encounter&para;<br>“evidentiary prejudice,” because Frank Petrella had died&para;<br>and LaMotta, then aged 88, appeared to have sustained a&para;<br>loss of memory. Id., at 44a–46a.9&para;<br>The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the laches-based dismissal. 695 F. 3d 946 (2012).&para;<br>Under Ninth Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals first&para;<br>observed, “[i]f any part of the alleged wrongful conduct&para;<br>occurred outside of the limitations period, courts presume&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 LaMotta,&para;<br>&para;<br>the court noted, “ha[d] suffered myriad blows to his head&para;<br>as a fighter years ago,” and “no longer recognize[d Petrella], even&para;<br>though he ha[d] known her for forty years.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>45a–46a.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v.

(citing §507(b)), and Petrella was aware&para;<br>of her potential claims many years earlier (as was MGM),&para;<br>id., at 952. “[T]he true cause of Petrella’s delay,” the court&para;<br>suggested, “was, as [Petrella] admits, that ‘the film hadn’t&para;<br>made money’ [in years she deferred suit].” Id., at 953.10&para;<br>Agreeing with the District Court, the Ninth Circuit determined that MGM had established expectations-based&para;<br>prejudice: the company had made a large investment in&para;<br>Raging Bull, believing it had complete ownership and&para;<br>control of the film. Id., at 953–954.11&para;<br>Judge Fletcher concurred only because Circuit precedent obliged him to do so. Id., at 958.

S. 454, 464 (1975).18 Laches, in contrast, originally&para;<br>served as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled&para;<br>the claim; it can scarcely be described as a rule for interpreting a statutory prescription. That is so here, because&para;<br>the statute, §507(b), makes the starting trigger an infringing act committed three years back from the commencement of suit, while laches, as conceived by the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit and advanced by MGM, makes the presumptive&para;<br>trigger the defendant’s initial infringing act. See 695&para;<br>F. 3d, at 951; Brief for United States 16.&para;<br>C&para;<br>MGM insists that the defense of laches must be available to prevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing&para;<br>nothing, waiting to see what the outcome of an alleged&para;<br>infringer’s investment will be.

Fan sites prompted by a book or film, for&para;<br>example, may benefit the copyright owner. See Wu, Tolerated Use, 31 Colum. J. L. &amp; Arts 617, 619–620 (2008).&para;<br>Even if an infringement is harmful, the harm may be too&para;<br>small to justify the cost of litigation.&para;<br>If the rule were, as MGM urges, “sue soon, or forever&para;<br>hold your peace,” copyright owners would have to mount a&para;<br>federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude. Section 507(b)’s three-year limitations period, however, coupled to the separate-accrual rule, see supra, at&para;<br>3–6, avoids such litigation profusion. It allows a copyright&para;<br>owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle.

Congress must have been&para;<br>aware that the passage of time and the author’s death&para;<br>could cause a loss or dilution of evidence. Congress chose,&para;<br>nonetheless, to give the author’s family “a second chance&para;<br>to obtain fair remuneration.” Stewart, 495 U.

Patry, Copyright §9.4,&para;<br>p. 9–18 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (“As in other civil litigation, a copyright owner bears the burden of establishing a&para;<br>prima facie case.”). But cf. post, at 4 (overlooking plaintiff ’s burden to show infringement and the absence of any&para;<br>burden upon the defendant “to prove that it did not infringe”). Any hindrance caused by the unavailability of&para;<br>evidence, therefore, is at least as likely to affect plaintiffs&para;<br>as it is to disadvantage defendants.

See 6 Patry §20:58, at 20–&para;<br>110 to 20–112.21 The test for estoppel is more exacting&para;<br>than the test for laches, and the two defenses are differently oriented.

S. C. §507(b). That is&para;<br>because it is a rolling limitations period, which restarts&para;<br>upon each “separate accrual” of a claim. See ante, at 5; 6&para;<br>W. Patry, Copyright §20:23, pp. 20–44 to 20–46 (2013). If&para;<br>a defendant reproduces or sells an infringing work on a&para;<br>continuing basis, a plaintiff can sue every 3 years until the&para;<br>copyright term expires—which may be up to 70 years after&para;<br>the author’s death. §302(a) (works created after January&para;<br>1, 1978, are protected until 70 years after the author’s&para;<br>death); §304(a) (works created before January 1, 1978, are&para;<br>protected for 28 years plus a 67-year renewal period). If,&para;<br>for example, a work earns no money for 20 years, but then,&para;<br>after development expenses have been incurred, it earns&para;<br>profits for the next 30, a plaintiff can sue in year 21 and at&para;<br>regular 3-year intervals thereafter. Each time the plaintiff will collect the defendant’s profits earned during the&para;<br>prior three years, unless he settles for a lump sum along&para;<br>the way. The defendant will recoup no more than his&para;<br>outlays and any “elements of profit attributable to factors&para;<br>other than the copyrighted work.” §§504(a)(1), (b).&para;<br>A 20-year delay in bringing suit could easily prove&para;<br>inequitable. Suppose, for example, the plaintiff has deliberately waited for the death of witnesses who might prove&para;<br>the existence of understandings about a license to reproduce the copyrighted work, or who might show that the&para;<br>plaintiff ’s work was in fact derived from older copyrighted&para;<br>materials that the defendant has licensed. Or, suppose&para;<br>the plaintiff has delayed in bringing suit because he wants&para;<br>to avoid bargaining with the defendant up front over a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>license. He knows that if he delays legal action, and the&para;<br>defendant invests time, effort, and resources into making&para;<br>the derivative product, the plaintiff will be in a much&para;<br>stronger position to obtain favorable licensing terms&para;<br>through settlement. Or, suppose the plaintiff has waited&para;<br>until he becomes certain that the defendant’s production&para;<br>bet paid off, that the derivative work did and would continue to earn money, and that the plaintiff has a chance of&para;<br>obtaining, say, an 80% share of what is now a 90% pure&para;<br>profit stream. (N. B. The plaintiff ’s profits recovery will&para;<br>be reduced by any “deductible expenses” incurred by the&para;<br>defendant in producing the work, and by any “elements of&para;<br>profits attributable to factors other than the copyrighted&para;<br>work,” §504(b)). Or, suppose that all of these circumstances&para;<br>exist together.&para;<br>Cases that present these kinds of delays are not imaginary. One can easily find examples from the lower courts&para;<br>where plaintiffs have brought claims years after they&para;<br>accrued and where delay-related inequity resulted.

The petitioner claims&para;<br>the MGM film Raging Bull violated a copyright originally&para;<br>owned by her father, which she inherited and then renewed in 1991. She waited 18 years after renewing the&para;<br>copyright, until 2009, to bring suit. During those 18 years,&para;<br>MGM spent millions of dollars developing different editions of, and marketing, the film. See App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 13a. MGM also entered into numerous licensing&para;<br>agreements, some of which allowed television networks to&para;<br>broadcast the film through 2015. Id., at 14a. Meanwhile,&para;<br>three key witness died or became unavailable, making it&para;<br>more difficult for MGM to prove that it did not infringe the&para;<br>petitioner’s copyright (either because the 1963 screenplay&para;<br>was in fact derived from a different book, the rights to&para;<br>which MGM owned under a nonchallenged license, or&para;<br>because MGM held a license to the screenplay under a&para;<br>1976 agreement that it signed with Jake LaMotta, who&para;<br>coauthored the screenplay with the petitioner’s father, see&para;<br>id. at 3a, 5a; App. 128–129, 257–258, 266–267). Consequently, I believe the Court of Appeals acted lawfully in&para;<br>dismissing the suit due to laches.&para;<br>Long delays do not automatically prove inequity, but,&para;<br>depending upon the circumstances, they raise that possibility. Indeed, suppose that that the copyright-holders in&para;<br>the song cases cited above, or their heirs, facing sudden&para;<br>revivals in demand or eventual deaths of witnesses, had&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>brought their claims 50, or even 60 years after those&para;<br>claims first accrued. Or suppose that the loss of evidence&para;<br>was clearly critical to the defendants’ abilities to prove&para;<br>their cases. The Court holds that insofar as a copyright&para;<br>claim seeks damages, a court cannot ever apply laches,&para;<br>irrespective of the length of the plaintiff ’s delay, the&para;<br>amount of the harm that it caused, or the inequity of&para;<br>permitting the action to go forward.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Why should laches not be available in an appropriate&para;<br>case? Consider the reasons the majority offers. First, the&para;<br>majority says that the 3-year “copyright statute of limitations . . . itself takes account of delay,” and so additional&para;<br>safeguards like laches are not needed. Ante, at 11. I agree&para;<br>that sometimes that is so. But I also fear that sometimes&para;<br>it is not. The majority correctly points out that the limitations period limits the retrospective relief a plaintiff can&para;<br>recover. It imposes a cap equal to the profits earned during the prior three years, in addition to any actual damages&para;<br>sustained during this time. Ibid.; §504(b). Thus, if the&para;<br>plaintiff waits from, say, 1980 until 2001 to bring suit, she&para;<br>cannot recover profits for the 1980 to 1998 period. But she&para;<br>can recover the defendant’s profits from 1998 through&para;<br>2001, which might be precisely when net revenues turned&para;<br>positive. And she can sue every three years thereafter&para;<br>until the copyright expires, perhaps in the year 2060. If&para;<br>the plaintiff ’s suit involves the type of inequitable circumstances I have described, her ability to recover profits from&para;<br>1998 to 2001 and until the copyright expires could be just&para;<br>the kind of unfairness that laches is designed to prevent.&para;<br>Second, the majority points out that the plaintiff can&para;<br>recover only the defendant’s profits less “ ‘deductible expenses’ incurred in generating those profits.” Ante, at 12&para;<br>(quoting §504(b)). In other words, the majority takes&para;<br>assurance from the fact that the Act enables the defendant&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to recoup his outlays in developing or selling the allegedly&para;<br>infringing work. Again, sometimes that fact will prevent&para;<br>inequitable results. But sometimes it will not. A plaintiff ’s delay may mean that the defendant has already&para;<br>recovered the majority of his expenses, and what is left is&para;<br>primarily profit. It may mean that the defendant has&para;<br>dedicated decades of his life to producing the work, such&para;<br>that the loss of a future profit stream (even if he can recover past expenses) is tantamount to the loss of any&para;<br>income in later years. And in circumstances such as those&para;<br>described, it could prove inequitable to give the profit to a&para;<br>plaintiff who has unnecessarily delayed in filing an action.&para;<br>Simply put, the “deductible expenses” provision does not&para;<br>protect the defendant from the potential inequity highlighted by Judge Hand nearly 100 years ago in his influential copyright opinion. That is, it does not stop a&para;<br>copyright-holder (or his heirs) from “stand[ing] inactive&para;<br>while the proposed infringer spends large sums of money”&para;<br>in a risky venture; appearing on the scene only when the&para;<br>venture has proved a success; and thereby collecting substantially more money than he could have obtained at the&para;<br>outset, had he bargained with the investor over a license&para;<br>and royalty fee. Haas, 234 F., at 108. But cf. id., at 108–&para;<br>109 (plaintiff to receive injunctive relief since one of the&para;<br>defendants was a “deliberate pirate,” but profit award to&para;<br>be potentially reduced in light of laches).&para;<br>Third, the majority says that “[i]nviting individual&para;<br>judges to set a time limit other than the one Congress&para;<br>prescribed” in the Copyright Act would “tug against the&para;<br>uniformity Congress sought to achieve when it enacted&para;<br>§507(b).” Ante, at 15. But why does the majority believe&para;<br>that part of what Congress intended to “achieve” was the&para;<br>elimination of the equitable defense of laches? As the&para;<br>majority recognizes, Congress enacted a uniform statute of&para;<br>limitations for copyright claims in 1957 so that federal&para;<br>courts, in determining timeliness, no longer had to borrow&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>from state law which varied from place to place. See ante,&para;<br>at 3–4. Nothing in the 1957 Act—or anywhere else in the&para;<br>text of the copyright statute—indicates that Congress also&para;<br>sought to bar the operation of laches. The Copyright Act&para;<br>is silent on the subject. And silence is consistent, not&para;<br>inconsistent, with the application of equitable doctrines.&para;<br>For one thing, the legislative history for §507 shows that&para;<br>Congress chose not to “specifically enumerat[e] certain&para;<br>equitable considerations which might be advanced in&para;<br>connection with civil copyright actions” because it understood that “ ‘[f]ederal district courts, generally, recognize&para;<br>these equitable defenses anyway.’ ” S. Rep. No. 1014, 85th&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., 2–3 (1957) (quoting the House Judiciary&para;<br>Committee). Courts prior to 1957 had often applied laches&para;<br>in federal copyright cases. See, e.g., Callaghan v. Myers,&para;<br>128 U. S. 617, 658–659 (1888) (assuming laches was an&para;<br>available defense in a copyright suit); Edwin L. Wiegand&para;<br>Co. v. Harold E. Trent Co., 122 F. 2d 920, 925 (CA3 1941)&para;<br>(applying laches to bar a copyright suit); D. O. Haynes &amp;&para;<br>Co. v. Druggists’ Circular, 32 F. 2d 215, 216–218 (CA2&para;<br>1929) (same). Congress expected they would continue to&para;<br>do so.&para;<br>Furthermore, this Court has held that federal courts&para;<br>may “appl[y] equitable doctrines that may toll or limit the&para;<br>time period” for suit when applying a statute of limitations, because a statutory “filing period” is a “requirement”&para;<br>subject to adjustment “ ‘when equity so requires.’ ” Morgan, 536 U. S., at 121–122 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World&para;<br>Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 398 (1982); emphasis added).&para;<br>This Court has read laches into statutes of limitations&para;<br>otherwise silent on the topic of equitable doctrines in a&para;<br>multitude of contexts, as have lower courts. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Morgan, supra, at 121 (“an employer may raise a laches&para;<br>defense” under Title VII); Bay Area Laundry and Dry&para;<br>Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522&para;<br>U. S. 192, 205 (1997) (similar, in respect to suits under the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980&para;<br>(MPPAA)); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136,&para;<br>155 (1967) (similar, in respect to an action for declaratory&para;<br>and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure&para;<br>Act); Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309, 319–320 (1904)&para;<br>(similar, in the case of a property action brought within&para;<br>New Mexico’s statute of limitations); Alsop v. Riker, 155&para;<br>U. S. 448, 460 (1894) (holding that “independently of the&para;<br>statute of limitations,” the contract action was barred&para;<br>“because of laches”); Teamsters &amp; Employers Welfare Trust&para;<br>of Ill. v. Gorman Bros. Ready Mix, 283 F. 3d 877, 883 (CA7&para;<br>2002) (laches available “in a suit against an [Employee&para;<br>Retirement Income Security Act of 1974] (ERISA)] plan for&para;<br>benefits”); Hot Wax, Inc. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 191 F. 3d 813,&para;<br>822–823 (CA7 1999) (laches available in a Lanham Act&para;<br>suit filed within the limitations period). Unless Congress&para;<br>indicates otherwise, courts normally assume that equitable rules continue to operate alongside limitations periods,&para;<br>and that equity applies both to plaintiffs and to defendants. See Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501&para;<br>U. S. 104, 108 (1991) (“Congress is understood to legislate&para;<br>against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles” and to incorporate them “except when a statutory&para;<br>purpose to the contrary is evident” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and citation omitted)); Porter v. Warner Holding&para;<br>Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946) (“Unless otherwise provided&para;<br>by statute, all the inherent equitable powers of the District Court are available for the proper and complete&para;<br>exercise of that jurisdiction”).&para;<br>The Court today comes to a different conclusion. It&para;<br>reads §507(b)’s silence as preserving doctrines that&para;<br>lengthen the period for suit when equitable considerations&para;<br>favor the plaintiff (e.g., equitable tolling), but as foreclosing a doctrine that would shorten the period when equity&para;<br>favors the defendant (i.e., laches). See ante, at 15–16, 19–&para;<br>20. I do not understand the logic of reading a silent stat-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ute in this manner.&para;<br>Fourth, the majority defends its rule by observing that&para;<br>laches was “developed by courts of equity,” and that this&para;<br>Court has “cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal&para;<br>relief ” even following the merger of law and equity in&para;<br>1938. Ante, at 12–13. The majority refers to three cases&para;<br>that offer support for this proposition, but none is determinative. In the first, Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S.&para;<br>392 (1946), the Court said:&para;<br>“If Congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for&para;<br>enforcing a right which it created, there is an end of&para;<br>the matter.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“Traditionally and for good reasons, statutes of limitation are not controlling measures of equitable relief.”&para;<br>Id., at 395–396.&para;<br>This statement, however, constituted part of the Court’s&para;<br>explanation as to why a federal statute, silent about limitations, should be applied consistently with “historic principles of equity in the enforcement of federally-created&para;<br>equitable rights” rather than with New York’s statute of&para;<br>limitations. Id., at 395. The case had nothing to do with&para;<br>whether laches governs in actions at law. The lawsuit in&para;<br>Holmberg had been brought “in equity,” and the Court&para;<br>remanded for a determination of whether the petitioners&para;<br>were “chargeable with laches.” Id., at 393, 397.&para;<br>The second case the majority cites, Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. 633 (2010), provides some additional support, but not much. There, the Court cited a 1935 case for&para;<br>the proposition that “ ‘[l]aches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law.’ ” Id., at 652 (quoting United States v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935)). But&para;<br>Merck concerned a federal securities statute that contained both a 2-year statute of limitations, running from&para;<br>the time of “discovery,” and a 5-year statute of repose,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>running from the time of a “violation.” Id., at 638 (citing&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1658(b)). Given that repose statutes set “an&para;<br>outside limit” on suit and are generally “inconsistent with&para;<br>tolling” and similar equitable doctrines, the Court held&para;<br>that the 2-year limitations period at issue was not subject&para;<br>to an “inquiry notice” rule or, by analogy, to laches. Lampf,&para;<br>Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.&para;<br>350, 363 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation&para;<br>omitted); Merck, supra, at 650–652. Merck did not suggest&para;<br>that statutes of limitations are always or normally inconsistent with equitable doctrines when plaintiffs seek damages. It simply found additional support for its conclusion&para;<br>in a case that this Court decided before the merger of law&para;<br>and equity. And here, unlike in Merck, the statute of&para;<br>limitations is not accompanied by a corollary statute of&para;<br>repose.&para;<br>Third, in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of&para;<br>N. Y., 470 U. S. 226 (1985), the Court said in a footnote&para;<br>that “application of the equitable defense of laches in an&para;<br>action at law would be novel indeed.” Id., at 245, n. 16.&para;<br>This statement was made in light of special policies related to Indian tribes, which the Court went on to discuss in&para;<br>the following sentences. Ibid. In any event, Oneida did&para;<br>not resolve whether laches was available to the defendants, for the lower court had not ruled on the issue. Id., at&para;<br>244–245.&para;<br>In sum, there is no reason to believe that the Court&para;<br>meant any of its statements in Holmberg, Merck, or Oneida&para;<br>to announce a general rule about the availability of&para;<br>laches in actions for legal relief, whenever Congress provides a statute of limitations. To the contrary, the Court&para;<br>has said more than once that a defendant could invoke&para;<br>laches in an action for damages (even though no assertion&para;<br>of the defense had actually been made in the case), despite&para;<br>a fixed statute of limitations. See Morgan, 536 U. S., at&para;<br>116–119, 121–122 (laches available in hostile work envi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ronment claims seeking damages under Title VII); Bay&para;<br>Area Laundry, 522 U. S., at 205 (laches available in actions for “withdrawal liability assessment[s]” under the&para;<br>MPPAA). Lower courts have come to similar holdings in a&para;<br>wide array of circumstances—often approving not only of&para;<br>the availability of the laches defense, but of its application&para;<br>to the case at hand. E.g., Cayuga Indian Nation of N. Y. v.&para;<br>Pataki, 413 F. 3d 266, 274–277 (CA2 2005) (laches available in a “possessory land claim” in which the District&para;<br>Court awarded damages, whether “characterized as an&para;<br>action at law or in equity,” and dismissing the action due&para;<br>to laches); Teamsters, 283 F. 3d, at 881–883 (laches available in suits under ERISA for benefits, but not warranted&para;<br>in that case); Hot Wax, 191 F. 3d, at 822–827 (“[T]he application of the doctrine of laches to Hot Wax’s Lanham&para;<br>Act claims [requesting damages] by the district court was&para;<br>proper”); A. C. Aukerman Co. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co.,&para;<br>960 F. 2d 1020, 1030–1032, 1045–1046 (CAFed 1992) (en&para;<br>banc) (laches available in patent suit claiming damages,&para;<br>and remanding for whether the defense was successful);&para;<br>Cornetta v. United States, 851 F. 2d 1372, 1376–1383&para;<br>(CAFed 1988) (en banc) (same, in suit seeking backpay).&para;<br>Even if we focus only upon federal copyright litigation,&para;<br>four of the six Circuits to have considered the matter have&para;<br>held that laches can bar claims for legal relief. See 695&para;<br>F. 3d 946, 956 (CA9 2012) (case below, barring all copyright claims due to laches); Peter Letterese &amp; Assocs., Inc.&para;<br>v. World Inst. of Scientology Enterprises, Int’l, 533 F. 3d&para;<br>1287, 1319–1322 (CA11 2008) (laches can bar copyright&para;<br>claims for retrospective damages); Chirco, 474 F. 3d, at&para;<br>234–236 (“laches can be argued ‘regardless of whether the&para;<br>suit is at law or in equity,’ ” and holding that while the&para;<br>plaintiffs could obtain damages and an injunction, their&para;<br>request for additional equitable relief “smack[ed] of the&para;<br>inequity against which Judge Hand cautioned in Haas and&para;<br>which the judicial system should abhor” (quoting Team-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sters, supra, at 881)); Jacobsen v. Deseret Book Co., 287 F.&para;<br>3d 936, 950–951 (CA10 2002) (laches available in “ ‘rare&para;<br>cases,’ ” and failing to draw a distinction in the type of&para;<br>remedy sought (citation omitted). But see New Era Publications Int’l v. Henry Holt &amp; Co., 873 F. 2d 576, 584–585&para;<br>(CA2 1989) (laches can bar claims for injunctive relief, but&para;<br>not damages, under the Copyright Act); Lyons Partnership, L. P. v. Morris Costumes, Inc., 243 F. 3d 789, 798–&para;<br>799 (CA4 2001) (laches unavailable in copyright cases&para;<br>altogether).&para;<br>Perhaps more importantly, in permitting laches to apply&para;<br>to copyright claims seeking equitable relief but not to&para;<br>those seeking legal relief, the majority places insufficient&para;<br>weight upon the rules and practice of modern litigation.&para;<br>Since 1938, Congress and the Federal Rules have replaced&para;<br>what would once have been actions “at law” and actions&para;<br>“in equity” with the “civil action.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 2&para;<br>(“There is one form of action—the civil action”). A federal&para;<br>civil action is subject to both equitable and legal defenses.&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1) (“In responding to a pleading, a&para;<br>party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including: . . . estoppel . . . laches . . . [and]&para;<br>statute of limitations”). Accordingly, since 1938, federal&para;<br>courts have frequently allowed defendants to assert what&para;<br>were formerly equitable defenses—including laches—in&para;<br>what were formerly legal actions. See supra, at 10–11&para;<br>(citing cases). Why should copyright be treated differently? Indeed, the majority concedes that “restitutional&para;<br>remedies” like “profits” (which are often claimed in copyright cases) defy clear classification as “equitable” or&para;<br>“legal.” Ante, at 2, n. 1 (internal quotation marks omitted). Why should lower courts have to make these uneasy&para;<br>and unnatural distinctions?&para;<br>Fifth, the majority believes it can prevent the inequities&para;<br>that laches seeks to avoid through the use of a different&para;<br>doctrine, namely equitable estoppel. Ante, at 19. I doubt&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that is so. As the majority recognizes, “the two defenses&para;<br>are differently oriented.” Ibid. The “gravamen” of estoppel is a misleading representation by the plaintiff that the&para;<br>defendant relies on to his detriment. 6 Patry, Copyright&para;<br>§20:58, at 20–110 to 20–112. The gravamen of laches is&para;<br>the plaintiff ’s unreasonable delay, and the consequent&para;<br>prejudice to the defendant. Id., §20:54, at 20–96. Where&para;<br>due to the passage of time, evidence favorable to the defense has disappeared or the defendant has continued to&para;<br>invest in a derivative work, what misleading representation by the plaintiff is there to estop?&para;<br>In sum, as the majority says, the doctrine of laches may&para;<br>occupy only a “ ‘little place’ ” in a regime based upon statutes of limitations. Ante, at 20 (quoting 1 D. Dobbs, Law&para;<br>of Remedies §2.6(1), p. 152 (2d ed. 1993)). But that place&para;<br>is an important one. In those few and unusual cases&para;<br>where a plaintiff unreasonably delays in bringing suit and&para;<br>consequently causes inequitable harm to the defendant,&para;<br>the doctrine permits a court to bring about a fair result. I&para;<br>see no reason to erase the doctrine from copyright’s lexicon, not even in respect to limitations periods applicable to&para;<br>damages actions.&para;<br>Consequently, with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
