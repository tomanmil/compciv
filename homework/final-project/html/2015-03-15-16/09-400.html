PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–400.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 2, 2010—Decided March 1, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>While employed as an angiography technician by respondent Proctor&para;<br>Hospital, petitioner Staub was a member of the United States Army&para;<br>Reserve. Both his immediate supervisor (Mulally) and Mulally’s su&para;<br>pervisor (Korenchuk) were hostile to his military obligations. Mu&para;<br>lally gave Staub disciplinary warning which included a directive re&para;<br>quiring Staub to report to her or Korenchuk when his cases were&para;<br>completed. After receiving a report from Korenchuk that Staub had&para;<br>violated the Corrective Action, Proctor’s vice president of human re&para;<br>sources (Buck) reviewed Staub’s personnel file and decided to fire&para;<br>him. Staub filed a grievance, claiming that Mulally had fabricated&para;<br>the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his&para;<br>military obligations, but Buck adhered to her decision. Staub sued&para;<br>Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemploy&para;<br>ment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which forbids an employer to&para;<br>deny “employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promo&para;<br>tion, or any benefit of employment” based on a person’s “membership”&para;<br>in or “obligation to perform service in a uniformed service,” 38&para;<br>U. S. C. §4311(a), and provides that liability is established “if the&para;<br>person’s membership . . . is a motivating factor in the employer’s ac&para;<br>tion,” §4311(c). He contended not that Buck was motivated by hostil&para;<br>ity to his military obligations, but that Mulally and Korenchuk were,&para;<br>and that their actions influenced Buck’s decision. A jury found Proc&para;<br>tor liable and awarded Staub damages, but the Seventh Circuit re&para;<br>versed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of&para;<br>law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than Mulally’s and&para;<br>Korenchuk’s advice in making her decision.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary ani&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>mus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employ&para;<br>ment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate em&para;<br>ployment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA. In con&para;<br>struing the phrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action,” this&para;<br>Court starts from the premise that when Congress creates a federal&para;<br>tort it adopts the background of general tort law. See, e.g., Burling&para;<br>ton N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Intentional&para;<br>torts such as the one here “generally require that the actor intend&para;<br>‘the consequences’ of an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau&para;<br>v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62. However, Proctor errs in contending&para;<br>that an employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker is&para;<br>motivated by discriminatory animus. So long as the earlier agent in&para;<br>tended, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he&para;<br>has the scienter required for USERRA liability. Moreover, it is axio&para;<br>matic under tort law that the decisionmaker’s exercise of judgment&para;<br>does not prevent the earlier agent’s action from being the proximate&para;<br>cause of the harm. See Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559&para;<br>U. S. 1, ___. Nor can the ultimate decisionmaker’s judgment be&para;<br>deemed a superseding cause of the harm. See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v.&para;<br>Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837. Proctor’s approach would have an im&para;<br>probable consequence: If an employer isolates a personnel official&para;<br>from its supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment&para;<br>actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employee’s&para;<br>personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer&para;<br>will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommen&para;<br>dations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce&para;<br>the adverse action. Proctor also errs in arguing that a decision&para;<br>maker’s independent investigation, and rejection, of an employee’s&para;<br>discriminatory animus allegations should negate the effect of the&para;<br>prior discrimination. Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>2. Applying this analysis here, the Seventh Circuit erred in holding&para;<br>that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Both Mu&para;<br>lally and Korenchuk acted within the scope of their employment&para;<br>when they took the actions that allegedly caused Buck to fire Staub.&para;<br>There was also evidence that their actions were motivated by hostil&para;<br>ity toward Staub’s military obligations, and that those actions were&para;<br>causal factors underlying Buck’s decision. Finally, there was evi&para;<br>dence that both Mulally and Korenchuk had the specific intent to&para;<br>cause Staub’s termination. The Seventh Circuit is to consider in the&para;<br>first instance whether the variance between the jury instruction&para;<br>given at trial and the rule adopted here was harmless error or should&para;<br>mandate a new trial.

Staub and Proctor hotly dispute the&para;<br>facts surrounding the firing, but because a jury found for&para;<br>Staub in his claim of employment discrimination against&para;<br>Proctor, we describe the facts viewed in the light most&para;<br>favorable to him.&para;<br>While employed by Proctor, Staub was a member of the&para;<br>United States Army Reserve, which required him to at&para;<br>tend drill one weekend per month and to train full time for&para;<br>two to three weeks a year. Both Janice Mulally, Staub’s&para;<br>immediate supervisor, and Michael Korenchuk, Mulally’s&para;<br>supervisor, were hostile to Staub’s military obligations.&para;<br>Mulally scheduled Staub for additional shifts without&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>notice so that he would “ ‘pa[y] back the department for&para;<br>everyone else having to bend over backwards to cover [his]&para;<br>schedule for the Reserves.’ ” 560 F. 3d 647, 652 (CA7&para;<br>2009). She also informed Staub’s co-worker, Leslie Swe&para;<br>borg, that Staub’s “ ‘military duty had been a strain on&para;<br>th[e] department,’ ” and asked Sweborg to help her “ ‘get&para;<br>rid of him.’ ” Ibid. Korenchuk referred to Staub’s military&para;<br>obligations as “ ‘a b[u]nch of smoking and joking and [a]&para;<br>waste of taxpayers[’] money.’ ” Ibid. He was also aware&para;<br>that Mulally was “ ‘out to get’ ” Staub. Ibid.&para;<br>In January 2004, Mulally issued Staub a “Corrective&para;<br>Action” disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a&para;<br>company rule requiring him to stay in his work area&para;<br>whenever he was not working with a patient. The Correc&para;<br>tive Action included a directive requiring Staub to report&para;<br>to Mulally or Korenchuk “ ‘when [he] ha[d] no patients and&para;<br>[the angio] cases [we]re complete[d].’ ” Id., at 653. Accord&para;<br>ing to Staub, Mulally’s justification for the Corrective&para;<br>Action was false for two reasons: First, the company rule&para;<br>invoked by Mulally did not exist; and second, even if it did,&para;<br>Staub did not violate it.&para;<br>On April 2, 2004, Angie Day, Staub’s co-worker, com&para;<br>plained to Linda Buck, Proctor’s vice president of human&para;<br>resources, and Garrett McGowan, Proctor’s chief operating&para;<br>officer, about Staub’s frequent unavailability and abrupt&para;<br>ness. McGowan directed Korenchuk and Buck to create a&para;<br>plan that would solve Staub’s “ ‘availability’ problems.”&para;<br>Id., at 654. But three weeks later, before they had time to&para;<br>do so, Korenchuk informed Buck that Staub had left his&para;<br>desk without informing a supervisor, in violation of the&para;<br>January Corrective Action. Staub now contends this&para;<br>accusation was false: he had left Korenchuk a voice-mail&para;<br>notification that he was leaving his desk. Buck relied on&para;<br>Korenchuk’s accusation, however, and after reviewing&para;<br>Staub’s personnel file, she decided to fire him. The termi&para;<br>nation notice stated that Staub had ignored the directive&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issued in the January 2004 Corrective Action.&para;<br>Staub challenged his firing through Proctor’s grievance&para;<br>process, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allega&para;<br>tion underlying the Corrective Action out of hostility&para;<br>toward his military obligations. Buck did not follow&para;<br>up with Mulally about this claim. After discussing the&para;<br>matter with another personnel officer, Buck adhered to&para;<br>her decision.&para;<br>Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Em&para;<br>ployment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38&para;<br>U. S. C. §4301 et seq., claiming that his discharge was&para;<br>motivated by hostility to his obligations as a military&para;<br>reservist. His contention was not that Buck had any such&para;<br>hostility but that Mulally and Korenchuk did, and that&para;<br>their actions influenced Buck’s ultimate employment&para;<br>decision. A jury found that Staub’s “military status was a&para;<br>motivating factor in [Proctor’s] decision to discharge him,”&para;<br>App. 68a, and awarded $57,640 in damages.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was&para;<br>entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 560 F. 3d 647.&para;<br>The court observed that Staub had brought a “ ‘cat’s paw’&para;<br>case,” meaning that he sought to hold his employer liable&para;<br>for the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with&para;<br>making the ultimate employment decision. Id., at 655–&para;<br>656.1 It explained that under Seventh Circuit precedent, a&para;<br>“cat’s paw” case could not succeed unless the nondecision&para;<br>maker exercised such “ ‘singular influence’ ” over the deci&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The term “cat’s paw” derives from a fable conceived by Aesop, put&para;<br>into verse by La Fontaine in 1679, and injected into United States&para;<br>employment discrimination law by Posner in 1990. See Shager v.&para;<br>Upjohn Co., 913 F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7). In the fable, a monkey induces a&para;<br>cat by flattery to extract roasting chestnuts from the fire. After the cat&para;<br>has done so, burning its paws in the process, the monkey makes off&para;<br>with the chestnuts and leaves the cat with nothing. A coda to the fable&para;<br>(relevant only marginally, if at all, to employment law) observes that&para;<br>the cat is similar to princes who, flattered by the king, perform services&para;<br>on the king’s behalf and receive no reward.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product&para;<br>of “blind reliance.” Id., at 659. It then noted that “Buck&para;<br>looked beyond what Mulally and Korenchuk said,” relying&para;<br>in part on her conversation with Day and her review of&para;<br>Staub’s personnel file. Ibid. The court “admit[ted] that&para;<br>Buck’s investigation could have been more robust,” since it&para;<br>“failed to pursue Staub’s theory that Mulally fabricated&para;<br>the write-up.” Ibid. But the court said that the “ ‘singular&para;<br>influence’ ” rule “does not require the decisionmaker to be&para;<br>a paragon of independence”: “It is enough that the deci&para;<br>sionmaker is not wholly dependent on a single source of&para;<br>information and conducts her own investigation into the&para;<br>facts relevant to the decision.” Ibid. (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Because the undisputed evidence estab&para;<br>lished that Buck was not wholly dependent on the advice&para;<br>of Korenchuk and Mulally, the court held that Proctor was&para;<br>entitled to judgment. Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemploy&para;<br>ment Rights Act (USERRA) provides in relevant part as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“A person who is a member of . . . or has an obliga&para;<br>tion to perform service in a uniformed service shall&para;<br>not be denied initial employment, reemployment, re&para;<br>tention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of&para;<br>employment by an employer on the basis of that&para;<br>membership, . . . or obligation.” 38 U. S. C. §4311(a).&para;<br>It elaborates further:&para;<br>“An employer shall be considered to have engaged&para;<br>in actions prohibited . . . under subsection (a), if the&para;<br>person’s membership . . . is a motivating factor in the&para;<br>employer’s action, unless the employer can prove that&para;<br>the action would have been taken in the absence of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>such membership.” §4311(c).&para;<br>The statute is very similar to Title VII, which prohibits&para;<br>employment discrimination “because of . . . race, color,&para;<br>religion, sex, or national origin” and states that such&para;<br>discrimination is established when one of those factors&para;<br>“was a motivating factor for any employment practice,&para;<br>even though other factors also motivated the practice.” 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §§2000e–2(a), (m).&para;<br>The central difficulty in this case is construing the&para;<br>phrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action.” When&para;<br>the company official who makes the decision to take an&para;<br>adverse employment action is personally acting out of&para;<br>hostility to the employee’s membership in or obligation to&para;<br>a uniformed service, a motivating factor obviously exists.&para;<br>The problem we confront arises when that official has no&para;<br>discriminatory animus but is influenced by previous com&para;<br>pany action that is the product of a like animus in some&para;<br>one else.&para;<br>In approaching this question, we start from the premise&para;<br>that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the&para;<br>background of general tort law. See Burlington N. &amp; S.&para;<br>F. R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip&para;<br>op., at 13–14); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S.&para;<br>47, 68–69 (2007); Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,&para;<br>524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998). Intentional torts such as this,&para;<br>“as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts, . . .&para;<br>generally require that the actor intend ‘the consequences’&para;<br>of an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau v. Gei&para;<br>ger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62 (1998).&para;<br>Staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry&para;<br>on the plaintiff’s personnel record was caused to be put&para;<br>there, with discriminatory animus, by Mulally and Koren&para;<br>chuk, suffices to establish the tort, even if Mulally and&para;<br>Korenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal. But&para;<br>discrimination was no part of Buck’s reason for the dis&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>missal; and while Korenchuk and Mulally acted with&para;<br>discriminatory animus, the act they committed—the mere&para;<br>making of the reports—was not a denial of “initial em&para;<br>ployment, reemployment, retention in employment, pro&para;<br>motion, or any benefit of employment,” as liability under&para;<br>USERRA requires. If dismissal was not the object of&para;<br>Mulally’s and Korenchuk’s reports, it may have been&para;<br>their result, or even their foreseeable consequence, but&para;<br>that is not enough to render Mulally or Korenchuk&para;<br>responsible.&para;<br>Here, however, Staub is seeking to hold liable not Mu&para;<br>lally and Korenchuk, but their employer. Perhaps, there&para;<br>fore, the discriminatory motive of one of the employer’s&para;<br>agents (Mulally or Korenchuk) can be aggregated with the&para;<br>act of another agent (Buck) to impose liability on Proctor.&para;<br>Again we consult general principles of law, agency law,&para;<br>which form the background against which federal tort&para;<br>laws are enacted. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285&para;<br>(2003); Burlington, supra, at 754–755. Here, however, the&para;<br>answer is not so clear. The Restatement of Agency sug&para;<br>gests that the malicious mental state of one agent cannot&para;<br>generally be combined with the harmful action of another&para;<br>agent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires&para;<br>both. See Restatement (Second) Agency §275, Illustration&para;<br>4 (1958). Some of the cases involving federal torts apply&para;<br>that rule. See United States v. Science Applications Int’l&para;<br>Corp., 626 F. 3d 1257, 1273–1276 (CADC 2010); Chaney v.&para;<br>Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F. 3d 219, 241 (CA5 2010);&para;<br>United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 566 F. 3d 1095,&para;<br>1122 (CADC 2009). But another case involving a federal&para;<br>tort, and one involving a federal crime, hold to the con&para;<br>trary. See United States ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse&para;<br>Savannah River Co., 352 F. 3d 908, 918–919 (CA4 2003);&para;<br>United States v. Bank of New England, N. A., 821 F. 2d&para;<br>844, 856 (CA1 1987). Ultimately, we think it unnecessary&para;<br>in this case to decide what the background rule of agency&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law may be, since the former line of authority is suggested&para;<br>by the governing text, which requires that discrimination&para;<br>be “a motivating factor” in the adverse action. When a&para;<br>decision to fire is made with no unlawful animus on the&para;<br>part of the firing agent, but partly on the basis of a report&para;<br>prompted (unbeknownst to that agent) by discrimination,&para;<br>discrimination might perhaps be called a “factor” or a&para;<br>“causal factor” in the decision; but it seems to us a consid&para;<br>erable stretch to call it “a motivating factor.”&para;<br>Proctor, on the other hand, contends that the employer&para;<br>is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker (the techni&para;<br>cal decisionmaker or the agent for whom he is the “cat’s&para;<br>paw”) is motivated by discriminatory animus. This avoids&para;<br>the aggregation of animus and adverse action, but it&para;<br>seems to us not the only application of general tort law&para;<br>that can do so. Animus and responsibility for the adverse&para;<br>action can both be attributed to the earlier agent (here,&para;<br>Staub’s supervisors) if the adverse action is the intended&para;<br>consequence of that agent’s discriminatory conduct. So&para;<br>long as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that&para;<br>the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be&para;<br>liable under USERRA. And it is axiomatic under tort law&para;<br>that the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does&para;<br>not prevent the earlier agent’s action (and hence the ear&para;<br>lier agent’s discriminatory animus) from being the proxi&para;<br>mate cause of the harm. Proximate cause requires only&para;<br>“some direct relation between the injury asserted and the&para;<br>injurious conduct alleged,” and excludes only those “link[s]&para;<br>that are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.” Hemi&para;<br>Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U. S. 1, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).2 We do&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Under the traditional doctrine of proximate cause, a tortfeasor is&para;<br>sometimes, but not always, liable when he intends to cause an adverse&para;<br>action and a different adverse action results. See Restatement (Second)&para;<br>Torts §§435, 435B and Comment a (1963 and 1964). That issue is not&para;<br>presented in this case since the record contains no evidence that Mu&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not think that the ultimate decisionmaker’s exercise of&para;<br>judgment automatically renders the link to the supervi&para;<br>sor’s bias “remote” or “purely contingent.” The decision&para;<br>maker’s exercise of judgment is also a proximate cause of&para;<br>the employment decision, but it is common for injuries to&para;<br>have multiple proximate causes. See Sosa v. AlvarezMachain, 542 U. S. 692, 704 (2004). Nor can the ultimate&para;<br>decisionmaker’s judgment be deemed a superseding cause&para;<br>of the harm. A cause can be thought “superseding” only if&para;<br>it is a “cause of independent origin that was not foresee&para;<br>able.” Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837&para;<br>(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives&para;<br>an unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent&para;<br>employer discrimination. An employer’s authority to&para;<br>reward, punish, or dismiss is often allocated among multi&para;<br>ple agents. The one who makes the ultimate decision does&para;<br>so on the basis of performance assessments by other su&para;<br>pervisors. Proctor’s view would have the improbable&para;<br>consequence that if an employer isolates a personnel&para;<br>official from an employee’s supervisors, vests the decision&para;<br>to take adverse employment actions in that official, and&para;<br>asks that official to review the employee’s personnel file&para;<br>before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be&para;<br>effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recom&para;<br>mendations of supervisors that were designed and in&para;<br>tended to produce the adverse action. That seems to us an&para;<br>implausible meaning of the text, and one that is not com&para;<br>pelled by its words.&para;<br>Proctor suggests that even if the decisionmaker’s mere&para;<br>exercise of independent judgment does not suffice to ne&para;<br>gate the effect of the prior discrimination, at least the&para;<br>decisionmaker’s independent investigation (and rejection)&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>lally or Korenchuk intended any particular adverse action other than&para;<br>&para;<br>Staub’s termination.&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of the employee’s allegations of discriminatory animus&para;<br>ought to do so. We decline to adopt such a hard-and-fast&para;<br>rule. As we have already acknowledged, the requirement&para;<br>that the biased supervisor’s action be a causal factor of the&para;<br>ultimate employment action incorporates the traditional&para;<br>tort-law concept of proximate cause. See, e.g., Anza v.&para;<br>Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 457–458 (2006);&para;<br>Sosa, supra, at 703. Thus, if the employer’s investigation&para;<br>results in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the&para;<br>supervisor’s original biased action (by the terms of&para;<br>USERRA it is the employer’s burden to establish that),&para;<br>then the employer will not be liable. But the supervisor’s&para;<br>biased report may remain a causal factor if the independ&para;<br>ent investigation takes it into account without determin&para;<br>ing that the adverse action was, apart from the supervi&para;<br>sor’s recommendation, entirely justified. We are aware of&para;<br>no principle in tort or agency law under which an em&para;<br>ployer’s mere conduct of an independent investigation has&para;<br>a claim-preclusive effect. Nor do we think the independ&para;<br>ent investigation somehow relieves the employer of “fault.”&para;<br>The employer is at fault because one of its agents commit&para;<br>ted an action based on discriminatory animus that was&para;<br>intended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse em&para;<br>ployment decision.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO claims that our failure to adopt a rule&para;<br>immunizing an employer who performs an independent&para;<br>investigation reflects a “stray[ing] from the statutory&para;<br>text.” Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). We do&para;<br>not understand this accusation. Since a supervisor is an&para;<br>agent of the employer, when he causes an adverse em&para;<br>ployment action the employer causes it; and when dis&para;<br>crimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a&para;<br>“motivating factor in the employer’s action,” precisely as&para;<br>the text requires. JUSTICE ALITO suggests that the em&para;<br>ployer should be held liable only when it “should be re&para;<br>garded as having delegated part of the decisionmaking&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>power” to the biased supervisor. Ibid. But if the inde&para;<br>pendent investigation relies on facts provided by the bi&para;<br>ased supervisor—as is necessary in any case of cat’s-paw&para;<br>liability—then the employer (either directly or through&para;<br>the ultimate decisionmaker) will have effectively delegated&para;<br>the factfinding portion of the investigation to the biased&para;<br>supervisor. Contrary to JUSTICE ALITO’s suggestion, the&para;<br>biased supervisor is not analogous to a witness at a bench&para;<br>trial. The mere witness is not an actor in the events that&para;<br>are the subject of the trial. The biased supervisor and the&para;<br>ultimate decisionmaker, however, acted as agents of the&para;<br>entity that the plaintiff seeks to hold liable; each of them&para;<br>possessed supervisory authority delegated by their em&para;<br>ployer and exercised it in the interest of their employer.&para;<br>In sum, we do not see how “fidelity to the statutory text,”&para;<br>ibid., requires the adoption of an independent&para;<br>investigation defense that appears nowhere in the text.&para;<br>And we find both speculative and implausible JUSTICE&para;<br>ALITO’s prediction that our Nation’s employers will sys&para;<br>tematically disfavor members of the armed services in&para;<br>their hiring decisions to avoid the possibility of cat’s-paw&para;<br>liability, a policy that would violate USERRA in any&para;<br>event.&para;<br>We therefore hold that if a supervisor performs an act&para;<br>motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the&para;<br>supervisor to cause an adverse employment action,3 and if&para;<br>that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment&para;<br>action, then the employer is liable under USERRA. 4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Under&para;<br>&para;<br>traditional tort law, “ ‘intent’ . . . denote[s] that the actor&para;<br>desires to cause consequences of his act, or that he believes that the&para;<br>consequences are substantially certain to result from it.” Id., §8A.&para;<br>4 Needless to say, the employer would be liable only when the super&para;<br>visor acts within the scope of his employment, or when the supervisor&para;<br>acts outside the scope of his employment and liability would be imputed&para;<br>to the employer under traditional agency principles.

A “reprimand . . . for&para;<br>workplace failings” constitutes conduct within the scope of&para;<br>an agent’s employment. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524&para;<br>U. S. 775, 798–799 (1998). As the Seventh Circuit recog&para;<br>nized, there was evidence that Mulally’s and Korenchuk’s&para;<br>actions were motivated by hostility toward Staub’s mili&para;<br>tary obligations. There was also evidence that Mulally’s&para;<br>and Korenchuk’s actions were causal factors underlying&para;<br>Buck’s decision to fire Staub. Buck’s termination notice&para;<br>expressly stated that Staub was terminated because he&para;<br>had “ignored” the directive in the Corrective Action. Fi&para;<br>nally, there was evidence that both Mulally and Koren&para;<br>chuk had the specific intent to cause Staub to be termi&para;<br>nated. Mulally stated she was trying to “ ‘get rid of ’ ”&para;<br>Staub, and Korenchuk was aware that Mulally was “ ‘out&para;<br>to get’ ” Staub. Moreover, Korenchuk informed Buck,&para;<br>Proctor’s personnel officer responsible for terminating&para;<br>employees, of Staub’s alleged noncompliance with Mu&para;<br>lally’s Corrective Action, and Buck fired Staub immedi&para;<br>ately thereafter; a reasonable jury could infer that Koren&para;<br>chuk intended that Staub be fired. The Seventh Circuit&para;<br>therefore erred in holding that Proctor was entitled to&para;<br>judgment as a matter of law.&para;<br>It is less clear whether the jury’s verdict should be&para;<br>reinstated or whether Proctor is entitled to a new trial.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>view as to whether the employer would be liable if a co-worker, rather&para;<br>than a supervisor, committed a discriminatory act that influenced the&para;<br>ultimate employment decision. We also observe that Staub took advan&para;<br>tage of Proctor’s grievance process, and we express no view as to&para;<br>whether Proctor would have an affirmative defense if he did not.

STAUB, PETITIONER v. PROCTOR &para;<br>&para;<br>HOSPITAL&para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[March 1, 2011] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,&para;<br>concurring in the judgment.&para;<br>I agree with the Court that the decision of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals must be reversed, but I would do so based on the&para;<br>statutory text, rather than principles of agency and tort&para;<br>law that do not speak directly to the question presented&para;<br>here.&para;<br>The relevant statutory provision states:&para;<br>“An employer shall be considered to have engaged in&para;<br>[prohibited discrimination against a member of one of&para;<br>the uniformed services] if the person’s membership&para;<br>. . . is a motivating factor in the employer’s action,&para;<br>unless the employer can prove that the action would&para;<br>have been taken in the absence of such membership&para;<br>. . . .” 38 U. S. C. §4311(c)(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>For present purposes, the key phrase is “a motivating&para;<br>factor in the employer’s action.” A “motivating factor” is a&para;<br>factor that “provide[s] . . . a motive.” See Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 1475 (1971) (defining “moti&para;<br>vate”). A “motive,” in turn, is “something within a person&para;<br>. . . that incites him to action.” Ibid. Thus, in order for&para;<br>discrimination to be “a motivating factor in [an] em&para;<br>ployer’s action,” discrimination must be present “within,”&para;<br>i.e., in the mind of, the person who makes the decision to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>take that action. And “the employer’s action” here is the&para;<br>decision to fire petitioner. Thus, petitioner, in order to&para;<br>recover, was required to show that discrimination moti&para;<br>vated that action.&para;<br>The Court, however, strays from the statutory text by&para;<br>holding that it is enough for an employee to show that&para;<br>discrimination motivated some other action and that this&para;<br>latter action, in turn, caused the termination decision.&para;<br>That is simply not what the statute says.&para;<br>The Court fears this interpretation of the statute would&para;<br>allow an employer to escape liability by assigning formal&para;<br>decisionmaking authority to an officer who may merely&para;<br>rubberstamp the recommendation of others who are moti&para;<br>vated by antimilitary animus. See ante, at 8. But fidelity&para;<br>to the statutory text does not lead to this result. Where&para;<br>the officer with formal decisionmaking authority merely&para;<br>rubberstamps the recommendation of others, the em&para;<br>ployer, I would hold, has actually delegated the decision&para;<br>making responsibility to those whose recommendation is&para;<br>rubberstamped. I would reach a similar conclusion where&para;<br>the officer with the formal decisionmaking authority is put&para;<br>on notice that adverse information about an employee may&para;<br>be based on antimilitary animus but does not undertake&para;<br>an independent investigation of the matter. In that situa&para;<br>tion, too, the employer should be regarded as having dele&para;<br>gated part of the decisionmaking power to those who are&para;<br>responsible for memorializing and transmitting the ad&para;<br>verse information that is accepted without examination.&para;<br>The same cannot be said, however, where the officer with&para;<br>formal decisionmaking responsibility, having been alerted&para;<br>to the possibility that adverse information may be tainted,&para;<br>undertakes a reasonable investigation and finds insuffi&para;<br>cient evidence to dispute the accuracy of that information.&para;<br>Nor can the employer be said to have “effectively dele&para;<br>gated” decisionmaking authority any time a decision&para;<br>maker “relies on facts provided by [a] biased supervisor.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>See ante, at 10. A decisionmaker who credits information&para;<br>provided by another person—for example, a judge who&para;<br>credits the testimony of a witness in a bench trial—does&para;<br>not thereby delegate a portion of the decisionmaking&para;<br>authority to the person who provides the information.&para;<br>This interpretation of §4311(c)(1) heeds the statutory&para;<br>text and would provide fair treatment for both employers&para;<br>and employees who are members of the uniformed ser&para;<br>vices. It would also encourage employers to establish&para;<br>internal grievance procedures similar to those that have&para;<br>been adopted following our decisions in Burlington Indus&para;<br>tries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v.&para;<br>Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998). Such procedures would&para;<br>often provide relief for employees without the need for&para;<br>litigation, and they would provide protection for employers&para;<br>who proceed in good faith.&para;<br>The Court’s contrary approach, by contrast, is almost&para;<br>certain to lead to confusion and is likely to produce results&para;<br>that will not serve the interests of either employers or&para;<br>employees who are members of the uniformed services.&para;<br>The Court’s holding will impose liability unfairly on em&para;<br>ployers who make every effort to comply with the law, and&para;<br>it may have the perverse effect of discouraging employers&para;<br>from hiring applicants who are members of the Reserves&para;<br>or the National Guard. In addition, by leaving open the&para;<br>possibility that an employer may be held liable if it inno&para;<br>cently takes into account adverse information provided,&para;<br>not by a supervisor, but by a low-level employee, see ante,&para;<br>at 10–11, n. 4, the Court increases the confusion that its&para;<br>decision is likely to produce.&para;<br>For these reasons, I cannot accept the Court’s interpre&para;<br>tation of §4311(c)(1), but I nevertheless agree that the&para;<br>decision below must be reversed. There was sufficient&para;<br>evidence to support a finding that at least Korenchuk was&para;<br>actually delegated part of the decisionmaking authority in&para;<br>this case. Korenchuk was the head of the unit in which&para;<br>Staub worked and it was Korenchuk who told Buck that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Staub left his work area without informing his supervi&para;<br>sors. There was evidence that Korenchuk’s accusation&para;<br>formed the basis of Buck’s decision to fire Staub, and that&para;<br>Buck simply accepted the accusation at face value. Ac&para;<br>cording to one version of events, Buck fired Staub immedi&para;<br>ately after Korenchuk informed her of Staub’s alleged&para;<br>misconduct, and she cited only that misconduct in the&para;<br>termination notice provided to Staub. See 5 Record 128–&para;<br>129, 267–268, 380–386; App. 74a. All of this is enough to&para;<br>show that Korenchuk was in effect delegated some of&para;<br>Buck’s termination authority. There was also evidence&para;<br>from which it may be inferred that displeasure with&para;<br>Staub’s Reserve responsibilities was a motivating factor in&para;<br>Korenchuk’s actions.*&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* See 5 Record 343–344 (testimony that Korenchuk made negative&para;<br>remarks about Staub’s Reserve duties before firing him in 1998); id., at&para;<br>124–126, 352 (testimony that Korenchuk informed Staub of the revenue&para;<br>lost while he was on Active Duty in 2003, that Korenchuk was aware in&para;<br>January 2004 that Staub might be called to Active Duty again, and that&para;<br>“[b]udget was a big issue with [Korenchuk]”).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
