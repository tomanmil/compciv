CASTLEMAN&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–1371. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided March 26, 2014&para;<br>Respondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” He argued that his previous conviction for “intentionally or knowingly&para;<br>caus[ing] bodily injury to” the mother of his child, App. 27, did not&para;<br>qualify as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because it did&para;<br>not involve “the use or attempted use of physical force,” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, reasoning that “physical force” must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily&para;<br>injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning. The Sixth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed on a different rationale. It held that the degree of physical&para;<br>force required for a conviction to constitute a “misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence” is the same as that required for a “violent felony”&para;<br>under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—&para;<br>namely, violent force—and that Castleman could have been convicted&para;<br>for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.&para;<br>Held: Castleman’s conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” Pp. 4–16.&para;<br>(a) Section 922(g)(9)’s “physical force” requirement is satisfied by&para;<br>the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction—&para;<br>namely, offensive touching. Congress presumably intends to incorporate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing suggests Congress intended otherwise here. The Sixth Circuit relied upon Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, in which the common-law&para;<br>meaning of “force” was found to be a “comical misfit,” id., at 145,&para;<br>when read into ACCA’s “violent felony” definition. But Johnson resolves this case in the Government’s favor: The very reasons for rejecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>it here. First, whereas it was “unlikely” that Congress meant to incorporate in ACCA’s “violent felony” definition “a phrase that the&para;<br>common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,” id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate&para;<br>the misdemeanor-specific meaning of “force” in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” Second, whereas the word “violent” or “violence” standing alone “connotes a substantial degree of&para;<br>force,” id., at 140, that is not true of “domestic violence,” which is a&para;<br>term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as “violent” in a nondomestic context. Third, whereas this Court has hesitated to apply ACCA to “crimes which, though dangerous, are not&para;<br>typically committed by those whom one normally labels ‘armed career&para;<br>criminals,’ ” Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137, 146, there is no&para;<br>anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or&para;<br>battery offenses together with others whom §922(g) disqualifies from&para;<br>gun ownership. In addition, a contrary reading would have made&para;<br>§922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.&para;<br>Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>(b) Under this definition of “physical force,” Castleman’s conviction&para;<br>qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” The application of the modified categorical approach—consulting Castleman’s&para;<br>state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the elements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense—is&para;<br>straightforward. Castleman pleaded guilty to “intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to” the mother of his child, and the&para;<br>knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves&para;<br>the use of physical force. First, a “bodily injury” must result from&para;<br>“physical force.” The common-law concept of “force” encompasses&para;<br>even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law sense. Second, the&para;<br>knowing or intentional application of force is a “use” of force. Leocal&para;<br>v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, distinguished. Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(c) Castleman claims that legislative history, the rule of lenity, and&para;<br>the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this Court’s interpretation of §922(g)(9), but his arguments are unpersuasive.&para;<br>Pp. 14–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>695 F. 3d 582, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

Id., at 13–16.&para;<br>Castleman moved to dismiss the §922(g)(9) charges,&para;<br>arguing that his Tennessee conviction did not qualify as a&para;<br>“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because it did&para;<br>not “ha[ve], as an element, the use . . . of physical force,”&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, on the theory that “the ‘use of physical force’ for §922(g)(9) purposes”&para;<br>must entail “violent contact with the victim.” App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 40a. The court held that a conviction under the&para;<br>relevant Tennessee statute cannot qualify as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because one can cause&para;<br>bodily injury without “violent contact”—for example, by&para;<br>“deceiving [the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage.”&para;<br>Id., at 41a.&para;<br>A divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Sixth Circuit affirmed, by different reasoning. 695 F. 3d&para;<br>582 (2012). The majority held that the degree of physical&para;<br>force required by §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is the same as required&para;<br>by §924(e)(2)(B)(i), which defines “violent felony.” Id., at&para;<br>587. Applying our decision in Johnson v. United States,&para;<br>559 U. S. 133 (2010), which held that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) requires “violent force,” id., at 140, the majority held that&para;<br>Castleman’s conviction did not qualify as a “misdemeanor&para;<br>crime of domestic violence” because Castleman could have&para;<br>been convicted for “caus[ing] a slight, nonserious physical&para;<br>injury with conduct that cannot be described as violent.”&para;<br>695 F. 3d, at 590. Judge McKeague dissented, arguing&para;<br>both that the majority erred in extending Johnson’s definition of a “violent felony” to the context of a “misdemeanor&para;<br>crime of domestic violence” and that, in any event, Castleman’s conviction satisfied the Johnson standard. Id., at&para;<br>593–597.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit’s decision deepened a split of authority among the Courts of Appeals. Compare, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Nason, 269 F. 3d 10, 18 (CA1 2001) (§922(g)(9)&para;<br>“encompass[es] crimes characterized by the application of&para;<br>any physical force”), with United States v. Belless, 338&para;<br>F. 3d 1063, 1068 (CA9 2003) (§922(g)(9) covers only “the&para;<br>violent use of force”). We granted certiorari to resolve this&para;<br>split, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now reverse the Sixth Circuit’s judgment.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>“It is a settled principle of interpretation that, absent&para;<br>other indication, ‘Congress intends to incorporate the wellsettled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.’ ” Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).&para;<br>Seeing no “other indication” here, we hold that Congress&para;<br>incorporated the common-law meaning of “force”—namely,&para;<br>offensive touching—in §921(a)(33)(A)’s definition of a “mis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>demeanor crime of domestic violence.”&para;<br>Johnson resolves this case in the Government’s favor—&para;<br>not, as the Sixth Circuit held, in Castleman’s. In Johnson,&para;<br>we considered whether a battery conviction was a “violent&para;<br>felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),&para;<br>§924(e)(1). As here, ACCA defines such a crime as one&para;<br>that “has as an element the use . . . of physical force,”&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i). We began by observing that at common&para;<br>law, the element of force in the crime of battery was “satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.” 559 U. S., at&para;<br>139 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of&para;<br>England 120 (1768)).2 And we recognized the general rule&para;<br>that “a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning,” except “where that meaning&para;<br>does not fit.” 559 U. S., at 139. We declined to read the&para;<br>common-law meaning of “force” into ACCA’s definition of a&para;<br>“violent felony,” because we found it a “comical misfit with&para;<br>the defined term.” Id., at 145; see United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 474 (2010) (“[A]n unclear definitional&para;<br>phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined”).&para;<br>In defining a “ ‘violent felony,’ ” we held, “the phrase ‘physical force’ ” must “mea[n] violent force.” Johnson, 559 U. S.,&para;<br>at 140. But here, the common-law meaning of “force” fits&para;<br>perfectly: The very reasons we gave for rejecting that&para;<br>meaning in defining a “violent felony” are reasons to embrace it in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic&para;<br>violence.”3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 We explained that the word “physical” did not add much to the word&para;<br>“force,” except to distinguish “force exerted by and through concrete&para;<br>bodies . . . from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.”&para;<br>Johnson, 559 U. S., at 138.&para;<br>3 Johnson specifically reserved the question whether our definition of&para;<br>“physical force” would extend to 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(9). 559 U. S., at&para;<br>143–144. And these reasons for declining to extend Johnson’s definition to §922(g)(9) serve equally to rebut the “presumption of consistent&para;<br>usage” on which JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence heavily relies, post, at&para;<br>1–2, 4.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>First, because perpetrators of domestic violence are&para;<br>“routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault&para;<br>or battery laws,” Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, it makes sense&para;<br>for Congress to have classified as a “misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence” the type of conduct that supports a&para;<br>common-law battery conviction. Whereas it was “unlikely”&para;<br>that Congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a&para;<br>“ ‘violent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,”&para;<br>Johnson, 559 U. S., at 141, it is likely that Congress&para;<br>meant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific meaning&para;<br>of “force” in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic&para;<br>violence.”&para;<br>Second, whereas the word “violent” or “violence” standing alone “connotes a substantial degree of force,” id., at&para;<br>140,4 that is not true of “domestic violence.” “Domestic&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 This portion of Johnson’s analysis relied heavily on Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), in which we interpreted the meaning of a&para;<br>“crime of violence” under 18 U. S. C. §16. As in Johnson and here, the&para;<br>statute defines a “crime of violence” in part as one “that has as an&para;<br>element the use . . . of physical force,” §16(a). In support of our holding&para;<br>in Johnson, we quoted Leocal’s observation that “ ‘[t]he ordinary meaning of [a “crime of violence”] . . . suggests a category of violent, active&para;<br>crimes.’ ” 559 U. S., at 140 (quoting 543 U. S., at 11).&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals have generally held that mere offensive&para;<br>touching cannot constitute the “physical force” necessary to a “crime of&para;<br>violence,” just as we held in Johnson that it could not constitute the&para;<br>“physical force” necessary to a “violent felony.” See Karimi v. Holder,&para;<br>715 F. 3d 561, 566–568 (CA4 2013); Singh v. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1228,&para;<br>1233 (CA9 2004); Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003);&para;<br>United States v.

Rede-Mendez, 680 F. 3d 552, 558 (CA6 2012)&para;<br>(commenting generally that “[i]n the crime of violence context, ‘the&para;<br>phrase “physical force” means violent force’ ”); United States v. Haileselassie, 668 F. 3d 1033, 1035 (CA8 2012) (dicta). But see Hernandez v.&para;<br>U. S. Attorney General, 513 F. 3d 1336, 1340, n. 3 (CA11 2008) (per&para;<br>curiam). The Board of Immigration Appeals has similarly extended&para;<br>Johnson’s requirement of violent force to the context of a “crime of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>violence” is not merely a type of “violence”; it is a term of&para;<br>art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as&para;<br>“violent” in a nondomestic context. See Brief for National&para;<br>Network to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae&para;<br>4–9; DOJ, Office on Violence Against Women, Domestic&para;<br>Violence (defining physical forms of domestic violence to&para;<br>include “[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching,&para;<br>biting, [and] hair pulling”), online at http://www.ovw.&para;<br>usdoj.gov/domviolence.htm.5 Indeed, “most physical assaults committed against women and men by intimates&para;<br>are relatively minor and consist of pushing, grabbing,&para;<br>shoving, slapping, and hitting.” DOJ, P. Tjaden &amp; N.&para;<br>Thoennes, Extent, Nature and Consequences of Intimate&para;<br>Partner Violence 11 (2000).&para;<br>Minor uses of force may not constitute “violence” in the&para;<br>generic sense. For example, in an opinion that we cited&para;<br>——————&para;<br>violence” under §16. Matter of Velasquez, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 278, 282&para;<br>(2010). Nothing in today’s opinion casts doubt on these holdings,&para;<br>because—as we explain—“domestic violence” encompasses a range of&para;<br>force broader than that which constitutes “violence” simpliciter.&para;<br>We note, as does JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence, post, at 8, and n. 7,&para;<br>that federal law elsewhere defines “domestic violence” in more limited&para;<br>terms: For example, a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act&para;<br>defines a “ ‘crime of domestic violence’ ” as “any crime of violence (as&para;<br>defined by [18 U. S. C. §16])” committed against a qualifying relation. 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). Our view that “domestic violence” encompasses acts that might not constitute “violence” in a nondomestic&para;<br>context does not extend to a provision like this, which specifically&para;<br>defines “domestic violence” by reference to a generic “crime of violence.”&para;<br>5 See also&para;<br>A.

Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d&para;<br>666, 670 (2003). But an act of this nature is easy to describe as “domestic violence,” when the accumulation of&para;<br>such acts over time can subject one intimate partner to the&para;<br>other’s control. If a seemingly minor act like this draws&para;<br>the attention of authorities and leads to a successful prosecution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend&para;<br>common sense or the English language to characterize the&para;<br>resulting conviction as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic&para;<br>violence.”&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence discounts our reference to&para;<br>social-science definitions of “domestic violence,” including&para;<br>those used by the organizations most directly engaged&para;<br>with the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.&para;<br>See post, at 8–11. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the operative phrase we are construing is not&para;<br>“domestic violence”; it is “physical force.” §921(a)(33)(A).&para;<br>“Physical force” has a presumptive common-law meaning,&para;<br>and the question is simply whether that presumptive&para;<br>meaning makes sense in defining a “misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence.”6&para;<br>A third reason for distinguishing Johnson’s definition of&para;<br>“physical force” is that unlike in Johnson—where a determination that the defendant’s crime was a “violent felony”&para;<br>would have classified him as an “armed career criminal”—&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The concurrence’s reliance on definitions of “domestic violence” in&para;<br>other statutory provisions, see post, at 8, and n. 7, is similarly unpersuasive. These other provisions show that when Congress wished to&para;<br>define “domestic violence” as a type of “violence” simpliciter, it knew&para;<br>how to do so. That it did not do so here suggests, if anything, that it did&para;<br>not mean to. See, e.g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 492&para;<br>(1994). This also answers the concurrence’s suggestion, post, at 10,&para;<br>that our holding will somehow make it difficult for Congress to define&para;<br>“domestic violence”—where it wants to—as requiring violent force.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 1). We may accordingly apply the modified categorical&para;<br>approach, consulting the indictment to which Castleman&para;<br>pleaded guilty in order to determine whether his conviction did entail the elements necessary to constitute the&para;<br>generic federal offense. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2); see&para;<br>Shepard, 544 U. S., at 26. Here, that analysis is straightforward: Castleman pleaded guilty to having “intentionally&para;<br>or knowingly cause[d] bodily injury” to the mother of his&para;<br>child, App. 27, and the knowing or intentional causation of&para;<br>bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.&para;<br>First, a “bodily injury” must result from “physical force.”&para;<br>Under Tennessee law, “bodily injury” is a broad term: It&para;<br>“includes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement;&para;<br>physical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the&para;<br>function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.”&para;<br>Tenn. Code Ann. §39–11–106(a)(2) (1997). JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence suggests that these forms of injury necessitate violent force, under Johnson’s definition of that&para;<br>phrase. Post, at 3. But whether or not that is so—a&para;<br>question we do not decide—these forms of injury do necessitate force in the common-law sense.&para;<br>The District Court thought otherwise, reasoning that&para;<br>one can cause bodily injury “without the ‘use of physical&para;<br>force’ ”—for example, by “deceiving [the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage, without making contact of any&para;<br>kind.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. But as we explained in&para;<br>Johnson, “physical force” is simply “force exerted by and&para;<br>through concrete bodies,” as opposed to “intellectual force&para;<br>or emotional force.” 559 U. S., at 138. And the commonlaw concept of “force” encompasses even its indirect application. “Force” in this sense “describ[es] one of the&para;<br>elements of the common-law crime of battery,” id., at 139,&para;<br>and “[t]he force used” in battery “need not be applied&para;<br>directly to the body of the victim.” 2 W. LaFave, Substan-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tive Criminal Law §16.2(b) (2d ed. 2003). “[A] battery may&para;<br>be committed by administering a poison or by infecting&para;<br>with a disease, or even by resort to some intangible substance,” such as a laser beam. Ibid. (footnote omitted)&para;<br>(citing State v. Monroe, 121 N. C. 677, 28 S. E. 547 (1897)&para;<br>(poison); State v. Lankford, 29 Del. 594, 102 A. 63 (1917)&para;<br>(disease); Adams v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 463, 534&para;<br>S. E. 2d 347 (2000) (laser beam)). It is impossible to cause&para;<br>bodily injury without applying force in the common-law&para;<br>sense.&para;<br>Second, the knowing or intentional application of force&para;<br>is a “use” of force. Castleman is correct that under Leocal&para;<br>v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), the word “use” “conveys the&para;<br>idea that the thing used (here, ‘physical force’) has been&para;<br>made the user’s instrument.” Brief for Respondent 37.&para;<br>But he errs in arguing that although “[p]oison may have&para;<br>‘forceful physical properties’ as a matter of organic chemistry, . . . no one would say that a poisoner ‘employs’ force or&para;<br>‘carries out a purpose by means of force’ when he or&para;<br>she sprinkles poison in a victim’s drink,” ibid. The “use&para;<br>of force” in Castleman’s example is not the act of&para;<br>“sprinkl[ing]” the poison; it is the act of employing poison&para;<br>knowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the&para;<br>harm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick&para;<br>or punch), does not matter. Under Castleman’s logic, after&para;<br>all, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a&para;<br>“use of force” because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that&para;<br>actually strikes the victim. Leocal held that the “use” of&para;<br>force must entail “a higher degree of intent than negligent&para;<br>or merely accidental conduct,” 543 U. S., at 9; it did not&para;<br>hold that the word “use” somehow alters the meaning of&para;<br>“force.”&para;<br>Because Castleman’s indictment makes clear that the&para;<br>use of physical force was an element of his conviction, that&para;<br>conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic&para;<br>violence.”&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>We are not persuaded by Castleman’s nontextual arguments against our interpretation of §922(g)(9).&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, Castleman invokes §922(g)(9)’s legislative history&para;<br>to suggest that Congress could not have intended for the&para;<br>provision to apply to acts involving minimal force. But to&para;<br>the extent that legislative history can aid in the interpretation of this statute, Castleman’s reliance on it is&para;<br>unpersuasive.&para;<br>Castleman begins by observing that during the debate&para;<br>over §922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision&para;<br>would help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of&para;<br>severe domestic abuse. Senator Lautenberg referred to&para;<br>“serious spousal or child abuse” and to “violent individuals”; Senator Hutchison to “ ‘people who batter their&para;<br>wives’ ”; Senator Wellstone to people who “brutalize” their&para;<br>wives or children; and Senator Feinstein to “severe and&para;<br>recurring domestic violence.” 142 Cong. Rec. 22985–&para;<br>22986, 22988. But as we noted above, see supra, at 2, the&para;<br>impetus of §922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe&para;<br>domestic violence are often convicted “under generally&para;<br>applicable assault or battery laws.” Hayes, 555 U. S., at&para;<br>427. So nothing about these Senators’ isolated references&para;<br>to severe domestic violence suggests that they would not&para;<br>have wanted §922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault&para;<br>conviction like Castleman’s.&para;<br>Castleman next observes that §922(g)(9) is the product&para;<br>of a legislative compromise. The provision originally&para;<br>barred gun possession for any “crime of domestic violence,”&para;<br>defined as any “felony or misdemeanor crime of violence,&para;<br>regardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.” 142&para;<br>Cong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote the provision to require the use of physical force in response to the concern&para;<br>“that the term crime of violence was too broad, and could&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>be interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit&para;<br>card with a pair of scissors,” id., at 26675. See Hayes, 555&para;<br>U. S., at 428. Castleman would have us conclude that&para;<br>Congress thus meant “to narrow the scope of the statute to&para;<br>convictions based on especially severe conduct.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address&para;<br>the fear that §922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in&para;<br>which no force at all was directed at a person. As Senator&para;<br>Lautenberg noted, the revised text was not only “more&para;<br>precise” than the original but also “probably broader.” 142&para;<br>Cong. Rec. 26675.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We are similarly unmoved by Castleman’s invocation of&para;<br>the rule of lenity. Castleman is correct that our “construction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for&para;<br>fair warning.” Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152,&para;<br>160 (1990). But “the rule of lenity only applies if, after&para;<br>considering text, structure, history, and purpose, there&para;<br>remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute, such that the Court must simply guess as to what&para;<br>Congress intended.” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488&para;<br>(2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>That is not the case here.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Finally, Castleman suggests—in a single paragraph—&para;<br>that we should read §922(g)(9) narrowly because it implicates his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But&para;<br>Castleman has not challenged the constitutionality of&para;<br>§922(g)(9), either on its face or as applied to him, and the&para;<br>meaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need&para;<br>not indulge Castleman’s cursory nod to constitutional&para;<br>avoidance concerns.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Castleman’s conviction for having “intentionally or&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

I write separately,&para;<br>however, because I reach that conclusion on narrower&para;<br>grounds.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133&para;<br>(2010), is the natural place to begin. Johnson is significant here because it concluded that “the phrase ‘physical&para;<br>force’ means violent force—that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.” Id., at&para;<br>140 (second emphasis added). This is an easy case if&para;<br>the phrase “physical force” has the same meaning in&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines “misdemeanor&para;<br>crime of domestic violence” for purposes of §922(g)(9), as it&para;<br>does in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in Johnson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without&para;<br>using force “capable of ” producing that result.&para;<br>There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson’s&para;<br>interpretation. One is the presumption of consistent&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>usage—the rule of thumb that a term generally means the&para;<br>same thing each time it is used. Although the presumption is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the&para;<br>same enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,&para;<br>33–34 (2005), it is equally relevant “when Congress uses the&para;<br>same language in two statutes having similar purposes,”&para;<br>Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005)&para;<br>(plurality opinion); see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of&para;<br>Memphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per&para;<br>curiam). This case is a textbook candidate for application&para;<br>of the Smith-Northcross branch of the rule. The “physical&para;<br>force” clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in&para;<br>nearly identical fashion: The former defines a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” as an offense that&para;<br>“has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical&para;<br>force,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a “violent&para;<br>felony” as an offense that “has as an element the use,&para;<br>attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against&para;<br>the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes&para;<br>are designed to promote public safety by deterring a class&para;<br>of criminals from possessing firearms.&para;<br>Respondent’s arguments fail to overcome the presumption of consistent usage. In respondent’s view, “physical&para;<br>force” cannot mean “any force that produces any pain&para;<br>or bodily injury,” Brief for Respondent 25, because&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a violent crime and one can inflict all sorts of minor injuries—bruises, paper cuts,&para;<br>etc.—by engaging in nonviolent behavior. Respondent&para;<br>therefore reasons that §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capable of inflicting “serious” bodily injury. That requirement&para;<br>is more demanding than both of the plausible meanings of “physical force” we identified in Johnson: commonlaw offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force&para;<br>capable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or&para;<br>otherwise. See 559 U. S., at 138–140. It would be surpassing strange to read a statute defining a “misdemeanor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>crime of domestic violence” as requiring greater force than&para;<br>the similarly worded statute in Johnson, which defined a&para;<br>“violent felony,” and respondent does not make a convincing case for taking that extraordinary step.&para;<br>For these reasons, I would give “physical force” the same&para;<br>meaning in §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as in Johnson. The rest of&para;<br>the analysis is straightforward. Because “intentionally or&para;<br>knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,” App. 27, categorically&para;<br>involves the use of “force capable of causing physical pain&para;<br>or injury to another person,” 559 U. S., at 140, respondent’s 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” under §922(g)(9).1&para;<br>I would reverse the judgment below on that basis and&para;<br>remand for further proceedings.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower interpretation of §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader&para;<br>one that treats any offensive touching, no matter how&para;<br>slight, as sufficient. That expansive common-law definition cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statutory text.&para;<br>We have twice addressed the meaning of “physical force”&para;<br>in the context of provisions that define a class of violent&para;<br>crimes. Both times, we concluded that “physical force”&para;<br>means violent force. In Johnson, we thought it “clear that&para;<br>in the context of a statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’&para;<br>the phrase ‘physical force’ means violent force.” Id., at&para;<br>140. And we held that common-law offensive touching—&para;<br>the same type of force the Court today holds does constitute “physical force”—is not sufficiently violent to satisfy&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Respondent argues at length that Tenn. Code Ann. §39–13–111(b)&para;<br>(2013 Supp.) does not require the “use” of physical force, since it is&para;<br>possible to cause bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent&para;<br>means. Brief for Respondent 30–42. The argument fails for the reasons given by the Court. See ante, at 13.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the Armed Career Criminal Act’s “physical force” requirement. See id., at 140–144. Our analysis in Johnson was&para;<br>premised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the&para;<br>generic federal “crime of violence” statute, 18 U. S. C. §16.&para;<br>In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), we observed&para;<br>that §16(a)—which defines a “crime of violence” as “an&para;<br>offense that has as an element the use, attempted use,&para;<br>or threatened use of physical force against the person or&para;<br>property of another”—comprehends “a category of violent, active crimes.” The textual similarity between&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii)’s “physical force” clause and the clauses&para;<br>at issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question:&para;<br>Why should the same meaning not apply here?&para;<br>The Court gives four responses that merit discussion,&para;<br>none of which withstands scrutiny. First, the Court invokes the “ ‘settled principle of interpretation that, absent&para;<br>other indication, “Congress intends to incorporate the&para;<br>well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.” ’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 4 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2013) (slip op., at 3)). That principle is of limited&para;<br>relevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory&para;<br>meaning is precisely “other indication” that §921(a)(33)&para;<br>(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common-law meaning.&para;<br>Anyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle&para;<br>cited by the Court is that when “ ‘a word is obviously&para;<br>transplanted from another legal source, whether the&para;<br>common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with&para;<br>it.’ ” Sekhar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3–4) (quoting&para;<br>Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,&para;<br>47 Colum.

But there is no&para;<br>interpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be&para;<br>given their broadest possible application, and §922(g)(9)&para;<br>without offensive touching would have had application in&para;<br>four-fifths of the States.

S. 415, 427 (2009), and such statutes generally prohibited “both offensive touching and the&para;<br>causation of bodily injury” or “only the latter,” ante, at 9, it&para;<br>does not follow that interpreting “physical force” to mean&para;<br>violent force would have rendered §922(g)(9) a practical&para;<br>nullity. To the contrary, §922(g)(9) would have worked&para;<br>perfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor&para;<br>assault or battery statutes at the time of §922(g)(9)’s&para;<br>enactment. At that point, 19 States had statutes that&para;<br>covered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touching,3 and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of&para;<br>types of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner—thus&para;<br>——————&para;<br>“crime of violence” statute discussed in Leocal was enacted in 1984, see&para;<br>§1001, 98 Stat. 2136.&para;<br>3 See Ala.

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Third, the Court seizes on the one and only meaningful&para;<br>distinction between §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) and the other provisions referred to above: that it defines a violent “misdemeanor” rather than a “violent felony” or an undifferentiated&para;<br>“crime of violence.” Ante, at 5–6. We properly take&para;<br>account of the term being defined when interpreting “an&para;<br>unclear definitional phrase.” United States v. Stevens, 559&para;<br>U. S. 460, 474 (2010); but see Babbitt v. Sweet Home&para;<br>Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 717–&para;<br>719 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But when we do so, we&para;<br>consider the entire term being defined, not just part of it.&para;<br>Here, the term being defined is “misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence.” Applying the term-to-be-defined canon&para;<br>thus yields the unremarkable conclusion that “physical&para;<br>force” in §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force involved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodily-injury&para;<br>offenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive&para;<br>touching).&para;<br>Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson&para;<br>and Leocal on the ground that “ ‘domestic violence’ encompasses a range of force broader than that which constitutes ‘violence’ simpliciter.” Ante, at 6, n. 4. That is&para;<br>to say, an act need not be violent to qualify as “domestic&para;<br>violence.” That absurdity is not only at war with the&para;<br>English language, it is flatly inconsistent with definitions of “domestic violence” from the period surrounding&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii)’s enactment. At the time, dictionaries&para;<br>defined “domestic violence” as, for instance, “[v]iolence&para;<br>between members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault&para;<br>or other violent act committed by one member of a household against another,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1564 (7th&para;<br>ed. 1999), and “[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one’s&para;<br>spouse or domestic partner,” American Heritage Dictionary 534 (4th ed. 2000).6 Those definitions, combined with&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Definitions&para;<br>&para;<br>of “physical force” from the same period are also at odds&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the absence of “domestic violence” entries in earlier dictionaries, see, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed.&para;<br>1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992),&para;<br>make it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a “term&para;<br>of art” definition “encompassing acts that one might not&para;<br>characterize as ‘violent’ in a nondomestic context,” ante,&para;<br>at 7.&para;<br>The Court’s inventive, nonviolent definition fares no&para;<br>better when judged against other accepted sources of&para;<br>meaning. Current dictionaries give “domestic violence”&para;<br>the same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs&para;<br>in a domestic context. See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (“[p]hysical abuse of a household member, especially one’s spouse or domestic partner”).&para;<br>The same goes for definitions of “domestic violence”&para;<br>found in other federal statutes.7 Indeed, Congress defined&para;<br>“crime of domestic violence” as a “crime of violence” in&para;<br>another section of the same bill that enacted §921(a)&para;<br>(33)(A)(ii). See §350(a), 110 Stat. 3009–639, codified at&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i).&para;<br>The Court ignores these authorities and instead bases&para;<br>its definition on an amicus brief filed by the National&para;<br>Network to End Domestic Violence and other private&para;<br>——————&para;<br>with the Court’s nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black’s&para;<br>Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) (“[f]orce consisting in a physical act,&para;<br>esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim”); id., at 1147 (6th&para;<br>ed. 1990) (“[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence”).&para;<br>7 See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §2261(a)(1) (defining as “[i]nterstate domestic&para;<br>violence” certain “crime[s] of violence”); §3561(b) (“The term ‘domestic&para;<br>violence crime’ means a crime of violence . . . in which the victim or&para;<br>intended victim is the [defendant’s] spouse” or other qualifying relation); 25 U. S. C. A. §1304(a)(2) (“The term ‘domestic violence’ means&para;<br>violence committed by a current or former spouse or” other qualifying&para;<br>relation); 42 U. S. C.

For example, amici’s&para;<br>definitions describe as “domestic violence” acts that “humiliate, isolate, frighten, . . .

See ante, at 7, n. 5.

(What is more abhorrent than violence against&para;<br>women?) But when they (and the Court) impose their allembracing definition on the rest of us, they not only&para;<br>distort the law, they impoverish the language. When&para;<br>everything is domestic violence, nothing is. Congress will&para;<br>have to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what&para;<br>it would be) to denote actual domestic violence.&para;<br>Although the Justice Department’s definitions ought to&para;<br>be deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extravagant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus),&para;<br>the Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions&para;<br>that they include, viz., “[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling.” Ibid. None of&para;<br>those actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive&para;<br>touching, and all of them are capable of causing physical&para;<br>pain or injury. Cf. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 143 (identifying&para;<br>“a slap in the face” as conduct that might rise to the level&para;<br>of violent force).

Here, of course, we are concerned&para;<br>with the less comprehensive legal definition. The second definition&para;<br>referred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with “overt violence,” which in its least serious form consists of “painful pinching or&para;<br>squeezing.” M.
