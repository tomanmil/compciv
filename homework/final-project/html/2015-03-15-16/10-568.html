Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007), which includes a “commit&para;<br>ment to a [specified] person,” e.g., a member of the officer’s household&para;<br>or the officer’s relative, §281A.420(8)(a)–(d), and “[a]ny other com&para;<br>mitment or relationship that is substantially similar” to one enumer&para;<br>ated in paragraphs (a)–(d), §281A.420(8)(e).&para;<br>Petitioner (Commission) administers and enforces Nevada’s law.&para;<br>The Commission investigated respondent Carrigan, an elected local&para;<br>official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a&para;<br>company that used Carrigan’s long-time friend and campaign man&para;<br>ager as a paid consultant. The Commission concluded that Carrigan&para;<br>had a disqualifying conflict of interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catch&para;<br>all provision, and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on&para;<br>the project. Carrigan sought judicial review, arguing that the Ne&para;<br>vada law violated the First Amendment. The State District Court&para;<br>denied the petition, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed, holding&para;<br>that voting is protected speech and that §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall&para;<br>definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.&para;<br>Held: The Nevada Ethics in Government Law is not unconstitutionally&para;<br>overbroad. Pp. 3–11.&para;<br>(a) That law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from vot&para;<br>ing on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure. If it was&para;<br>constitutional to exclude Carrigan from voting, then his exclusion&para;<br>from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitu&para;<br>tional, for it was a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v.

White, 536 U. S. 765,&para;<br>785. Here, dispositive evidence is provided by “early congressional&para;<br>enactments,” which offer “ ‘contemporaneous and weighty evidence of&para;<br>the Constitution’s meaning,’ ” Printz v.

Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to&para;<br>judges also date back to the founding. The notion that Nevada’s&para;<br>recusal rules violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also in&para;<br>consistent with long-standing traditions in the States, most of which&para;<br>have some type of recusal law. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(c) Restrictions on legislators’ voting are not restrictions on legisla&para;<br>tors’ protected speech. A legislator’s vote is the commitment of his&para;<br>apportioned share of the legislature’s power to the passage or defeat&para;<br>of a particular proposal. He casts his vote “as trustee for his con&para;<br>stituents, not as a prerogative of personal power.” Raines v. Byrd,&para;<br>521 U. S. 811, 821. Moreover, voting is not a symbolic action, and the&para;<br>fact that it is the product of a deeply held or highly unpopular per&para;<br>sonal belief does not transform it into First Amendment speech.&para;<br>Even if the mere vote itself could express depth of belief (which it&para;<br>cannot), this Court has rejected the notion that the First Amendment&para;<br>confers a right to use governmental mechanics to convey a message.&para;<br>See, e.g., Timmons v.

Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007).1 Section&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 At the time of the relevant events in this case, the disclosure and&para;<br>recusal provisions of the Ethics in Government Law were codified at&para;<br>Nev. Rev. Stat. §281.501 (2003). They were recodified without relevant&para;<br>change in 2007 at §281A.420, and all citations are to that version. The&para;<br>Nevada Legislature further amended the statute in 2009, see Nev.&para;<br>Stats., ch. 257, §9.5, p. 1057, but those changes are not relevant here.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>281A.420(8)(a)–(d) of the law defines the term “commit&para;<br>ment in a private capacity to the interests of others” to&para;<br>mean a “commitment to a person” who is a member of the&para;<br>officer’s household; is related by blood, adoption, or mar&para;<br>riage to the officer; employs the officer or a member of his&para;<br>household; or has a substantial and continuing business&para;<br>relationship with the officer. Paragraph (e) of the same&para;<br>subsection adds a catchall to that definition: “[a]ny other&para;<br>commitment or relationship that is substantially similar”&para;<br>to one of those listed in paragraphs (a)–(d).&para;<br>The Ethics in Government Law is administered and&para;<br>enforced by the petitioner in this litigation, the Nevada&para;<br>Commission on Ethics. In 2005, the Commission initiated&para;<br>an investigation of Michael Carrigan, an elected member&para;<br>of the City Council of Sparks, Nevada, in response to&para;<br>complaints that Carrigan had violated §281A.420(2) by&para;<br>voting to approve an application for a hotel/casino project&para;<br>known as the “Lazy 8.” Carrigan, the complaints asserted,&para;<br>had a disabling conflict in the matter because his long&para;<br>time friend and campaign manager, Carlos Vasquez,&para;<br>worked as a paid consultant for the Red Hawk Land Com&para;<br>pany, which had proposed the Lazy 8 project and would&para;<br>benefit from its approval.&para;<br>Upon completion of its investigation, the Commission&para;<br>concluded that Carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of&para;<br>interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall provision because&para;<br>his relationship with Vasquez was “substantially similar”&para;<br>to the prohibited relationships listed in §281A.420(8)(a)–&para;<br>(d). Its written decision censured Carrigan for failing to&para;<br>abstain from voting on the Lazy 8 matter, but did not&para;<br>impose a civil penalty because his violation was not will&para;<br>ful, see §281A.480. (Before the hearing, Carrigan had&para;<br>consulted the Sparks city attorney, who advised him that&para;<br>disclosing his relationship with Vasquez before voting on&para;<br>the Lazy 8 project, which he did, would satisfy his obliga&para;<br>tions under the Ethics in Government Law.)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Carrigan filed a petition for judicial review in the First&para;<br>Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, arguing&para;<br>that the provisions of the Ethics in Government Law that&para;<br>he was found to have violated were unconstitutional under&para;<br>the First Amendment. The District Court denied the&para;<br>petition, but a divided Nevada Supreme Court reversed.&para;<br>The majority held that voting was protected by the First&para;<br>Amendment, and, applying strict scrutiny, found that&para;<br>§281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall definition was unconstitution&para;<br>ally overbroad. 126 Nev. 28, ___–___, 236 P. 3d 616, 621–&para;<br>624 (2010).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The First Amendment prohibits laws “abridging the&para;<br>freedom of speech,” which, “ ‘as a general matter . . . means&para;<br>that government has no power to restrict expression be&para;<br>cause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its&para;<br>content.’ ” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535&para;<br>U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug&para;<br>Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65 (1983)). But the Amend&para;<br>ment has no application when what is restricted is not&para;<br>protected speech. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354&para;<br>U. S. 476, 483 (1957) (obscenity not protected speech). The&para;<br>Nevada Supreme Court thought a legislator’s vote to be&para;<br>protected speech because voting “is a core legislative&para;<br>function.” 126 Nev., at ___, 236 P. 3d, at 621 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>We disagree, for the same reason. But before discussing&para;<br>that issue, we must address a preliminary detail: The&para;<br>challenged law not only prohibits the legislator who has a&para;<br>conflict from voting on the proposal in question, but also&para;<br>forbids him to “advocate the passage or failure” of the&para;<br>proposal—evidently meaning advocating its passage or&para;<br>failure during the legislative debate. Neither Carrigan&para;<br>nor any of his amici contend that the prohibition on advo&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cating can be unconstitutional if the prohibition on voting&para;<br>is not. And with good reason. Legislative sessions would&para;<br>become massive town-hall meetings if those who had a&para;<br>right to speak were not limited to those who had a right&para;<br>to vote. If Carrigan was constitutionally excluded from&para;<br>voting, his exclusion from “advocat[ing]” at the legislative&para;<br>session was a reasonable time, place and manner limita&para;<br>tion. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,&para;<br>468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984).&para;<br>III&para;<br>“[A] universal and long-established tradition of prohibit&para;<br>ing certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the&para;<br>prohibition is constitutional: Principles of liberty funda&para;<br>mental enough to have been embodied within constitu&para;<br>tional guarantees are not readily erased from the Nation’s&para;<br>consciousness.” Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536&para;<br>U. S. 765, 785 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Laws punishing libel and obscenity are not thought to&para;<br>violate “the freedom of speech” to which the First Amend&para;<br>ment refers because such laws existed in 1791 and have&para;<br>been in place ever since. The same is true of legislative&para;<br>recusal rules. The Nevada Supreme Court and Carrigan&para;<br>have not cited a single decision invalidating a generally&para;<br>applicable conflict-of-interest recusal rule—and such rules&para;<br>have been commonplace for over 200 years.&para;<br>“[E]arly congressional enactments ‘provid[e] contempo&para;<br>raneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s mean&para;<br>ing,’ ” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 905 (1997)&para;<br>(quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–724 (1986)).&para;<br>That evidence is dispositive here. Within 15 years of the&para;<br>founding, both the House of Representatives and the&para;<br>Senate adopted recusal rules. The House rule—to which&para;<br>no one is recorded as having objected, on constitutional or&para;<br>other grounds, see D. Currie, The Constitution in Con&para;<br>gress: The Federalist Period 1789–1801, p. 10 (1997)—was&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>adopted within a week of that chamber’s first achieving a&para;<br>quorum.2 The rule read: “No member shall vote on any&para;<br>question, in the event of which he is immediately and&para;<br>particularly interested.” 1 Annals of Cong. 99 (1789).&para;<br>Members of the House would have been subject to this&para;<br>recusal rule when they voted to submit the First Amend&para;<br>ment for ratification; their failure to note any inconsis&para;<br>tency between the two suggests that there was none.&para;<br>The first Senate rules did not include a recusal require&para;<br>ment, but Thomas Jefferson adopted one when he was&para;<br>President of the Senate. His rule provided as follows:&para;<br>“Where the private interests of a member are con&para;<br>cerned in a bill or question, he is to withdraw. And&para;<br>where such an interest has appeared, his voice [is]&para;<br>disallowed, even after a division. In a case so contrary&para;<br>not only to the laws of decency, but to the fundamen&para;<br>tal principles of the social compact, which denies to&para;<br>any man to be a judge in his own case, it is for the&para;<br>honor of the house that this rule, of immemorial ob&para;<br>servance, should be strictly adhered to.” A Manual of&para;<br>Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of&para;<br>the United States 31 (1801).&para;<br>Contemporaneous treatises on parliamentary procedure&para;<br>track parts of Jefferson’s formulation. See, e.g., A. Clark,&para;<br>Manual, Compiled and Prepared for the Use of the [New&para;<br>York] Assembly 99 (1816); L. Cushing, Manual of Parlia&para;<br>mentary Practice, Rules of Proceeding and Debate in&para;<br>Deliberative Assemblies 30 (7th ed. 1854).&para;<br>Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges&para;<br>also date back to the founding.

CARRIGAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sel to a party appearing before them. Act of May 8, 1792,&para;<br>ch. 36, §11, 1 Stat. 278–279. In 1821, Congress expanded&para;<br>these bases for recusal to include situations in which “the&para;<br>judge . . . is so related to, or connected with, either party,&para;<br>as to render it improper for him, in his opinion, to sit on&para;<br>the trial of such suit.” Act of Mar. 3, 1821, ch. 51, 3 Stat.&para;<br>643. The statute was again expanded in 1911, to make&para;<br>any “personal bias or prejudice” a basis for recusal. Act of&para;<br>Mar. 3, 1911, §21, 36 Stat. 1090. The current version,&para;<br>which retains much of the 1911 version’s language, is&para;<br>codified at 28 U. S. C. §144. See generally Liteky v. United&para;<br>States, 510 U.

There are of course differences between a legisla&para;<br>tor’s vote and a judge’s, and thus between legislative and&para;<br>judicial recusal rules; nevertheless, there do not appear to&para;<br>have been any serious challenges to judicial recusal stat&para;<br>utes as having unconstitutionally restricted judges’ First&para;<br>Amendment rights.3&para;<br>The Nevada Supreme Court’s belief that recusal rules&para;<br>violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also incon&para;<br>sistent with long-standing traditions in the States. A&para;<br>number of States, by common-law rule, have long required&para;<br>recusal of public officials with a conflict. See, e.g., In&para;<br>re Nashua, 12 N. H. 425, 430 (1841) (“If one of the com&para;<br>missioners be interested, he shall not serve”); Commis&para;<br>sioners’ Court v. Tarver, 25 Ala. 480, 481 (1854) (“If any&para;<br>member . . . has a peculiar, personal interest, such mem&para;<br>ber would be disqualified”); Stubbs v.

See National Conference of State Legisla&para;<br>tures, Voting Recusal Provisions (2009), online at http://&para;<br>www.ncsl.org/?TabID=15357 (as visited June 9, 2011, and&para;<br>available in Clerk of Court’s case file).&para;<br>In an attempt to combat this overwhelming evidence of&para;<br>constitutional acceptability, Carrigan relies on a handful&para;<br>of lower-court cases from the 1980’s and afterwards. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 25 (citing Clark v. United States, 886&para;<br>F. 2d 404 (CADC 1989); Miller v. Hull, 878 F. 2d 523 (CA1&para;<br>1989); and Camacho v. Brandon, 317 F. 3d 153 (CA2&para;<br>2003)). Even if they were relevant, those cases would be&para;<br>too little and too late to contradict the long-recognized&para;<br>need for legislative recusal. But they are not relevant.&para;<br>The first was vacated as moot, see Clark v. United States,&para;<br>915 F. 2d 699, 700, 706 (CADC 1990) (en banc), and the&para;<br>other two involve retaliation amounting to viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination. See Miller, supra, at 533; Camacho, su&para;<br>pra, at 160. In the past we have applied heightened scru&para;<br>tiny to laws that are viewpoint discriminatory even as to&para;<br>speech not protected by the First Amendment, see R. A. V.&para;<br>v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 383–386 (1992). Carrigan does&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4A&para;<br>&para;<br>number of States enacted early judicial recusal laws as well. See,&para;<br>e.g., 1797 Vt.

CARRIGAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not assert that the recusal laws here are viewpoint dis&para;<br>criminatory, nor could he: The statute is content-neutral&para;<br>and applies equally to all legislators regardless of party or&para;<br>position.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>But how can it be that restrictions upon legislators’&para;<br>voting are not restrictions upon legislators’ protected&para;<br>speech? The answer is that a legislator’s vote is the com&para;<br>mitment of his apportioned share of the legislature’s&para;<br>power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal.&para;<br>The legislative power thus committed is not personal to&para;<br>the legislator but belongs to the people; the legislator has&para;<br>no personal right to it. As we said in Raines v. Byrd, 521&para;<br>U. S. 811, 821 (1997), when denying Article III standing to&para;<br>legislators who claimed that their voting power had been&para;<br>diluted by a statute providing for a line-item veto, the&para;<br>legislator casts his vote “as trustee for his constituents,&para;<br>not as a prerogative of personal power.” In this respect,&para;<br>voting by a legislator is different from voting by a citizen.&para;<br>While “a voter’s franchise is a personal right,” “[t]he pro&para;<br>cedures for voting in legislative assemblies . . . pertain to&para;<br>legislators not as individuals but as political representa&para;<br>tives executing the legislative process.” Coleman v. Miller,&para;<br>307 U. S. 433, 469–470 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).&para;<br>Carrigan and JUSTICE ALITO say that legislators often&para;<br>“ ‘us[e] their votes to express deeply held and highly un&para;<br>popular views, often at great personal or political peril.’ ”&para;<br>Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (quoting Brief for Respondent 23). How do they&para;<br>express those deeply held views, one wonders? Do ballots&para;<br>contain a check-one-of-the-boxes attachment that will be&para;<br>displayed to the public, reading something like “( ) I have&para;<br>a deeply held view about this; ( ) this is probably desirable;&para;<br>( ) this is the least of the available evils; ( ) my personal&para;<br>view is the other way, but my constituents want this; ( )&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

There are, to be sure, instances where&para;<br>action conveys a symbolic meaning—such as the burning&para;<br>of a flag to convey disagreement with a country’s policies,&para;<br>see Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989). But the&para;<br>act of voting symbolizes nothing. It discloses, to be sure,&para;<br>that the legislator wishes (for whatever reason) that the&para;<br>proposition on the floor be adopted, just as a physical&para;<br>assault discloses that the attacker dislikes the victim. But&para;<br>neither the one nor the other is an act of communication.&para;<br>Cf. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional&para;<br>Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 66 (2006) (expressive value was&para;<br>“not created by the conduct itself but by the speech that&para;<br>accompanies it”).&para;<br>Moreover, the fact that a nonsymbolic act is the product&para;<br>of deeply held personal belief—even if the actor would like&para;<br>it to convey his deeply held personal belief—does not&para;<br>transform action into First Amendment speech. Nor does&para;<br>the fact that action may have social consequences—such&para;<br>as the unpopularity that cost John Quincy Adams his&para;<br>Senate seat resulting from his vote in favor of the Em&para;<br>bargo Act of 1807, see post, at 1. However unpopular&para;<br>Adams’ vote may have made him, and however deeply&para;<br>Adams felt that his vote was the right thing to do, the act&para;<br>of voting was still nonsymbolic conduct engaged in for an&para;<br>independent governmental purpose.&para;<br>Even if it were true that the vote itself could “express&para;<br>deeply held and highly unpopular views,” the argument&para;<br>would still miss the mark. This Court has rejected the&para;<br>notion that the First Amendment confers a right to use&para;<br>governmental mechanics to convey a message. For exam&para;<br>ple, in Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S.&para;<br>351 (1997), we upheld a State’s prohibition on multiple&para;<br>party or “fusion” candidates for elected office against a&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>First Amendment challenge. We admitted that a State’s&para;<br>ban on a person’s appearing on the ballot as the candidate&para;<br>of more than one party might prevent a party from “using&para;<br>the ballot to communicate to the public it supports a par&para;<br>ticular candidate who is already another party’s candi&para;<br>date,” id., at 362; but we nonetheless were “unpersuaded&para;<br>. . . by the party’s contention that it has a right to use the&para;<br>ballot itself to send a particularized message.” Id., at 362–&para;<br>363; see also Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 438&para;<br>(1992). In like manner, a legislator has no right to use&para;<br>official powers for expressive purposes.&para;<br>Carrigan and JUSTICE ALITO also cite Doe v. Reed, 561&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010), as establishing “the expressive character&para;<br>of voting.” Post, at 2; see also Brief for Respondent 26.&para;<br>But Reed did no such thing. That case held only that a&para;<br>citizen’s signing of a petition—“ ‘core political speech,’ ”&para;<br>Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421–422 (1988)—was not&para;<br>deprived of its protected status simply because, under&para;<br>state law, a petition that garnered a sufficient number of&para;<br>signatures would suspend the state law to which it per&para;<br>tained, pending a referendum. See Reed, 561 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (opinion of SCALIA,&para;<br>J.). It is one thing to say that an inherently expressive act&para;<br>remains so despite its having governmental effect, but it is&para;<br>altogether another thing to say that a governmental act&para;<br>becomes expressive simply because the governmental&para;<br>actor wishes it to be so. We have never said the latter is&para;<br>true.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO reasons as follows: (1) If an ordinary citizen were to&para;<br>vote in a straw poll on an issue pending before a legislative body, that&para;<br>vote would be speech; (2) if a member of the legislative body were to do&para;<br>the same, it would be no less expressive; therefore (3) the legislator’s&para;<br>actual vote must also be expressive. This conclusion does not follow. A&para;<br>legislator voting on a bill is not fairly analogized to one simply discuss&para;<br>ing that bill or expressing an opinion for or against it. The former is&para;<br>performing a governmental act as a representative of his constituents,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The democratic process&para;<br>presumes a constant interchange of voices. Quite apart&para;<br>from the act of voting, speech takes place both in the&para;<br>election process and during the routine course of commu&para;<br>nications between and among legislators, candidates,&para;<br>citizens, groups active in the political process, the press,&para;<br>and the public at large. This speech and expression often&para;<br>finds powerful form in groups and associations with whom&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>a legislator or candidate has long and close ties, ties made&para;<br>all the stronger by shared outlook and civic purpose. The&para;<br>process is so intricate a part of communication in a democ&para;<br>racy that it is difficult to describe in summary form, lest&para;<br>its fundamental character be understated. It may suffice,&para;<br>however, to note just a few examples.&para;<br>Assume a citizen has strong and carefully considered&para;<br>positions on family life; the environment; economic princi&para;<br>ples; criminal justice; religious values; or the rights of&para;<br>persons. Assume, too, that based on those beliefs, he or&para;<br>she has personal ties with others who share those views.&para;<br>The occasion may arise when, to promote and protect&para;<br>these beliefs, close friends and associates, perhaps in&para;<br>concert with organized groups with whom the citizen also&para;<br>has close ties, urge the citizen to run for office. These&para;<br>persons and entities may offer strong support in an elec&para;<br>tion campaign, support which itself can be expression in&para;<br>its classic form. The question then arises what application&para;<br>the Nevada statute has if a legislator who was elected&para;<br>with that support were to vote upon legislation central to&para;<br>the shared cause, or, for that matter, any other cause&para;<br>supported by those friends and affiliates.&para;<br>As the Court notes, Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007)&para;<br>provides:&para;<br>“[A] public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the&para;<br>passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in&para;<br>the consideration of, a matter with respect to which&para;<br>the independence of judgment of a reasonable person&para;<br>in his situation would be materially affected by . . .&para;<br>[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests&para;<br>of others.”&para;<br>There is, in my view, a serious concern that the statute&para;<br>imposes burdens on the communications and expressions&para;<br>just discussed. The immediate response might be that the&para;<br>statute does not apply because its application is confined&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>to the legislator’s “commitment in a private capacity to the&para;<br>interests of others.” That proposition may be a debatable&para;<br>one. At least without the benefit of further submissions or&para;<br>argument or explanation, it seems that one fair interpre&para;<br>tation, if not the necessary one, is that the statute could&para;<br>apply to a legislator whose personal life is tied to the&para;<br>longstanding, close friendships he or she has forged in the&para;<br>common cause now at stake.&para;<br>The application of the statute’s language to the case just&para;<br>supposed, and to any number of variations on the supposi&para;<br>tion, is not apparent. And if the statute imposes unjusti&para;<br>fied burdens on speech or association protected by the&para;<br>First Amendment, or if it operates to chill or suppress the&para;<br>exercise of those freedoms by reason of vague terms or&para;<br>overbroad coverage, it is invalid. See United States v.&para;<br>Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 292–293, 304 (2008). A statute of&para;<br>this sort is an invitation to selective enforcement; and&para;<br>even if enforcement is undertaken in good faith, the dan&para;<br>gers of suppression of particular speech or associational&para;<br>ties may well be too significant to be accepted. See Gentile&para;<br>v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1051 (1991).&para;<br>The interests here at issue are at the heart of the First&para;<br>Amendment. “[T]he First Amendment has its fullest and&para;<br>most urgent application to speech uttered during a cam&para;<br>paign for political office.” Eu v. San Francisco County&para;<br>Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court has&para;<br>made it clear that “the right of citizens to band together in&para;<br>promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse&para;<br>their political views” is among the First Amendment’s&para;<br>most pressing concerns. Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S.&para;<br>581, 586 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The constitutionality of a law prohibiting a legislative&para;<br>or executive official from voting on matters advanced by or&para;<br>associated with a political supporter is therefore a most&para;<br>serious matter from the standpoint of the logical and&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>inevitable burden on speech and association that preceded&para;<br>the vote. The restriction may impose a significant burden&para;<br>on activities protected by the First Amendment. As a&para;<br>general matter, citizens voice their support and lend their&para;<br>aid because they wish to confer the powers of public office&para;<br>on those whose positions correspond with their own. That&para;<br>dynamic, moreover, links the principles of participation&para;<br>and representation at the heart of our democratic govern&para;<br>ment. Just as candidates announce positions in exchange&para;<br>for citizens’ votes, Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 55–56&para;<br>(1982), so too citizens offer endorsements, advertise their&para;<br>views, and assist political campaigns based upon bonds of&para;<br>common purpose. These are the mechanisms that sustain&para;<br>representative democracy. See ibid.&para;<br>The Court has held that due process may require&para;<br>recusal in the context of certain judicial determinations,&para;<br>see Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2009); but as the foregoing indicates, it is not at all clear&para;<br>that a statute of this breadth can be enacted to extend&para;<br>principles of judicial impartiality to a quite different con&para;<br>text. The differences between the role of political bodies in&para;<br>formulating and enforcing public policy, on the one hand,&para;<br>and the role of courts in adjudicating individual disputes&para;<br>according to law, on the other, see ante, at 6, may call for a&para;<br>different understanding of the responsibilities attendant&para;<br>upon holders of those respective offices and of the legiti&para;<br>mate restrictions that may be imposed upon them.&para;<br>For these reasons, the possibility that Carrigan was&para;<br>censured because he was thought to be beholden to a&para;<br>person who helped him win an election raises constitu&para;<br>tional concerns of the first magnitude.&para;<br>As the Court observes, however, the question whether&para;<br>Nevada’s recusal statute was applied in a manner that&para;<br>burdens the First Amendment freedoms discussed above is&para;<br>not presented in this case.

Ante, at 8. As respondent notes, “[o]ur his&para;<br>tory is rich with tales of legislators using their votes to&para;<br>express deeply held and highly unpopular views, often at&para;<br>great personal or political peril.” Brief for Respondent 23.&para;<br>To illustrate this point, respondent notes, among other&para;<br>famous incidents, John Quincy Adams’ vote in favor of the&para;<br>Embargo Act of 1807, a vote that is said to have cost&para;<br>him his Senate seat, and Sam Houston’s vote against the&para;<br>Kansas-Nebraska Act, a vote that was deeply unpopular&para;<br>in the South. Id., at 23–24 (citing J. Kennedy, Profiles in&para;<br>Courage 48, 109 (commemorative ed. 1991)).&para;<br>In response to respondent’s argument, the Court sug&para;<br>gests that the “expressive value” of such votes is “ ‘not&para;<br>created by the conduct itself but by the speech that ac&para;<br>companies it.’ ” Ante, at 9. This suggestion, however, is&para;<br>surely wrong. If John Quincy Adams and Sam Houston&para;<br>had done no more than cast the votes in question, their&para;<br>votes would still have spoken loudly and clearly to every&para;<br>one who was interested in the bills in question. Voting&para;<br>has an expressive component in and of itself. The Court’s&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v.

Ibid.*&para;<br>A legislative vote is not speech, the Court tells us, be&para;<br>cause the vote may express, not the legislator’s sincere&para;<br>personal view, but simply the view that is favored by the&para;<br>legislator’s constituents. See ibid. But the same is some&para;<br>times true of legislators’ speeches.&para;<br>Not only is the Court incorrect in its analysis of the&para;<br>expressive character of voting, but the Court’s position is&para;<br>inconsistent with our reasoning just last Term in Doe v.&para;<br>Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). There, respondents argued&para;<br>that “signing a petition is a legally operative legislative&para;<br>act and therefore ‘does not involve any significant expres&para;<br>sive element.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Brief for&para;<br>Respondent Reed 31). But the Court rejected this argu&para;<br>ment, stating:&para;<br>“It is true that signing a referendum petition may ul&para;<br>timately have the legal consequence of requiring the&para;<br>secretary of state to place the referendum on the bal&para;<br>lot. But we do not see how adding such legal effect to&para;<br>an expressive activity somehow deprives that activity&para;<br>of its expressive component, taking it outside the&para;<br>scope of the First Amendment.” 561 U.
