Argued January 14, 2014—Decided June 9, 2014&para;<br>Bellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA), filed a voluntary chapter 7&para;<br>bankruptcy petition. Respondent Peter Arkison, the bankruptcy&para;<br>trustee, filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against petitioner&para;<br>Executive Benefits Insurance Agency (EBIA) and others alleging the&para;<br>fraudulent conveyance of assets from BIA to EBIA. The Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court granted summary judgment for the trustee. EBIA appealed to&para;<br>the District Court, which affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s decision&para;<br>after de novo review and entered judgment for the trustee. While&para;<br>EBIA’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, this Court held that&para;<br>Article III did not permit a Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment&para;<br>on a counterclaim for tortious interference, even though final&para;<br>adjudication of that claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized&para;<br>by statute. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. In light of Stern,&para;<br>EBIA moved to dismiss its appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit rejected EBIA’s motion and affirmed. It acknowledged the&para;<br>trustee’s claims as “Stern claims,” i.e., claims designated for final&para;<br>adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but&para;<br>prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that EBIA had&para;<br>impliedly consented to jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals also&para;<br>observed that the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment could instead be&para;<br>treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to&para;<br>de novo review by the District Court.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of 1984, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in&para;<br>bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory&para;<br>categories of proceedings: “core” proceedings and “non-core”&para;<br>proceedings. See generally 28 U. S. C. §157. In core proceedings, a&para;<br>bankruptcy judge “may hear and determine . . . and enter&para;<br>appropriate orders and judgments,” subject to the district court’s&para;<br>traditional appellate review. §157(b)(1). In non-core proceedings—&para;<br>those that are “not . . . core” but are “otherwise related to a case&para;<br>under title 11,” §157(c)(1)—final judgment must be entered by the&para;<br>district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judge’s proposed&para;<br>findings of fact and conclusions of law, ibid., except that the&para;<br>bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent,&para;<br>§157(c)(2).&para;<br>In Stern, the Court confronted an underlying conflict between the&para;<br>1984 Act and the requirements of Article III. The Court held that&para;<br>Article III prohibits Congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with&para;<br>the authority to finally adjudicate the “core” claim of tortious&para;<br>interference. The Court did not, however, address how courts should&para;<br>proceed when they encounter a Stern claim. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>2. Stern claims may proceed as non-core within the meaning of&para;<br>§157(c). Lower courts have described Stern claims as creating a&para;<br>statutory “gap,” since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized&para;<br>to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding.&para;<br>However, this so-called gap is closed by the Act’s severability&para;<br>provision, which instructs that where a “provision of the Act or [its]&para;<br>application . . . is held invalid, the remainder of th[e] Act . . . is not&para;<br>affected thereby.” 98 Stat. 344. As applicable here, when a court&para;<br>identifies a Stern claim, it has “held invalid” the “application” of&para;<br>§157(b), and the “remainder” not affected includes §157(c), which&para;<br>governs non-core proceedings. Accordingly, where a claim otherwise&para;<br>satisfies §157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court should simply treat the&para;<br>Stern claim as non-core. This conclusion accords with the Court’s&para;<br>general approach to severability, which is to give effect to the valid&para;<br>portion of a statute so long as it “remains ‘fully operative as a law,’ ”&para;<br>Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,&para;<br>561 U. S. 477, 509, and so long as the statutory text and context do&para;<br>not suggest that Congress would have preferred no statute at all,&para;<br>ibid. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>3. Section 157(c)(1)’s procedures apply to the fraudulent&para;<br>conveyance claims here. This Court assumes without deciding that&para;<br>these claims are Stern claims, which Article III does not permit to be&para;<br>treated as “core” claims under §157(b). But because the claims assert&para;<br>that property of the bankruptcy estate was improperly removed, they&para;<br>are self-evidently “related to a case under title 11.” Accordingly, they&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by §157(c)(1).&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court would have been permitted to follow that&para;<br>provision’s procedures, i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and&para;<br>conclusions of law to the District Court for de novo review. Pp. 11–&para;<br>12.&para;<br>4. Here, the District Court’s de novo review of the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court’s order and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any&para;<br>potential error in the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of judgment. EBIA&para;<br>contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review by an Article&para;<br>III court regardless of whether the parties consented to bankruptcy&para;<br>court adjudication. In the alternative, EBIA asserts that even if such&para;<br>consent were constitutionally permissible, it did not in fact consent.&para;<br>Neither contention need be addressed here, because EBIA received&para;<br>the same review from the District Court that it would have received&para;<br>had the Bankruptcy Court treated the claims as non-core proceedings&para;<br>under §157(c)(1).

Stern did not, however, decide how bankruptcy or district courts should proceed when a “Stern&para;<br>claim” is identified. We hold today that when, under&para;<br>Stern’s reasoning, the Constitution does not permit a&para;<br>bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a bankruptcyrelated claim, the relevant statute nevertheless permits a&para;<br>bankruptcy court to issue proposed findings of fact and&para;<br>conclusions of law to be reviewed de novo by the district&para;<br>court. Because the District Court in this case conducted&para;<br>the de novo review that petitioner demands, we affirm the&para;<br>judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the District&para;<br>Court’s decision.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS.

The next day,&para;<br>Paleveda used BIA funds to incorporate Executive Benefits Insurance Agency, Inc.

The assets were deposited into an&para;<br>account held jointly by ARIS and EBIA and ultimately&para;<br>credited to EBIA at the end of the year.&para;<br>On June 1, 2006, BIA filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for&para;<br>the Western District of Washington. Peter Arkison, the&para;<br>bankruptcy trustee and respondent in this case, filed a&para;<br>complaint in the same Bankruptcy Court against EBIA&para;<br>and others. As relevant here, the complaint alleged that&para;<br>Paleveda used various methods to fraudulently convey&para;<br>BIA assets to EBIA.1 EBIA filed an answer and denied&para;<br>many of the trustee’s allegations.&para;<br>After some disagreement as to whether the trustee’s&para;<br>claims should continue in the Bankruptcy Court or instead&para;<br>proceed before a jury in Federal District Court, the trustee&para;<br>filed a motion for summary judgment against EBIA in the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court.

We&para;<br>reserve that question for another day.&para;<br>5 Bankruptcy referees were designated “judges” in 1973. See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.

The Bankruptcy Reform Act eliminated the historical distinction&para;<br>between “ ‘summary’ ” jurisdiction belonging to bankruptcy&para;<br>courts and “ ‘plenary’ ” jurisdiction belonging to either a&para;<br>district court or an appropriate state court. Northern&para;<br>Pipeline, supra, at 54 (plurality opinion); see also 1 W.&para;<br>Norton &amp; W. Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice §4:12,&para;<br>p. 4–44 (3d ed. 2013). Instead, the 1978 Act mandated&para;<br>that bankruptcy judges “shall exercise” jurisdiction over&para;<br>“all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or&para;<br>related to cases under title 11.” 28 U. S. C. §§1471(b)–(c)&para;<br>(1976 ed., Supp. IV). Under the 1978 Act, bankruptcy&para;<br>judges were “vested with all of the ‘powers of a court of&para;<br>equity, law, and admiralty,’ ” with only a few limited exceptions. Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 55 (plurality&para;<br>opinion) (quoting §1481). Notwithstanding their expanded&para;<br>jurisdiction and authority, these bankruptcy judges were&para;<br>not afforded the protections of Article III—namely, life&para;<br>tenure and a salary that may not be diminished. Id.,&para;<br>at 53.&para;<br>In Northern Pipeline, this Court addressed whether&para;<br>bankruptcy judges under the 1978 Act could “constitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law&para;<br>contract claim” against an entity not otherwise a party to&para;<br>the proceeding. Id., at 53, 87, n. 40. The Court concluded&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that assignment of that claim for resolution by the bankruptcy judge “violates Art. III of the Constitution.” Id., at&para;<br>52, 87 (plurality opinion); see id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment). The Court distinguished between cases involving so-called “public rights,” which may&para;<br>be removed from the jurisdiction of Article III courts, and&para;<br>cases involving “private rights,” which may not. See id., at&para;<br>69–71 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). Specifically, the plurality noted that&para;<br>“the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at&para;<br>the core of the federal bankruptcy power, must be distinguished from the adjudication of state-created private&para;<br>rights,” which belong in an Article III court. Id., at 71–72,&para;<br>and n. 26.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Against that historical backdrop, Congress enacted the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of&para;<br>1984—the Act at issue in this case. See 28 U. S. C. §151&para;<br>et seq. Under the 1984 Act, federal district courts have&para;<br>“original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title&para;<br>11,” §1334(a), and may refer to bankruptcy judges any&para;<br>“proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related&para;<br>to a case under title 11,” §157(a).6 Bankruptcy judges&para;<br>serve 14-year terms subject to removal for cause,&para;<br>§§152(a)(1), (e), and their salaries are set by Congress,&para;<br>§153(a).&para;<br>The 1984 Act largely restored the bifurcated jurisdictional scheme that existed prior to the 1978 Act. The 1984&para;<br>Act implements that bifurcated scheme by dividing all&para;<br>matters that may be referred to the bankruptcy court&para;<br>into two categories: “core” and “non-core” proceedings. See&para;<br>generally §157.7 It is the bankruptcy court’s responsibility&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 In addition, district courts may also withdraw such matters from the&para;<br>bankruptcy courts for “cause shown.” §157(d).&para;<br>7 In using the term “core,” Congress tracked the Northern Pipeline&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Proc. 7012. For core&para;<br>proceedings, the statute contains a nonexhaustive list of&para;<br>examples, including—as relevant here—“proceedings to&para;<br>determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances.”&para;<br>§157(b)(2)(H). The statute authorizes bankruptcy judges&para;<br>to “hear and determine” such claims and “enter appropriate orders and judgments” on them. §157(b)(1). A final&para;<br>judgment entered in a core proceeding is appealable to the&para;<br>district court, §158(a)(1), which reviews the judgment&para;<br>under traditional appellate standards, Rule 8013.&para;<br>As for “non-core” proceedings—i.e., proceedings that are&para;<br>“not . . . core” but are “otherwise related to a case under&para;<br>title 11”—the statute authorizes a bankruptcy court to&para;<br>“hear [the] proceeding,” and then “submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.”&para;<br>§157(c)(1). The district court must then review those&para;<br>proposed findings and conclusions de novo and enter any&para;<br>final orders or judgments. Ibid. There is one statutory&para;<br>exception to this rule: If all parties “consent,” the statute&para;<br>permits the bankruptcy judge “to hear and determine and&para;<br>to enter appropriate orders and judgments” as if the proceeding were core. §157(c)(2).&para;<br>Put simply: If a matter is core, the statute empowers the&para;<br>bankruptcy judge to enter final judgment on the claim,&para;<br>subject to appellate review by the district court. If a matter is non-core, and the parties have not consented to final&para;<br>adjudication by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy&para;<br>judge must propose findings of fact and conclusions of law.&para;<br>Then, the district court must review the proceeding&para;<br>de novo and enter final judgment.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>plurality’s use of the same term as a description of those claims that fell&para;<br>within the scope of the historical bankruptcy court’s power.

AGENCY v. ARKISON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>&para;<br>Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, confronted an underlying conflict between the 1984 Act and the requirements of&para;<br>Article III. In particular, Stern considered a constitutional&para;<br>challenge to the statutory designation of a particular claim&para;<br>as “core.” The bankrupt in that case had filed a commonlaw counterclaim for tortious interference against a creditor to the estate. Id., at ___. Section 157(b)(2)(C), as&para;<br>added by the 1984 Act, lists “counterclaims by the estate&para;<br>against persons filing claims against the estate” as a core&para;<br>proceeding, thereby authorizing the bankruptcy court to&para;<br>adjudicate the claim to final judgment. See supra this&para;<br>page. The respondent in Stern objected that Congress had&para;<br>violated Article III by vesting the power to adjudicate the&para;<br>tortious interference counterclaim in bankruptcy court.&para;<br>Stern, 564 U. S., at ___.&para;<br>We agreed. Id., at ___. In that circumstance, we held,&para;<br>Congress had improperly vested the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>with the “ ‘ judicial Power of the United States,’ ” just as in&para;<br>Northern Pipeline. 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 21,&para;<br>38). Because “[n]o ‘public right’ exception excuse[d] the&para;<br>failure to comply with Article III,” we concluded that&para;<br>Congress could not confer on the Bankruptcy Court the&para;<br>authority to finally decide the claim. Id., at ___. (slip op.,&para;<br>at 21).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Stern made clear that some claims labeled by Congress&para;<br>as “core” may not be adjudicated by a bankruptcy court in&para;<br>the manner designated by §157(b). Stern did not, however, address how the bankruptcy court should proceed&para;<br>under those circumstances. We turn to that question now.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit held that the fraudulent conveyance&para;<br>claims at issue here are Stern claims—that is, proceedings&para;<br>that are defined as “core” under §157(b) but may not, as a&para;<br>constitutional matter, be adjudicated as such (at least in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the absence of consent, see n. 4, supra. See 702 F. 3d, at&para;<br>562. Neither party contests that conclusion.&para;<br>The lower courts, including the Ninth Circuit in this&para;<br>case, have described Stern claims as creating a statutory&para;<br>“gap.” See, e.g., 702 F. 3d, at 565. By definition, a Stern&para;<br>claim may not be adjudicated to final judgment by the&para;<br>bankruptcy court, as in a typical core proceeding. But the&para;<br>alternative procedure, whereby the bankruptcy court&para;<br>submits proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,&para;<br>applies only to non-core claims. See §157(c)(1). Because&para;<br>§157(b) does not explicitly authorize bankruptcy judges to&para;<br>submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in&para;<br>a core proceeding, the argument goes, Stern created a&para;<br>“gap” in the bankruptcy statute. See 702 F. 3d, at 565.&para;<br>That gap purportedly renders the bankruptcy court powerless to act on Stern claims, see Brief for Petitioner 46–48,&para;<br>thus requiring the district court to hear all Stern claims in&para;<br>the first instance.&para;<br>We disagree. The statute permits Stern claims to proceed as non-core within the meaning of §157(c). In particular, the statute contains a severability provision that&para;<br>accounts for decisions, like Stern, that invalidate certain&para;<br>applications of the statute:&para;<br>“If any provision of this Act or the application thereof&para;<br>to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Act, or the application of that provision to persons or circumstances other than those as&para;<br>to which it is held invalid, is not affected thereby.” 98&para;<br>Stat. 344, note following 28 U. S. C. §151.&para;<br>The plain text of this severability provision closes the&para;<br>so-called “gap” created by Stern claims. When a court&para;<br>identifies a claim as a Stern claim, it has necessarily “held&para;<br>invalid” the “application” of §157(b)—i.e., the “core” label&para;<br>and its attendant procedures—to the litigant’s claim.&para;<br>Note following §151. In that circumstance, the statute&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>instructs that “the remainder of th[e] Act . . . is not affected&para;<br>thereby.” Ibid. That remainder includes §157(c), which&para;<br>governs non-core proceedings. With the “core” category no&para;<br>longer available for the Stern claim at issue, we look to&para;<br>§157(c)(1) to determine whether the claim may be adjudicated as a non-core claim—specifically, whether it is “not a&para;<br>core proceeding” but is “otherwise related to a case under&para;<br>title 11.” If the claim satisfies the criteria of §157(c)(1),&para;<br>the bankruptcy court simply treats the claims as non-core:&para;<br>The bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and&para;<br>submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law&para;<br>to the district court for de novo review and entry of&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>The conclusion that the remainder of the statute may&para;<br>continue to apply to Stern claims accords with our general&para;<br>approach to severability. We ordinarily give effect to the&para;<br>valid portion of a partially unconstitutional statute so long&para;<br>as it “remains ‘ “fully operative as a law,” ’ ” Free Enterprise&para;<br>Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561&para;<br>U. S. 477, 509 (2010) (quoting New York v. United States,&para;<br>505 U. S. 144, 186 (1992)), and so long as it is not “ ‘evident’ ” from the statutory text and context that Congress&para;<br>would have preferred no statute at all, 561 U. S., at 509&para;<br>(quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684&para;<br>(1987)). Neither of those concerns applies here. Thus,&para;<br>§157(c) may be applied naturally to Stern claims. And,&para;<br>EBIA has identified “nothing in the statute’s text or historical context” that makes it “evident” that Congress&para;<br>would prefer to suspend Stern claims in limbo. 561 U. S.,&para;<br>at 509.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 To the contrary, we noted in Stern that removal of claims from core&para;<br>bankruptcy jurisdiction does not “meaningfully chang[e] the division of&para;<br>labor in the current statute.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 37). Accepting EBIA’s contention that district courts are required to hear all Stern&para;<br>claims in the first instance, see Brief for Petitioner 46–48, would&para;<br>dramatically alter the division of responsibility set by Congress.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Now we must determine whether the procedures set&para;<br>forth in §157(c)(1) apply to the fraudulent conveyance&para;<br>claims at issue in this case. The Court of Appeals held,&para;<br>and we assume without deciding, that the fraudulent&para;<br>conveyance claims in this case are Stern claims. See Part&para;<br>III, supra. For purposes of this opinion, the “application”&para;<br>of both the “core” label and the procedures of §157(b) to&para;<br>the trustee’s claims has therefore been “held invalid.”&para;<br>Note following §151. Accordingly, we must decide whether&para;<br>the fraudulent conveyance claims brought by the trustee&para;<br>are within the scope of §157(c)(1)—that is, “not . . . core”&para;<br>proceedings but “otherwise related to a case under title&para;<br>11.” We hold that this language encompasses the trustee’s&para;<br>claims of fraudulent conveyance.&para;<br>First, the fraudulent conveyance claims in this case are&para;<br>“not . . . core.” The Ninth Circuit held—and no party&para;<br>disputes—that Article III does not permit these claims to&para;<br>be treated as “core.” See Part III, supra. Second, the&para;<br>fraudulent conveyance claims are self-evidently “related to&para;<br>a case under title 11.” At bottom, a fraudulent conveyance&para;<br>claim asserts that property that should have been part of&para;<br>the bankruptcy estate and therefore available for distribution to creditors pursuant to Title 11 was improperly&para;<br>removed. That sort of claim is “related to a case under&para;<br>title 11” under any plausible construction of the statutory&para;<br>text, and no party contends otherwise. See, e.g., Celotex&para;<br>Corp. v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 300, 307, n. 5, 308 (1995)&para;<br>(“Proceedings ‘related to’ the bankruptcy include . . . suits&para;<br>between third parties which have an effect on the bankruptcy estate”). Accordingly, because these Stern claims&para;<br>fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by&para;<br>§157(c)(1), the Bankruptcy Court would have been permitted to follow the procedures required by that provision,&para;<br>i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law to the District Court to be reviewed de novo.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Although this case did not proceed in precisely that&para;<br>fashion, we affirm nonetheless. A brief procedural history&para;<br>of the case helps explain why.&para;<br>As noted, §157 permits a bankruptcy court to adjudicate&para;<br>a claim to final judgment in two circumstances—in core&para;<br>proceedings, see §157(b), and in non-core proceedings&para;<br>“with the consent of all the parties,” §157(c)(2). In this&para;<br>case, the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of&para;<br>the bankruptcy trustee without specifying in its order&para;<br>whether it was acting pursuant to §157(b) (core) or&para;<br>§157(c)(2) (non-core with consent). EBIA immediately&para;<br>appealed to the District Court, see §158, but it did not&para;<br>argue that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional&para;<br>authority to grant summary judgment. As a result, the&para;<br>District Court did not analyze whether there was a Stern&para;<br>problem and did not, as some district courts have done,&para;<br>relabel the bankruptcy order as mere proposed findings of&para;<br>fact and conclusions of law. See, e.g., In re Parco Merged&para;<br>Media Corp., 489 B. R. 323, 326 (Me. 2013) (collecting&para;<br>cases). The District Court did, however, review de novo&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Court’s grant of summary judgment for&para;<br>the trustee—a legal question—and issued a reasoned&para;<br>opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court. The District&para;<br>Court then separately entered judgment in favor of the&para;<br>trustee. See 28 U. S. C. §1334(b) (“[T]he district courts&para;<br>shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil&para;<br>proceedings . . . related to cases under title 11”).&para;<br>EBIA now objects on constitutional grounds to the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court’s disposition of the fraudulent conveyance claims. EBIA contends that it was constitutionally&para;<br>entitled to review of its fraudulent conveyance claims by&para;<br>an Article III court regardless of whether the parties&para;<br>consented to adjudication by a bankruptcy court. Brief for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner 25–27. In an alternative argument, EBIA&para;<br>asserts that even if the Constitution permitted the Bankruptcy Court to adjudicate its claim with the consent of&para;<br>the parties, it did not in fact consent. Id., at 38.&para;<br>In light of the procedural posture of this case, however,&para;<br>we need not decide whether EBIA’s contentions are correct&para;<br>on either score. At bottom, EBIA argues that it was entitled to have an Article III court review de novo and enter&para;<br>judgment on the fraudulent conveyance claims asserted by&para;<br>the trustee. In effect, EBIA received exactly that. The&para;<br>District Court conducted de novo review of the summary&para;<br>judgment claims, concluding in a written opinion that&para;<br>there were no disputed issues of material fact and that the&para;<br>trustee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In&para;<br>accordance with its statutory authority over matters&para;<br>related to the bankruptcy, see §1334(b), the District Court&para;<br>then separately entered judgment in favor of the trustee.&para;<br>EBIA thus received the same review from the District&para;<br>Court that it would have received if the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>had treated the fraudulent conveyance claims as non-core&para;<br>proceedings under §157(c)(1). In short, even if EBIA is&para;<br>correct that the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of judgment was&para;<br>invalid, the District Court’s de novo review and entry of its&para;<br>own valid final judgment cured any error. Cf. Carter v.&para;<br>Kubler, 320 U. S. 243, 248 (1943) (bankruptcy commissioner’s error was cured after the District Court “made&para;<br>an independent and complete review of the conflicting&para;<br>evidence”).&para;<br>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
