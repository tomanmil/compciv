Argued December 6, 2010—Decided March 1, 2011&para;<br>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a two-step process for&para;<br>adjudicating veterans’ benefits claims for service-connected disabili&para;<br>ties: A VA regional office makes an initial decision on the claim; and&para;<br>a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek de novo review&para;<br>in the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Before 1988, a veteran whose&para;<br>claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further re&para;<br>view, but the Veterans’ Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court&para;<br>of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribu&para;<br>nal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans. A veteran must&para;<br>file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date&para;<br>when the Board’s final decision is properly mailed. 38 U. S. C.&para;<br>§7266(a).&para;<br>After the VA denied David Henderson’s claim for supplemental&para;<br>disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court,&para;<br>missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days. Henderson argued&para;<br>that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable toll&para;<br>ing principles. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided&para;<br>Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, which held that the statutory limita&para;<br>tion on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in&para;<br>an ordinary civil case is “jurisdictional,” so that a party’s failure to&para;<br>file within that period could not be excused. The Veterans Court con&para;<br>cluded that Bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day&para;<br>deadline and dismissed Henderson’s untimely appeal. The Federal&para;<br>Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>does not have jurisdictional consequences. Pp. 4–13.&para;<br>(a) Branding a procedural rule as going to a court’s subject-matter&para;<br>jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.&para;<br>Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do&para;<br>not exceed the scope of their subject-matter jurisdiction and thus&para;<br>must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either&para;<br>overlook or elect not to press. Jurisdictional rules may also cause a&para;<br>waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants, since&para;<br>objections may be raised at any time, even after trial. Because of&para;<br>these drastic consequences, this Court has urged that a rule should&para;<br>not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court’s adjudi&para;<br>catory capacity, i.e., its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. E.g.,&para;<br>Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Among the rules&para;<br>that should not be described as jurisdictional are “claim-processing&para;<br>rules,” which seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by re&para;<br>quiring parties to take certain procedural steps at specified times.&para;<br>Although filing deadlines are quintessential claim-processing rules,&para;<br>Congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to such rules.&para;<br>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, applied a “readily adminis&para;<br>trable bright line” rule to determine whether Congress has done so:&para;<br>There must be a “clear” indication that Congress wanted the rule to&para;<br>be “jurisdictional.” Id., at 515–516. “[C]ontext, including this Court’s&para;<br>interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant,”&para;<br>Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___, to whether Congress has spoken clearly&para;<br>on this point. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) Congress did not clearly prescribe that the 120-day deadline&para;<br>here be jurisdictional. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(1) None of the precedents cited by the parties controls here. All&para;<br>of the cases they cite—e.g., Bowles, supra; Stone v. INS, 514 U. S.&para;<br>386; and Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467—involved review&para;<br>by Article III courts. This case, by contrast, involves review by an&para;<br>Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme. Instead&para;<br>of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative de&para;<br>cisions, this Court attempts to ascertain Congress’ intent regarding&para;<br>the particular type of review at issue. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(2) Several factors indicate that 120-day deadline was not meant&para;<br>to be jurisdictional. The terms of §7266(a), which sets the deadline,&para;<br>provide no clear indication that the provision was meant to carry ju&para;<br>risdictional consequences. It neither speaks in “jurisdictional terms”&para;<br>nor refers “in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court],”&para;<br>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394. Nor does&para;<br>§7266’s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication. Its&para;<br>placement in a subchapter entitled “Procedure,” and not in the sub&para;<br>chapter entitled “Organization and Jurisdiction,” suggests that Con&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>gress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule. Most&para;<br>telling, however, are the singular characteristics of the review&para;<br>scheme that Congress created for adjudicating veterans’ benefits&para;<br>claims. Congress’ longstanding solicitude for veterans, United States&para;<br>v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647, is plainly reflected in the VJRA and in&para;<br>subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran’s fa&para;<br>vor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA deci&para;<br>sions. The contrast between ordinary civil litigation—which provided&para;<br>the context in Bowles—and the system Congress created for veterans&para;<br>is dramatic. In ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be com&para;<br>menced within a specified limitations period; the litigation is adver&para;<br>sarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims&para;<br>and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both&para;<br>parties may appeal an adverse decision; and a final judgment may be&para;<br>reopened only in narrow circumstances. By contrast, a veteran need&para;<br>not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA pro&para;<br>ceedings are informal and nonadversarial; and the VA assists veter&para;<br>ans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the&para;<br>benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence. A veteran who loses&para;<br>before the Board may obtain review in the Veterans Court, but a&para;<br>Board decision in the veteran’s favor is final. And a veteran may re&para;<br>open a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence. Rigid&para;<br>jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period would clash sharply&para;<br>with this scheme. Particularly in light of “the canon that provisions&para;<br>for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in&para;<br>the beneficiaries’ favor,” King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215,&para;<br>220–221, n. 9, this Court sees no clear indication that the 120-day&para;<br>limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany&para;<br>the jurisdiction tag. Contrary to the Government’s argument, the&para;<br>lack of review opportunities for veterans before 1988 is of little help&para;<br>in interpreting §7266(a). Section 7266(a) was enacted as part of the&para;<br>VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.&para;<br>Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>589 F. 3d 1201, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Mem&para;<br>bers joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the consideration or&para;<br>decision of the case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal&para;<br>with the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date&para;<br>when the Board’s final decision is properly mailed. 38&para;<br>U. S. C. §7266(a). This case presents the question wheth&para;<br>er a veteran’s failure to file a notice of appeal within the&para;<br>120-day period should be regarded as having “jurisdic&para;<br>tional” consequences. We hold that it should not.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers&para;<br>the federal program that provides benefits to veterans&para;<br>with service-connected disabilities. The VA has a two-step&para;<br>process for the adjudication of these claims. First, a VA&para;<br>regional office receives and processes veterans’ claims and&para;<br>makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>benefits. Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the&para;<br>regional office’s decision, the veteran may obtain de novo&para;<br>review by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The Board is a&para;<br>body within the VA that makes the agency’s final decision&para;<br>in cases appealed to it. §§7101, 7104(a).&para;<br>The VA’s adjudicatory “process is designed to function&para;<br>throughout with a high degree of informality and solici&para;<br>tude for the claimant.” Walters v. National Assn. of Ra&para;<br>diation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 311 (1985). A veteran&para;<br>faces no time limit for filing a claim, and once a claim is&para;<br>filed, the VA’s process for adjudicating it at the regional&para;<br>office and the Board is ex parte and nonadversarial, 38&para;<br>CFR §§3.103(a), 20.700(c) (2010). The VA has a statutory&para;<br>duty to assist veterans in developing the evidence neces&para;<br>sary to substantiate their claims. 38 U. S. C. §§5103(a)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. III), 5103A (2006 ed.). And when evaluat&para;<br>ing claims, the VA must give veterans the “benefit of&para;<br>the doubt” whenever positive and negative evidence on&para;<br>a material issue is roughly equal. §5107(b). If a regional&para;<br>office denies a claim, the veteran has a generous one-year&para;<br>time limit to initiate an appeal to the Board. §7105(b)(1);&para;<br>38 CFR §20.302(a). A veteran may also reopen a previ&para;<br>ously denied claim at any time by presenting “new and&para;<br>material evidence,” 38 U. S. C. §5108, and decisions by a&para;<br>regional office or the Board are subject to challenge at any&para;<br>time based on “clear and unmistakable error,” §§5109A,&para;<br>7111.&para;<br>Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was rejected by the&para;<br>VA was generally unable to obtain further review. 38&para;<br>U.

Federal Circuit decisions may&para;<br>in turn be reviewed by this Court by writ of certiorari.&para;<br>B&para;<br>David Henderson served in the military during the&para;<br>Korean War. In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100&para;<br>percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and&para;<br>in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based&para;<br>on his need for in-home care. After a VA regional office&para;<br>and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal&para;<br>with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing&para;<br>deadline by 15 days. See §7266(a).&para;<br>The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson’s&para;<br>appeal as untimely.

SHINSEKI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment. While Henderson’s appeal was pending, however,&para;<br>we decided Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). In&para;<br>Bowles, we held that the statutory limitation on the length&para;<br>of an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an&para;<br>ordinary civil case, 28 U. S. C. §2107(c) (2006 ed., Supp.&para;<br>III), is “jurisdictional,” and we therefore held that a party’s&para;<br>failure to file a notice of appeal within that period could&para;<br>not be excused based on equitable factors, or on the oppos&para;<br>ing party’s forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late&para;<br>filing. Bowles, supra, at 213–214.&para;<br>After we announced our decision in Bowles, the Veter&para;<br>ans Court directed the parties to brief that decision’s effect&para;<br>on prior Federal Circuit precedent that allowed the equi&para;<br>table tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of&para;<br>appeal in the Veterans Court. A divided panel of the&para;<br>Veterans Court concluded that Bowles compelled jurisdic&para;<br>tional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed&para;<br>Henderson’s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction.&para;<br>Henderson v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 217 (2008).&para;<br>Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a&para;<br>divided en banc court affirmed. 589 F. 3d 1201 (2009).&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In this case, as in others that have come before us in&para;<br>recent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is&para;<br>“jurisdictional.” See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engi&para;<br>neers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central&para;<br>Region, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); Bowles, supra; Arbaugh v.&para;<br>Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006); Eberhart v. United&para;<br>States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam); Scarborough v.&para;<br>Principi, 541 U. S. 401 (2004); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.&para;<br>443 (2004). This question is not merely semantic but one&para;<br>of considerable practical importance for judges and liti&para;<br>gants. Branding a rule as going to a court’s subject-matter&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial&para;<br>system. Under that system, courts are generally limited&para;<br>to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the&para;<br>parties. See Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U. S. 331,&para;<br>356–357 (2006). Courts do not usually raise claims or&para;<br>arguments on their own. But federal courts have an inde&para;<br>pendent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the&para;<br>scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise&para;<br>and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either&para;<br>overlook or elect not to press. See Arbaugh, supra, at 514.&para;<br>Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of&para;<br>judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.&para;<br>For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is&para;<br>replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised&para;<br>at particular times. See Sanchez-Llamas, supra, at 356–&para;<br>357. Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however,&para;<br>may be raised at any time. Thus, a party, after losing at&para;<br>trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court&para;<br>lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at&para;<br>508. Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if&para;<br>the party had previously acknowledged the trial court’s&para;<br>jurisdiction. Ibid. And if the trial court lacked jurisdic&para;<br>tion, many months of work on the part of the attorneys&para;<br>and the court may be wasted.&para;<br>Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdic&para;<br>tional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent&para;<br>cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term. We&para;<br>have urged that a rule should not be referred to as juris&para;<br>dictional unless it governs a court’s adjudicatory capacity,&para;<br>that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. Reed&para;<br>Elsevier, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); Kontrick, supra, at&para;<br>455. Other rules, even if important and mandatory, we&para;<br>have said, should not be given the jurisdictional brand.&para;<br>See Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).&para;<br>Among the types of rules that should not be described as&para;<br>jurisdictional are what we have called “claim-processing&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rules.” These are rules that seek to promote the orderly&para;<br>progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take&para;<br>certain procedural steps at certain specified times. Id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 14); Eberhart, supra, at 19; Scarborough,&para;<br>supra, at 413–414; Kontrick, supra, at 455–456. Filing&para;<br>deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue&para;<br>here, are quintessential claim-processing rules. Accord&para;<br>ingly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of&para;<br>jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent&para;<br>cases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Cir&para;<br>cuit, and this opinion could end at this point.&para;<br>Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that&para;<br>simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions&para;<br>that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we&para;<br>would prefer to call a claim-processing rule. See Bowles,&para;<br>supra, at 212–213. The question here, therefore, is&para;<br>whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be&para;<br>“jurisdictional.” In Arbaugh, we applied a “readily admin&para;<br>istrable bright line” rule for deciding such questions. 546&para;<br>U. S., at 515–516. Under Arbaugh, we look to see if there&para;<br>is any “clear” indication that Congress wanted the rule to&para;<br>be “jurisdictional.” Ibid. This approach is suited to cap&para;<br>ture Congress’ likely intent and also provides helpful&para;<br>guidance for courts and litigants, who will be “duly in&para;<br>structed” regarding a rule’s nature. See id., at 514–515,&para;<br>and n. 11.&para;<br>Congress, of course, need not use magic words in order&para;<br>to speak clearly on this point. “[C]ontext, including this&para;<br>Court’s interpretation of similar provisions in many years&para;<br>past, is relevant.” Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>13). When “a long line of this Court’s decisions left undis&para;<br>turbed by Congress,” Union Pacific, supra, at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 13), has treated a similar requirement as “jurisdic&para;<br>tional,” we will presume that Congress intended to follow&para;<br>that course. See John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 552 U. S. 130, 133–134, 139 (2008).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>With these principles in mind, we consider whether&para;<br>Congress clearly prescribed that the deadline for filing&para;<br>a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court should be&para;<br>“jurisdictional.”&para;<br>A&para;<br>Contending that the 120-day filing deadline was meant&para;<br>to be jurisdictional, the Government maintains that&para;<br>Bowles is controlling. The Government reads Bowles to&para;<br>mean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in&para;<br>civil cases are jurisdictional. Since §7266(a) establishes a&para;<br>statutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the&para;<br>Government reasons, that deadline is jurisdictional.&para;<br>We reject the major premise of this syllogism. Bowles&para;<br>did not hold categorically that every deadline for seeking&para;<br>judicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional. Instead,&para;<br>Bowles concerned an appeal from one court to another&para;<br>court. The “century’s worth of precedent and practice in&para;<br>American courts” on which Bowles relied involved appeals&para;<br>of that type. See 551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2.&para;<br>Contending that Bowles’ reasoning extends to the judi&para;<br>cial review of administrative decisions, the Government&para;<br>relies on Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386 (1995). There, with&para;<br>out elaboration, we described as “ ‘mandatory and jurisdic&para;<br>tional’ ” the deadline for seeking review in the courts of&para;<br>appeals of final removal orders of the Board of Immigra&para;<br>tion Appeals. Id., at 405 (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 495&para;<br>U. S. 33, 45 (1990)). The Government also notes that&para;<br>lower court decisions have uniformly held that the Hobbs&para;<br>Act’s 60-day time limit for filing a petition for review of&para;<br>certain final agency decisions, 28 U. S. C. §2344, is juris&para;<br>dictional. Brief for United States 18.&para;<br>Petitioner correctly observes, however, that Veterans&para;<br>Court review of a VA decision denying benefits differs in&para;<br>many respects from court of appeals review of an agency&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>decision under the Hobbs Act. Cf. Shinseki v. Sanders,&para;<br>556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15) (“Congress has&para;<br>made clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency”). And&para;<br>there is force to petitioner’s argument that a more ap&para;<br>propriate analog is judicial review of an administrative&para;<br>decision denying Social Security disability benefits. The&para;<br>Social Security disability benefits program, like the veter&para;<br>ans benefits program, is “unusually protective” of claim&para;<br>ants, Heckler v. Day, 467 U. S. 104, 106–107 (1984). See&para;<br>also Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 110–112 (2000) (plurality&para;<br>opinion). Indeed, the Government acknowledges that “the&para;<br>Social Security and veterans-benefit review mechanisms&para;<br>share significant common attributes.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 16. And long before Congress enacted the VJRA,&para;<br>we held that the deadline for obtaining review of Social&para;<br>Security benefits decisions in district court, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§405(g), is not jurisdictional. Bowen v. City of New York,&para;<br>476 U. S. 467, 478, and n. 10 (1986); Mathews v. Eldridge,&para;<br>424 U. S. 319, 328, n. 9 (1976); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422&para;<br>U. S. 749, 763–764 (1975).&para;<br>In the end, however, none of the precedents cited by the&para;<br>parties controls our decision here. All of those cases in&para;<br>volved review by Article III courts. This case, by contrast,&para;<br>involves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique&para;<br>administrative scheme. Instead of applying a categorical&para;<br>rule regarding review of administrative decisions, we&para;<br>attempt to ascertain Congress’ intent regarding the par&para;<br>ticular type of review at issue in this case.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Several factors convince us that the 120-day deadline for&para;<br>seeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have&para;<br>jurisdictional attributes.&para;<br>The terms of the provision setting that deadline, 38&para;<br>U. S. C. §7266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear&para;<br>evidence, that the provision was meant to carry jurisdic&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tional consequences. Section 7266(a) provides:&para;<br>“In order to obtain review by the Court of Appeals&para;<br>for Veterans Claims of a final decision of the Board&para;<br>of Veterans’ Appeals, a person adversely affected by&para;<br>such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the&para;<br>Court within 120 days after the date on which notice&para;<br>of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e) of&para;<br>this title.”&para;<br>This provision “does not speak in jurisdictional terms or&para;<br>refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans&para;<br>Court],” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385,&para;<br>394 (1982). If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to&para;<br>be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provi&para;<br>sion in language like that in the provision of the VJRA&para;<br>that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the&para;<br>Veterans Court. This latter provision states that Federal&para;<br>Circuit review must be obtained “within the time and in&para;<br>the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts&para;<br>of appeals from United States district courts.” §7292(a).&para;<br>Because the time for taking an appeal from a district court&para;<br>to a court of appeals in a civil case has long been under&para;<br>stood to be jurisdictional, see Bowles, supra, at 209–210,&para;<br>and n. 2, this language clearly signals an intent to impose&para;<br>the same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court&para;<br>to the Federal Circuit. But the 120-day limit at issue in&para;<br>this case is not framed in comparable terms. It is true&para;<br>that §7266 is cast in mandatory language, but we have&para;<br>rejected the notion that “all mandatory prescriptions,&para;<br>however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.”&para;<br>Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting&para;<br>Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 510; internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Thus, the language of §7266 provides no clear&para;<br>indication that Congress wanted that provision to be&para;<br>treated as having jurisdictional attributes.&para;<br>Nor does §7266’s placement within the VJRA provide&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>such an indication. Congress placed §7266, numbered&para;<br>§4066 in the enacting legislation, in a subchapter entitled&para;<br>“Procedure.” See VJRA, §301, 102 Stat. 4113, 4115–4116.&para;<br>That placement suggests Congress regarded the 120-day&para;<br>limit as a claim-processing rule. Cf. INS v. National&para;<br>Center for Immigrants’ Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 189&para;<br>(1991) (“[T]he title of a statute or section can aid in resolv&para;<br>ing an ambiguity in the legislation’s text”). Congress&para;<br>elected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA sub&para;<br>chapter entitled “Organization and Jurisdiction.” See 102&para;<br>Stat. 4113–4115.&para;<br>Within that subchapter, a separate provision, captioned&para;<br>“Jurisdiction; finality of decisions,” prescribes the jurisdic&para;<br>tion of the Veterans Court. Id., at 4113–4114. Subsection&para;<br>(a) of that provision, numbered §4052 in the enacting&para;<br>legislation, grants the Veterans Court “exclusive jurisdic&para;<br>tion to review decisions of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals”&para;<br>and the “power to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of&para;<br>the Board or to remand the matter, as appropriate.” Id.,&para;<br>at 4113. It also prohibits the court from hearing appeals&para;<br>by the VA Secretary. Subsection (b) limits the court’s&para;<br>review to “the record of proceedings before the [VA],”&para;<br>specifies the scope of that review, and precludes review of&para;<br>the VA’s disability ratings schedule. Ibid. Nothing in this&para;<br>provision or in the “Organization and Jurisdiction” sub&para;<br>chapter addresses the time for seeking Veterans Court&para;<br>review.&para;<br>While the terms and placement of §7266 provide some&para;<br>indication of Congress’ intent, what is most telling here&para;<br>are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that&para;<br>Congress created for the adjudication of veterans’ benefits&para;<br>claims. “The solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long&para;<br>standing.” United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647&para;<br>(1961); see also Sanders, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).&para;<br>And that solicitude is plainly reflected in the VJRA, as&para;<br>well as in subsequent laws that “place a thumb on the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>scale in the veteran’s favor in the course of administrative&para;<br>and judicial review of VA decisions,” id., at ___ (Souter, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (slip op., at 2). See, e. g., Veterans Claims&para;<br>Assistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 2096; Act of Nov. 21,&para;<br>1997, 111 Stat. 2271; VJRA, §103, 102 Stat. 4106–4107.&para;<br>The contrast between ordinary civil litigation—which&para;<br>provided the context of our decision in Bowles—and the&para;<br>system that Congress created for the adjudication of vet&para;<br>erans’ benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic. In&para;<br>ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally com&para;<br>mence their suits within the time specified in a statute of&para;<br>limitations, see 28 U. S. C. §1658, and the litigation is&para;<br>adversarial. Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that&para;<br>supports their claims and generally bear the burden of&para;<br>production and persuasion. Both parties may appeal an&para;<br>adverse trial-court decision, see §1291, and a final judg&para;<br>ment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances. See&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.&para;<br>By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an&para;<br>initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset&para;<br>of disability or separation from service. When a claim is&para;<br>filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonad&para;<br>versarial. The VA is charged with the responsibility of&para;<br>assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports&para;<br>their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must&para;<br>give the veteran the benefit of any doubt. If a veteran is&para;<br>unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may&para;<br>obtain de novo review before the Board, and if the veteran&para;<br>loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further&para;<br>review in the Veterans Court. A Board decision in the&para;<br>veteran’s favor, on the other hand, is final. And even if a&para;<br>veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of&para;<br>administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen&para;<br>a claim simply by presenting “new and material evidence.”&para;<br>Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for&para;<br>filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sharply with this scheme.&para;<br>We have long applied “the canon that provisions for&para;<br>benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be con&para;<br>strued in the beneficiaries’ favor.” King v. St. Vincent’s&para;<br>Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 220–221, n. 9 (1991); see also&para;<br>Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U. S. 191, 196 (1980);&para;<br>Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &amp; Repair Corp., 328 U. S.&para;<br>275, 285 (1946). Particularly in light this canon, we do not&para;<br>find any clear indication that the 120-day limit was in&para;<br>tended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany&para;<br>the jurisdiction tag.&para;<br>The Government argues that there is no reason to think&para;<br>that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent&para;<br>with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior&para;<br>to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were&para;<br>not subject to any further review at all. Brief for United&para;<br>States 29. The provision at issue here, however, was&para;<br>enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was&para;<br>decidedly favorable to veterans. Accordingly, the review&para;<br>opportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was&para;<br>enacted are of little help in interpreting 38 U. S. C.&para;<br>§7266(a).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>We hold that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal&para;<br>with the Veterans Court does not have jurisdictional&para;<br>attributes. The 120-day limit is nevertheless an impor&para;<br>tant procedural rule.
