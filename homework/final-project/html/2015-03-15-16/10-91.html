WILSON, SUPERINTENDANT, INDIANA &para;<br>&para;<br>STATE PRISON v. JOSEPH E. CORCORAN &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10–91. Decided November 8, 2010 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Federal courts may not issue writs of habeas corpus to&para;<br>state prisoners whose confinement does not violate federal&para;<br>law. Because the Court of Appeals granted the writ to&para;<br>respondent without finding such a violation, we vacate its&para;<br>judgment and remand.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In 1997, respondent Joseph Corcoran shot and killed&para;<br>four men, including his brother and his sister’s fiance. An&para;<br>Indiana jury found him guilty of four counts of murder,&para;<br>found the statutory aggravating circumstance of multiple&para;<br>murders, and unanimously recommended capital punish&para;<br>ment. The trial judge agreed and sentenced respondent to&para;<br>death.&para;<br>But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated&para;<br>the sentence out of concern that the trial judge might have&para;<br>violated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory&para;<br>aggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.&para;<br>Corcoran v. State, 739 N. E. 2d 649, 657–658 (2000).&para;<br>When addressing respondent at sentencing, the trial court&para;<br>had remarked:&para;<br>“ ‘[T]he knowing and intentional murders of four inno&para;<br>cent people is an extremely heinous and aggravated&para;<br>crime. . . . I don’t think in the history of this county&para;<br>we’ve had a mass murderer such as yourself. It&para;<br>makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a very dangerous, evil mass&para;<br>murderer. And I am convinced in my heart of hearts,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WILSON v. CORCORAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>. . . if given the opportunity, you will murder again.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 657 (quoting transcript).&para;<br>According to the Indiana Supreme Court, the trial judge’s&para;<br>reference to the innocence of respondent’s victims, the&para;<br>heinousness of his offense, and his future dangerousness&para;<br>was not necessarily improper; it is permissible to provide&para;<br>“an appropriate context for consideration of the alleged&para;<br>aggravating and mitigating circumstances.” Ibid. (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). But because the trial court&para;<br>might have meant that it weighed these factors as aggra&para;<br>vating circumstances, the Indiana Supreme Court re&para;<br>manded for resentencing. See ibid.&para;<br>On remand, the trial court issued a revised sentencing&para;<br>order. It wrote:&para;<br>“ ‘ The trial Court, in balancing the proved aggravators&para;<br>and mitigators, emphasizes to the Supreme Court&para;<br>that it only relied upon those proven statutory aggra&para;<br>vators. The trial Court’s remarks at the sentencing&para;<br>hearing, and the language in the original sentencing&para;<br>order explain why such high weight was given to the&para;<br>statutory aggravator of multiple murder, and further&para;<br>support the trial Court’s personal conclusion that the&para;<br>sentence is appropriate punishment for this offender&para;<br>and these crimes.’ ” Corcoran v. State, 774 N. E. 2d&para;<br>495, 498 (Ind. 2002) (quoting order).&para;<br>On appeal, over respondent’s objection, the Supreme Court&para;<br>accepted this explanation and affirmed the sentence. Id.,&para;<br>at 498–499, 502. It explained that it was “now satisfied&para;<br>that the trial court has relied on only aggravators listed in&para;<br>Indiana Code §35–50–2–9(b). . . . There is no lack of clar&para;<br>ity in [the trial court’s] statement and no plausible reason&para;<br>to believe it untrue.” Id., at 499.&para;<br>Respondent later applied to the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Northern District of Indiana for a writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus. His habeas petition asserted a number of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>grounds for relief, including a renewed claim that, not&para;<br>withstanding its assurances to the contrary, the trial court&para;<br>improperly relied on nonstatutory aggravating factors&para;<br>when it resentenced him. Respondent also asserted that&para;<br>this reliance violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ments. Record, Doc. 13, p. 11. In its response to the peti&para;<br>tion, the State specifically disputed that contention. Id.,&para;<br>Doc. 33, p. 16 (“[Respondent] fails to establish any consti&para;<br>tutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Court’s re&para;<br>view of the trial court’s treatment of Corcoran’s sentence&para;<br>on remand, let alone does it show that the state supreme&para;<br>court’s judgment is in any way inconsistent with applica&para;<br>ble United States Supreme Court precedent”).&para;<br>The District Court, however, had no need to resolve this&para;<br>dispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly dif&para;<br>ferent ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the&para;<br>death penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a&para;<br>jury trial had violated the Sixth Amendment. Corcoran v.&para;<br>Buss, 483 F. Supp. 2d 709, 725–726 (2007). It did not&para;<br>address the sentencing challenge because that was “ren&para;<br>dered moot” by the grant of habeas relief. Id., at 734.&para;<br>The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed&para;<br>the District Court’s Sixth Amendment ruling. Corcoran v.&para;<br>Buss, 551 F. 3d 703, 712, 714 (2008). Then, evidently&para;<br>overlooking respondent’s remaining sentencing claims, the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the District Court&para;<br>“with instructions to deny the writ.” Id., at 714. To cor&para;<br>rect this oversight, we granted certiorari and vacated the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit’s judgment. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 558&para;<br>U. S. 1 (2009) (per curiam). We explained that the Court&para;<br>of Appeals “should have permitted the District Court to&para;<br>consider Corcoran’s unresolved challenges to his death&para;<br>sentence on remand, or should have itself explained why&para;<br>such consideration was unnecessary.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 2).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WILSON v. CORCORAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>On remand—and without any opportunity for briefing&para;<br>by the parties—the Court of Appeals changed course and&para;<br>granted habeas relief. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 593 F. 3d&para;<br>547, 555 (2010). After determining that respondent’s&para;<br>sentencing challenge had been waived by his failure to&para;<br>include it in his original cross-appeal, the Seventh Circuit&para;<br>concluded that the claim satisfied plain-error review. Id.,&para;<br>at 551. The panel explained that, “unlike the Indiana&para;<br>Supreme Court,” it was unsatisfied with the trial court’s&para;<br>representation that it relied only on aggravating factors&para;<br>authorized by Indiana law. Ibid. Because the trial court’s&para;<br>revised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory&para;<br>factors of heinousness, victims’ innocence, and future&para;<br>dangerousness to determine the weight given to the ag&para;<br>gravator of multiple murders, the Seventh Circuit con&para;<br>cluded that the Indiana Supreme Court had made an&para;<br>“ ‘unreasonable determination of the facts’ ” when it ac&para;<br>cepted the trial court’s representation that it did not rely&para;<br>on those factors as aggravating circumstances. Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)). The panel therefore&para;<br>required the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentenc&para;<br>ing determination in order to “prevent non-compliance&para;<br>with Indiana law.” 593 F. 3d, at 552–553.&para;<br>But it is only noncompliance with federal law that ren&para;<br>ders a State’s criminal judgment susceptible to collateral&para;<br>attack in the federal courts. The habeas statute unambi&para;<br>guously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to&para;<br>a state prisoner “only on the ground that he is in custody&para;<br>in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the&para;<br>United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(a). And we have re&para;<br>peatedly held that “ ‘federal habeas corpus relief does not&para;<br>lie for errors of state law.’ ” Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.&para;<br>62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780&para;<br>(1990)). “[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court&para;<br>to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law&para;<br>questions.” 502 U. S., at 67–68. But here, the panel’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>opinion contained no hint that it thought the violation of&para;<br>Indiana law it had unearthed also entailed the infringe&para;<br>ment of any federal right. Not only did the court frame&para;<br>respondent’s claim as whether “the Indiana trial court&para;<br>considered non-statutory aggravating circumstances . . . in&para;<br>contravention of state law,” 593 F. 3d, at 551 (emphasis&para;<br>added), it also explicitly acknowledged that “[n]othing in&para;<br>[its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule per&para;<br>mitting the use of non-statutory aggravators in the death&para;<br>sentence selection process. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.&para;<br>862, 878 (1983) (permitting their use under federal law),”&para;<br>id., at 551–552 (citations omitted).&para;<br>Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to find an&para;<br>unreasonable determination of the facts under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(2). That provision allows habeas petitioners to&para;<br>avoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to&para;<br>federal claims adjudicated on the merits in state court by&para;<br>showing that the state court’s decision was “based on an&para;<br>unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” It does&para;<br>not repeal the command of §2254(a) that habeas relief may&para;<br>be afforded to a state prisoner “only on the ground” that&para;<br>his custody violates federal law.&para;<br>In response to the Seventh Circuit’s opinion, the State&para;<br>filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The&para;<br>State’s petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred&para;<br>by granting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It&para;<br>also contended, on the authority of our opinion in Wain&para;<br>wright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78 (1983) (per curiam), that the&para;<br>Court of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana&para;<br>Supreme Court’s factual determination that its own trial&para;<br>court complied with Indiana law.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but amended its&para;<br>opinion to include this language:&para;<br>“This [remand for resentencing] will cure the state&para;<br>trial court’s ‘unreasonable determination of the facts.’&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WILSON v. CORCORAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) [sic]. (It will also prevent non&para;<br>compliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended&para;<br>that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompli&para;<br>ance with state law also violates the federal Constitu&para;<br>tion and thus warrants him relief under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced any con&para;<br>trary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode, 464&para;<br>U. S. 78 (1983), or any similar decision.)” App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 144a–145a.&para;<br>The amendment did not cure the defect. It is not&para;<br>enough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the exis&para;<br>tence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court&para;<br>agrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The&para;<br>Seventh Circuit’s opinion reflects no such agreement, nor&para;<br>does it even articulate what federal right was allegedly&para;<br>infringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the&para;<br>court maintains that it would not violate federal law for&para;<br>Indiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court&para;<br>did. 593 F. 3d, at 551–552.&para;<br>In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional&para;<br>error, the amended opinion says only that the State had&para;<br>not “advanced any contrary argument based on Wain&para;<br>wright v. Goode . . . or any similar decision.” App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this language was&para;<br>meant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State&para;<br>forfeited the position that respondent’s allegations do not&para;<br>state a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the&para;<br>State explicitly disputed that point before the District&para;<br>Court—the last forum in which the subject had been&para;<br>raised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that&para;<br>respondent had waived the claim entirely. 593 F. 3d, at&para;<br>551. And there is no suggestion that the State has ever&para;<br>conceded the existence of a federal right to be sentenced in&para;<br>accordance with Indiana law. Under those circumstances,&para;<br>it was improper for the Court of Appeals to issue the writ&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>without first concluding that a violation of federal law had&para;<br>been established.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the&para;<br>case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with&para;<br>this opinion. We express no view about the merits of the&para;<br>habeas petition.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
