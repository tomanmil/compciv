UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–876.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 8, 2009—Decided June 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners (hereinafter Defendants)—executives of Hollinger Interna&para;<br>tional, Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company—were indicted&para;<br>for mail fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§1341, 1346, and other federal crimes. At&para;<br>trial, the Government pursued alternative mail-fraud theories, charg&para;<br>ing that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently&para;<br>paying themselves bogus “noncompetition fees”; and (2) by failing to&para;<br>disclose those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest&para;<br>services. Before jury deliberations began, the Government proposed&para;<br>special-verdict forms that would reveal, in the event that the jury&para;<br>voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the particular theory or theo&para;<br>ries accounting for the verdict. Defendants resisted, preferring an&para;<br>unelaborated general verdict. The Government ultimately acqui&para;<br>esced. The District Court instructed the jury on each of the alterna&para;<br>tive theories. As to honest-services fraud, the court informed the&para;<br>jury, over Defendants’ timely objection, that a person commits that&para;<br>offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself and/or a&para;<br>co-schemer and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loy&para;<br>alty. The jury returned general verdicts of “guilty” on the mail-fraud&para;<br>counts, found that one Defendant was also guilty of obstruction of&para;<br>justice, and acquitted Defendants on all other charges.&para;<br>On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services&para;<br>fraud jury instructions. Seeking reversal of their mail-fraud convic&para;<br>tions, Defendants relied on Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 312,&para;<br>which held that a general verdict may be set aside “where the verdict&para;<br>is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible&para;<br>to tell which ground the jury selected.” The Seventh Circuit found no&para;<br>infirmity in the honest-services instructions, but further determined&para;<br>that even if those instructions were wrong, Defendants could not pre&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BLACK v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>vail. By opposing the Government-proposed special-verdict forms,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals declared, defendants had forfeited their objec&para;<br>tion to the instructions. Their challenge would have become moot,&para;<br>the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms sepa&para;<br>rating the alternative fraud theories, and reported on the forms that&para;<br>Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud. Defendants, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals therefore reasoned, bore responsibility for the ob&para;<br>scurity of the jury’s verdict.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __, this Court&para;<br>vacated a conviction on the ground that the honest-services compo&para;<br>nent of the federal mail-fraud statute, §1346, criminalizes only&para;<br>schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks. That holding&para;<br>renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect.&para;<br>P. 5.&para;<br>2. By properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at&para;<br>trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions&para;<br>on appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in&para;<br>the Government-proposed special-verdict forms. The Federal Rules&para;<br>of Criminal Procedure do not provide for submission of special ques&para;<br>tions to the jury. In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49 pro&para;<br>vides for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts, Rule&para;<br>49(a); and general verdicts with answers to written questions, Rule&para;<br>49(b). While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they&para;<br>are informative on objections to instructions. Criminal Rule 30(d)&para;<br>provides that a “party who objects to any portion of the instructions&para;<br>or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of&para;<br>the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury&para;<br>retires to deliberate.” Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied&para;<br>with that requirement. The Seventh Circuit, in essence, added a fur&para;<br>ther requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury&para;<br>instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal&para;<br>statute or criminal rule. And it placed in the prosecutor’s hands au&para;<br>thority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.&para;<br>To boot, the appeals court applied the sanction to Defendants, al&para;<br>though they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their re&para;<br>sistance to the Government’s special-verdict request. Criminal Rule&para;<br>57(b) is designed to ward off such judicial invention. It provides: “No&para;<br>sanction . . . may be imposed for noncompliance with any require&para;<br>ment not in federal law [or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged viola&para;<br>tor was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the&para;<br>noncompliance.” Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>3.

United States, decided today, ante, p. __,&para;<br>we vacated a conviction because the indictment rested, in&para;<br>part, on an improper construction of the “honest services”&para;<br>component of the federal ban on mail fraud, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1341, 1346. A similar infirmity is present in this case.&para;<br>Here, too, the Government and trial court advanced an&para;<br>interpretation of §1346 rejected by the Court’s opinion in&para;<br>Skilling. Nevertheless, the Government urges, the convic&para;<br>tions of the defendants below, petitioners here, should be&para;<br>affirmed for an independent reason. At trial, the Govern&para;<br>ment pursued alternative theories: (1) money-or-property&para;<br>fraud; and (2) honest-services fraud. To pinpoint whether&para;<br>the jury based its verdict on money-or-property fraud, or&para;<br>honest-services fraud, or both, the Government proposed&para;<br>special interrogatories to accompany the verdict. The&para;<br>defendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general&para;<br>verdict, and the Government ultimately acquiesced in that&para;<br>standard form of submission.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals held that the defendants, by op&para;<br>posing the Government-suggested special interrogatories,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BLACK v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>forfeited their objection to the honest-services-fraud in&para;<br>structions given to the jury. 530 F. 3d 596, 603 (CA7&para;<br>2008). We reverse that ruling. A criminal defendant, we&para;<br>hold, need not request special interrogatories, nor need he&para;<br>acquiesce in the Government’s request for discrete find&para;<br>ings by the jury, in order to preserve in full a timely raised&para;<br>objection to jury instructions on an alternative theory of&para;<br>guilt.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioners Conrad Black, John Boultbee, and Mark&para;<br>Kipnis, as well as Peter Atkinson,1 (collectively, Defen&para;<br>dants) were leading executives of Hollinger International,&para;<br>Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company that,&para;<br>through subsidiaries, owned newspapers here and abroad.&para;<br>In 2005, the Government indicted Defendants on multiple&para;<br>counts, of prime concern here, three counts of mail fraud&para;<br>in violation of §§1341 and 1346.2 Two theories were pur&para;<br>sued by the Government on each mail-fraud count. The&para;<br>Government charged that (1) Defendants stole millions&para;<br>from Hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus&para;<br>“noncompetition fees”; and that (2) by failing to disclose&para;<br>their receipt of those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger&para;<br>of their honest services as managers of the company.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>honest-services deprivation theories advanced by the&para;<br>Government. Id., at 235a. As to the latter, the District&para;<br>Court informed the jury, over Defendants’ objection, that a&para;<br>person commits honest-services fraud if he “misuse[s] his&para;<br>position for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer”&para;<br>and “knowingly and intentionally breache[s] his duty of&para;<br>loyalty.” Id., at 235a–236a.&para;<br>Before jury deliberations began, the Government asked&para;<br>the District Court to employ a special-verdict form, which&para;<br>would reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on&para;<br>a mail-fraud count, the theory or theories accounting for&para;<br>the verdict—money-or-property fraud, honest-services&para;<br>fraud, or both. See App. 430a.3 Defendants opposed the&para;<br>Government-proposed special interrogatories and urged,&para;<br>instead, standard general-verdict forms. Id., at 432a.&para;<br>Comprehending, however, that in the event of a guilty&para;<br>verdict, “the jury’s specification of the [mail-]fraud theory&para;<br>might [aid] appellate review,” ibid., Defendants proposed&para;<br>an accommodation: Upon return of a guilty verdict on any&para;<br>mail-fraud count, jurors could be asked to specify the&para;<br>theory on which they relied, id., at 433a.&para;<br>The Government objected to special interrogatories&para;<br>presented to the jury postverdict, App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>222a, and the District Court declined to adopt that proce&para;<br>dure, id., at 225a.4 When the court rejected postverdict&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Government proposed this language for each defendant on each&para;<br>mail-fraud count:&para;<br>“If you find the defendant . . . Guilty with respect to [this Count], you&para;<br>must answer the following question by checking the applicable lines.&para;<br>“With respect to [this Count], we, the jury, find the following has&para;<br>been proven beyond a reasonable doubt (check all that apply):&para;<br>“Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its&para;<br>shareholders of money or property ____&para;<br>“Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its&para;<br>shareholders of their intangible right to honest services ____.” App.&para;<br>430a.&para;<br>4 In her years at the bar and on the bench, the trial judge commented,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BLACK v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>interrogatories, the Government represented that it would&para;<br>not object to submission of the mail-fraud counts for jury&para;<br>decision by general verdict. Id., at 228a. The jury re&para;<br>turned general verdicts of “guilty” on the three mail-fraud&para;<br>counts;5 it also found defendant Black guilty of obstruction&para;<br>of justice in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1512(c)(1), and it&para;<br>acquitted Defendants on all other charges.&para;<br>On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the jury&para;<br>instructions on honest-services fraud. Under the rule&para;<br>declared by this Court in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S.&para;<br>298, 312 (1957), a general verdict may be set aside “where&para;<br>the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on an&para;<br>other, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury&para;<br>selected.” Relying on that rule, Defendants urged reversal&para;<br>of their mail-fraud convictions. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>found no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, 530&para;<br>F. 3d, at 600–602, but further determined that Defendants&para;<br>could not prevail even if those instructions were wrong,&para;<br>id., at 602–603. For this determination, the court homed&para;<br>in on the Government’s special-verdict proposal.&para;<br>The challenge to the honest-services instructions would&para;<br>have become moot, the court observed, had the jury re&para;<br>ceived special-verdict forms separating money-or-property&para;<br>fraud from honest-services fraud, and reported on the&para;<br>forms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services&para;<br>fraud. Defendants, the Court of Appeals reasoned, bore&para;<br>responsibility for the obscurity of the jury’s verdict. True,&para;<br>the court acknowledged, it was not incumbent on Defen&para;<br>dants to request special verdicts. But by resisting the&para;<br>Government’s proposal for separate findings on money-or&para;<br>property fraud and on honest-services fraud, and request&para;<br>——————&para;<br>she had “absolutely” never seen the postverdict procedure used. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 225a.&para;<br>5 The District Court later granted Kipnis’ motion for judgment of&para;<br>acquittal on one of these counts.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Defendants’&para;<br>suggestion of postverdict interrogatories did not, in the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ view, overcome the forfeiture, for&para;<br>“[q]uestioning the jurors after they have handed down&para;<br>their verdict is not a good procedure and certainly not one&para;<br>that a district judge is required to employ.” Ibid.6&para;<br>We granted certiorari in this case, 556 U.

S. ___ (2009), to&para;<br>determine what conduct Congress rendered criminal by&para;<br>proscribing, in §1346, fraudulent deprivation of “the in&para;<br>tangible right of honest services.” We also agreed to con&para;<br>sider in this case the question whether Defendants for&para;<br>feited their objection to the honest-services jury&para;<br>instructions by opposing the Government’s request for&para;<br>special verdicts.&para;<br>II&para;<br>We decided in Skilling that §1346, properly confined,&para;<br>criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or&para;<br>kickbacks. See ante, p. __. That holding renders the&para;<br>honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect,7&para;<br>and brings squarely before us the question presented by&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling: Did Defendants, by&para;<br>failing to acquiesce in the Government’s request for spe&para;<br>cial verdicts, forfeit their objection, timely made at trial, to&para;<br>the honest-services instructions?&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Jacobs Mfg. Co. v. Sam Brown Co., 19 F. 3d 1259, 1267&para;<br>(CA8 1994) (“Postverdict interrogatories may imply the jury’s verdict is&para;<br>unjustified and cause the jury to answer the interrogatories in a man&para;<br>ner inconsistent with the verdict.”); cf. Yeager v. United States, 557&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (“Courts properly avoid . . . explora&para;<br>tions into the jury’s sovereign space.”).&para;<br>7 The scheme to defraud alleged here did not involve any bribes or&para;<br>kickbacks.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BLACK v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In addressing this issue, we note first the absence of any&para;<br>provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for&para;<br>submission of special questions to the jury. See Stein v.&para;<br>New York, 346 U. S. 156, 178 (1953) (“Our own Rules of&para;<br>Criminal Procedure make no provision for anything but a&para;<br>general verdict.”), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v.&para;<br>Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964).8 The sole call for special&para;<br>findings in the Criminal Rules concerns nonjury trials.&para;<br>Rule 23(c) provides: “If a party [in a case tried without a&para;<br>jury] requests before the finding of guilty or not guilty, the&para;<br>court must state its specific findings of fact in open court&para;<br>or in a written decision or opinion.”&para;<br>In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide&para;<br>for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts,&para;<br>which instruct the jury to return “a special written finding&para;<br>on each issue of fact,” Rule 49(a); and general verdicts&para;<br>with answers to “written questions on one or more issues&para;<br>of fact,” Rule 49(b).9 Although not dispositive,10 the ab&para;<br>sence of a Criminal Rule authorizing special verdicts&para;<br>counsels caution.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The&para;<br>&para;<br>absence of a special verdict or interrogatory provision in the&para;<br>Criminal Rules is hardly accidental. See Skidmore v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio&para;<br>R. Co., 167 F. 2d 54, 70 (CA2 1948) (L. Hand, J., concurring) (“I should&para;<br>like to subject a verdict, as narrowly as was practical, to a review which&para;<br>should make it in fact, what we very elaborately pretend that it should&para;<br>be: a decision based upon law. In criminal prosecutions there may be,&para;<br>and in my judgment there are, other considerations which intervene to&para;<br>make such an attempt undesirable.”).&para;<br>9 Although the special interrogatories requested by the Government&para;<br>in this case have been called “special verdicts” by the parties and the&para;<br>courts below, they more closely resemble what Civil Rule 49(b) de&para;<br>scribes as “general verdict[s] with answers to written questions.”&para;<br>(Capitalization omitted.)&para;<br>10 See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 57(b) (when there is no controlling law,&para;<br>“[a] judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal&para;<br>law, these rules, and the local rules of the district”).&para;<br>11 By calling for caution, we do not mean to suggest that special ver&para;<br>dicts in criminal cases are never appropriate. See United States v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts,&para;<br>they are informative on objections to instructions.

Rule Crim.&para;<br>Proc. 30(d), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 915. The Rule provides: “A&para;<br>party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a&para;<br>failure to give a requested instruction must inform the&para;<br>court of the specific objection and the grounds for the&para;<br>objection before the jury retires to deliberate.” Defendants&para;<br>here, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.12&para;<br>The Court of Appeals, in essence, added a further re&para;<br>quirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to&para;<br>jury instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction un&para;<br>moored to any federal statute or criminal rule. And it&para;<br>placed in the prosecutor’s hands authority to trigger the&para;<br>sanction simply by requesting a special verdict. See 530&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Ruggiero, 726 F. 2d 913, 922–923 (CA2 1984) (in complex Racketeer&para;<br>Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act cases, “it can be extremely&para;<br>useful for a trial judge to request the jury to record their specific&para;<br>dispositions of the separate predicate acts charged, in addition to their&para;<br>verdict of guilty or innocence”); id., at 927 (Newman, J., concurring in&para;<br>part and dissenting in part) (“[A] District Court should have the discre&para;<br>tion to use a jury interrogatory in cases where risk of prejudice to the&para;<br>defendant is slight and the advantage of securing particularized fact&para;<br>finding is substantial.”).&para;<br>12 The Government asserts that Defendants’ opposition to a special&para;<br>verdict resulted in forfeiture not of their jury-instruction objection, but&para;<br>of their “Yates argument” that any instructional error may “requir[e]&para;<br>reversal.” Brief for United States 52, and n. 21 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The Government thus appears to concede that Defen&para;<br>dants preserved their instructional challenge, but maintains that they&para;<br>are powerless to ask a court to assess the prejudicial effect of any error&para;<br>they may be able to demonstrate. See Reply Brief 29, n. 10 (on Gov&para;<br>ernment’s view, “[Defendants] could still ‘claim’ they were wrongly&para;<br>convicted, they just could not ask a court to do anything about it”). We&para;<br>see little merit in the Government’s attempt to divorce preservation of&para;<br>a claim from preservation of the right to redress should the claim&para;<br>succeed.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BLACK v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>F. 3d, at 603.13 To boot, the Court of Appeals applied the&para;<br>sanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice&para;<br>that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s special-verdict request. There is a Rule de&para;<br>signed to ward off judicial invention of the kind present&para;<br>here. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b) admon&para;<br>ishes: “No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed&para;<br>for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law&para;<br>[or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged violator was fur&para;<br>nished with actual notice of the requirement before the&para;<br>noncompliance.”&para;<br>We hold, in short, that, by properly objecting to the&para;<br>honest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants&para;<br>secured their right to challenge those instructions on&para;<br>appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to&para;<br>acquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict&para;<br>forms. Our decision in Skilling makes it plain that the&para;<br>honest-services instructions in this case were indeed&para;<br>incorrect. As in Skilling, ante, at 40–41, we express no&para;<br>opinion on the question whether the error was ultimately&para;<br>harmless, but leave that matter for consideration on&para;<br>remand.14&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed&para;<br>ings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Rendering&para;<br>&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling all the more&para;<br>anomalous, at the time the trial court settled on the general verdict&para;<br>form, the Government was no longer pressing its special-verdict re&para;<br>quest.

No more should be said.&para;<br>Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the&para;<br>District Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the&para;<br>jury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In&para;<br>my view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently&para;<br>with the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill&para;<br>ing v. United States, ante, p. ___, but in instructing the&para;<br>jury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set&para;<br>forth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un&para;<br>constitutionally vague. Skilling, ante, p. ___ (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>concurring in part and concurring in judgment).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

For&para;<br>the reasons set forth in JUSTICE SCALIA’s separate opinion&para;<br>in Skilling v. United States, ante, p. ___ (opinion concur&para;<br>ring in part and concurring in judgment), §1346 is uncon&para;<br>stitutionally vague. To convict a defendant based on an&para;<br>honest-services-fraud theory, even one limited to bribes or&para;<br>kickbacks, would violate his or her rights under the Due&para;<br>Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
