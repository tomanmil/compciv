UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–9026. Argued December 2, 2014—Decided January 13, 2015&para;<br>Petitioner Whitfield, fleeing a botched bank robbery, entered 79-yearold Mary Parnell’s home and guided a terrified Parnell from a hallway to a room a few feet away, where she suffered a fatal heart attack. He was convicted of, among other things, violating 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2113(e), which establishes enhanced penalties for anyone who “forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person”&para;<br>in the course of committing or fleeing from a bank robbery. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the movement Whitfield required&para;<br>Parnell to make satisfied the forced-accompaniment requirement, rejecting his argument that §2113(e) requires “substantial” movement.&para;<br>Held: A bank robber “forces [a] person to accompany him,” for purposes&para;<br>of §2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him,&para;<br>even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over&para;<br>a short distance, as was the case here. At the time the forcedaccompaniment provision was enacted, just as today, to “accompany”&para;<br>someone meant to “go with” him. The word does not, as Whitfield&para;<br>contends, connote movement over a substantial distance. Accompaniment requires movement that would normally be described as from&para;<br>one place to another. Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to accompany&para;<br>him for at least several feet, from one room to another, and that surely sufficed. The severity of the penalties for a forced-accompaniment&para;<br>conviction—a mandatory minimum of 10 years, and a maximum of&para;<br>life imprisonment—does not militate against this interpretation, for&para;<br>the danger of a forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the&para;<br>distance traversed. This reading also does not make any other part&para;<br>of §2113’s graduated penalty scheme superfluous. Pp. 2–5.&para;<br>548 Fed.

The Fourth Circuit disagreed, holding that,&para;<br>“[a]lthough Whitfield required Mrs. Parnell to accompany&para;<br>him for only a short distance within her own home, and for&para;<br>a brief period, no more is required to prove that a forced&para;<br>accompaniment occurred.” 695 F. 3d 288, 311 (2012).&para;<br>After further proceedings in the District Court and Court of&para;<br>Appeals, 548 Fed.

United States, 530&para;<br>U. S. 255, 280 (2000) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Section&para;<br>2113 has been amended frequently, but the relevant&para;<br>phrase—“forces any person to accompany him without the&para;<br>consent of such person”—has remained unchanged, and so&para;<br>presumptively retains its original meaning.

See Oxford English Dictionary 60 (1st ed.&para;<br>1933) (defining “accompany” as: “To go in company with,&para;<br>to go along with”). The word does not, as Whitfield contends, connote movement over a substantial distance. It&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was, and still is, perfectly natural to speak of accompanying someone over a relatively short distance, for example:&para;<br>from one area within a bank “to the vault”;1 “to the altar”&para;<br>at a wedding;2 “up the stairway”;3 or into, out of, or across&para;<br>a room.4 English literature is replete with examples. See,&para;<br>e.g., C. Dickens, David Copperfield 529 (Modern Library&para;<br>ed. 2000) (Uriah “accompanied me into Mr. Wickfield’s&para;<br>room”); J. Austen, Pride and Prejudice 182 (Greenwich ed.&para;<br>1982) (Elizabeth “accompanied her out of the room”).&para;<br>It is true enough that accompaniment does not embrace&para;<br>minimal movement—for example, the movement of a bank&para;<br>teller’s feet when the robber grabs her arm. It must constitute movement that would normally be described as from&para;<br>one place to another, even if only from one spot within&para;<br>a room or outdoors to a different one. Here, Whitfield&para;<br>forced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet,&para;<br>from one room to another. That surely sufficed.&para;<br>In an attempt to support his position that “accompany”&para;<br>should be read to mean “accompany over a substantial&para;<br>distance,” Whitfield observes that a forced-accompaniment&para;<br>conviction carries severe penalties: a mandatory minimum&para;<br>sentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life&para;<br>imprisonment. In 1934, a forced-accompaniment conviction could even be punished with death.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1934, ch. 304, §3, 48 Stat. 783. The severity of these&para;<br>sentences, Whitfield says, militates against interpreting&para;<br>subsection (e) to capture forced accompaniment occurring&para;<br>over a small distance.&para;<br>But it does not seem to us that the danger of a forced&para;<br>accompaniment varies with the distance traversed. Consider, for example, a hostage-taker’s movement of one of&para;<br>his victims a short distance to a window, where she would&para;<br>be exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a human shield as he approaches the door. And even if we&para;<br>thought otherwise, we would have no authority to add a&para;<br>limitation the statute plainly does not contain. The Congress that wrote this provision may well have had most&para;<br>prominently in mind John Dillinger’s driving off with&para;<br>hostages, but it enacted a provision which goes well&para;<br>beyond that. It is simply not in accord with English usage&para;<br>to give “accompany” a meaning that covers only large&para;<br>distances.&para;<br>Whitfield also contends that “accompany” must be read&para;<br>narrowly in light of §2113’s graduated penalty scheme.&para;<br>That scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence&para;<br>for bank robbers who use “force and violence” or “intimidation,” §2113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those&para;<br>who “assaul[t]” or “pu[t] in jeopardy the life of ” another&para;<br>“by the use of a dangerous weapon or device,” §2113(d),&para;<br>and (3) a minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum&para;<br>sentence of life, for forced accompaniment, §2113(e).&para;<br>According to Whitfield, bank robbers almost always “exert&para;<br>some control over the movement of the bank’s employees.” Brief for Petitioner 22. Therefore, he says, unless&para;<br>“accompany” is limited to forced movement over substantial distances, nearly all §2113 violations will be punishable under subsection (e), making subsections (a) and&para;<br>(d) pointless.&para;<br>We disagree. Even if Whitfield is right that bank robbers always “exert some control” over others, it does not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>follow that they always force others to accompany them&para;<br>somewhere—that is, to go somewhere with them. As we&para;<br>have no reason to think that to be the case, and because&para;<br>subsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct conduct, our&para;<br>interpretation of “accompany” does not make any part of&para;<br>§2113 superfluous.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>We hold that a bank robber “forces [a] person to accompany him,” for purposes of §2113(e), when he forces that&para;<br>person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement&para;<br>occurs entirely within a single building or over a short&para;<br>distance. Defined in this manner, Whitfield forced Parnell&para;<br>to “accompany him.” §2113(e). The judgment of the&para;<br>Fourth Circuit is affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
