The University, which&para;<br>is committed to increasing racial minority enrollment, adopted its&para;<br>current program after this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 539&para;<br>U. S. 306, upholding the use of race as one of many “plus factors” in&para;<br>an admissions program that considered the overall individual contribution of each candidate, and decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.&para;<br>244, holding unconstitutional an admissions program that automatically awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.&para;<br>Petitioner, who is Caucasian, was rejected for admission to the&para;<br>University’s 2008 entering class. She sued the University and school&para;<br>officials, alleging that the University’s consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court&para;<br>granted summary judgment to the University. Affirming, the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference to the University, both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversity’s benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan&para;<br>was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal. Applying that&para;<br>standard, the court upheld the University’s admissions plan.&para;<br>Held: Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents&para;<br>of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, its decision affirming the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to the University was incorrect. Pp. 5–13.&para;<br>(a) Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question&para;<br>considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.&para;<br>In Bakke’s principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state&para;<br>university “decisions based on race or ethnic origin . . . are reviewable&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>under the Fourteenth Amendment,” 438 U. S., at 287, using a strict&para;<br>scrutiny standard, id., at 299. He identified as a compelling interest&para;<br>that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that&para;<br>this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array “of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.” Id., at 315&para;<br>In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing&para;<br>that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial&para;<br>review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e.,&para;<br>a university must clearly demonstrate that its “ ‘purpose or interest is&para;<br>both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of&para;<br>the classification is “necessary . . . to the accomplishment” of its purpose,’ ” Bakke, supra, at 305. Additional guidance may be found in&para;<br>the Court’s broader equal protection jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rice v.&para;<br>Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 517; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.&para;<br>469, 505. Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the government bears the burden to prove “ ‘that the reasons for any [racial]&para;<br>classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program using racial categories or classifications. A court may&para;<br>give some deference to a university’s “judgment that such diversity is&para;<br>essential to its educational mission,” 539 U. S., at 328, provided that&para;<br>diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision. On this&para;<br>point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for&para;<br>deference to the University’s experience and expertise about its educational mission. However, once the University has established that&para;<br>its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University&para;<br>must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are narrowly tailored to its goal. On this point, the University receives no&para;<br>deference. Id., at 333. It is at all times the University’s obligation to&para;<br>demonstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that admissions processes “ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity&para;<br>the defining feature of his or her application.” Id., at 337. Narrow&para;<br>tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is “necessary” for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits&para;<br>of diversity. Bakke, supra, at 305. The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would&para;<br>produce the educational benefits of diversity.&para;<br>Rather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit&para;<br>held petitioner could challenge only whether the University’s decision&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to use race as an admissions factor “was made in good faith.” It presumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the&para;<br>burden of rebutting that presumption. It thus undertook the narrowtailoring requirement with a “degree of deference” to the school.&para;<br>These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grutter’s command that “all racial classifications imposed by government&para;<br>‘must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539&para;<br>U. S., at 326. Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a&para;<br>school’s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice,&para;<br>yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The&para;<br>Court vacates the Fifth Circuit’s judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded&para;<br>so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a&para;<br>correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the&para;<br>University’s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess&para;<br>whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that&para;<br>its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational&para;<br>benefits of diversity.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>scrutiny, its decision affirming the District Court’s grant&para;<br>of summary judgment to the University was incorrect.&para;<br>That decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Located in Austin, Texas, on the most renowned campus&para;<br>of the Texas state university system, the University is one&para;<br>of the leading institutions of higher education in the Nation. Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when&para;<br>petitioner sought admission to the University’s entering&para;<br>class, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group&para;<br>12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.&para;<br>Petitioner was denied admission.&para;<br>In recent years the University has used three different&para;<br>programs to evaluate candidates for admission. The first&para;<br>is the program it used for some years before 1997, when&para;<br>the University considered two factors: a numerical score&para;<br>reflecting an applicant’s test scores and academic performance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the&para;<br>applicant’s race. In 1996, this system was held unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Fifth Circuit. It ruled the University’s consideration of&para;<br>race violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did&para;<br>not further any compelling government interest. Hopwood&para;<br>v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932, 955 (1996).&para;<br>The second program was adopted to comply with the&para;<br>Hopwood decision. The University stopped considering&para;<br>race in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic&para;<br>metric of a candidate’s potential contribution to the University, to be used in conjunction with the Academic Index. This “Personal Achievement Index” (PAI) measures a&para;<br>student’s leadership and work experience, awards, extracurricular activities, community service, and other special&para;<br>circumstances that give insight into a student’s back-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ground. These included growing up in a single-parent&para;<br>home, speaking a language other than English at home,&para;<br>significant family responsibilities assumed by the applicant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the student’s family. Seeking to address the decline in minority&para;<br>enrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded&para;<br>its outreach programs.&para;<br>The Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop­&para;<br>wood decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top&para;<br>Ten Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803&para;<br>(West 2009). Also referred to as H. B. 588, the Top&para;<br>Ten Percent Law grants automatic admission to any public state college, including the University, to all students&para;<br>in the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas&para;<br>that comply with certain standards.&para;<br>The University’s revised admissions process, coupled&para;<br>with the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in&para;<br>a more racially diverse environment at the University.&para;<br>Before the admissions program at issue in this case, in the&para;<br>last year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did&para;<br>not consider race, the entering class was 4.5% AfricanAmerican and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with&para;<br>the 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when&para;<br>race was explicitly considered, and the University’s entering freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5%&para;<br>Hispanic.&para;<br>Following this Court’s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger,&para;<br>supra, and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), the&para;<br>University adopted a third admissions program, the 2004&para;<br>program in which the University reverted to explicit consideration of race. This is the program here at issue. In&para;<br>Grutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many&para;<br>“plus factors” in an admissions program that considered&para;<br>the overall individual contribution of each candidate. In&para;<br>Gratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michigan’s undergraduate admissions program, which automat-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ically awarded points to applicants from certain racial&para;<br>minorities.&para;<br>The University’s plan to resume race-conscious admissions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an internal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and&para;<br>Ethnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The&para;<br>Proposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset&para;<br>of undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24&para;<br>students. It showed that few of these classes had significant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addition the Proposal relied on what it called “anecdotal”&para;<br>reports from students regarding their “interaction in the&para;<br>classroom.” The Proposal concluded that the University&para;<br>lacked a “critical mass” of minority students and that to&para;<br>remedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit&para;<br>consideration to race in the undergraduate admissions&para;<br>program.&para;<br>To implement the Proposal the University included a&para;<br>student’s race as a component of the PAI score, beginning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University&para;<br>asks students to classify themselves from among five&para;<br>predefined racial categories on the application. Race is not&para;<br>assigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed&para;<br>that race is a meaningful factor.&para;<br>Once applications have been scored, they are plotted&para;<br>on a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the&para;<br>Personal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid&para;<br>students are assigned to so-called cells based on their&para;<br>individual scores. All students in the cells falling above a&para;<br>certain line are admitted. All students below the line are&para;<br>not. Each college—such as Liberal Arts or Engineering—&para;<br>admits students separately. So a student is considered&para;<br>initially for her first-choice college, then for her second&para;<br>choice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared&para;<br>major.&para;<br>Petitioner applied for admission to the University’s 2008&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

She sued the University&para;<br>and various University officials in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged&para;<br>that the University’s consideration of race in admissions&para;<br>violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parties crossmoved for summary judgment. The District Court granted&para;<br>summary judgment to the University. The United States&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. It held&para;<br>that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference&para;<br>to the University, both in the definition of the compelling&para;<br>interest in diversity’s benefits and in deciding whether its&para;<br>specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated&para;<br>goal. Applying that standard, the court upheld the University’s admissions plan. 631 F. 3d 213, 217–218 (2011).&para;<br>Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>denied petitioner’s request for rehearing en banc. See 644&para;<br>F. 3d 301, 303 (CA5 2011) (per curiam). Petitioner sought&para;<br>a writ of certiorari. The writ was granted. 565 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2012).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Among the Court’s cases involving racial classifications&para;<br>in education, there are three decisions that directly address the question of considering racial minority status as&para;<br>a positive or favorable factor in a university’s admissions&para;<br>process, with the goal of achieving the educational benefits&para;<br>of a more diverse student body: Bakke, 438 U. S. 265;&para;<br>Gratz, supra; and Grutter, 539 U. S. 306. We take those&para;<br>cases as given for purposes of deciding this case.&para;<br>We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice&para;<br>Powell in Bakke, supra. In Bakke, the Court considered&para;<br>a system used by the medical school of the University of&para;<br>California at Davis. From an entering class of 100 students the school had set aside 16 seats for minority applicants. In holding this program impermissible under the&para;<br>Equal Protection Clause Justice Powell’s opinion stated&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>certain basic premises. First, “decisions based on race&para;<br>or ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state&para;<br>universities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id., at 287 (separate opinion). The principle&para;<br>of equal protection admits no “artificial line of a ‘twoclass theory’ ” that “permits the recognition of special&para;<br>wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that&para;<br>accorded others.” Id., at 295. It is therefore irrelevant&para;<br>that a system of racial preferences in admissions may&para;<br>seem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict&para;<br>scrutiny, for when government decisions “touch upon an&para;<br>individual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a&para;<br>judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear&para;<br>on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling&para;<br>governmental interest.” Id., at 299.&para;<br>Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest&para;<br>that could justify the consideration of race: the interest in&para;<br>the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student&para;<br>body. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a&para;<br>compelling interest, because a university’s “broad mission&para;<br>[of] education” is incompatible with making the “judicial,&para;<br>legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or&para;<br>statutory violations” necessary to justify remedial racial&para;<br>classification. Id., at 307–309.&para;<br>The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast,&para;<br>serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced classroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and&para;<br>stereotypes. The academic mission of a university is&para;<br>“a special concern of the First Amendment.” Id., at 312.&para;<br>Part of “ ‘the business of a university [is] to provide that&para;<br>atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment, and creation,’ ” and this in turn leads to the question of “ ‘who may be admitted to study.’ ” Sweezy v. New&para;<br>Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Justice Powell’s central point, however, was that this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>interest in securing diversity’s benefits, although a permissible objective, is complex. “It is not an interest in&para;<br>simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of&para;<br>the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members&para;<br>of selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage&para;<br>an undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity&para;<br>that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a&para;<br>far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of&para;<br>which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.” Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (separate&para;<br>opinion).&para;<br>In Gratz, 539 U. S. 244, and Grutter, supra, the Court&para;<br>endorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell. In Grut­&para;<br>ter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the&para;<br>educational benefits of “student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.” Id., at 325.&para;<br>As Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows&para;<br>only if a clear precondition is met: The particular admissions process used for this objective is subject to judicial&para;<br>review. Race may not be considered unless the admissions&para;<br>process can withstand strict scrutiny. “Nothing in Justice&para;<br>Powell’s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may&para;<br>employ whatever means it desires to achieve the stated&para;<br>goal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by&para;<br>our strict scrutiny analysis.” Gratz, supra, at 275. “To be&para;<br>narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program&para;<br>cannot use a quota system,” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 334, but&para;<br>instead must “remain flexible enough to ensure that each&para;<br>applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way&para;<br>that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining&para;<br>feature of his or her application,” id., at 337. Strict scrutiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that&para;<br>its “purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible&para;<br>and substantial, and that its use of the classification is&para;<br>necessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.”&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Bakke, 438 U. S., at 305 (opinion of Powell, J.) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>While these are the cases that most specifically address&para;<br>the central issue in this case, additional guidance may&para;<br>be found in the Court’s broader equal protection jurisprudence which applies in this context. “Distinctions between&para;<br>citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very&para;<br>nature odious to a free people,” Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U. S.&para;<br>495, 517 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), and&para;<br>therefore “are contrary to our traditions and hence constitutionally suspect,” Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499&para;<br>(1954). “ ‘[B]ecause racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,’ ” Richmond&para;<br>v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 505 (1989) (quoting&para;<br>Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 533–534 (1980)&para;<br>(Stevens, J., dissenting)), “the Equal Protection Clause&para;<br>demands that racial classifications . . . be subjected to the&para;<br>‘most rigid scrutiny.’ ” Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11&para;<br>(1967).&para;<br>To implement these canons, judicial review must begin&para;<br>from the position that “any official action that treats a&para;<br>person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is&para;<br>inherently suspect.” Fullilove, supra, at 523 (Stewart, J.,&para;<br>dissenting); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192&para;<br>(1964). Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and it&para;<br>is the government that bears the burden to prove “ ‘that&para;<br>the reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate,’ ” Croson, supra, at&para;<br>505 (quoting Fullilove, 448 supra, at 533–535 (Stevens, J.,&para;<br>dissenting)).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Grutter made clear that racial “classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests.” 539 U. S., at 326. And&para;<br>Grutter endorsed Justice Powell’s conclusion in Bakke that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“the attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher&para;<br>education.” 438 U. S., at 311–312 (separate opinion).&para;<br>Thus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied&para;<br>to any admissions program using racial categories or&para;<br>classifications.&para;<br>According to Grutter, a university’s “educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational&para;<br>mission is one to which we defer.” 539 U. S., at 328.&para;<br>Grutter concluded that the decision to pursue “the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity,” id.,&para;<br>at 330, that the University deems integral to its mission&para;<br>is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which&para;<br>some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under&para;<br>Grutter. A court, of course, should ensure that there is a&para;<br>reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision. On this point, the District Court and Court of&para;<br>Appeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for deference to the University’s conclusion, “ ‘based on its&para;<br>experience and expertise,’ ” 631 F. 3d, at 230 (quoting 645&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 587, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse student body would serve its educational goals. There is&para;<br>disagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with&para;<br>the principles of equal protection in approving this compelling interest in diversity. See post, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring); post, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., concurring); post, at 1–2&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But the parties here do not&para;<br>ask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter’s holding.&para;<br>A university is not permitted to define diversity as&para;<br>“some specified percentage of a particular group merely&para;<br>because of its race or ethnic origin.” Bakke, supra, at&para;<br>307 (opinion of Powell, J.). “That would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.”&para;<br>Grutter, supra, at 330. “Racial balancing is not transformed from ‘patently unconstitutional’ to a compelling&para;<br>state interest simply by relabeling it ‘racial diversity.’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v.

S. 701, 732 (2007).&para;<br>Once the University has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there&para;<br>must still be a further judicial determination that the&para;<br>admissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implementation. The University must prove that the means chosen&para;<br>by the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored&para;<br>to that goal. On this point, the University receives no&para;<br>deference. Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not&para;<br>for university administrators, to ensure that “[t]he means&para;<br>chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose&para;<br>must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish&para;<br>that purpose.” 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). True, a court can take account of a university’s&para;<br>experience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain&para;<br>admissions processes. But, as the Court said in Grutter, it&para;<br>remains at all times the University’s obligation to demonstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that&para;<br>admissions processes “ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an&para;<br>applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or&para;<br>her application.” Id., at 337.&para;<br>Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court&para;<br>verify that it is “necessary” for a university to use race&para;<br>to achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Bakke,&para;<br>supra, at 305. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into&para;<br>whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity&para;<br>without using racial classifications. Although “[n]arrow&para;<br>tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable&para;<br>race-neutral alternative,” strict scrutiny does require a&para;<br>court to examine with care, and not defer to, a university’s&para;<br>“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral&para;<br>alternatives.” See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339–340 (emphasis added). Consideration by the university is of course&para;<br>necessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no&para;<br>workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity. If “ ‘a nonracial approach&para;<br>. . . could promote the substantial interest about as well&para;<br>and at tolerable administrative expense,’ ” Wygant v.&para;<br>Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (quoting&para;<br>Greenawalt, Judicial Scrutiny of “Benign” Racial Preference in Law School Admissions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 559,&para;<br>578–579 (1975)), then the university may not consider&para;<br>race. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the&para;<br>validity of a university’s adoption of an affirmative action&para;<br>plan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to&para;<br>racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral&para;<br>alternatives do not suffice.&para;<br>Rather than perform this searching examination, however, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge&para;<br>only “whether [the University’s] decision to reintroduce&para;<br>race as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.”&para;<br>631 F. 3d, at 236. And in considering such a challenge,&para;<br>the court would “presume the University acted in good&para;<br>faith” and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that&para;<br>presumption. Id., at 231–232. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>held that to “second-guess the merits” of this aspect of&para;<br>the University’s decision was a task it was “ill-equipped to&para;<br>perform” and that it would attempt only to “ensure that&para;<br>[the University’s] decision to adopt a race-conscious admissions policy followed from [a process of] good faith&para;<br>consideration.” Id., at 231. The Court of Appeals thus&para;<br>concluded that “the narrow-tailoring inquiry—like the&para;<br>compelling-interest inquiry—is undertaken with a degree&para;<br>of deference to the Universit[y].” Id., at 232. Because “the&para;<br>efforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of&para;<br>high purpose,” the Court of Appeals held that the use of&para;<br>race in the admissions program fell within “a constitutionally protected zone of discretion.” Id., at 231.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>These expressions of the controlling standard are at&para;<br>odds with Grutter’s command that “all racial classifications imposed by government ‘must be analyzed by a&para;<br>reviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539 U. S., at 326&para;<br>(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S.&para;<br>200, 227 (1995)). In Grutter, the Court approved the plan&para;<br>at issue upon concluding that it was not a quota, was&para;<br>sufficiently flexible, was limited in time, and followed&para;<br>“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral&para;<br>alternatives.” 539 U. S., at 339. As noted above, see&para;<br>supra, at 1, the parties do not challenge, and the Court&para;<br>therefore does not consider, the correctness of that&para;<br>determination.&para;<br>Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an&para;<br>impermissible consideration of race. It must be remembered that “the mere recitation of a ‘benign’ or legitimate&para;<br>purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no&para;<br>weight.” Croson, 488 U. S., at 500. Strict scrutiny does&para;<br>not permit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its&para;<br>admissions process uses race in a permissible way without&para;<br>a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the&para;<br>process works in practice.&para;<br>The higher education dynamic does not change the&para;<br>narrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in&para;<br>other contexts. “[T]he analysis and level of scrutiny applied to determine the validity of [a racial] classification do&para;<br>not vary simply because the objective appears acceptable&para;<br>. . . . While the validity and importance of the objective&para;<br>may affect the outcome of the analysis, the analysis itself&para;<br>does not change.” Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,&para;<br>458 U. S. 718, 724, n. 9 (1982).&para;<br>The District Court and Court of Appeals confined the&para;<br>strict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring&para;<br>to the University’s good faith in its use of racial classifications and affirming the grant of summary judgment on&para;<br>that basis.

See&para;<br>Adarand, supra, at 237. Unlike Grutter, which was decided&para;<br>after trial, this case arises from cross-motions for summary judgment. In this case, as in similar cases, in determining whether summary judgment in favor of the&para;<br>University would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>must assess whether the University has offered sufficient&para;<br>evidence that would prove that its admissions program is&para;<br>narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of&para;<br>diversity.

But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must&para;<br>not be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judicial review to be meaningful, a university must make a&para;<br>showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the&para;<br>only interest that this Court has approved in this context:&para;<br>the benefits of a student body diversity that “encompasses&para;<br>a . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of&para;<br>which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.” Bakke, 438 U.

Jenkins, 515 U.

Jenkins, supra, at 121 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring). And rightly so. “Purchased at the price of&para;<br>immeasurable human suffering, the equal protection&para;<br>principle reflects our Nation’s understanding that [racial]&para;<br>classifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the&para;<br>individual and our society.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.&para;<br>Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in&para;<br>part and concurring in judgment). “The Constitution&para;<br>abhors classifications based on race” because “every time&para;<br>the government places citizens on racial registers and&para;<br>makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.” Grutter, supra, at 353 (THOMAS,&para;<br>J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Court first articulated the strict-scrutiny standard&para;<br>in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944).&para;<br>There, we held that “[p]ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial&para;<br>antagonism never can.” Id., at 216.1 Aside from Grutter,&para;<br>the Court has recognized only two instances in which a&para;<br>“[p]ressing public necessity” may justify racial discrimination by the government. First, in Korematsu, the Court&para;<br>recognized that protecting national security may satisfy&para;<br>this exacting standard. In that case, the Court upheld an&para;<br>evacuation order directed at “all persons of Japanese&para;<br>ancestry” on the grounds that the Nation was at war with&para;<br>Japan and that the order had “a definite and close rela——————&para;<br>1 The standard of “pressing public necessity” is more frequently called&para;<br>a “compelling governmental interest.” I use the terms interchangeably.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Second, the Court has recognized that&para;<br>the government has a compelling interest in remedying&para;<br>past discrimination for which it is responsible, but we&para;<br>have stressed that a government wishing to use race must&para;<br>provide “a ‘strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that&para;<br>remedial action [is] necessary.’ ” Richmond v. J. A. Croson&para;<br>Co., 488 U. S. 469, 500, 504 (1989) (quoting Wygant v.&para;<br>Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality&para;<br>opinion)).&para;<br>In contrast to these compelling interests that may, in a&para;<br>narrow set of circumstances, justify racial discrimination,&para;<br>the Court has frequently found other asserted interests&para;<br>insufficient. For example, in Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S.&para;<br>429 (1984), the Court flatly rejected a claim that the best&para;<br>interests of a child justified the government’s racial discrimination. In that case, a state court awarded custody&para;<br>to a child’s father because the mother was in a mixed-race&para;<br>marriage. The state court believed the child might be&para;<br>stigmatized by living in a mixed-race household and&para;<br>sought to avoid this perceived problem in its custody&para;<br>determination. We acknowledged the possibility of stigma&para;<br>but nevertheless concluded that “the reality of private&para;<br>biases and the possible injury they might inflict” do not&para;<br>justify racial discrimination. Id., at 433. As we explained,&para;<br>“The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but&para;<br>neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or&para;<br>indirectly, give them effect.” Ibid.&para;<br>Two years later, in Wygant, supra, the Court held that&para;<br>even asserted interests in remedying societal discrimination and in providing role models for minority students&para;<br>could not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimination. In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement&para;<br>between a school board and a teacher’s union favored&para;<br>teachers who were “ ‘Black, American Indian, Oriental, or&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>of Spanish descendancy.’ ” Id., at 270–271, and n. 2 (plurality opinion). We rejected the interest in remedying&para;<br>societal discrimination because it had no logical stopping&para;<br>point. Id., at 276. We similarly rebuffed as inadequate&para;<br>the interest in providing role models to minority students&para;<br>and added that the notion that “black students are better&para;<br>off with black teachers could lead to the very system the&para;<br>Court rejected in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.&para;<br>483 (1954).” Ibid.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Grutter was a radical departure from our strict-scrutiny&para;<br>precedents. In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law&para;<br>School (Law School) claimed that it had a compelling&para;<br>reason to discriminate based on race. The reason it advanced did not concern protecting national security or&para;<br>remedying its own past discrimination. Instead, the Law&para;<br>School argued that it needed to discriminate in admissions&para;<br>decisions in order to obtain the “educational benefits that&para;<br>flow from a diverse student body.” 539 U. S., at 317.&para;<br>Contrary to the very meaning of strict scrutiny, the Court&para;<br>deferred to the Law School’s determination that this interest was sufficiently compelling to justify racial discrimination. Id., at 325.&para;<br>I dissented from that part of the Court’s decision. I&para;<br>explained that “only those measures the State must take&para;<br>to provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent violence, will constitute a ‘pressing public necessity’ ” sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny. Id., at 353. Cf. Lee v.&para;<br>Washington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (Black, J., concurring) (protecting prisoners from violence might justify&para;<br>narrowly tailored discrimination); J. A.

The use of the conjunction, “and,” implies that the University believes its&para;<br>discrimination furthers two distinct interests. The first is&para;<br>an interest in attaining diversity for its own sake. The second is an interest in attaining educational benefits that&para;<br>allegedly flow from diversity.&para;<br>Attaining diversity for its own sake is a nonstarter. As&para;<br>even Grutter recognized, the pursuit of diversity as an end&para;<br>is nothing more than impermissible “racial balancing.”&para;<br>539 U. S., at 329–330 (“The Law School’s interest is not&para;<br>simply ‘to assure within its student body some specified&para;<br>percentage of a particular group merely because of its race&para;<br>or ethnic origin.’ That would amount to outright racial&para;<br>balancing, which is patently unconstitutional” (quoting&para;<br>Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.

Therefore,&para;<br>the educational benefits allegedly produced by diversity&para;<br>must rise to the level of a compelling state interest in order&para;<br>for the program to survive strict scrutiny.&para;<br>Unfortunately for the University, the educational benefits flowing from student body diversity—assuming they&para;<br>exist—hardly qualify as a compelling state interest.

Within a matter of years, the warning became&para;<br>reality: After being ordered to desegregate, Prince Edward&para;<br>County closed its public schools from the summer of 1959&para;<br>until the fall of 1964.

See Grutter,&para;<br>539 U. S., at 365–366 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“Contained within today’s majority opinion is the seed of a new&para;<br>constitutional justification for a concept I thought long&para;<br>and rightly rejected—racial segregation”).

Today, the segregationists’ arguments would never be given serious consideration. But see M.

And&para;<br>they even appealed to the fact that many blacks agreed&para;<br>that separate schools were in the “best interests” of both&para;<br>races. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Davis 24–25 (“ ‘It&para;<br>has been my experience, in working with the people of&para;<br>Virginia, including both white and Negro, that the customs and the habits and the traditions of Virginia citizens&para;<br>are such that they believe for the best interests of both the&para;<br>white and the Negro that the separate school is best’ ”).&para;<br>Following in these inauspicious footsteps, the University&para;<br>would have us believe that its discrimination is likewise&para;<br>benign. I think the lesson of history is clear enough:&para;<br>Racial discrimination is never benign. “ ‘[B]enign’ carries&para;<br>with it no independent meaning, but reflects only acceptance of the current generation’s conclusion that a&para;<br>politically acceptable burden, imposed on particular citizens on the basis of race, is reasonable.” See Metro Broad­&para;<br>casting, 497 U.

The University’s professed good intentions cannot excuse its outright racial discrimination any more&para;<br>than such intentions justified the now denounced arguments of slaveholders and segregationists.&para;<br>B&para;<br>While it does not, for constitutional purposes, matter&para;<br>whether the University’s racial discrimination is benign, I&para;<br>note that racial engineering does in fact have insidious&para;<br>consequences. There can be no doubt that the University’s&para;<br>discrimination injures white and Asian applicants who are&para;<br>denied admission because of their race. But I believe the&para;<br>injury to those admitted under the University’s discriminatory admissions program is even more harmful.&para;<br>Blacks and Hispanics admitted to the University as a&para;<br>result of racial discrimination are, on average, far less&para;<br>prepared than their white and Asian classmates. In the&para;<br>University’s entering class of 2009, for example, among&para;<br>the students admitted outside the Top Ten Percent plan,&para;<br>blacks scored at the 52d percentile of 2009 SAT takers&para;<br>nationwide, while Asians scored at the 93d percentile.&para;<br>Brief for Richard Sander et al. as Amici Curiae 3–4, and&para;<br>n. 4.

There is no reason to believe this is&para;<br>not the case at the University. The University and its&para;<br>dozens of amici are deafeningly silent on this point.&para;<br>Furthermore, the University’s discrimination does&para;<br>nothing to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics&para;<br>who have access to a college education generally. Instead,&para;<br>the University’s discrimination has a pervasive shifting&para;<br>effect. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the&para;<br>World 145–146 (2004). The University admits minorities&para;<br>who otherwise would have attended less selective colleges&para;<br>where they would have been more evenly matched. But,&para;<br>as a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispanics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are&para;<br>placed in a position where underperformance is all but&para;<br>inevitable because they are less academically prepared&para;<br>than the white and Asian students with whom they must&para;<br>compete.

And, like so many educational institutions across the Nation,1 the University&para;<br>has taken care to follow the model approved by the Court&para;<br>in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003).

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 587, 609 (WD Tex. 2009) (“[T]he parties agree&para;<br>[that the University’s] policy was based on the [admissions] policy [upheld in Grutter].”).&para;<br>Petitioner urges that Texas’ Top Ten Percent Law and&para;<br>race-blind holistic review of each application achieve&para;<br>significant diversity, so the University must be content&para;<br>with those alternatives. I have said before and reiterate&para;<br>here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly&para;<br>neutral alternatives as race unconscious. See Gratz, 539&para;<br>U. S., at 303–304, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). As Justice&para;<br>Souter observed, the vaunted alternatives suffer from “the&para;<br>disadvantage of deliberate obfuscation.” Id., at 297–298&para;<br>(dissenting opinion).&para;<br>Texas’ percentage plan was adopted with racially segregated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.&para;<br>See House Research Organization, Bill Analysis, HB 588,&para;<br>pp. 4–5 (Apr. 15, 1997) (“Many regions of the state, school&para;<br>districts, and high schools in Texas are still predominantly&para;<br>composed of people from a single racial or ethnic group.&para;<br>Because of the persistence of this segregation, admitting&para;<br>the top 10 percent of all high schools would provide a&para;<br>diverse population and ensure that a large, well qualified&para;<br>pool of minority students was admitted to Texas universities.”). It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that&para;<br>drives such plans.2 As for holistic review, if universities&para;<br>cannot explicitly include race as a factor, many may “resort to camouflage” to “maintain their minority enrollment.” Gratz, 539 U. S., at 304 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>notion that Texas’ Top Ten Percent Law is race neutral calls to&para;<br>mind Professor Thomas Reed Powell’s famous statement: “If you think&para;<br>that you can think about a thing inextricably attached to something&para;<br>else without thinking of the thing which it is attached to, then you have&para;<br>a legal mind.” T. Arnold, The Symbols of Government 101 (1935)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Only that kind of legal mind could&para;<br>conclude that an admissions plan specifically designed to produce racial&para;<br>diversity is not race conscious.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>I have several times explained why government actors,&para;<br>including state universities, need not be blind to the lingering effects of “an overtly discriminatory past,” the&para;<br>legacy of “centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.” Id., at&para;<br>298 (dissenting opinion). See also Adarand Constructors,&para;<br>Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 272–274 (1995) (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). Among constitutionally permissible options, I&para;<br>remain convinced, “those that candidly disclose their&para;<br>consideration of race [are] preferable to those that conceal&para;<br>it.” Gratz, 539 U. S., at 305, n. 11 (dissenting opinion).&para;<br>Accordingly, I would not return this case for a second&para;<br>look. As the thorough opinions below show, 631 F. 3d 213&para;<br>(CA5 2011); 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, the University’s admissions policy flexibly considers race only as a “factor of a&para;<br>factor of a factor of a factor” in the calculus, id., at 608;&para;<br>followed a yearlong review through which the University&para;<br>reached the reasonable, good-faith judgment that supposedly race-neutral initiatives were insufficient to achieve,&para;<br>in appropriate measure, the educational benefits of studentbody diversity, see 631 F. 3d, at 225–226; and is subject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of&para;<br>race remains necessary and proper to achieve the University’s educational objectives, see id., at 226.3 Justice&para;<br>Powell’s opinion in Bakke and the Court’s decision in&para;<br>Grutter require no further determinations. See Grutter,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 As the Court said in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 339 (2003),&para;<br>“[n]arrow tailoring . . . require[s] serious, good faith consideration of&para;<br>workable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the&para;<br>university seeks.” But, Grutter also explained, it does not “require a&para;<br>university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence&para;<br>[and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities&para;<br>to members of all racial groups.” Ibid. I do not read the Court to&para;<br>say otherwise. See ante, at 10 (acknowledging that, in determining&para;<br>whether a race-conscious admissions policy satisfies Grutter’s narrowtailoring requirement, “a court can take account of a university’s&para;<br>experience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions&para;<br>processes”).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>539 U. S., at 333–343; Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315–320.&para;<br>The Court rightly declines to cast off the equal protection framework settled in Grutter. See ante, at 5. Yet it&para;<br>stops short of reaching the conclusion that framework&para;<br>warrants. Instead, the Court vacates the Court of Appeals’ judgment and remands for the Court of Appeals to&para;<br>“assess whether the University has offered sufficient&para;<br>evidence [to] prove that its admissions program is narrowly&para;<br>tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13. As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already&para;<br>completed that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this&para;<br>Court’s Bakke and Grutter pathmarkers, merits our&para;<br>approbation.4&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Because the University’s admissions policy, in my view, is constitutional under Grutter, there is no need for the Court in this case “to&para;<br>revisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether&para;<br>designed to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group,&para;<br>should be subject to the same standard of judicial review.” 539 U. S., at&para;<br>346, n. (GINSBURG, J., concurring). See also Gratz v. Bollinger, 539&para;<br>U. S. 244, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“Actions designed to&para;<br>burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly&para;<br>ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched&para;<br>discrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated.”).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
