KENNY&para;<br>A., BY HIS NEXT FRIEND WINN, ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–970.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 14, 2009—Decided April 21, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Title 42 U. S. C. §1988 authorizes courts to award a “reasonable” attor&para;<br>ney’s fee for prevailing parties in civil rights actions. Half of respon&para;<br>dents’ $14 million fee request was based on their calculation of the&para;<br>“lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours the attorneys and their employ&para;<br>ees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the commu&para;<br>nity. The other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work&para;<br>and results, supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would&para;<br>be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience&para;<br>to litigate this case. Awarding fees of about $10.5 million, the Dis&para;<br>trict Court found that the proposed hourly rates were “fair and rea&para;<br>sonable,” but that some of the entries on counsel’s billing records&para;<br>were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were ex&para;<br>cessive. The court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately $6 mil&para;<br>lion, but enhanced that award by 75%, or an additional $4.5 million.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The calculation of an attorney’s fee based on the lodestar may be&para;<br>increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary cir&para;<br>cumstances. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(a) The lodestar approach has “achieved dominance in the federal&para;<br>courts.” Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 801. Although imper&para;<br>fect, it has several important virtues: It produces an award that ap&para;<br>proximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for&para;<br>representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a compa&para;<br>rable case; and it is readily administrable, see, e.g., Burlington v. Da&para;<br>gue, 505 U. S. 557, 566, and “objective,” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461&para;<br>U. S. 424, 433, thereby cabining trial judges’ discretion, permitting&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>meaningful judicial review, and producing reasonably predictable re&para;<br>sults. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) This Court has established six important rules that lead to&para;<br>today’s decision. First, a “reasonable” fee is one that is sufficient to&para;<br>induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meri&para;<br>torious civil rights case, see Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citi&para;<br>zens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565, but that does not pro&para;<br>vide “a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of&para;<br>attorneys,” ibid. Second, there is a “strong” presumption that the&para;<br>lodestar method yields a sufficient fee. See, e.g., id., at 564. Third,&para;<br>the Court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount&para;<br>for performance, but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may&para;<br>be awarded in “rare” and “exceptional” circumstances. E.g., id., at&para;<br>565. Fourth, “the lodestar includes most, if not all, of the relevant&para;<br>factors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee.” Id., at 566. An en&para;<br>hancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the&para;<br>lodestar calculation, such as the case’s novelty and complexity, see,&para;<br>e.g., Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898, or the quality of an attor&para;<br>ney’s performance, Delaware Valley, supra, at 566. Fifth, the burden&para;<br>of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee&para;<br>applicant. E.g., Blum, 465 U. S., at 901. Sixth, an applicant seeking&para;<br>an enhancement must produce “specific evidence” supporting the&para;<br>award, id., at 899, 901, to assure that the calculation is objective and&para;<br>capable of being reviewed on appeal. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(c) The Court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the&para;<br>lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation. The “strong&para;<br>presumption” that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in&para;<br>those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately&para;<br>account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a&para;<br>reasonable fee. P. 9.&para;<br>(d) The Court treats the quality of an attorney’s performance and&para;<br>the results obtained as one factor, since superior results are relevant&para;<br>only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior at&para;<br>torney performance and not another factor, such as inferior perform&para;<br>ance by opposing counsel. The circumstances in which superior at&para;<br>torney performance is not adequately taken into account in the&para;<br>lodestar calculation are “rare” and “exceptional.” Enhancements&para;<br>should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee&para;<br>would not have been “adequate to attract competent counsel.” Blum,&para;<br>supra, at 897. First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the&para;<br>method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately meas&para;<br>ure the attorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part during&para;<br>the litigation. This may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into&para;<br>account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, the trial judge&para;<br>should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking&para;<br>the attorney’s ability to a prevailing market rate. Second, an en&para;<br>hancement may be appropriate if the attorney’s performance includes&para;<br>an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exception&para;<br>ally protracted. In such cases, the enhancement amount must be cal&para;<br>culated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of&para;<br>being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard interest&para;<br>rate to the qualifying expense outlays. Third, an enhancement may&para;<br>be appropriate where an attorney’s performance involves exceptional&para;<br>delay in the payment of fees. In such a case, the enhancement should&para;<br>be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional de&para;<br>lay in expense reimbursement. Enhancements are not appropriate&para;<br>on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more&para;<br>common. Nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increas&para;<br>ingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with&para;<br>a bonus for obtaining specified results. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>2. The District Court did not provide proper justification for the&para;<br>75% fee enhancement it awarded in this case. It commented that the&para;<br>enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropri&para;<br>ate hourly rate, but the effect was to raise the top rate from $495 to&para;<br>more than $866 per hour, while nothing in the record shows that this&para;<br>is an appropriate figure for the relevant market. The court also em&para;<br>phasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for ex&para;<br>penses and wait for reimbursement, but did not calculate the amount&para;<br>of the enhancement attributable to this factor. Similarly, the court&para;<br>noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the&para;<br>case, but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was out&para;<br>side the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on §1988 for&para;<br>fees. Nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordi&para;<br>nary and unwarranted delay. And its reliance on the contingency of&para;<br>the outcome contravenes Dague, supra, at 565. Finally, insofar as&para;<br>the court relied on a comparison of counsel’s performance in this case&para;<br>with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases, it did not employ a&para;<br>methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review. While de&para;<br>termining a “reasonable attorney’s fee” is within the trial judge’s&para;<br>sound discretion under §1988, that discretion is not unlimited. The&para;<br>judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of&para;<br>a fee determination, including any enhancement. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>532 F. 3d 1209, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C. J.,&para;<br>and SCALIA, KENNEDY, and THOMAS, JJ., joined.

But as we have also said in prior cases,&para;<br>there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is suffi&para;<br>cient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot&para;<br>be used as a ground for increasing an award above the&para;<br>lodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identi&para;<br>fying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 JUSTICE BREYER would have us answer this question “Yes” and then&para;<br>end the opinion. See post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissent&para;<br>ing in part). Such an opinion would be of little use to the bench or bar&para;<br>and would pointlessly invite an additional round of litigation. The&para;<br>issue of the standards to be applied in granting an enhancement is&para;<br>fairly subsumed within the question that we agreed to decide and has&para;<br>been extensively discussed in the briefs filed in this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced&para;<br>fee is justified. Because the District Court did not apply&para;<br>these standards, we reverse the decision below and re&para;<br>mand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents (plaintiffs below) are children in the Geor&para;<br>gia foster-care system and their next friends. They filed&para;<br>this class action on behalf of 3,000 children in foster care&para;<br>and named as defendants the Governor of Georgia and&para;<br>various state officials (petitioners in this case). Claiming&para;<br>that deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties&para;<br>near Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional&para;<br>and statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and&para;<br>declaratory relief, as well as attorney’s fees and expenses.&para;<br>The United States District Court for the Northern Dis&para;<br>trict of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation,&para;<br>where the parties entered into a consent decree, which the&para;<br>District Court approved. The consent decree resolved all&para;<br>pending issues other than the fees that respondents’ at&para;<br>torneys were entitled to receive under 42 U. S. C. §1988.2&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondents submitted a request for more than $14&para;<br>million in attorney’s fees. Half of that amount was based&para;<br>on their calculation of the lodestar—roughly 30,000 hours&para;<br>multiplied by hourly rates of $200 to $495 for attorneys&para;<br>and $75 to $150 for non-attorneys.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>request, respondents submitted affidavits asserting that&para;<br>these rates were within the range of prevailing market&para;<br>rates for legal services in the relevant market.&para;<br>The other half of the amount that respondents sought&para;<br>represented a fee enhancement for superior work and&para;<br>results. Affidavits submitted in support of this request&para;<br>claimed that the lodestar amount “would be generally&para;<br>insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill, judg&para;<br>ment, professional representation and experience” to&para;<br>litigate this case. See, e.g., App. 80. Petitioners objected&para;<br>to the fee request, contending that some of the proposed&para;<br>hourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were&para;<br>excessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate&para;<br>factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.&para;<br>The District Court awarded fees of approximately&para;<br>$10.5 million. See 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1296 (ND Ga.&para;<br>2006). The District Court found that the hourly rates&para;<br>proposed by respondents were “fair and reasonable,” id., at&para;<br>1285, but that some of the entries on counsel’s billing&para;<br>records were vague and that the hours claimed for many of&para;<br>the billing categories were excessive. The court therefore&para;<br>cut the non-travel hours by 15% and halved the hourly&para;<br>rate for travel hours. This resulted in a lodestar calcula&para;<br>tion of approximately $6 million.&para;<br>The court then enhanced this award by 75%, concluding&para;<br>that the lodestar calculation did not take into account “(1)&para;<br>the fact that class counsel were required to advance case&para;<br>expenses of $1.7 million over a three-year period with no&para;<br>on[-]going reimbursement, (2) the fact that class counsel&para;<br>were not paid on an on-going basis as the work was being&para;<br>performed, and (3) the fact that class counsel’s ability to&para;<br>recover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely&para;<br>contingent on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 1288. The&para;<br>court stated that respondents’ attorneys had exhibited “a&para;<br>higher degree of skill, commitment, dedication, and pro&para;<br>fessionalism . . . than the Court has seen displayed by the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>attorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the&para;<br>bench.” Id., at 1289. The court also commented that the&para;<br>results obtained were “ ‘extraordinary’ ” and added that&para;<br>“[a]fter 58 years as a practicing attorney and federal&para;<br>judge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a&para;<br>plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such&para;<br>a comprehensive scale.” Id., at 1290. The enhancement&para;<br>resulted in an additional $4.5 million fee award.&para;<br>Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a panel of the Elev&para;<br>enth Circuit affirmed. 532 F. 3d 1209 (2008). The panel&para;<br>held that the District Court had not abused its discretion&para;<br>by failing to make a larger reduction in the number of&para;<br>hours for which respondents’ attorneys sought reim&para;<br>bursement, but the panel commented that it “would have&para;<br>cut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter&para;<br>in the first instance” and added that the hourly rates&para;<br>approved by the District Court also “appear[ed] to be on&para;<br>the generous side.” Id., at 1220, and n. 2. On the question&para;<br>of the enhancement, however, the panel splintered, with&para;<br>each judge writing a separate opinion.&para;<br>Judge Carnes concluded that binding Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>precedent required that the decision of the District Court&para;<br>be affirmed, but he opined that the reasoning in our opin&para;<br>ions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in&para;<br>this case. He concluded that the quality of the attorneys’&para;<br>performance was “adequately accounted for ‘either in&para;<br>determining the reasonable number of hours expended on&para;<br>the litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 1225 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley&para;<br>Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565–566&para;<br>(1986) (Delaware Valley I)). He found that an enhance&para;<br>ment could not be justified based on delay in the recovery&para;<br>of attorney’s fees and reimbursable expenses because such&para;<br>delay is a routine feature of cases brought under 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1983. And he reasoned that the District Court&para;<br>had contravened our holding in Burlington v. Dague, 505&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 557 (1992), when it relied on “ ‘the fact that class&para;<br>counsel’s compensation was totally contingent upon pre&para;<br>vailing in this action.’ ” 532 F. 3d, at 1226, 1228 (quoting&para;<br>affidavit in support of fee request).&para;<br>Judge Wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed&para;<br>with Judge Carnes’ view that Eleventh Circuit precedent&para;<br>is inconsistent with our decisions. Judge Hill also con&para;<br>curred in the judgment but expressed no view about the&para;<br>correctness of the prior Circuit precedent.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the&para;<br>dissent of three judges. See 547 F. 3d 1319 (2008). Judge&para;<br>Wilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehear&para;<br>ing; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina,&para;<br>filed an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing;&para;<br>and Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending,&para;<br>among other things, that the District Court, by basing the&para;<br>enhancement in large part on a comparison of the per&para;<br>formance of respondents’ attorneys with all of the un&para;<br>named attorneys whose work he had observed during his&para;<br>professional career, had improperly rendered a decision&para;<br>that was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had&para;<br>essentially served as a witness in support of the enhance&para;<br>ment. Id., at 1326–1327.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The general rule in our legal system is that each party&para;<br>must pay its own attorney’s fees and expenses, see Hensley&para;<br>v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983), but Congress&para;<br>enacted 42 U. S. C. §1988 in order to ensure that federal&para;<br>rights are adequately enforced. Section 1988 provides that&para;<br>a prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may re&para;<br>cover “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Virtually identical language appears in many of the federal fee&para;<br>shifting statutes. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Unfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress&para;<br>meant by a “reasonable” fee, and therefore the task of&para;<br>identifying an appropriate methodology for determining a&para;<br>“reasonable” fee was left for the courts.&para;<br>One possible method was set out in Johnson v. Georgia&para;<br>Highway Express, Inc., 488 F. 2d 714, 717–719 (CA5&para;<br>1974), which listed 12 factors that a court should consider&para;<br>in determining a reasonable fee.4 This method, however,&para;<br>“gave very little actual guidance to district courts. Setting&para;<br>attorney’s fees by reference to a series of sometimes sub&para;<br>jective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges&para;<br>and produced disparate results.” Delaware Valley I,&para;<br>supra, at 563.&para;<br>An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by&para;<br>the Third Circuit in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadel&para;<br>phia v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp.,&para;<br>487 F. 2d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F. 2d 102&para;<br>(1976), and “achieved dominance in the federal courts”&para;<br>after our decision in Hensley. Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535&para;<br>U. S. 789, 801 (2002). “Since that time, ‘[t]he “lodestar”&para;<br>figure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light&para;<br>of our fee-shifting jurisprudence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Dague,&para;<br>supra, at 562).&para;<br>Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has&para;<br>several important virtues. First, in accordance with our&para;<br>understanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the&para;<br>lodestar looks to “the prevailing market rates in the rele&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 These factors were: “(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty&para;<br>and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the&para;<br>legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney&para;<br>due to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the&para;<br>fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or&para;<br>the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9)&para;<br>the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ‘unde&para;<br>sirability’ of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional&para;<br>relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley&para;<br>v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 430, n. 3 (1983).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vant community.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 895&para;<br>(1984). Developed after the practice of hourly billing had&para;<br>become widespread, see Gisbrecht, supra, at 801, the&para;<br>lodestar method produces an award that roughly approxi&para;<br>mates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have&para;<br>received if he or she had been representing a paying client&para;<br>who was billed by the hour in a comparable case. Second,&para;<br>the lodestar method is readily administrable, see Dague,&para;<br>505 U. S., at 566; see also Buckhannon Board &amp; Care&para;<br>Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human&para;<br>Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 609 (2001); and unlike the John&para;<br>son approach, the lodestar calculation is “objective,”&para;<br>Hensley, supra, at 433, and thus cabins the discretion of&para;<br>trial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and&para;<br>produces reasonably predictable results.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting&para;<br>statutes have established six important rules that lead to&para;<br>our decision in this case.&para;<br>First, a “reasonable” fee is a fee that is sufficient to&para;<br>induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation&para;<br>of a meritorious civil rights case. See Delaware Valley I,&para;<br>478 U. S., at 565 (“[I]f plaintiffs . . . find it possible to&para;<br>engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he&para;<br>will be paid a ‘reasonable fee,’ the purpose behind the fee&para;<br>shifting statute has been satisfied”); Blum, supra, at 897&para;<br>(“[A] reasonable attorney’s fee is one that is adequate to&para;<br>attract competent counsel, but that does not produce&para;<br>windfalls to attorneys” (ellipsis, brackets, and internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)). Section 1988’s aim is to en&para;<br>force the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide “a&para;<br>form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of&para;<br>attorneys.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565.&para;<br>Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is pre&para;<br>sumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. See Dague,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>supra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565; Blum,&para;<br>supra, at 897; see also Gisbrecht, supra, at 801–802.&para;<br>Indeed, we have said that the presumption is a “strong”&para;<br>one.

Delaware Valley I,&para;<br>supra, at 565; Blum, supra, at 897; Hensley, 461 U. S., at&para;<br>435.&para;<br>Fourth, we have noted that “the lodestar figure includes&para;<br>most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a ‘rea&para;<br>sonable’ attorney’s fee,” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566,&para;<br>and have held that an enhancement may not be awarded&para;<br>based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calcula&para;<br>tion, see Dague, supra, at 562–563; Pennsylvania v. Dela&para;<br>ware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711,&para;<br>726–727 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) (plurality opinion);&para;<br>Blum, 465 U. S., at 898. We have thus held that the nov&para;<br>elty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as&para;<br>a ground for an enhancement because these factors “pre&para;<br>sumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable&para;<br>hours recorded by counsel.” Ibid. We have also held that&para;<br>the quality of an attorney’s performance generally should&para;<br>not be used to adjust the lodestar “[b]ecause considera&para;<br>tions concerning the quality of a prevailing party’s coun&para;<br>sel’s representation normally are reflected in the reason&para;<br>able hourly rate.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566.&para;<br>Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is&para;<br>necessary must be borne by the fee applicant. Dague,&para;<br>supra, at 561; Blum, 465 U. S., at 901–902.&para;<br>Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must&para;<br>produce “specific evidence” that supports the award. Id.,&para;<br>at 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on “evidence&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that enhancement was necessary to provide fair and rea&para;<br>sonable compensation”). This requirement is essential if&para;<br>the lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues,&para;<br>i.e., providing a calculation that is objective and capable of&para;<br>being reviewed on appeal.&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In light of what we have said in prior cases, we reject&para;<br>any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar&para;<br>method may not be enhanced in any situation. The lode&para;<br>star method was never intended to be conclusive in all&para;<br>circumstances. Instead, there is a “strong presumption”&para;<br>that the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presump&para;<br>tion may be overcome in those rare circumstances in&para;<br>which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a&para;<br>factor that may properly be considered in determining a&para;<br>reasonable fee.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the&para;<br>quality of an attorney’s performance or the results ob&para;<br>tained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an&para;<br>enhancement. We treat these two factors as one. When a&para;<br>plaintiff’s attorney achieves results that are more favor&para;<br>able than would have been predicted based on the govern&para;<br>ing law and the available evidence, the outcome may be&para;<br>attributable to superior performance and commitment of&para;<br>resources by plaintiff’s counsel. Or the outcome may&para;<br>result from inferior performance by defense counsel, unan&para;<br>ticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable&para;<br>rulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or&para;<br>simple luck. Since none of these latter causes can justify&para;<br>an enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to&para;<br>the extent it can be shown that they are the result of&para;<br>superior attorney performance. Thus, we need only con&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sider whether superior attorney performance can justify&para;<br>an enhancement. And in light of the principles derived&para;<br>from our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circum&para;<br>stances in which superior attorney performance is not&para;<br>adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation.&para;<br>We conclude that there are a few such circumstances but&para;<br>that these circumstances are indeed “rare” and “excep&para;<br>tional,” and require specific evidence that the lodestar&para;<br>fee would not have been “adequate to attract competent&para;<br>counsel,” Blum, supra, at 897 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the&para;<br>method used in determining the hourly rate employed in&para;<br>the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the&para;<br>attorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part&para;<br>during the litigation.5 This may occur if the hourly rate is&para;<br>determined by a formula that takes into account only a&para;<br>single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)6 or&para;<br>perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an&para;<br>enhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is&para;<br>compensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in&para;<br>cases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes.&para;<br>But in order to provide a calculation that is objective and&para;<br>reviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney’s&para;<br>hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the&para;<br>attorney’s ability to a prevailing market rate.&para;<br>Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Respondents correctly note that an attorney’s “brilliant insights and&para;<br>critical maneuvers sometimes matter far more than hours worked or&para;<br>years of experience.” Brief for Respondents 14. But as we said in Blum&para;<br>v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984), “[i]n those cases, the special skill&para;<br>and experience of counsel should be reflected in the reasonableness of&para;<br>the hourly rates.”&para;<br>6 See, e.g., Salazar v. District of Columbia, 123 F. Supp. 2d 8 (DC&para;<br>2000); Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 354 (DC 1983),&para;<br>aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 746 F. 2d 4 (CADC 1984).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>attorney’s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of&para;<br>expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As&para;<br>Judge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to&para;<br>represent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay&para;<br>the attorney, the attorney presumably understands that&para;<br>no reimbursement is likely to be received until the suc&para;<br>cessful resolution of the case, 532 F. 3d, at 1227, and&para;<br>therefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reim&para;<br>bursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual&para;<br>cases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhance&para;<br>ment may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement&para;<br>must be calculated using a method that is reasonable,&para;<br>objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as&para;<br>by applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying&para;<br>outlays of expenses.&para;<br>Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in&para;<br>which an attorney’s performance involves exceptional&para;<br>delay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to&para;<br>be compensated under §1988 presumably understands&para;<br>that payment of fees will generally not come until the end&para;<br>of the case, if at all. See 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of&para;<br>Carnes, J.). Compensation for this delay is generally&para;<br>made “either by basing the award on current rates or by&para;<br>adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its&para;<br>present value.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 282&para;<br>(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not&para;<br>rule out the possibility that an enhancement may be ap&para;<br>propriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the&para;<br>face of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is&para;<br>unjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, how&para;<br>ever, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a&para;<br>method similar to that described above in connection with&para;<br>exceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for&para;<br>expenses.&para;<br>We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant&para;<br>performance enhancements on the ground that departures&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from hourly billing are becoming more common. As we&para;<br>have noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it&para;<br>provides a rough approximation of general billing prac&para;<br>tices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual,&para;<br>an alternative to the lodestar method may have to be&para;<br>found. However, neither respondents nor their amici&para;<br>contend that that day has arrived. Nor have they shown&para;<br>that permitting the award of enhancements on top of the&para;<br>lodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the&para;<br>general run of cases.&para;<br>We are told that, under an increasingly popular ar&para;<br>rangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate&para;<br>but receive a bonus if certain specified results are ob&para;<br>tained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an&para;<br>enhancement such as the one in this case. Brief for Re&para;<br>spondents 55–57. The analogy, however, is flawed. An&para;<br>attorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to&para;<br>a reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to&para;<br>earn a performance bonus is in a position far different&para;<br>from an attorney in a §1988 case who is compensated at&para;<br>the full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance&para;<br>enhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the&para;<br>litigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons&para;<br>for the purposes of administering enhancements, there&para;<br>fore, is not appropriate.&para;<br>V&para;<br>In the present case, the District Court did not provide&para;<br>proper justification for the large enhancement that it&para;<br>awarded. The court increased the lodestar award by 75%&para;<br>but, as far as the court’s opinion reveals, this figure ap&para;<br>pears to have been essentially arbitrary. Why, for exam&para;<br>ple, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the&para;<br>100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75%&para;<br>rather than 50% or 25% or 10%?&para;<br>The District Court commented that the enhancement&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was the “minimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary&para;<br>to reasonably compensate [respondents’] counsel.” 454&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1290. But the effect of the enhancement&para;<br>was to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than&para;<br>$866 per hour,7 and the District Court did not point to&para;<br>anything in the record that shows that this is an appro&para;<br>priate figure for the relevant market.&para;<br>The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents’&para;<br>counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses&para;<br>and had to wait for reimbursement, id., at 1288, but the&para;<br>court did not calculate the amount of the enhancement&para;<br>that is attributable to this factor. Similarly, the District&para;<br>Court noted that respondents’ counsel did not receive fees&para;<br>on an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the&para;<br>court did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the&para;<br>record that the delay here was outside the normal range&para;<br>expected by attorneys who rely on §1988 for the payment&para;<br>of their fees or quantify the disparity. Nor did the court&para;<br>provide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraor&para;<br>dinary and unwarranted delay. And the court’s reliance&para;<br>on the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding&para;<br>in Dague. See 505 U. S., at 565.&para;<br>Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a com&para;<br>parison of the performance of counsel in this case with the&para;<br>performance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the Dis&para;<br>trict Court did not employ a methodology that permitted&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER’s reliance on the average hourly rate for all of re&para;<br>spondents’ attorneys is highly misleading. See post, at 10. In calculat&para;<br>ing the lodestar, the District Court found that the hourly rate for each&para;<br>of these attorneys was “eminently fair and reasonable” and “consistent&para;<br>with the prevailing market rates in Atlanta for comparable work.” 454&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1285–1286. JUSTICE BREYER’s calculation of an average&para;<br>hourly rate for all attorney hours reflects nothing more than the fact&para;<br>that much of the work was performed by attorneys whose “fair and&para;<br>reasonable” market rate was below the market average.

Needless to say, we do not&para;<br>question the sincerity of the District Court’s observations,&para;<br>and we are in no position to assess their accuracy. But&para;<br>when a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impres&para;<br>sionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method—&para;<br>providing an objective and reviewable basis for fees, see&para;<br>id., at 566—is undermined.&para;<br>Determining a “reasonable attorney’s fee” is a matter&para;<br>that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,&para;<br>see 42 U.

C. §1988 (permitting court, “in its discretion,”&para;<br>to award fees), but the judge’s discretion is not unlimited.&para;<br>It is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific&para;<br>explanation for all aspects of a fee determination, includ&para;<br>ing any award of an enhancement. Unless such an expla&para;<br>nation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible,&para;<br>and without such review, widely disparate awards may be&para;<br>made, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may&para;<br>appear to be influenced) by a judge’s subjective opinion&para;<br>regarding particular attorneys or the importance of the&para;<br>case. In addition, in future cases, defendants contemplat&para;<br>ing the possibility of settlement will have no way to esti&para;<br>mate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge&para;<br>enhancement. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>case, witnessed the proceedings, and been able to evaluate&para;<br>the attorneys’ overall performance in light of the objec&para;<br>tives, context, legal difficulty, and practical obstacles&para;<br>present in the case. In a word, the district judge will have&para;<br>observed the attorney’s true “value, as demonstrated . . .&para;<br>during the litigation.” Ibid. (emphasis added). By con&para;<br>trast, a court of appeals, faced with a cold and perhaps&para;<br>lengthy record, will inevitably have less time and oppor&para;<br>tunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an&para;<br>exceptionally fine job. And this Court is yet less suited to&para;<br>performing that inquiry.&para;<br>Accordingly, determining&para;<br>whether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case&para;<br>“is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a&para;<br>trial judge,” ante, at 13, and the function of appellate&para;<br>courts is to review that judge’s determination for an abuse&para;<br>of such discretion. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S.&para;<br>552, 571 (1988); see also General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522&para;<br>U. S. 136, 143 (1997) (“[D]eference . . . is the hallmark of&para;<br>abuse-of-discretion review”).&para;<br>This case well illustrates why our tiered and function&para;<br>ally specialized judicial system places the task of deter&para;<br>mining an attorney’s fee award primarily in the district&para;<br>court’s hands. The plaintiffs’ lawyers spent eight years&para;<br>investigating the underlying facts, developing the initial&para;<br>complaint, conducting court proceedings, and working out&para;<br>final relief. The District Court’s docket, with over 600&para;<br>entries, consists of more than 18,000 pages. Transcripts of&para;<br>hearings and depositions, along with other documents,&para;<br>have produced a record that fills 20 large boxes. Neither&para;<br>we, nor an appellate panel, can easily read that entire&para;<br>record. Nor should we attempt to second-guess a district&para;<br>judge who is aware of the many intangible matters that&para;<br>the written page cannot reflect.&para;<br>My own review of this expansive record cannot possibly&para;<br>be exhaustive. But those portions of the record I have&para;<br>reviewed lead me to conclude, like the Court of Appeals,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when&para;<br>awarding an enhanced fee. I reach this conclusion based&para;<br>on four considerations.&para;<br>First, the record indicates that the lawyers’ objective in&para;<br>this case was unusually important and fully consistent&para;<br>with the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights&para;<br>statute, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Moreover, the problem the&para;<br>attorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of&para;<br>skill and effort. Specifically, these lawyers and their&para;<br>clients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its&para;<br>entire foster-care system—a system that much in the&para;<br>record describes as well below the level of minimal consti&para;<br>tutional acceptability. The record contains investigative&para;<br>reports, mostly prepared by Georgia’s own Office of the&para;<br>Child Advocate, which show, for example, the following:&para;<br>•	 The State’s foster-care system was unable to provide&para;<br>essential medical and mental health services; children&para;<br>consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and&para;<br>life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hear&para;<br>ing loss, due to failures on the part of the State to ad&para;<br>minister basic care and antibiotics. See, e.g., Doc. 3,&para;<br>Exh. 3C, pp. 11–13.&para;<br>•	 Understaffing and improper staffing placed children&para;<br>in the care of individuals with dangerous criminal re&para;<br>cords; children were physically assaulted by the staff,&para;<br>locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,&para;<br>and abused in other ways. See, e.g., Doc. 50, pp. 32–&para;<br>36, 55; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, pp. 2–6; Doc. 3, Exh. 2, pp. 4–&para;<br>5; Doc. 52, Exh. 1, pp. 6, 12–15, 34.&para;<br>•	 The shelters themselves were “unsanitary and dilapi&para;<br>dated,” “unclean,” infested with rats, “overcrowded,”&para;<br>unsafe, and “ ‘out of control.’ ” See, e.g., Doc. 3, Exh.&para;<br>3A, at 1–2; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, p. 2; Doc. 50, at 29.&para;<br>•	 Due to improper supervision and other deficiencies at&para;<br>the shelters, 20% of the children abused drugs; some&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>also became victims of child prostitution. See id., at&para;<br>39; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, at 3.&para;<br>•	 Systemic failures also caused vulnerable children to&para;<br>suffer regular beatings and sexual abuse, including&para;<br>rape, at the hands of more aggressive shelter resi&para;<br>dents. See, e.g., Doc. 50, at 18–22, 54–55; Doc. 52,&para;<br>Exh. 1, at 7–10, 26; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, at 3 (“[A child]&para;<br>was beaten so badly by eight other [children] that he&para;<br>suffered severe internal bleeding”); id., at 4 (describ&para;<br>ing violent sexual assault and rape).&para;<br>•	 Not surprisingly, many children—upwards of 5 per&para;<br>day and over 750 per year—tried to escape these con&para;<br>ditions; others tried to commit suicide. See, e.g., Doc.&para;<br>50, at 27–28, 54; Doc. 52, Exh. 18, p. 4 (under seal) (at&para;<br>least 25% of children run away from shelters); Doc.&para;<br>52, Exh. 18E, pp. 1–11, 18–19 (under seal) (daily logs);&para;<br>see also Doc. 50, Exh. 1, at 37, 54 (describing suicide&para;<br>attempts) (all docket entries above and hereinafter re&para;<br>fer to No. 1:02–cv–1686 (ND Ga.) (case below)).&para;<br>The State’s Office of the Child Advocate, whose reports&para;<br>provide much of the basis for the foregoing description,&para;<br>concluded that the system was “operating in crisis mode”&para;<br>and that any private operator who ran such a system&para;<br>“would never be licensed to care for children.” Office of the&para;<br>Child Advocate for the Protection of Children Ann.

But the State did not grant the Child&para;<br>Advocate’s office the litigating authority she sought. See&para;<br>2000 Ga. Laws p. 245, as codified, Ga. Code Ann. §15–11–&para;<br>173 (2008).&para;<br>The upshot is that the plaintiffs’ attorneys did what the&para;<br>child advocate could not do: They initiated this lawsuit.&para;<br>They thereby assumed the role of “a ‘private attorney&para;<br>general’ ” by filling an enforcement void in the State’s own&para;<br>legal system, a function “that Congress considered of the&para;<br>highest priority,” Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,&para;<br>390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968) (per curiam), and “meant to&para;<br>promote in enacting §1988,” Texas State Teachers Assn. v.&para;<br>Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 793&para;<br>(1989).&para;<br>Second, the course of the lawsuit was lengthy and ardu&para;<br>ous. The plaintiffs and their lawyers began with factual&para;<br>investigations beyond those which the child advocate had&para;<br>already conducted. See, e.g., Record, Docs. 50–52 (par&para;<br>tially under seal). They then filed suit. And the State met&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the plaintiffs’ efforts with a host of complex procedural, as&para;<br>well as substantive, objections. The State, for example,&para;<br>argued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate&para;<br>the shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might&para;<br>have approved the investigations, the State then removed&para;<br>the case to federal court; the State then sought protective&para;<br>orders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the&para;<br>shelters’ staff; and, after losing its motions, the State&para;<br>delayed to the point where the District Court “was forced&para;<br>to admonish [the] State Defendants for ‘relying on techni&para;<br>cal legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay&para;<br>and hinder the discovery process.’ ” 454 F. Supp. 2d. 1260,&para;<br>1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4). See&para;<br>also Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9–10; Docs. 26, 28–29, 44, 60.&para;<br>In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing&para;<br>the motion on complex legal doctrines such as Younger&para;<br>abstention and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which the&para;<br>District Court found inapplicable. 218 F. R. D. 277, 284–&para;<br>290 (ND Ga. 2003). See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37&para;<br>(1971); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),&para;<br>and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460&para;<br>U. S. 462 (1983). The State also opposed the petitioners’&para;<br>request to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster&para;<br>care, but the District Court again rejected the State’s&para;<br>argument. 218 F. R. D., at 299–302. And, after that, the&para;<br>State filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Re&para;<br>cord, Docs. 243–245, which plaintiffs’ attorneys opposed in&para;<br>thorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits,&para;<br>see Docs. 254–258, 260. After losing that motion and&para;<br>eventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced pro&para;<br>tracted litigation as to who should be the mediator. See&para;<br>Docs. 363–364, 366, 369–370, 373, 376, 380. All told, in&para;<br>opposing the plaintiffs’ efforts to have the foster-care&para;<br>system reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside&para;<br>counsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates,&para;<br>worked significantly more hours than that figure alone&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>indicates) and tapped its own law department for an addi&para;<br>tional 5,200 hours of work. 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287.&para;<br>Third, in the face of this opposition, the results obtained&para;<br>by the plaintiffs’ attorneys appear to have been excep&para;<br>tional. The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the&para;<br>course of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the&para;<br>State will take in order to address the specific deficiencies&para;<br>of the sort that I described above. See id., at 1289; see&para;<br>also App. 92–207 (consent decree). And it establishes a&para;<br>reporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by&para;<br>the District Court’s enforcement authority. See 454&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1289. As a result of the decree, the State&para;<br>agreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system,&para;<br>to the benefit of children in many different communities.&para;<br>And informed observers have described the decree as&para;<br>having brought about significant positive results. See,&para;<br>e.g., Record, Doc. 632, p. 4 (most recent court-appointed&para;<br>overseers’ report) (“The State’s overall performance . . .&para;<br>continues the trend of steady improvement . . .”); id., at 4–&para;<br>10 (detailing substantial health, safety, and welfare im&para;<br>provements); see also, Office of the Child Advocate Ann.&para;<br>Report (2008), Letter from Tom C.

Supp. 2d, at 1282;&para;<br>2. “based on its personal observation of plaintiffs’ coun&para;<br>sel’s performance throughout this litigation, the Court&para;<br>finds that . . . counsel brought a higher degree of skill,&para;<br>commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this&para;<br>litigation than the Court has seen displayed by the at&para;<br>torneys in any other case during its 27 years on the&para;<br>bench,” id., at 1288–1290;&para;<br>3. the Consent Decree “provided extraordinary benefits&para;<br>to the plaintiff class . . . .” Id., at 1282. “[T]he settle&para;<br>ment achieved by plaintiffs’ counsel is comprehensive&para;<br>in its scope and detailed in its coverage. . . .

I recognize that the ordinary lodestar&para;<br>calculation yields a large fee award. But by my assess&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, the lodestar calculation in this case translates to an&para;<br>average hourly fee per attorney of $249. See id., at 1287&para;<br>(lodestar calculation and attorney hours). (The majority’s&para;<br>reference to an hourly fee of $866, ante, at 12, refers to the&para;<br>rate associated with the single highest paid of the 17&para;<br>attorneys under the enhanced fee, not the average hourly&para;<br>rate under the lodestar. The lay reader should also bear&para;<br>in mind that a lawyer’s “fee” is substantially greater than&para;<br>his “profit,” given that attorneys must sometimes cover&para;<br>case-specific costs (which in this case exceeded $800,000,&para;<br>see 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1291) and also must cover routine&para;<br>overhead expenses, which typically consume 40% of their&para;<br>fees, see Altman Weil Publications, Inc., Survey of Law&para;<br>Firm Economics 30 (2007 ed.)).&para;<br>At $249 per hour, the lodestar would compensate this&para;<br>group of attorneys—whom the District Court described as&para;<br>extraordinary—at a rate lower than the average rate&para;<br>charged by attorneys practicing law in the State of Geor&para;<br>gia, where the average hourly rate is $268. See id., at 89.&para;<br>Accordingly, even the majority would seem to acknowledge&para;<br>that some form of an enhancement is appropriate in this&para;<br>case. See ante, at 10 (“[A]n enhancement may be appro&para;<br>priate where the method used in determining the hourly&para;<br>rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not ade&para;<br>quately measure the attorney’s true market value, as&para;<br>demonstrated in part during the litigation”). Indeed, the&para;<br>fact that these exceptional results were achieved in a case&para;<br>where “much of the work,” ante, at 13, n. 7, was performed&para;<br>by relatively inexperienced attorneys (who, accordingly,&para;<br>would be compensated by the lodestar “below the market&para;<br>average,” ibid.) is all the more reason to think that their&para;<br>service rendered their outstanding performance worthy of&para;<br>an enhancement. By comparison, the District Court’s&para;<br>enhanced award—a special one-time adjustment unique to&para;<br>this exceptional case—would compensate these attorneys,&para;<br>on this one occasion, at an average hourly rate of $435,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>which is comparable to the rates charged by the Nation’s&para;<br>leading law firms on average on every occasion. See Firm&para;<br>by-Firm Sampling of Billing Rates Nationwide, National&para;<br>Law Journal, Dec. 11, 2006, p. S2 (listing 13 firms at&para;<br>which average hourly rate is between $400 and $510); J.&para;<br>Barnett, Certification Drag: The Opinion Puzzle and&para;<br>Other Transactional Curiosities, 33 Iowa J.

Thus, it would appear that the enhanced award&para;<br>is wholly consistent with the purpose of §1988, which was&para;<br>enacted to ensure that “counsel for prevailing parties [are]&para;<br>paid as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee&para;<br>paying client.” S.

As I stated&para;<br>at the outset, we are in complete agreement with respect&para;<br>to the answer to the question presented: “[A]n increase” to&para;<br>the lodestar “due to superior performance and results” “is&para;<br>permitted in extraordinary circumstances.” Ante, at 1.&para;<br>Unlike JUSTICE THOMAS, I do not read the Court’s opinion&para;<br>to “advance our attorney’s fees jurisprudence further along&para;<br>the decisional arc” toward a point where enhancements&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PERDUE v. KENNY A.&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>are “virtually” barred in all cases. Ante, at 2 (concurring&para;<br>opinion). Our prior cases make clear that enhancements&para;<br>are permitted in “ ‘exceptional’ cases,” Delaware Valley,&para;<br>478 U. S., at 565, where the attorney achieves “exceptional&para;<br>success,” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435; see also Blum, 465&para;<br>U. S., at 896–901. By definition, such exceptional circum&para;<br>stances occur only rarely. See ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring). I do not see how the Court could “advance”&para;<br>our fee enhancement jurisprudence so as to further dis&para;<br>courage lodestar enhancements without overruling the&para;<br>precedents I have just cited, which the Court has not done.&para;<br>To the contrary, today the Court “reaffirm[s]” those prece&para;<br>dents, which allow enhancements for exceptional perform&para;<br>ance. Ante, at 1. And with respect to that central holding&para;<br>we are unanimous.&para;<br>Nor is my disagreement with the Court absolute with&para;<br>respect to the proper resolution of the case before us, for&para;<br>the Court does not purport to prohibit the District Court&para;<br>from awarding an enhanced fee on remand if that court&para;<br>provides more detailed reasoning supporting its decision.&para;<br>Ante, at 12; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. But the majority and I&para;<br>do disagree in this respect: I would not disturb the judg&para;<br>ment below. “A request for attorney’s fees should not&para;<br>result in a second major litigation.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at&para;<br>437. Nor should it lead to years of protracted appellate&para;<br>review. See id., at 455–456 (Brennan, J., concurring in&para;<br>part and dissenting in part).
