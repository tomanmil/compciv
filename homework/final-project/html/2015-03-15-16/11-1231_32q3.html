Argued December 4, 2012—Decided January 22, 2013&para;<br>The reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient&para;<br>services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for&para;<br>hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.&para;<br>The adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a&para;<br>hospital’s patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income&para;<br>(SSI), called the SSI fraction. Each year, the Centers for Medicare &amp;&para;<br>Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for an eligible&para;<br>hospital and submits that number to the hospital’s “fiscal intermediary,” a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contractor.&para;<br>The intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then&para;<br>sends the hospital a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR). A&para;<br>provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to&para;<br>the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board) within&para;<br>180 days of receiving the NPR. 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3). By regulation, the Secretary of HHS authorized the PRRB to extend the 180day limit, for good cause, up to three years. See 42 CFR 405.1841(b)&para;<br>(2007).&para;<br>The Baystate Medical Center—not a party here—timely appealed&para;<br>its SSI fraction calculation for each year from 1993 through 1996.&para;<br>The PRRB found that errors in CMS’s methodology resulted in a systematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment&para;<br>and corresponding underpayments to providers. In March 2006, the&para;<br>Board’s Baystate decision was made public. Within 180 days, respondent hospitals filed a complaint with the Board, challenging&para;<br>their adjustments for 1987 through 1994. Acknowledging that their&para;<br>challenges were more than a decade out of time, they urged that eq-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>uitable tolling of the limitations period was in order due to CMS’s&para;<br>failure to tell them about the computation error. The PRRB held that&para;<br>it lacked jurisdiction, reasoning that it had no equitable powers save&para;<br>those legislation or regulation might confer. On judicial review, the&para;<br>District Court dismissed the hospitals’ claims. The D. C. Circuit reversed. The presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling, the court concluded, applied to the&para;<br>180-day time limit because nothing in §1395oo(a)(3) indicated that&para;<br>Congress intended to disallow such tolling.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The 180-day limitation in §1395oo(a)(3) is not “jurisdictional.”&para;<br>Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(a) Unless Congress has “clearly state[d]” that a statutory limitation is jurisdictional, the restriction should be treated “as nonjurisdictional.” Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515–516.&para;<br>“[C]ontext, including this Court’s interpretations of similar provisions&para;<br>in many years past,” is probative of whether Congress intended a&para;<br>particular provision to rank as jurisdictional. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.&para;<br>Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___. If §1395oo(a)(3) were jurisdictional, the&para;<br>180-day time limit could not be enlarged by agency or court.&para;<br>Section 1395oo(a)(3) hardly reveals a design to preclude any regulatory extension. The provision instructs that a provider “may obtain&para;<br>a hearing” by filing “a request . . . within 180 days after notice of the&para;<br>intermediary’s final determination.” It “does not speak in jurisdictional terms.” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394.&para;<br>This Court has repeatedly held that filing deadlines ordinarily are&para;<br>not jurisdictional; indeed, they have been described as “quintessential claim-processing rules.” Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(b) Court-appointed amicus urges that §1395oo(a)(3) should be&para;<br>classified as a jurisdictional requirement based on its proximity to&para;<br>§§1395oo(a)(1) and (a)(2), both jurisdictional requirements, amicus&para;<br>asserts. But a requirement that would otherwise be nonjurisdictional&para;<br>does not become jurisdictional simply because it is in a section of a&para;<br>statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions. Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___. Amicus also urges that the Medicare Act’s express grant of authority for the Secretary to extend the time for beneficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for §1395oo(a)(3)’s&para;<br>provider appeals. In support, amicus relies on the general rule that&para;<br>Congress’s use of “certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another” can indicate that “different meanings&para;<br>were intended,” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9.&para;<br>But that interpretive guide, like other canons of construction, is “no&para;<br>more than [a] rul[e] of thumb” that can tip the scales when a statute&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>could be read in multiple ways. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,&para;<br>503 U. S. 249, 253. Here, §1395oo(a)’s limitation is most sensibly&para;<br>characterized as nonjurisdictional. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>2. The Secretary’s regulation is a permissible interpretation of&para;<br>§1395oo(a)(3). Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(a) Congress vested in the Secretary large rulemaking authority&para;<br>to administer Medicare. A court lacks authority to undermine the&para;<br>Secretary’s regime unless her regulation is “arbitrary, capricious, or&para;<br>manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural&para;<br>Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844. Here, the regulation survives inspection under that deferential standard. The Secretary brought to bear practical experience in superintending the huge&para;<br>program generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining a&para;<br>three-year outer limit for intermediary determination challenges. A&para;<br>court must uphold her judgment as long as it is a permissible construction of the statute, even if the court would have interpreted the&para;<br>statute differently absent agency regulation. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(b) A presumption of equitable tolling generally applies to suits&para;<br>against the United States, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,&para;<br>498 U.S. 89, 95–96, but application of this presumption is not in order for §1395oo(a)(3). This Court has never applied Irwin’s presumption to an agency’s internal appeal deadline. The presumption was&para;<br>adopted in part on the premise that “[s]uch a principle is likely to be&para;<br>a realistic assessment of legislative intent.” Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95.&para;<br>That premise is inapt in the context of providers’ administrative appeals under the Medicare Act. For nearly 40 years the Secretary has&para;<br>prohibited the Board from extending the 180-day deadline, except as&para;<br>provided by regulation. In the six times §1395oo has been amended&para;<br>since 1974, Congress has left untouched the 180-day provision and&para;<br>the Secretary’s rulemaking authority. Furthermore, the statutory&para;<br>scheme, which applies to sophisticated institutional providers, is not&para;<br>designed to be “ ‘unusually protective’ of claimants.” Bowen v. City of&para;<br>New York, 476 U. S. 467, 480. Nor is the scheme one “in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers, initiate the process.” Zipes, 455&para;<br>U. S., at 397.&para;<br>The hospitals ultimately argue that the Secretary’s regulations fail&para;<br>to adhere to “fundamentals of fair play.” FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 143. They point to 42 CFR §405.1885(b)(3),&para;<br>which permits reopening of an intermediary’s reimbursement determination “at any time” if the determination was procured by fraud or&para;<br>fault of the provider. But this Court has explained that giving intermediaries more time to discover overpayments than providers have to&para;<br>discover underpayments may be justified by the “administrative realities” of the system: a few dozen fiscal intermediaries are charged&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SEBELIUS v.

A provider dissatisfied with the fiscal intermediary’s determination may appeal to an administrative body&para;<br>named the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB&para;<br>or Board). The governing statute, §602(h)(l)(D), 97 Stat.&para;<br>165, 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), sets a 180-day limit for&para;<br>filing appeals from the fiscal intermediary to the PRRB.&para;<br>By a regulation promulgated in 1974, the Secretary of the&para;<br>Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorized the Board to extend the 180-day limitation, for good&para;<br>cause, up to three years.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The agency was called the Department of Health, Education, and&para;<br>Welfare until 1979, but for simplicity’s sake we refer to it as HHS&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The providers in this case are hospitals who appealed to&para;<br>the PRRB more than ten years after expiration of the 180day statutory deadline. They assert that the Secretary’s&para;<br>failure to disclose information that made the fiscal intermediary’s reimbursement calculation incorrect prevented&para;<br>them from earlier appealing to the Board. Three positions&para;<br>have been briefed and argued regarding the time for providers’ appeals to the PRRB. First, a Court-appointed&para;<br>amicus curiae has urged that the 180-day limitation is&para;<br>“jurisdictional,” and therefore cannot be enlarged at all by&para;<br>agency or court. Second, the Government maintains that&para;<br>the Secretary has the prerogative to set an outer limit of&para;<br>three years for appeals to the Board. And third, the hospitals argue that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies,&para;<br>stopping the 180-day clock during the time the Secretary&para;<br>concealed the information that made the fiscal intermediary’s reimbursement determinations incorrect.&para;<br>We hold that the statutory 180-day limitation is not&para;<br>“jurisdictional,” and that the Secretary reasonably construed the statute to permit a regulation extending the&para;<br>time for a provider’s appeal to the PRRB to three years.&para;<br>We further hold that the presumption in favor of equitable&para;<br>tolling does not apply to administrative appeals of the&para;<br>kind here at issue.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Medicare program covers certain inpatient services&para;<br>that hospitals provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Providers are reimbursed at a fixed amount per patient, regardless of the actual operating costs they incur in rendering&para;<br>these services. But the total reimbursement amount is&para;<br>adjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. This adjustment is&para;<br>made because hospitals with an unusually high percent——————&para;<br>throughout this opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

See H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 99–241, pt. 1, p. 16 (1985). The amount of the&para;<br>disproportionate share adjustment is determined in part&para;<br>by the percentage of the patients served by the hospital&para;<br>who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)&para;<br>payments, a percentage commonly called the SSI fraction.&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).&para;<br>At the end of each year, providers participating in Medicare submit cost reports to contractors acting on behalf of&para;<br>HHS known as fiscal intermediaries. Also at year end,&para;<br>the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for each eligible hospital and&para;<br>submits that number to the intermediary for that hospital.&para;<br>Using these numbers to determine the total payment due,&para;<br>the intermediary issues a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR) informing the provider how much it will be&para;<br>paid for the year.&para;<br>If a provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary’s reimbursement determination, the statute gives it the right&para;<br>to file a request for a hearing before the PRRB within&para;<br>180 days of receiving the NPR. §1395oo(a)(3) (2006 ed.)&para;<br>In 1974, the Secretary promulgated a regulation, after&para;<br>notice and comment rulemaking, permitting the Board to&para;<br>extend the 180-day time limit upon a showing of good&para;<br>cause; the regulation further provides that “no such extension shall be granted by the Board if such request is filed&para;<br>more than 3 years after the date the notice of the intermediary’s determination is mailed to the provider.” 39 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 34517 (1974) (codified in 42 CFR §405.1841(b)&para;<br>(2007)).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In 2008, after this case commenced, the Secretary replaced the 1974&para;<br>regulation with a new prescription limiting “good cause” to “extraordinary circumstances beyond [the provider’s] control (such as a natural or&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SEBELIUS v.

Eventually, the&para;<br>PRRB determined that CMS had omitted several categories of SSI data from its calculations and was using a&para;<br>flawed process to determine the number of low-income&para;<br>beneficiaries treated by hospitals.

In March 2006, the Board’s decision in&para;<br>the Baystate case was made public. Within 180 days, the&para;<br>hospitals in this case filed a complaint with the Board&para;<br>seeking to challenge their disproportionate share adjustments for the years 1987 through 1994. The hospitals&para;<br>acknowledged that their challenges, unlike Baystate’s&para;<br>timely contest, were more than a decade out of time. But&para;<br>equitable tolling of the limitations period was in order,&para;<br>they urged, due to CMS’s failure to inform the hospitals&para;<br>——————&para;<br>other catastrophe, fire, or strike).” 73 Fed. Reg. 30250 (2008) (codified&para;<br>in 42 CFR §405.1836(b) (2012)). The new regulation retains the strict&para;<br>three-year cutoff for all claims. §405.1836(c)(2). The parties agree that&para;<br>this case is governed by the 1974 regulation, and our opinion today&para;<br>addresses only that regulation.&para;<br>3 In §951 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 117 Stat. 2427, Congress required the Secretary&para;<br>to furnish hospitals with the data necessary to compute their own&para;<br>disproportionate share adjustment. Pursuant to this congressional&para;<br>mandate, the Secretary has adopted procedures for turning over the&para;<br>SSI data to hospitals upon request. 70 Fed.

On judicial review, the District Court dismissed the hospitals’ claims for relief, holding that nothing in the statute suggests that “Congress intended to&para;<br>authorize equitable tolling.” 686 F. Supp. 2d 55, 70 (DC&para;<br>2010).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed. 642 F. 3d 1145 (CADC&para;<br>2011). It relied on the presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling and&para;<br>reasoned that “ ‘the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants&para;<br>should also apply to suits against the United States.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 1148 (quoting Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,&para;<br>498 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1990)). The presumption applies&para;<br>to the 180-day time limit for provider appeals from reimbursement determinations, the Court of Appeals held,&para;<br>finding nothing in the statutory provision for PRRB review indicating that Congress intended to disallow equitable tolling. 642 F. 3d, at 1149–1151.&para;<br>We granted the Secretary’s petition for certiorari, 567&para;<br>U.

Beyond the jurisdictional inquiry,4 the Secretary asked us to determine&para;<br>whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that&para;<br>equitable tolling applies to providers’ Medicare reimbursement appeals to the PRRB, notwithstanding the&para;<br>Secretary’s regulation barring such appeals after three&para;<br>years.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Characterizing a rule as jurisdictional renders it unique&para;<br>in our adversarial system.

Tardy jurisdictional objections can&para;<br>therefore result in a waste of adjudicatory resources and&para;<br>can disturbingly disarm litigants. See Henderson v.&para;<br>Shinseki, 562 U.

S., at&para;<br>209, n. 2; cf. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 454 (a time limitation&para;<br>may be emphatic, yet not jurisdictional).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Amicus urges that the three requirements in §1395oo(a)&para;<br>are specifications that together define the limits of the&para;<br>PRRB’s jurisdiction. Subsection (a)(1) specifies the claims&para;<br>providers may bring to the Board, and subsection (a)(2)&para;<br>sets forth an amount-in-controversy requirement. These&para;<br>are jurisdictional requirements, amicus asserts, so we&para;<br>should read the third specification, subsection (a)(3)’s&para;<br>180-day limitation, as also setting a jurisdictional&para;<br>requirement.&para;<br>Last Term, we rejected a similar proximity-based argument. A requirement we would otherwise classify as&para;<br>nonjurisdictional, we held, does not become jurisdictional&para;<br>simply because it is placed in a section of a statute that&para;<br>also contains jurisdictional provisions. Gonzalez, 565&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

S. 749, 763–764 (1975) (statutory provision at issue&para;<br>contained three requirements for judicial review, only one&para;<br>of which was jurisdictional).&para;<br>Amicus also argues that the 180-day time limit for provider appeals to the PRRB should be viewed as jurisdictional because Congress could have expressly made the&para;<br>provision nonjurisdictional, and indeed did so for other&para;<br>time limits in the Medicare Act. Amicus notes particularly&para;<br>that when Medicare beneficiaries request the Secretary&para;<br>to reconsider a benefits determination, the statute gives&para;<br>them a time limit of 180 days or “such additional time as&para;<br>the Secretary may allow.” 42 U. S. C. §1395ff(b)(1)(D)(i);&para;<br>see also §1395ff(b)(1)(D)(ii) (permitting Medicare beneficiary to request a hearing by the Secretary within “time&para;<br>limits” the Secretary “shall establish in regulations”). We&para;<br>have recognized, as a general rule, that Congress’s use of&para;<br>“certain language in one part of the statute and different&para;<br>language in another” can indicate that “different meanings&para;<br>were intended.” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692,&para;<br>711, n. 9 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Amicus notes this general rule in urging that an express grant&para;<br>of authority for the Secretary to extend the time for beneficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for&para;<br>provider appeals.&para;<br>But the interpretive guide just identified, like other&para;<br>canons of construction, is “no more than [a] rul[e] of&para;<br>thumb” that can tip the scales when a statute could be&para;<br>read in multiple ways. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,&para;<br>503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992). For the reasons earlier stated,&para;<br>see supra, at 6–8, we are persuaded that the time limitation in §1395oo(a) is most sensibly characterized as a&para;<br>nonjurisdictional prescription. The limitation therefore&para;<br>does not bar the modest extension contained in the Secretary’s regulation.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>We turn now to the question whether §1395oo(a)(3)’s&para;<br>180-day time limit for a provider to appeal to the PRRB is&para;<br>subject to equitable tolling.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Congress vested in the Secretary large rulemaking&para;<br>authority to administer the Medicare program. The PRRB&para;<br>may adopt rules and procedures only if “not inconsistent”&para;<br>with the Medicare Act or “regulations of the Secretary.”&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1395oo(e). Concerning the 180-day period&para;<br>for an appeal to the Board from an intermediary’s reimbursement determination, the Secretary’s regulation implementing §1395oo, adopted after notice and comment,&para;<br>speaks in no uncertain terms:&para;<br>“A request for a Board hearing filed after [the 180-day&para;<br>time limit] shall be dismissed by the Board, except&para;<br>that for good cause shown, the time limit may be extended. However, no such extension shall be granted&para;<br>by the Board if such request is filed more than 3 years&para;<br>after the date the notice of the intermediary’s determination is mailed to the provider.” 42 CFR&para;<br>§405.1841(b) (2007).&para;<br>The Secretary allowed only a distinctly limited extension of time to appeal to the PRRB, cognizant that “the&para;<br>Board is burdened by an immense caseload,” and that&para;<br>“procedural rules requiring timely filings are indispensable devices for keeping the machinery of the reimbursement appeals process running smoothly.” High Country&para;<br>Home Health, Inc. v. Thompson, 359 F. 3d 1307, 1310&para;<br>(CA10 2004). Imposing equitable tolling to permit appeals&para;<br>barred by the Secretary’s regulation would essentially gut&para;<br>the Secretary’s requirement that an appeal to the Board&para;<br>“shall be dismissed” if filed more than 180 days after the&para;<br>NPR, unless the provider shows “good cause” and requests&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&para;<br>467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984).&para;<br>The Secretary’s regulation, we are satisfied, survives&para;<br>inspection under that deferential standard. As HHS has&para;<br>explained, “[i]t is in the interest of providers and the program that, at some point, intermediary determinations&para;<br>and the resulting amount of program payment due the&para;<br>provider or the program become no longer open to correction.” CMS, Medicare: Provider Reimbursement Manual,&para;<br>pt. 1, ch. 29, §2930, p. 29–73 (rev. no. 372, 2011); cf. Taylor&para;<br>v. Freeland &amp; Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644 (1992) (“Deadlines&para;<br>may lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt parties&para;<br>to act and produce finality.”). The Secretary brought to&para;<br>bear practical experience in superintending the huge program generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining&para;<br>three years as the outer limit. A court must uphold the&para;<br>Secretary’s judgment as long as it is a permissible construction of the statute, even if it differs from how the&para;<br>court would have interpreted the statute in the absence of&para;<br>an agency regulation. National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980&para;<br>(2005); see also Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 11.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Rejecting the Secretary’s position, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>relied principally on this Court’s decision in Irwin, 498&para;<br>U. S., at 95–96. Irwin concerned the then 30-day time&para;<br>period for filing suit against a federal agency under Title&para;<br>VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–&para;<br>16(c) (1988 ed.). We held in Irwin that “the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits&para;<br>against private defendants should also apply to suits&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>against the United States.” 498 U. S., at 95–96. Irwin&para;<br>itself, and equitable-tolling cases we have considered both&para;<br>pre- and post-Irwin, have generally involved time limits&para;<br>for filing suit in federal court. See, e.g., Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010) (one-year limitation for filing&para;<br>application for writ of habeas corpus); Rotella v. Wood, 528&para;<br>U. S. 549 (2000) (four-year period for filing civil RICO&para;<br>suit); United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38 (1998) (12year period to bring suit under Quiet Title Act); Lampf,&para;<br>Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.&para;<br>350 (1991) (one- and three-year periods for commencing&para;<br>civil action under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of&para;<br>1934); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484 (1967) (60-day period&para;<br>for filing suit under Trading with the Enemy Act); Kendall&para;<br>v. United States, 107 U. S. 123 (1883) (six-year period for&para;<br>filing suit in Court of Claims). Courts in those cases rendered in the first instance the decision whether equity&para;<br>required tolling.&para;<br>This case is of a different order. We have never applied&para;<br>the Irwin presumption to an agency’s internal appeal deadline, here the time a provider has to appeal an intermediary’s reimbursement determination to the PRRB. Cf.&para;<br>United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350 (1997)&para;<br>(assuming, arguendo, that Irwin presumption applied to&para;<br>time limit for filing an administrative claim for a tax refund, but concluding based on statutory text, structure,&para;<br>and purpose that there was “good reason to believe that&para;<br>Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to&para;<br>apply”).&para;<br>The presumption of equitable tolling was adopted in&para;<br>part on the premise that “[s]uch a principle is likely to be&para;<br>a realistic assessment of legislative intent.” Irwin, 498&para;<br>U. S., at 95. But that premise is inapt in the context of&para;<br>providers’ administrative appeals under the Medicare Act.&para;<br>The Act, until 1972, provided no avenue for providers to&para;<br>obtain administrative or judicial review. When Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>first directed the Secretary to establish the PRRB, Congress simultaneously imposed the 180-day deadline, with&para;<br>no statutory exceptions. For nearly 40 years the Secretary has prohibited the Board from extending that deadline, except as provided by regulation. And until the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit’s decision in this case, no court had ever read&para;<br>equitable tolling into §1395oo(a)(3) or the Secretary’s&para;<br>implementation of that provision. Congress amended&para;<br>§1395oo six times since 1974, each time leaving untouched&para;<br>the 180-day administrative appeal provision and the&para;<br>Secretary’s rulemaking authority. At no time did Congress express disapproval of the three-year outer time&para;<br>limit set by the Secretary for an extension upon a showing&para;<br>of good cause. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.&para;<br>Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 846 (1986) (“[W]hen Congress revisits&para;<br>a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative&para;<br>interpretation without pertinent change, the congressional&para;<br>failure to revise or repeal the agency’s interpretation is&para;<br>persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>We note, furthermore, that unlike the remedial statutes&para;<br>at issue in many of this Court’s equitable-tolling decisions,&para;<br>see Irwin, 498 U. S., at 91; Bowen v. City of New York, 476&para;<br>U. S. 467, 480 (1986); Zipes, 455 U. S., at 398, the statutory scheme before us is not designed to be “ ‘unusually&para;<br>protective’ of claimants.” Bowen, 476 U. S., at 480. Nor is&para;<br>it one “in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers,&para;<br>initiate the process.” Zipes, 455 U. S., at 397 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). The Medicare payment system&para;<br>in question applies to “sophisticated” institutional providers assisted by legal counsel, and “generally capable&para;<br>of identifying an underpayment in [their] own NPR&para;<br>within the 180-day time period specified in 42 U.

Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S.&para;<br>134, 143 (1940). They point, particularly, to 42 CFR&para;<br>§405.1885(b)(3) (2012), which permits reopening of an&para;<br>intermediary’s reimbursement determination “at any time&para;<br>if it is established that such determination . . . was&para;<br>procured by fraud or similar fault of any party to the&para;<br>determination.”5&para;<br>We considered a similar alleged inequity in Your Home&para;<br>and explained that it was justified by the “administrative&para;<br>realities” of the provider reimbursement appeal system.&para;<br>525 U. S., at 455. There are only a few dozen fiscal intermediaries and they are charged with issuing tens of thousands of NPRs, while each provider can concentrate on&para;<br>a single NPR, its own. Id., at 456. The Secretary, Your&para;<br>Home concluded, could reasonably believe that this asymmetry justifies giving the intermediaries more time to&para;<br>discover overpayments than the providers have to discover&para;<br>underpayments. Moreover, the fraud exception allowing&para;<br>indefinite reopening does apply to an intermediary if it&para;<br>“procured” a Board decision by “fraud or similar fault.”&para;<br>Although an intermediary is not a party to its own determination, it does rank as a party in proceedings before the&para;<br>Board. 42 CFR §405.1843(a).6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Because neither the Secretary nor the intermediary counts as a&para;<br>party to the intermediary’s determination, 42 CFR §405.1805, providers&para;<br>alone are subject to this exception to the time limitation.&para;<br>6 The fraud exception apart, reopening time is limited to three years.&para;<br>§405.1885(a). Within that time, reopening may be sought by the&para;<br>intermediary, the Board, the Secretary, or the provider. Thus an&para;<br>intermediary determination or Board decision could not be reopened if,&para;<br>outside the three-year window, the Secretary discovered errors in&para;<br>calculating the SSI fraction that resulted in overpayments to providers.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

And we&para;<br>have previously applied the Irwin presumption outside the&para;<br>context of filing deadlines in Article III courts. See Young&para;<br>v. United States, 535 U.

Ante, at&para;<br>12–14 (quoting Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v.&para;<br>Shalala, 525 U. S. 449, 456 (1999)).

Because claimants must generally&para;<br>pursue administrative relief before seeking judicial review, see Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 88–91 (2006), a&para;<br>contrary approach could have odd practical consequences&para;<br>and would attribute a strange intent to Congress: to protect a claimant’s ability to seek judicial review of an agency’s decision by making equitable tolling available, while&para;<br>leaving to the agency’s discretion whether the same claimant may invoke equitable tolling in order to seek an administrative remedy in the first place.&para;<br>Even in cases where the governing statute clearly delegates to an agency the discretion to adopt rules that limit&para;<br>the scope of equitable exceptions to administrative deadlines, I believe “cases may arise where the equities in&para;<br>favor of tolling the limitations period are ‘so great that&para;<br>deference to the agency’s judgment is inappropriate.’ ”&para;<br>Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467, 480 (1986)&para;<br>(quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.

While equitable&para;<br>tolling extends to circumstances outside both parties’&para;<br>control, the related doctrines of equitable estoppel and&para;<br>fraudulent concealment may bar a defendant from enforcing a statute of limitation when its own deception prevented a reasonably diligent plaintiff from bringing a&para;<br>timely claim.
