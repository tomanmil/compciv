Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different&para;<br>procedural settings; since then, the Government has employed a unified “removal proceeding” for exclusions and deportations alike. But&para;<br>the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substantive grounds for the two actions. One list specifies what crimes render an alien excludable, see 8 U. S. C. §1182(a), while another—&para;<br>sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list specifies what&para;<br>crimes render an alien deportable, see §1227(a).&para;<br>Until repealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality&para;<br>Act permitted the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief to an&para;<br>excludable alien, if the alien had lawfully resided in the United&para;<br>States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country&para;<br>and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds.&para;<br>By its terms, §212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the&para;<br>Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to deportation proceedings as well. Although Congress substituted a narrower discretionary remedy for §212(c) in 1996, see §1229b, §212(c)’s&para;<br>broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based&para;<br>on a guilty plea entered before §212(c)’s repeal, INS v. St. Cyr, 533&para;<br>U. S. 289, 326.&para;<br>In deciding whether to exclude such an alien, the BIA first checks&para;<br>the statutory ground identified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the basis for exclusion. Unless that ground is one of&para;<br>the two falling outside §212(c)’s scope, the alien is eligible for discretionary relief. The BIA then determines whether to grant relief&para;<br>based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>This case concerns the BIA’s method for applying §212(c) in the&para;<br>deportation context. The BIA’s approach, known as the “comparablegrounds” rule, evaluates whether the charged deportation ground has&para;<br>a close analogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. If the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equivalent”&para;<br>to the set making up an exclusion ground, the alien can seek §212(c)&para;<br>relief. But if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer&para;<br>offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is ineligible for relief,&para;<br>even if the alien’s particular offense falls within an exclusion ground.&para;<br>Petitioner Judulang, who has lived continuously in the United&para;<br>States as a lawful permanent resident since 1974, pleaded guilty to&para;<br>voluntary manslaughter in 1988. After he pleaded guilty to another&para;<br>crime in 2005, DHS commenced a deportation action, charging him&para;<br>with having committed an “aggravated felony” involving “a crime of&para;<br>violence” based on his manslaughter conviction. The Immigration&para;<br>Judge ordered Judulang’s deportation, and the BIA affirmed, finding&para;<br>Judulang ineligible for §212(c) relief because the “crime of violence”&para;<br>deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit, having previously upheld the BIA’s comparablegrounds rule, denied Judulang’s petition for review.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The BIA’s policy for applying §212(c) in deportation cases is “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §706(2)(A). Pp. 9–21.&para;<br>(a) While agencies have expertise and experience in administering&para;<br>their statutes that no court may properly ignore, courts retain a narrow but important role in ensuring that agencies have engaged in&para;<br>reasoned decisionmaking. Thus, in reviewing the BIA’s action, this&para;<br>Court must assess, among other matters, “whether the decision was&para;<br>based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there&para;<br>has been a clear error of judgment.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of&para;<br>United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.&para;<br>29, 43. That task involves examining the reasons for agency decisions, or the absence of such reasons.&para;<br>The comparable-grounds approach cannot survive scrutiny under&para;<br>this standard. By hinging a deportable alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories—a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this&para;<br>country—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned&para;<br>manner. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(b) Even if the BIA has legitimate reasons for limiting §212(c)’s&para;<br>scope in deportation cases, it must do so in some rational way. In&para;<br>other words, the BIA must use an approach that is tied to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the&para;<br>immigration system. The comparable-grounds rule has no connection&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to these factors. Instead, it makes §212(c) eligibility turn on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions. Whether the set of&para;<br>offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an&para;<br>exclusion ground has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien&para;<br>whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to&para;<br>stay in this country. Here, Judulang was found ineligible for §212(c)&para;<br>relief because the “crime of violence” deportation ground includes a&para;<br>few offenses—simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use&para;<br>of a vehicle—not found in the similar moral turpitude exclusion&para;<br>ground. But the inclusion of simple assaults and minor burglaries in&para;<br>the deportation ground is irrelevant to the merits of Judulang’s case.&para;<br>The BIA’s approach has other odd features. In applying the comparable-grounds rule, the BIA has denied relief to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely within a much broader exclusion&para;<br>ground. Yet providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of&para;<br>that group. In addition, the outcome of the comparable-grounds&para;<br>analysis may itself rest on an arbitrary decision. An alien’s prior&para;<br>conviction could fall within a number of deportation grounds, only&para;<br>one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground. In such cases, an&para;<br>alien’s eligibility for relief would hinge on an individual official’s decision as to which deportation ground to charge. An alien appearing&para;<br>before one official may suffer deportation, while an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this&para;<br>country.&para;<br>In short, the comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any&para;<br>factors relevant to whether an alien should be deported. Instead, it&para;<br>turns deportation decisions into a “sport of chance.” Rosenberg v.&para;<br>Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 455. That is what the APA’s “arbitrary and capricious” standard is designed to prevent. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>(c) The Government’s arguments in defense of the comparablegrounds rule are not persuasive. First, §212(c)’s text does not support the rule. That section cannot provide a textual anchor for any&para;<br>method of providing discretionary relief in deportation cases because&para;<br>it addresses only exclusion. Second, the history of the comparablegrounds rule does not work in the Government’s favor. The BIA repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to deportable&para;<br>aliens, settling on the current rule only in 2005. Third, the Government’s claim that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money&para;<br>falls short. Cost may be an important factor for agencies to consider&para;<br>in many contexts, but cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary&para;<br>agency policy. In any event, it is unclear that the comparablegrounds rule saves money when compared with alternative approaches. Pp. 16–21.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v.

We hold that the BIA’s approach is arbitrary and&para;<br>capricious.&para;<br>The legal background of this case is complex, but the&para;<br>principle guiding our decision is anything but. When an&para;<br>administrative agency sets policy, it must provide a reasoned explanation for its action. That is not a high bar,&para;<br>but it is an unwavering one. Here, the BIA has failed to&para;<br>meet it.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of&para;<br>aliens from admission to this country and the deportation&para;<br>of aliens previously admitted. Before 1996, these two&para;<br>kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings,&para;<br>with an alien seeking entry (whether for the first time or&para;<br>upon return from a trip abroad) placed in an “exclusion&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>proceeding” and an alien already here channeled to a&para;<br>“deportation proceeding.” See Landon v. Plasencia, 459&para;<br>U. S. 21, 25–26 (1982) (comparing the two). Since that&para;<br>time, the Government has used a unified procedure,&para;<br>known as a “removal proceeding,” for exclusions and deportations alike. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. But the&para;<br>statutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have&para;<br>always varied. Now, as before, the immigration laws&para;<br>provide two separate lists of substantive grounds, principally involving criminal offenses, for these two actions.&para;<br>One list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien&para;<br>excludable (or in the term the statute now uses, “inadmissible”), see §1182(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), while another—&para;<br>sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list&para;<br>specifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable&para;<br>from the country, see §1227(a).&para;<br>An additional, historic difference between exclusion&para;<br>and deportation cases involved the ability of the Attorney&para;<br>General to grant an alien discretionary relief. Until repealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality&para;<br>Act, 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), authorized&para;<br>the Attorney General to admit certain excludable aliens.&para;<br>See also §136(p) (1926 ed.) (predecessor provision to&para;<br>§212(c)). The Attorney General could order this relief&para;<br>when the alien had lawfully resided in the United States&para;<br>for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the&para;<br>country, unless the alien was excludable on one of two&para;<br>specified grounds. See §1182(c) (1994 ed.).1 But by its&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant part of §212(c), in the version of the exclusion statute&para;<br>all parties use, read as follows:&para;<br>“Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily&para;<br>proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,&para;<br>and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven&para;<br>consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney&para;<br>General without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section&para;<br>(other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>terms, §212(c) did not apply when an alien was being&para;<br>deported.&para;<br>This discrepancy threatened to produce an odd result in&para;<br>a case called Matter of L-, 1 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1 (1940), leading&para;<br>to the first-ever grant of discretionary relief in a deportation case. L- was a permanent resident of the United&para;<br>States who had been convicted of larceny. Although L-’s&para;<br>crime made him inadmissible, he traveled abroad and&para;<br>then returned to the United States without any immigration official’s preventing his entry. A few months later,&para;<br>the Government caught up with L- and initiated a deportation action based on his larceny conviction. Had the&para;<br>Government apprehended L- at the border a short while&para;<br>earlier, he would have been placed in an exclusion proceeding where he could have applied for discretionary&para;<br>relief. But because L- was instead in a deportation proceeding, no such relief was available. Responding to this&para;<br>apparent anomaly, Attorney General Robert Jackson (on&para;<br>referral of the case from the BIA) determined that L- could&para;<br>receive a waiver: L-, Jackson said, “should be permitted to&para;<br>make the same appeal to discretion that he could have&para;<br>made if denied admission” when returning from his recent&para;<br>trip. Id., at 6. In accord with this decision, the BIA&para;<br>adopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceedings to apply for discretionary relief under §212(c) whenever they had left and reentered the country after becoming deportable. See Matter of S-, 6 I. &amp; N. Dec. 392,&para;<br>394–396 (1954).&para;<br>But this approach created another peculiar asymmetry:&para;<br>Deportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned&para;<br>could receive §212(c) relief, while those who had never left&para;<br>——————&para;<br>The parenthetical clause of this section prevented the Attorney General from waiving exclusion for aliens who posed a threat to national&para;<br>security, §1182(a)(3), and aliens who engaged in international child&para;<br>abduction, §1182(a)(9)(C).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>could not. In Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d 268 (1976), the&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that&para;<br>this disparity violated equal protection. Id., at 273 (“[A]n&para;<br>alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he&para;<br>has never departed after his initial entry should receive at&para;<br>least as much consideration as an individual who may&para;<br>leave and return from time to time”). The BIA acquiesced&para;<br>in the Second Circuit’s decision, see Matter of Silva, 16&para;<br>I. &amp; N. Dec. 26 (1976), thus applying §212(c) in deportation proceedings regardless of an alien’s travel history.&para;<br>All this might have become academic when Congress&para;<br>repealed §212(c) in 1996 and substituted a new discretionary remedy, known as “cancellation of removal,” which is&para;<br>available in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable&para;<br>and deportable aliens alike. See 8 U. S. C. §1229b. But in&para;<br>INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 326 (2001), this Court concluded that the broader relief afforded by §212(c) must&para;<br>remain available, on the same terms as before, to an alien&para;<br>whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before&para;<br>§212(c)’s repeal. We reasoned that aliens had agreed to&para;<br>those pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in&para;<br>mind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport&para;<br>with “ ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable&para;<br>reliance, and settled expectations.’ ” Id., at 323 (quoting&para;<br>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994)).&para;<br>Accordingly, §212(c) has had an afterlife for resident&para;<br>aliens with old criminal convictions.&para;<br>When the BIA is deciding whether to exclude such an&para;<br>alien, applying §212(c) is an easy matter. The Board&para;<br>first checks the statutory ground that the Department&para;<br>of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as the basis&para;<br>for exclusion; the Board may note, for example, that&para;<br>DHS has charged the alien with previously committing&para;<br>a “crime involving moral turpitude,” see 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Unless the charged ground is one of&para;<br>the pair falling outside §212(c)’s scope, see n. 1, supra, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>alien is eligible for discretionary relief. The Board then&para;<br>determines whether to grant that relief based on such&para;<br>factors as “the seriousness of the offense, evidence of&para;<br>either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the&para;<br>alien’s residence, the impact of deportation on the family,&para;<br>the number of citizens in the family, and the character of&para;<br>any service in the Armed Forces.” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at&para;<br>296, n. 5.&para;<br>By contrast, when the BIA is deciding whether to deport&para;<br>an alien, applying §212(c) becomes a tricky business.&para;<br>Recall that §212(c) applies on its face only to exclusion&para;<br>decisions. So the question arises: How is the BIA to determine when an alien should receive §212(c) relief in the&para;<br>deportation context?&para;<br>One approach that the BIA formerly used considered&para;<br>how the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding. To&para;<br>perform this analysis, the Board would first determine&para;<br>whether the criminal conviction making the alien deportable fell within a statutory ground for exclusion. Almost all&para;<br>convictions did so, largely because the “crime involving&para;<br>moral turpitude” ground encompasses so many offenses.2&para;<br>Assuming that threshold inquiry were met, the Board&para;<br>would mimic its approach in exclusion cases—first making&para;<br>sure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from&para;<br>§212(c) and then conducting the multi-factor analysis. See&para;<br>Matter of Tanori, 15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 566, 567–568 (1976);&para;<br>In re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892&para;<br>(BIA, Dec. 1, 2003).&para;<br>A second approach is the one challenged here; definitively adopted in 2005 (after decades of occasional use), it&para;<br>often is called the “comparable-grounds” rule. See, e.g., De&para;<br>la Rosa v. U. S. Attorney General, 579 F. 3d 1327, 1332&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Firearms offenses are the most significant crimes falling outside the&para;<br>statutory grounds for exclusion. See Matter of Hernandez-Casillas, 20&para;<br>I. &amp; N. Dec. 262, 282, n. 4 (1990).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(CA11 2009).&para;<br>That approach evaluates whether the&para;<br>ground for deportation charged in a case has a close analogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. See In re&para;<br>Blake, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 728 (2005); In re Brieva-Perez,&para;<br>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 772–773 (2005).3 If the deportation&para;<br>ground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equivalent” to the set of offenses making up an exclusion ground,&para;<br>then the alien can seek §212(c) relief. Blake, 23 I. &amp; N.&para;<br>Dec., at 728. But if the deportation ground charged covers&para;<br>significantly different or more or fewer offenses than any&para;<br>exclusion ground, the alien is not eligible for a waiver.&para;<br>Such a divergence makes §212(c) inapplicable even if the&para;<br>particular offense committed by the alien falls within an&para;<br>exclusion ground.&para;<br>Two contrasting examples from the BIA’s cases&para;<br>may help to illustrate this approach. Take first an&para;<br>alien convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, whom&para;<br>DHS seeks to deport on the ground that he has committed an “aggravated felony” involving “illicit trafficking&para;<br>in a controlled substance.” 8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(B),&para;<br>1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Under the comparable-grounds rule, the&para;<br>immigration judge would look to see if that deportation&para;<br>ground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclusion ground. And according to the BIA in Matter of Meza,&para;<br>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 257 (1991), the judge would find an adequate match—the exclusion ground applicable to aliens&para;<br>who have committed offenses “relating to a controlled&para;<br>substance,” 8 U. S. C. §§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C).&para;<br>Now consider an alien convicted of first-degree sexual&para;<br>abuse of a child, whom DHS wishes to deport on the&para;<br>ground that he has committed an “aggravated felony”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Blake&para;<br>&para;<br>and Brieva-Perez clarified a 2004 regulation issued by the BIA&para;<br>stating that an alien is ineligible for §212(c) relief when deportable “on&para;<br>a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212.”&para;<br>8 CFR §1212.3(f)(5) (2010).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

May this alien seek §212(c) relief ?&para;<br>According to the BIA, he may not do so—not because his&para;<br>crime is too serious (that is irrelevant to the analysis), but&para;<br>instead because no statutory ground of exclusion covers&para;<br>substantially the same offenses. To be sure, the alien’s&para;<br>own offense is a “crime involving moral turpitude,” 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and so fits within an exclusion&para;<br>ground. Indeed, that will be true of most or all offenses&para;<br>included in this deportation category. See supra, at 5.&para;<br>But on the BIA’s view, the “moral turpitude” exclusion&para;<br>ground “addresses a distinctly different and much broader&para;<br>category of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual&para;<br>abuse of a minor charge.” Blake, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 728.&para;<br>And the much greater sweep of the exclusion ground&para;<br>prevents the alien from seeking discretionary relief from&para;<br>deportation.4&para;<br>Those mathematically inclined might think of the&para;<br>comparable-grounds approach as employing Venn diagrams. Within one circle are all the criminal offenses composing the particular ground of deportation charged. Within&para;<br>other circles are the offenses composing the various exclusion grounds. When, but only when, the “deportation&para;<br>circle” sufficiently corresponds to one of the “exclusion&para;<br>circles” may an alien apply for §212(c) relief.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Careful readers may note that the example involving controlled&para;<br>substances offered in the last paragraph also involves an exclusion&para;<br>ground that sweeps more broadly than the deportation ground charged.&para;<br>The deportation ground requires “trafficking” in a controlled substance,&para;<br>whereas the exclusion ground includes all possession offenses as well.&para;<br>The BIA nonetheless held in Meza that the degree of overlap between&para;<br>the two grounds was sufficient to make the alien eligible for §212(c)&para;<br>relief. That holding reveals the broad discretion that the BIA currently&para;<br>exercises in deciding when two statutory grounds are comparable&para;<br>enough.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v.

S. 502,&para;<br>515 (2009) (noting “the requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action”).&para;<br>The BIA has flunked that test here. By hinging a deportable alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief on the&para;<br>chance correspondence between statutory categories—a&para;<br>matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this&para;<br>country—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a&para;<br>reasoned manner.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The parties here spend much time disputing whether&para;<br>the BIA must make discretionary relief available to deportable and excludable aliens on identical terms. As this&para;<br>case illustrates, the comparable-grounds approach does&para;<br>not do so. If Judulang were seeking entry to this country,&para;<br>he would be eligible for §212(c) relief; voluntary manslaughter is “a crime involving moral turpitude,” and so&para;<br>his conviction falls within an exclusion ground. But Judulang cannot apply for relief from deportation because the&para;<br>“crime of violence” ground charged in his case does not&para;<br>match any exclusion ground (including the one for “turpitudinous” crimes). See infra, at 13. Judulang argues that&para;<br>this disparity is impermissible because any disparity&para;<br>between excludable and deportable aliens is impermissible: If an alien may seek §212(c) relief in an exclusion&para;<br>case, he also must be able to seek such relief in a deportation case. See Brief for Petitioner 47–51.8 But the Gov——————&para;<br>8 Judulang also argues that the BIA is making an impermissible distinction between two groups of deportable aliens—those who have&para;<br>recently left and returned to the country and those who have not.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

And the Government presses&para;<br>a policy reason for making §212(c) relief more readily&para;<br>available in exclusion cases. Doing so, it argues, will&para;<br>provide an incentive for some resident aliens (i.e., those&para;<br>eligible for a waiver from exclusion, but not deportation) to&para;<br>report themselves to immigration officials, by applying for&para;<br>advance permission to exit and reenter the country. In&para;<br>contrast, applying §212(c) uniformly might lead all aliens&para;<br>to “try to evade immigration officials for as long as possible,” because they could in any event “seek [discretionary]&para;<br>relief if caught.” Id., at 52.&para;<br>In the end, we think this dispute beside the point, and&para;<br>we do not resolve it.

That is because agency action&para;<br>must be based on non-arbitrary, “ ‘relevant factors,’ ” State&para;<br>——————&para;<br>According to Judulang, the BIA is treating the former as if they were&para;<br>seeking admission, while applying the “comparable grounds” approach&para;<br>only to the latter.

But the&para;<br>Government contends that it is drawing no such line—that it is applying the comparable-grounds policy to all deportable aliens. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 29. We think the available evidence tends to support the&para;<br>Government’s representation. See In re Meza-Castillo, No. A091 366&para;<br>529, 2009 WL 455596 (BIA, Feb. 9, 2009) (applying comparable-grounds&para;<br>analysis to a deportable alien who had left and returned to the country); In re Valenzuela-Morales, No. A40 443 512, 2008 WL 2079382&para;<br>(BIA, Apr. 23, 2008) (same). But in light of our holding that the&para;<br>comparable-grounds approach is arbitrary and capricious, we need not&para;<br>resolve this dispute about the BIA’s practice.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Farm, 463 U. S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., 419&para;<br>U. S., at 285), which here means that the BIA’s approach&para;<br>must be tied, even if loosely, to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system. A method for disfavoring deportable aliens&para;<br>that bears no relation to these matters—that neither&para;<br>focuses on nor relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the&para;<br>country—is arbitrary and capricious. And that is true&para;<br>regardless whether the BIA might have acted to limit the&para;<br>class of deportable aliens eligible for §212(c) relief on&para;<br>other, more rational bases.&para;<br>The problem with the comparable-grounds policy is that&para;<br>it does not impose such a reasonable limitation. Rather&para;<br>than considering factors that might be thought germane to&para;<br>the deportation decision, that policy hinges §212(c) eligibility on an irrelevant comparison between statutory&para;<br>provisions. Recall that the BIA asks whether the set of&para;<br>offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with&para;<br>the set in an exclusion ground. But so what if it does?&para;<br>Does an alien charged with a particular deportation&para;<br>ground become more worthy of relief because that ground&para;<br>happens to match up with another? Or less worthy of&para;<br>relief because the ground does not? The comparison in no&para;<br>way changes the alien’s prior offense or his other attributes and circumstances. So it is difficult to see why that&para;<br>comparison should matter.&para;<br>Each of these statutory&para;<br>grounds contains a slew of offenses. Whether each contains the same slew has nothing to do with whether a&para;<br>deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both&para;<br>grounds merits the ability to seek a waiver.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The case would be different if Congress had intended for §212(c)&para;<br>relief to depend on the interaction of exclusion grounds and deportation&para;<br>grounds. But the Government has presented us with no evidence to&para;<br>this effect, nor have we found any. See Blake, 489 F. 3d, at 102 (Congress never contemplated, in drafting the immigration laws, “that its&para;<br>grounds of deportation would have any connection with the grounds of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

In commencing&para;<br>Judulang’s deportation proceeding, the Government&para;<br>charged him with an “aggravated felony” involving a&para;<br>“crime of violence” based on his prior manslaughter conviction. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a–12a. That made&para;<br>him ineligible for §212(c) relief because the “crime of violence” deportation ground does not sufficiently overlap&para;<br>with the most similar exclusion ground, for “crime[s]&para;<br>involving moral turpitude.” The problem, according to the&para;<br>BIA, is that the “crime of violence” ground includes a few&para;<br>offenses—simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use of a vehicle—that the “moral turpitude” ground&para;<br>does not. See Brieva-Perez, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 772–773;&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29, 40–41. But this statutory difference in no way relates to Judulang—or to most other&para;<br>aliens charged with committing a “crime of violence.”&para;<br>Perhaps aliens like Judulang should be eligible for §212(c)&para;<br>relief, or perhaps they should not. But that determination&para;<br>is not sensibly made by establishing that simple assaults&para;<br>and minor burglaries fall outside a ground for exclusion.&para;<br>That fact is as extraneous to the merits of the case as a&para;<br>coin flip would be. It makes Judulang no less deserving of&para;<br>the opportunity to seek discretionary relief—just as its&para;<br>converse (the inclusion of simple assaults and burglaries&para;<br>in the “moral turpitude” exclusion ground) would make&para;<br>him no more so.&para;<br>Or consider a different headscratching oddity of the&para;<br>comparable-grounds approach—that it may deny §212(c)&para;<br>eligibility to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely&para;<br>inside an exclusion ground. The BIA’s Blake decision,&para;<br>noted earlier, provides an example. See supra, at 6–7.&para;<br>The deportation ground charged was “aggravated felony”&para;<br>involving “sexual abuse of a minor”; the closest exclusion&para;<br>ground was, once again, a “crime [of] moral turpitude.” 23&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>exclusion” in the application of §212(c)); see also infra, at 16–17.&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I. &amp; N. Dec., at 727. Here, the BIA’s problem was not that&para;<br>the deportation ground covered too many offenses; all or&para;<br>virtually all the crimes within that ground also are crimes&para;<br>of moral turpitude. Rather, the BIA objected that the&para;<br>deportation ground covered too few crimes—or put oppositely, that “the moral turpitude ground of exclusion addresses a . . . much broader category of offenses.” Id., at&para;<br>728. But providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad&para;<br>class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation&para;<br>cases to a subset of that group.10 (The better argument&para;<br>would surely be the reverse—that giving relief in the one&para;<br>context supports doing so in the other.) Again, we do not&para;<br>say today that the BIA must give all deportable aliens&para;<br>meeting §212(c)’s requirements the chance to apply for a&para;<br>waiver. See supra, at 11–12. The point is instead that the&para;<br>BIA cannot make that opportunity turn on the meaningless matching of statutory grounds.&para;<br>And underneath this layer of arbitrariness lies yet&para;<br>another, because the outcome of the Board’s comparablegrounds analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an&para;<br>immigration official’s charging decision. This problem&para;<br>arises because an alien’s prior conviction may fall within a&para;<br>number of deportation grounds, only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground. Consider, for example, an&para;<br>alien who entered the country in 1984 and committed voluntary manslaughter in 1988. That person could&para;<br>be charged (as Judulang was) with an “aggravated felony” involving a “crime of violence,” see 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). If so, the alien could&para;<br>not seek a waiver because of the absence of a comparable&para;<br>exclusion ground. But the alien also could be charged&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Perhaps&para;<br>&para;<br>that is why the BIA declined to apply similar reasoning in&para;<br>Meza—a case also involving an exclusion ground that sweeps more&para;<br>broadly than a deportation ground (although not to the same extent as&para;<br>in Blake). See supra, at 6.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with “a crime involving moral turpitude committed within&para;<br>five years . . . after the date of admission,” see&para;<br>§1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). And if that were the deportation&para;<br>charge, the alien could apply for relief, because the ground&para;<br>corresponds to the “moral turpitude” ground used in exclusion cases. See In re Salmon, 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 734&para;<br>(1978). So everything hangs on the charge. And the&para;<br>Government has provided no reason to think that immigration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding&para;<br>what charges to bring, or that those officials are exercising&para;<br>their charging discretion with §212(c) in mind. See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 34–36. So at base everything hangs on the&para;<br>fortuity of an individual official’s decision. An alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation; an&para;<br>identically situated alien appearing before another may&para;<br>gain the right to stay in this country.&para;<br>In a foundational deportation case, this Court recognized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in&para;<br>this country, and reversed an agency decision that would&para;<br>“make his right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious.” Delgadillo v. Carmichael,&para;<br>332 U. S. 388, 391 (1947). We think the policy before us&para;<br>similarly flawed. The comparable-grounds approach does&para;<br>not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien (or&para;<br>any group of aliens) should be deported. It instead distinguishes among aliens—decides who should be eligible for&para;<br>discretionary relief and who should not—solely by comparing the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories&para;<br>into which an alien falls. The resulting Venn diagrams&para;<br>have no connection to the goals of the deportation process&para;<br>or the rational operation of the immigration laws. Judge&para;<br>Learned Hand wrote in another early immigration case&para;<br>that deportation decisions cannot be made a “sport of&para;<br>chance.” See Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F. 2d 878, 879&para;<br>(CA2 1947) (quoted in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449,&para;<br>455 (1963)). That is what the comparable-grounds rule&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>brings about, and that is what the APA’s “arbitrary and&para;<br>capricious” standard is designed to thwart.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Government makes three arguments in defense of&para;<br>the comparable-grounds rule—the first based on statutory&para;<br>text, the next on history, the last on cost. We find none of&para;<br>them persuasive.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Government initially contends that the comparablegrounds approach is more faithful to “the statute’s language,” Brief for Respondent 21—or otherwise said, that&para;<br>“lifting that limit ‘would take immigration practice even&para;<br>further from the statutory text,’ ” id., at 22 (quoting Matter&para;<br>of Hernandez-Casillas, 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 262, 287 (1990)). In&para;<br>the Government’s view, §212(c) is “phrased in terms of&para;<br>waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion”; that&para;<br>phrasing, says the Government, counsels a comparative&para;<br>analysis of grounds when applying §212(c) in the deportation context. Brief for Respondent 21; see Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 34 (“[T]he reason [the comparable-grounds approach]&para;<br>makes sense is because the statute only provides for relief&para;<br>from grounds of . . . exclusion”).&para;<br>The first difficulty with this argument is that it is based&para;<br>on an inaccurate description of the statute. Section 212(c)&para;<br>instructs that certain resident aliens “may be admitted in&para;<br>the discretion of the Attorney General” notwithstanding&para;<br>any of “the provisions of subsection (a) . . . (other than&para;<br>paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.).&para;<br>Subsection (a) contains the full list of exclusion grounds;&para;<br>paragraphs (3) and (9)(C) (which deal with national security and international child abduction) are two among&para;<br>these. What §212(c) actually says, then, is that the Attorney General may admit any excludable alien, except if&para;<br>the alien is charged with two specified grounds. And that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>means that once the Attorney General determines that&para;<br>the alien is not being excluded for those two reasons, the&para;<br>ground of exclusion no longer matters. At that point, the&para;<br>alien is eligible for relief, and the thing the Attorney General waives is not a particular exclusion ground, but the&para;<br>simple denial of entry. So the premise of the Government’s argument is wrong. And if the premise, so too the&para;<br>conclusion—that is, because §212(c)’s text is not “phrased&para;<br>in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion,” Brief for Respondent 21, it cannot counsel a search&para;<br>for corresponding grounds of deportation.&para;<br>More fundamentally, the comparable-grounds approach&para;<br>would not follow from §212(c) even were the Government&para;<br>right about the section’s phrasing. That is because §212(c)&para;<br>simply has nothing to do with deportation: The provision&para;<br>was not meant to interact with the statutory grounds for&para;<br>deportation, any more than those grounds were designed&para;<br>to interact with the provision. Rather, §212(c) refers&para;<br>solely to exclusion decisions; its extension to deportation&para;<br>cases arose from the agency’s extra-textual view that some&para;<br>similar relief should be available in that context to avoid&para;<br>unreasonable distinctions. Cf., e.g., Matter of L-, 1 I. &amp; N.&para;<br>Dec., at 5; see also supra, at 3–4.11 Accordingly, the text of&para;<br>§212(c), whether or not phrased in terms of “waiving&para;<br>grounds of exclusion,” cannot support the BIA’s use of the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Congress amended §212(c), just five months before repealing it, to&para;<br>include a first-time reference to deportation cases. That amendment&para;<br>prohibited the Attorney General from granting discretionary relief to&para;<br>aliens deportable on several specified grounds. See Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1277 (effective Apr. 24,&para;<br>1996). The change does not affect our analysis, nor does the Government argue it should. As the Government notes, the amendment “did&para;<br>not speak to the viability of the Board’s” comparable-grounds rule, but&para;<br>instead made categorically ineligible for §212(c) relief “those deportable&para;<br>by reason of certain crimes.” Brief for Respondent 20. Presumably,&para;<br>Congress thought those crimes particularly incompatible with an&para;<br>alien’s continued residence in this country.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>JUDULANG v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>comparable-grounds rule—or, for that matter, any other&para;<br>method for extending discretionary relief to deportation&para;<br>cases. We well understand the difficulties of operating in&para;<br>such a text-free zone; indeed, we appreciate the Government’s yearning for a textual anchor. But §212(c), no&para;<br>matter how many times read or parsed, does not provide&para;<br>one.&para;<br>2&para;<br>In disputing Judulang’s contentions, the Government&para;<br>also emphasizes the comparable-grounds rule’s vintage.&para;<br>See Brief for Respondent 22–23, 30–43. As an initial&para;<br>matter, we think this a slender reed to support a significant government policy. Arbitrary agency action becomes&para;<br>no less so by simple dint of repetition. (To use a prior&para;<br>analogy, flipping coins to determine §212(c) eligibility&para;<br>would remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the&para;<br>first.) And longstanding capriciousness receives no special&para;<br>exemption from the APA. In any event, we cannot detect&para;<br>the consistency that the BIA claims has marked its approach to this issue. To the contrary, the BIA has repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to deportable aliens.&para;<br>Prior to 1984, the BIA endorsed a variety of approaches.&para;<br>In Matter of T-, 5 I. &amp; N. Dec. 389, 390 (1953), for example,&para;<br>the BIA held that an alien was not eligible for §212(c)&para;<br>relief because her “ground of deportation” did not appear&para;<br>in the exclusion statute. That decision anticipated the&para;<br>comparable-grounds approach that the BIA today uses.&para;<br>But in Tanori, the BIA pronounced that a deportable alien&para;<br>could apply for a waiver because “the same facts”—in that&para;<br>case, a marijuana conviction—would have allowed him to&para;<br>seek §212(c) relief in an exclusion proceeding. 15 I. &amp; N.&para;<br>Dec., at 568. That approach is more nearly similar to the&para;<br>one Judulang urges here. And then, in Matter of Granados, 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 726, 728 (1979), the BIA tried to have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>it both ways: It denied §212(c) eligibility both because the&para;<br>deportation ground charged did not correspond to, and&para;<br>because the alien’s prior conviction did not fall within, a&para;<br>waivable ground of exclusion. In short, the BIA’s cases&para;<br>were all over the map.&para;<br>The Government insists that the BIA imposed order in&para;<br>Matter of Wadud, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 182, 185–186 (1984),&para;<br>when it held that a deportable alien could not seek §212(c)&para;<br>relief unless the deportation ground charged had an “analogous ground of inadmissibility.” See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>40–41. But the BIA’s settlement, if any, was fleeting.&para;<br>Just seven years later, the BIA adopted a new policy&para;<br>entirely, extending §212(c) eligibility to “aliens deportable&para;<br>under any ground of deportability except those where&para;<br>there is a comparable ground of exclusion which has been&para;<br>specifically excepted from section 212(c).” HernandezCasillas, 20 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 266. That new rule turned the&para;<br>comparable-grounds approach inside-out, allowing aliens&para;<br>to seek §212(c) relief in deportation cases except when the&para;<br>ground charged corresponded to an exclusion ground that&para;<br>could not be waived. To be sure, the Attorney General (on&para;<br>referral of the case from the BIA), disavowed this position&para;<br>in favor of the more standard version of the comparablegrounds rule. Id., at 287. But even while doing so, the&para;<br>Attorney General stated that “an alien subject to deportation must have the same opportunity to seek discretionary&para;<br>relief as an alien . . . subject to exclusion.” Ibid. That&para;<br>assertion is exactly the one Judulang makes in this case;&para;<br>it is consonant not with the comparable-grounds rule the&para;<br>BIA here defends, but instead with an inquiry into whether an alien’s prior conviction falls within an exclusion&para;<br>ground.&para;<br>Given these mixed signals, it is perhaps not surprising&para;<br>that the BIA continued to alternate between approaches in&para;<br>the years that followed.

HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dorsed the comparable-grounds approach on several occasions. See Meza, 20 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 259; Matter of Montenegro, 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 603, 604–605 (1992); Matter of&para;<br>Gabryelsky, 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 750, 753–754 (1993); In re&para;<br>Esposito, 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 6–7 (1995); In re JimenezSantillano, 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 567, 571–572 (1996). But just&para;<br>a few years later, the BIA issued a series of unpublished&para;<br>opinions that asked only whether a deportable alien’s&para;<br>prior conviction fell within an exclusion ground. See, e.g.,&para;<br>In re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892&para;<br>(Dec. 1, 2003). Not until the BIA’s decisions in Blake and&para;<br>Brieva-Perez did the pendulum stop swinging. That history hardly supports the Government’s view of a consistent&para;<br>agency practice.12&para;<br>3&para;<br>The Government finally argues that the comparablegrounds rule saves time and money. The Government&para;<br>claims that comparing deportation grounds to exclusion&para;<br>grounds can be accomplished in just a few “precedential&para;<br>decision[s],” which then can govern broad swaths of cases.&para;<br>See Brief for Respondent 46. By contrast, the Government&para;<br>argues, Judulang’s approach would force it to determine&para;<br>whether each and every crime of conviction falls within an&para;<br>exclusion ground. Further, the Government contends that&para;<br>Judulang’s approach would grant eligibility to a greater&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Because&para;<br>&para;<br>we find the BIA’s prior practice so unsettled, we likewise&para;<br>reject Judulang’s argument that Blake and Brieva-Perez were impermissibly retroactive. To succeed on that theory, Judulang would have&para;<br>to show, at a minimum, that in entering his guilty plea, he had reasonably relied on a legal rule from which Blake and Brieva-Perez departed.&para;<br>See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994) (stating&para;<br>that retroactivity analysis focuses on “considerations of fair notice,&para;<br>reasonable reliance, and settled expectations”). The instability of the&para;<br>BIA’s prior practice prevents Judulang from making this showing:&para;<br>The BIA sometimes recognized aliens in Judulang’s position as eligible&para;<br>for §212(c) relief, but sometimes did not.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>number of deportable aliens, which in turn would force the&para;<br>Government to make additional individualized assessments of whether to actually grant relief. Id., at 47.&para;<br>Once again, the Government’s rationale comes up short.&para;<br>Cost is an important factor for agencies to consider in&para;<br>many contexts. But cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary agency policy. (If it could, flipping coins would be a&para;<br>valid way to determine an alien’s eligibility for a waiver.)&para;<br>And in any event, we suspect the Government exaggerates&para;<br>the cost savings associated with the comparable-grounds&para;<br>rule. Judulang’s proposed approach asks immigration&para;<br>officials only to do what they have done for years in exclusion cases; that means, for one thing, that officials can&para;<br>make use of substantial existing precedent governing&para;<br>whether a crime falls within a ground of exclusion. And&para;<br>Judulang’s proposal may not be the only alternative to the&para;<br>comparable-grounds rule. See supra, at 11–12. In rejecting that rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to&para;<br>devise another, equally economical policy respecting eligibility for §212(c) relief, so long as it comports with everything held in both this decision and St. Cyr.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We must reverse an agency policy when we cannot&para;<br>discern a reason for it. That is the trouble in this case.&para;<br>The BIA’s comparable-grounds rule is unmoored from the&para;<br>purposes and concerns of the immigration laws. It allows&para;<br>an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to&para;<br>govern a matter of the utmost importance—whether lawful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country&para;<br>may stay here. And contrary to the Government’s protestations, it is not supported by text or practice or cost considerations. The BIA’s approach therefore cannot pass&para;<br>muster under ordinary principles of administrative law.&para;<br>The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is hereby reversed,&para;<br>and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
