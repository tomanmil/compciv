The&para;<br>subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all&para;<br>disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia. When a&para;<br>dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of&para;<br>Texas. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forumselection clause rendered venue “wrong” under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a)&para;<br>and “improper” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). In&para;<br>the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the&para;<br>Eastern District of Virginia under 28 U. S. C. §1404(a). The District&para;<br>Court denied both motions. It concluded that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to&para;<br>another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under §1404(a); and that&para;<br>the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors,&para;<br>only one of which was the forum-selection clause. After weighing those&para;<br>factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marine’s petition for a writ of&para;<br>mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under&para;<br>§1406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under&para;<br>§1404(a). The court agreed with the District Court that §1404(a) is&para;<br>the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that&para;<br>points to another federal forum; that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3)&para;<br>would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection&para;<br>clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum; and that the District Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.&para;<br>COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after&para;<br>conducting the balance-of-interests analysis required by §1404(a).&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. A forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer&para;<br>under §1404(a), which provides that “[f]or the convenience of parties&para;<br>and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer&para;<br>any civil action to any other district or division where it might have&para;<br>been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have&para;<br>consented.” Pp. 4–11.&para;<br>(a) Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when&para;<br>venue is “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or “improper” depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case&para;<br>was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws. Title&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1391, which governs venue generally, states that&para;<br>“[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law . . . this section shall govern&para;<br>the venue of all civil actions brought in” federal district courts.&para;<br>§1391(a)(1). It then defines districts in which venue is proper. See&para;<br>§1391(b). If a case falls within one of §1391(b)’s districts, venue is&para;<br>proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dismissed or transferred under §1406(a). Whether the parties’ contract&para;<br>contains a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case&para;<br>falls into one of the specified districts.&para;<br>This conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue&para;<br>provisions, which reflects Congress’ intent that venue should always&para;<br>lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. See §1391(b)(3). The conclusion also&para;<br>follows from this Court’s decisions construing the federal venue&para;<br>statutes. See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612; Stewart&para;<br>Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(b) Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a&para;<br>court “wrong” or “improper” under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the&para;<br>clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under §1404(a),&para;<br>which permits transfer to any other district where venue is proper or&para;<br>to any district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation. Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the&para;<br>federal court system. When a forum-selection clause points to a state&para;<br>or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of&para;<br>forum non conveniens. Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doctrine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another&para;<br>federal court. Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp.,&para;<br>549 U. S. 422. For all other cases, parties may still invoke the residual forum non conveniens doctrine. See id., at 430. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(c) The Court declines to consider whether a defendant in a&para;<br>breach-of-contract action could obtain dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) if&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the plaintiff files suit in a district other than the one specified in a&para;<br>forum-selection clause. Petitioner did not file a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rule’s application.&para;<br>Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>2. When a defendant files a §1404(a) motion, a district court should&para;<br>transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the&para;<br>convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. No such exceptional factors appear to be present in this case. Pp. 11–17.&para;<br>(a) Normally, a district court considering a §1404(a) motion must&para;<br>evaluate both the private interests of the parties and public-interest&para;<br>considerations. But when the parties’ contract contains a valid&para;<br>forum-selection clause, that clause “represents [their] agreement as to&para;<br>the most proper forum,” Stewart, 487 U. S., at 31, and should be “given&para;<br>controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases,” id., at 33&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The presence of a valid forum-selection&para;<br>clause requires district courts to adjust their usual §1404(a) analysis&para;<br>in three ways. First, the plaintiff’s choice of forum merits no weight,&para;<br>and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has&para;<br>the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the&para;<br>parties bargained is unwarranted. Second, the court should not consider the parties’ private interests aside from those embodied in the&para;<br>forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests. Because&para;<br>public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in unusual cases. Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause&para;<br>flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a&para;<br>§1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue’s&para;<br>choice-of-law rules. See Van Dusen, supra, at 639. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(b) Here, the District Court’s application of §1404(a) did not comport with these principles. The court improperly placed the burden&para;<br>on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties’ contractually&para;<br>preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring J-Crew, the&para;<br>party acting in violation of the forum-selection clause, to show that&para;<br>public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer. It also&para;<br>erred in giving weight to the parties’ private interests outside those&para;<br>expressed in the forum-selection clause. And its holding that public&para;<br>interests favored keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract&para;<br>law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to those in Virginia rested in part on the District Court’s mistaken belief that&para;<br>the Virginia federal court would have been required to apply Texas’&para;<br>choice-of-law rules instead of Virginia’s.

We reject petitioner’s&para;<br>argument that such a clause may be enforced by a motion&para;<br>to dismiss under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3) of&para;<br>the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Instead, a forumselection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer&para;<br>under §1404(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V), which provides that&para;<br>“[f ]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the&para;<br>interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil&para;<br>action to any other district or division where it might have&para;<br>been brought or to any district or division to which all&para;<br>parties have consented.” When a defendant files such a&para;<br>motion, we conclude, a district court should transfer the&para;<br>case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the&para;<br>convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. In&para;<br>the present case, both the District Court and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals misunderstood the standards to be applied in&para;<br>adjudicating a §1404(a) motion in a case involving a forum-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

Atlantic&para;<br>Marine then entered into a subcontract with respondent&para;<br>J-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on&para;<br>the project. This subcontract included a forum-selection&para;<br>clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties&para;<br>“ ‘shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of&para;<br>Norfolk, Virginia, or the United States District Court for&para;<br>the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division.’ ” In re&para;<br>Atlantic Marine Constr. Co., 701 F. 3d 736, 737–738 (CA5&para;<br>2012).&para;<br>When a dispute about payment under the subcontract&para;<br>arose, however, J-Crew sued Atlantic Marine in the Western District of Texas, invoking that court’s diversity jurisdiction. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss the suit,&para;<br>arguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue in&para;<br>the Western District of Texas “wrong” under §1406(a) and&para;<br>“improper” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).&para;<br>In the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the&para;<br>case to the Eastern District of Virginia under §1404(a).&para;<br>J-Crew opposed these motions.&para;<br>The District Court denied both motions. It first concluded that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another&para;<br>federal forum. The District Court then held that Atlantic&para;<br>Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer&para;<br>would be appropriate under §1404(a) and that the court&para;<br>would “consider a nonexhaustive and nonexclusive list of&para;<br>public and private interest factors,” of which the “forum-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Giving&para;<br>particular weight to its findings that “compulsory process&para;<br>will not be available for the majority of J-Crew’s witnesses”&para;<br>and that there would be “significant expense for those&para;<br>willing witnesses,” the District Court held that Atlantic&para;<br>Marine had failed to carry its burden of showing that&para;<br>transfer “would be in the interest of justice or increase the&para;<br>convenience to the parties and their witnesses.” Id., at&para;<br>*7–*8; see also 701 F. 3d, at 743.&para;<br>Atlantic Marine petitioned the Court of Appeals for a&para;<br>writ of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss&para;<br>the case under §1406(a) or to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia under §1404(a). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals denied Atlantic Marine’s petition because Atlantic&para;<br>Marine had not established a “ ‘clear and indisputable’ ”&para;<br>right to relief.

Ricoh Corp., 487&para;<br>U. S. 22 (1988), the Court of Appeals agreed with the&para;<br>District Court that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism&para;<br>for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum when venue is otherwise proper in the&para;<br>district where the case was brought. See 701 F. 3d, at&para;<br>739–741.1 The court stated, however, that if a forumselection clause points to a nonfederal forum, dismissal&para;<br>under Rule 12(b)(3) would be the correct mechanism to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Venue was otherwise proper in the Western District of Texas because the subcontract at issue in the suit was entered into and was to&para;<br>be performed in that district.

We&para;<br>granted certiorari. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Atlantic Marine contends that a party may enforce a&para;<br>forum-selection clause by seeking dismissal of the suit&para;<br>under §1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3). We disagree. Section&para;<br>1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue&para;<br>is “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or&para;<br>“improper” depends exclusively on whether the court in&para;<br>which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of&para;<br>federal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing&para;<br>about a forum-selection clause.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Section 1406(a) provides that “[t]he district court of a&para;<br>district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong&para;<br>division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest&para;<br>of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in&para;<br>which it could have been brought.” Rule 12(b)(3) states&para;<br>that a party may move to dismiss a case for “improper&para;<br>venue.” These provisions therefore authorize dismissal&para;<br>only when venue is “wrong” or “improper” in the forum in&para;<br>which it was brought.&para;<br>This question—whether venue is “wrong” or “improper”—is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>generally governed by 28 U. S. C. §1391 (2006 ed., Supp. V).2&para;<br>That provision states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided&para;<br>by law . . . this section shall govern the venue of all civil&para;<br>actions brought in district courts of the United States.”&para;<br>§1391(a)(1) (emphasis added). It further provides that “[a]&para;<br>civil action may be brought in—(1) a judicial district in&para;<br>which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a&para;<br>judicial district in which a substantial part of the events&para;<br>or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is&para;<br>situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action&para;<br>may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any&para;<br>judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the&para;<br>court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.”&para;<br>§1391(b).3 When venue is challenged, the court must&para;<br>determine whether the case falls within one of the three&para;<br>categories set out in §1391(b). If it does, venue is proper;&para;<br>if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be&para;<br>dismissed or transferred under §1406(a). Whether the&para;<br>parties entered into a contract containing a forumselection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into&para;<br>one of the categories of cases listed in §1391(b). As a&para;<br>result, a case filed in a district that falls within §1391 may&para;<br>not be dismissed under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).&para;<br>Petitioner’s contrary view improperly conflates the&para;<br>special statutory term “venue” and the word “forum.” It&para;<br>is certainly true that, in some contexts, the word “venue”&para;<br>is used synonymously with the term “forum,” but §1391&para;<br>makes clear that venue in “all civil actions” must be determined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Section 1391 governs “venue generally,” that is, in cases where a&para;<br>more specific venue provision does not apply. Cf., e.g., §1400 (identifying proper venue for copyright and patent suits).&para;<br>3 Other provisions of §1391 define the requirements for proper venue&para;<br>in particular circumstances.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.&para;<br>COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>section. That language cannot reasonably be read to allow&para;<br>judicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations&para;<br>on the forum in which a case may be brought.&para;<br>The structure of the federal venue provisions confirms&para;<br>that they alone define whether venue exists in a given&para;<br>forum. In particular, the venue statutes reflect Congress’&para;<br>intent that venue should always lie in some federal court&para;<br>whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over&para;<br>the defendant. The first two paragraphs of §1391(b) define the preferred judicial districts for venue in a typical&para;<br>case, but the third paragraph provides a fallback option: If&para;<br>no other venue is proper, then venue will lie in “any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the&para;<br>court’s personal jurisdiction” (emphasis added). The statute thereby ensures that so long as a federal court has&para;<br>personal jurisdiction over the defendant, venue will always lie somewhere. As we have previously noted, “Congress does not in general intend to create venue gaps,&para;<br>which take away with one hand what Congress has given&para;<br>by way of jurisdictional grant with the other.” Smith v.&para;<br>United States, 507 U. S. 197, 203 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet petitioner’s approach would&para;<br>mean that in some number of cases—those in which the&para;<br>forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign court—&para;<br>venue would not lie in any federal district. That would not&para;<br>comport with the statute’s design, which contemplates&para;<br>that venue will always exist in some federal court.&para;<br>The conclusion that venue is proper so long as the requirements of §1391(b) are met, irrespective of any forumselection clause, also follows from our prior decisions&para;<br>construing the federal venue statutes. In Van Dusen v.&para;<br>Barrack, 376 U. S. 612 (1964), we considered the meaning&para;<br>of §1404(a), which authorizes a district court to “transfer&para;<br>any civil action to any other district or division where it&para;<br>might have been brought.” The question in Van Dusen&para;<br>was whether §1404(a) allows transfer to a district in which&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>venue is proper under §1391 but in which the case could&para;<br>not have been pursued in light of substantive state-law&para;<br>limitations on the suit. See id., at 614–615. In holding&para;<br>that transfer is permissible in that context, we construed&para;<br>the phrase “where it might have been brought” to refer&para;<br>to “the federal laws delimiting the districts in which such&para;<br>an action ‘may be brought,’ ” id., at 624, noting that&para;<br>“the phrase ‘may be brought’ recurs at least 10 times” in&para;<br>§§1391–1406, id., at 622. We perceived “no valid reason&para;<br>for reading the words ‘where it might have been brought’&para;<br>to narrow the range of permissible federal forums beyond&para;<br>those permitted by federal venue statutes.” Id., at 623.&para;<br>As we noted in Van Dusen, §1406(a) “shares the same&para;<br>statutory context” as §1404(a) and “contain[s] a similar&para;<br>phrase.” Id., at 621, n. 11. It instructs a court to transfer&para;<br>a case from the “wrong” district to a district “in which it&para;<br>could have been brought.” The most reasonable interpretation of that provision is that a district cannot be “wrong”&para;<br>if it is one in which the case could have been brought&para;<br>under §1391. Under the construction of the venue laws we&para;<br>adopted in Van Dusen, a “wrong” district is therefore a&para;<br>district other than “those districts in which Congress has&para;<br>provided by its venue statutes that the action ‘may be&para;<br>brought.’ ” Id., at 618 (emphasis added). If the federal&para;<br>venue statutes establish that suit may be brought in a&para;<br>particular district, a contractual bar cannot render venue&para;<br>in that district “wrong.”&para;<br>Our holding also finds support in Stewart, 487 U. S. 22.&para;<br>As here, the parties in Stewart had included a forumselection clause in the relevant contract, but the plaintiff&para;<br>filed suit in a different federal district. The defendant had&para;<br>initially moved to transfer the case or, in the alternative,&para;<br>to dismiss for improper venue under §1406(a), but by the&para;<br>time the case reached this Court, the defendant had abandoned its §1406(a) argument and sought only transfer&para;<br>under §1404(a). We rejected the plaintiff ’s argument that&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST. &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>state law governs a motion to transfer venue pursuant to a&para;<br>forum-selection clause, concluding instead that “federal&para;<br>law, specifically 28 U. S. C. §1404(a), governs the District&para;<br>Court’s decision whether to give effect to the parties’&para;<br>forum-selection clause.” Id., at 32. We went on to explain&para;<br>that a “motion to transfer under §1404(a) . . . calls on the&para;<br>district court to weigh in the balance a number of casespecific factors” and that the “presence of a forumselection clause . . . will be a significant factor that figures&para;<br>centrally in the district court’s calculus.” Id., at 29.&para;<br>The question whether venue in the original court was&para;<br>“wrong” under §1406(a) was not before the Court, but we&para;<br>wrote in a footnote that “[t]he parties do not dispute that&para;<br>the District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss&para;<br>the case for improper venue under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a)&para;<br>because respondent apparently does business in the&para;<br>Northern District of Alabama. See 28 U. S. C. §1391(c)&para;<br>(venue proper in judicial district in which corporation is&para;<br>doing business).” Id., at 28, n. 8. In other words, because&para;<br>§1391 made venue proper, venue could not be “wrong” for&para;<br>purposes of §1406(a). Though dictum, the Court’s observation supports the holding we reach today. A contrary&para;<br>view would all but drain Stewart of any significance. If a&para;<br>forum-selection clause rendered venue in all other federal&para;<br>courts “wrong,” a defendant could always obtain automatic&para;<br>dismissal or transfer under §1406(a) and would not have&para;<br>any reason to resort to §1404(a). Stewart’s holding would&para;<br>be limited to the presumably rare case in which the defendant inexplicably fails to file a motion under §1406(a)&para;<br>or Rule 12(b)(3).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue&para;<br>in a court “wrong” or “improper” within the meaning of&para;<br>§1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced&para;<br>through a motion to transfer under §1404(a). That provi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion states that “[f ]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may&para;<br>transfer any civil action to any other district or division&para;<br>where it might have been brought or to any district or&para;<br>division to which all parties have consented.” Unlike&para;<br>§1406(a), §1404(a) does not condition transfer on the initial forum’s being “wrong.” And it permits transfer to&para;<br>any district where venue is also proper (i.e., “where [the&para;<br>case] might have been brought”) or to any other district to&para;<br>which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.&para;<br>Section 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for&para;<br>enforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a&para;<br>particular federal district. And for the reasons we address&para;<br>in Part III, infra, a proper application of §1404(a) requires&para;<br>that a forum-selection clause be “given controlling weight&para;<br>in all but the most exceptional cases.” Stewart, supra, at&para;<br>33 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).&para;<br>Atlantic Marine argues that §1404(a) is not a suitable&para;<br>mechanism to enforce forum-selection clauses because&para;<br>that provision cannot provide for transfer when a forumselection clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal, see&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 18–19, and we agree with Atlantic&para;<br>Marine that the Court of Appeals failed to provide a sound&para;<br>answer to this problem. The Court of Appeals opined that&para;<br>a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum&para;<br>should be enforced through Rule 12(b)(3), which permits a&para;<br>party to move for dismissal of a case based on “improper&para;<br>venue.” 701 F. 3d, at 740. As Atlantic Marine persuasively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be reconciled with our construction of the term “improper venue” in&para;<br>§1406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal&para;<br>venue laws. If venue is proper under federal venue rules,&para;<br>it does not matter for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(3) whether&para;<br>the forum-selection clause points to a federal or a nonfederal forum.&para;<br>Instead, the appropriate way to enforce a forum-&para;<br>&para;<br>10 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

Section&para;<br>1404(a) is merely a codification of the doctrine of forum&para;<br>non conveniens for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is within the federal court system; in such&para;<br>cases, Congress has replaced the traditional remedy of&para;<br>outright dismissal with transfer. See Sinochem Int’l Co. v.&para;<br>Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U. S. 422, 430 (2007)&para;<br>(“For the federal court system, Congress has codified the&para;<br>doctrine . . . ”); see also notes following §1404 (Historical&para;<br>and Revision Notes) (Section 1404(a) “was drafted in&para;<br>accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens,&para;<br>permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even&para;<br>though the venue is proper”). For the remaining set of&para;<br>cases calling for a nonfederal forum, §1404(a) has no&para;<br>application, but the residual doctrine of forum non conveniens “has continuing application in federal courts.” Sinochem, 549 U. S., at 430 (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>brackets omitted); see also ibid. (noting that federal courts&para;<br>invoke forum non conveniens “in cases where the alternative forum is abroad, and perhaps in rare instances where&para;<br>a state or territorial court serves litigational convenience&para;<br>best” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).&para;<br>And because both §1404(a) and the forum non conveniens&para;<br>doctrine from which it derives entail the same balancingof-interests standard, courts should evaluate a forumselection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the&para;<br>same way that they evaluate a forum-selection clause&para;<br>pointing to a federal forum.

Even if a defendant could use&para;<br>Rule 12(b)(6) to enforce a forum-selection clause, that&para;<br>would not change our conclusions that §1406(a) and Rule&para;<br>12(b)(3) are not proper mechanisms to enforce a forumselection clause and that §1404(a) and the forum non&para;<br>conveniens doctrine provide appropriate enforcement&para;<br>mechanisms.4&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although the Court of Appeals correctly identified&para;<br>§1404(a) as the appropriate provision to enforce the forumselection clause in this case, the Court of Appeals erred in&para;<br>failing to make the adjustments required in a §1404(a)&para;<br>analysis when the transfer motion is premised on a forumselection clause. When the parties have agreed to a valid&para;<br>forum-selection clause, a district court should ordinarily&para;<br>transfer the case to the forum specified in that clause.5&para;<br>Only under extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the&para;<br>convenience of the parties should a §1404(a) motion be&para;<br>denied.

Even if Professor Sachs is ultimately&para;<br>correct, therefore, defendants would have sensible reasons to invoke&para;<br>§1404(a) or the forum non conveniens doctrine in addition to Rule&para;<br>12(b)(6).&para;<br>5 Our analysis presupposes a contractually valid forum-selection&para;<br>clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>12 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.&para;<br>COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>In the typical case not involving a forum-selection&para;<br>clause, a district court considering a §1404(a) motion (or a&para;<br>forum non conveniens motion) must evaluate both the&para;<br>convenience of the parties and various public-interest&para;<br>considerations.6 Ordinarily, the district court would weigh&para;<br>the relevant factors and decide whether, on balance, a&para;<br>transfer would serve “the convenience of parties and witnesses” and otherwise promote “the interest of justice.”&para;<br>§1404(a).&para;<br>The calculus changes, however, when the parties’ contract contains a valid forum-selection clause, which “represents the parties’ agreement as to the most proper&para;<br>forum.” Stewart, 487 U. S., at 31. The “enforcement of&para;<br>valid forum-selection clauses, bargained for by the parties,&para;<br>protects their legitimate expectations and furthers vital&para;<br>interests of the justice system.” Id., at 33 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring). For that reason, and because the overarching&para;<br>consideration under §1404(a) is whether a transfer would&para;<br>promote “the interest of justice,” “a valid forum-selection&para;<br>clause [should be] given controlling weight in all but the&para;<br>most exceptional cases.” Id., at 33 (same). The presence&para;<br>of a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to&para;<br>adjust their usual §1404(a) analysis in three ways.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Factors relating to the parties’ private interests include “relative&para;<br>ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for&para;<br>attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,&para;<br>witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate&para;<br>to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case&para;<br>easy, expeditious and inexpensive.” Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454&para;<br>U. S. 235, 241, n. 6 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). Publicinterest factors may include “the administrative difficulties flowing&para;<br>from court congestion; the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home; [and] the interest in having the trial of a diversity&para;<br>case in a forum that is at home with the law.” Ibid. (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The Court must also give some weight to the plaintiffs’&para;<br>choice of forum. See Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U. S. 29, 32 (1995).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>First, the plaintiff ’s choice of forum merits no weight.&para;<br>Rather, as the party defying the forum-selection clause,&para;<br>the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that transfer&para;<br>to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted. Because plaintiffs are ordinarily allowed to select&para;<br>whatever forum they consider most advantageous (consistent with jurisdictional and venue limitations), we have&para;<br>termed their selection the “plaintiff ’s venue privilege.”&para;<br>Van Dusen, 376 U. S., at 635.7 But when a plaintiff agrees&para;<br>by contract to bring suit only in a specified forum—&para;<br>presumably in exchange for other binding promises by&para;<br>the defendant—the plaintiff has effectively exercised its&para;<br>“venue privilege” before a dispute arises. Only that initial&para;<br>choice deserves deference, and the plaintiff must bear the&para;<br>burden of showing why the court should not transfer the&para;<br>case to the forum to which the parties agreed.&para;<br>Second, a court evaluating a defendant’s §1404(a) motion to transfer based on a forum-selection clause should&para;<br>not consider arguments about the parties’ private interests. When parties agree to a forum-selection clause, they&para;<br>waive the right to challenge the preselected forum as&para;<br>inconvenient or less convenient for themselves or their&para;<br>witnesses, or for their pursuit of the litigation. A court&para;<br>accordingly must deem the private-interest factors to&para;<br>weigh entirely in favor of the preselected forum. As we&para;<br>have explained in a different but “ ‘instructive’ ” context,&para;<br>Stewart, supra, at 28, “[w]hatever ‘inconvenience’ [the&para;<br>parties] would suffer by being forced to litigate in the&para;<br>contractual forum as [they] agreed to do was clearly foreseeable at the time of contracting.” The Bremen v. Zapata&para;<br>Off-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, 17–18 (1972); see also Stewart,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We note that this “privilege” exists within the confines of statutory&para;<br>limitations, and “[i]n most instances, the purpose of statutorily specified venue is to protect the defendant against the risk that a plaintiff&para;<br>will select an unfair or inconvenient place of trial.” Leroy v. Great&para;<br>Western United Corp., 443 U. S. 173, 183–184 (1979).&para;<br>&para;<br>14 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.&para;<br>COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>supra, at 33 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (stating that Bremen’s “reasoning applies with much force to federal courts&para;<br>sitting in diversity”).&para;<br>As a consequence, a district court may consider arguments about public-interest factors only. See n. 6, supra.&para;<br>Because those factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion,&para;<br>the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should&para;<br>control except in unusual cases. Although it is “conceivable in a particular case” that the district court “would&para;<br>refuse to transfer a case notwithstanding the counterweight of a forum-selection clause,” Stewart, supra, at 30–&para;<br>31, such cases will not be common.&para;<br>Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause&para;<br>flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different&para;<br>forum, a §1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it&para;<br>the original venue’s choice-of-law rules—a factor that in&para;<br>some circumstances may affect public-interest considerations. See Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235, 241,&para;<br>n. 6 (1981) (listing a court’s familiarity with the “law that&para;<br>must govern the action” as a potential factor). A federal&para;<br>court sitting in diversity ordinarily must follow the choiceof-law rules of the State in which it sits. See Klaxon Co. v.&para;<br>Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487, 494–496 (1941).&para;<br>However, we previously identified an exception to that principle for §1404(a) transfers, requiring that the state law&para;<br>applicable in the original court also apply in the transferee court. See Van Dusen, 376 U. S., at 639. We deemed&para;<br>that exception necessary to prevent “defendants, properly&para;<br>subjected to suit in the transferor State,” from “invok[ing]&para;<br>§1404(a) to gain the benefits of the laws of another jurisdiction . . . .” Id., at 638; see Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494&para;<br>U. S. 516, 522 (1990) (extending the Van Dusen rule to&para;<br>§1404(a) motions by plaintiffs).&para;<br>The policies motivating our exception to the Klaxon rule&para;<br>for §1404(a) transfers, however, do not support an extension to cases where a defendant’s motion is premised on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>enforcement of a valid forum-selection clause. See Ferens,&para;<br>supra, at 523. To the contrary, those considerations lead&para;<br>us to reject the rule that the law of the court in which the&para;<br>plaintiff inappropriately filed suit should follow the case to&para;<br>the forum contractually selected by the parties. In Van&para;<br>Dusen, we were concerned that, through a §1404(a) transfer, a defendant could “defeat the state-law advantages&para;<br>that might accrue from the exercise of [the plaintiff ’s]&para;<br>venue privilege.” 376 U. S., at 635. But as discussed&para;<br>above, a plaintiff who files suit in violation of a forumselection clause enjoys no such “privilege” with respect to&para;<br>its choice of forum, and therefore it is entitled to no concomitant “state-law advantages.” Not only would it be&para;<br>inequitable to allow the plaintiff to fasten its choice of&para;<br>substantive law to the venue transfer, but it would also&para;<br>encourage gamesmanship. Because “§1404(a) should not&para;<br>create or multiply opportunities for forum shopping,”&para;<br>Ferens, supra, at 523, we will not apply the Van Dusen&para;<br>rule when a transfer stems from enforcement of a forumselection clause: The court in the contractually selected&para;<br>venue should not apply the law of the transferor venue to&para;<br>which the parties waived their right.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 For the reasons detailed above, see Part II–B, supra, the same&para;<br>standards should apply to motions to dismiss for forum non conveniens&para;<br>in cases involving valid forum-selection clauses pointing to state or foreign forums. We have noted in contexts unrelated to forum-selection&para;<br>clauses that a defendant “invoking forum non conveniens ordinarily&para;<br>bears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiff’s chosen forum.” Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Co., 549 U. S. 422, 430 (2007).&para;<br>That is because of the “hars[h] result” of that doctrine: Unlike a&para;<br>§1404(a) motion, a successful motion under forum non conveniens&para;<br>requires dismissal of the case. Norwood, 349 U. S., at 32. That inconveniences plaintiffs in several respects and even “makes it possible for&para;<br>[plaintiffs] to lose out completely, through the running of the statute of&para;<br>limitations in the forum finally deemed appropriate.” Id., at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such caution is not warranted, however,&para;<br>when the plaintiff has violated a contractual obligation by filing suit&para;<br>in a forum other than the one specified in a valid forum-selection&para;<br>&para;<br>16 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

OF TEX.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>When parties have contracted in advance to litigate&para;<br>disputes in a particular forum, courts should not unnecessarily disrupt the parties’ settled expectations. A forumselection clause, after all, may have figured centrally in&para;<br>the parties’ negotiations and may have affected how they&para;<br>set monetary and other contractual terms; it may, in fact,&para;<br>have been a critical factor in their agreement to do business together in the first place. In all but the most unusual cases, therefore, “the interest of justice” is served by&para;<br>holding parties to their bargain.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The District Court’s application of §1404(a) in this case&para;<br>did not comport with these principles. The District Court&para;<br>improperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove&para;<br>that transfer to the parties’ contractually preselected&para;<br>forum was appropriate. As the party acting in violation of&para;<br>the forum-selection clause, J-Crew must bear the burden&para;<br>of showing that public-interest factors overwhelmingly&para;<br>disfavor a transfer.&para;<br>The District Court also erred in giving weight to arguments about the parties’ private interests, given that all&para;<br>private interests, as expressed in the forum-selection&para;<br>clause, weigh in favor of the transfer. The District Court&para;<br>stated that the private-interest factors “militat[e] against&para;<br>a transfer to Virginia” because “compulsory process will&para;<br>not be available for the majority of J-Crew’s witnesses”&para;<br>and there will be “significant expense for those willing&para;<br>witnesses.” 2012 WL 8499879, *6–*7; see 701 F. 3d, at&para;<br>743 (noting District Court’s “concer[n] with J-Crew’s ability to secure witnesses for trial”).
