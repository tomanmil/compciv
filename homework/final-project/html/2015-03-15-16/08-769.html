STEVENS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–769.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 6, 2009—Decided April 20, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. §48 to criminalize the commercial crea&para;<br>tion, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. The&para;<br>statute addresses only portrayals of harmful acts, not the underlying&para;<br>conduct. It applies to any visual or auditory depiction “in which a liv&para;<br>ing animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or&para;<br>killed,” if that conduct violates federal or state law where “the crea&para;<br>tion, sale, or possession takes place,” §48(c)(1). Another clause ex&para;<br>empts depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educa&para;<br>tional, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.”&para;<br>§48(b).&para;<br>The&para;<br>legislative background of §48 focused primarily on “crush videos,”&para;<br>which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said&para;<br>to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish. Respondent Ste&para;<br>vens was indicted under §48 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.&para;<br>He moved to dismiss, arguing that §48 is facially invalid under the&para;<br>First Amendment. The District Court denied his motion, and Ste&para;<br>vens was convicted. The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and de&para;<br>clared §48 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of&para;<br>protected speech.&para;<br>Held: Section §48 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid un&para;<br>der the First Amendment. Pp. 5–20.&para;<br>(a) Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically&para;<br>unprotected by the First Amendment. Because §48 explicitly regu&para;<br>lates expression based on content, it is “ ‘presumptively invalid,’ . . .&para;<br>and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.”&para;<br>United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803,&para;<br>817. Since its enactment, the First Amendment has permitted re&para;<br>strictions on a few historic categories of speech—including obscenity,&para;<br>defamation, fraud, incitement, and speech integral to criminal con&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>duct—that “have never been thought to raise any Constitutional&para;<br>problem,” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572. Depic&para;<br>tions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list. While the&para;<br>prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law,&para;<br>there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting depictions of&para;<br>such cruelty. The Government’s proposed test would broadly balance&para;<br>the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine&para;<br>whether the First Amendment even applies. But the First Amend&para;<br>ment’s free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of&para;<br>speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and&para;<br>benefits. The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American&para;<br>people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government out&para;<br>weigh the costs. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, distinguished.&para;<br>Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(b) Stevens’s facial challenge succeeds under existing doctrine.&para;<br>Pp. 9–20.&para;<br>(1) In the First Amendment context, a law may be invalidated as&para;<br>overbroad if “a ‘substantial number’ of its applications are unconsti&para;<br>tutional, ‘ “judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate&para;<br>sweep.” ’ ” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican&para;<br>Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6. Stevens claims that common depic&para;<br>tions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of&para;<br>materials subject to §48. The Government does not defend such ap&para;<br>plications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to spe&para;<br>cific types of extreme material. Section 48’s constitutionality thus&para;<br>turns on how broadly it is construed. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(2) Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.&para;<br>The statute’s definition of a “depiction of animal cruelty” does not&para;<br>even require that the depicted conduct be cruel. While the words&para;<br>“maimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey cruelty, “wounded” and&para;<br>“killed” do not. Those words have little ambiguity and should be read&para;<br>according to their ordinary meaning. Section 48 does require that the&para;<br>depicted conduct be “illegal,” but many federal and state laws con&para;<br>cerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard&para;<br>against animal cruelty. For example, endangered species protections&para;<br>restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals. The statute&para;<br>draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.&para;<br>Moreover, §48 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal&para;<br>in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, “re&para;<br>gardless of whether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place” there,&para;<br>§48(c)(1). Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the&para;<br>ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the&para;<br>same conduct is unlawful. This greatly expands §48’s scope, because&para;<br>views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cruelty vary widely from place to place. Hunting is unlawful in the&para;<br>District of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national&para;<br>market for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand&para;<br>for crush videos or animal fighting depictions. Because the statute&para;<br>allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country,&para;<br>§48(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that&para;<br>is sold in the Nation’s Capital. Those seeking to comply with the law&para;<br>face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate ju&para;<br>risdictions. Pp. 11–15.&para;<br>(3) Limiting §48’s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal&para;<br>fighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, re&para;<br>quires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute’s exceptions&para;<br>clause. The statute only exempts material with “serious” value, and&para;<br>“serious” must be taken seriously. The excepted speech must also fall&para;<br>within one of §48(b)’s enumerated categories. Much speech does not.&para;<br>For example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional&para;<br>in nature. The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading&para;<br>that results in the statute’s banning only the depictions the Govern&para;<br>ment would like to ban.&para;<br>Although the language of §48(b) is drawn from the Court’s deci&para;<br>sion in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, the exceptions clause does&para;<br>not answer every First Amendment objection. Under Miller, “seri&para;<br>ous” value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity. But&para;<br>Miller did not determine that serious value could be used as a gen&para;<br>eral precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.&para;<br>Even “ ‘wholly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection of free&para;<br>speech.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25. The First Amend&para;<br>ment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not&para;<br>qualify for §48(b)’s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall&para;<br>within §48(c)’s broad reach. Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>(4) Despite the Government’s assurance that it will apply §48 to&para;<br>reach only “extreme” cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconsti&para;<br>tutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it&para;<br>responsibly. Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to&para;<br>avoid constitutional doubt. A limiting construction can be imposed&para;<br>only if the statute “is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construction,”&para;<br>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 884. To read&para;<br>§48 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinter&para;<br>pretation. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>(5) This construction of §48 decides the constitutional question.&para;<br>The Government makes no effort to defend §48 as applied beyond&para;<br>crush videos and depictions of animal fighting. It argues that those&para;<br>particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or&para;<br>are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny. But&para;<br>the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depic&para;<br>tions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively&para;<br>protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to §48.&para;<br>Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively&para;<br>impermissible applications of §48 far outnumber any permissible&para;<br>ones. The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited&para;<br>to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would&para;<br>be constitutional. Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substan&para;<br>tially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.&para;<br>Pp. 19–20.&para;<br>&para;<br>533 F. 3d 218, affirmed.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

The statute does not address&para;<br>underlying acts harmful to animals, but only portrayals of&para;<br>such conduct. The question presented is whether the&para;<br>prohibition in the statute is consistent with the freedom of&para;<br>speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Section 48 establishes a criminal penalty of up to five&para;<br>years in prison for anyone who knowingly “creates, sells,&para;<br>or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,” if done “for&para;<br>commercial gain” in interstate or foreign commerce.&para;<br>§48(a).1 A depiction of “animal cruelty” is defined as one&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>statute reads in full:&para;<br>“§48.

In what is referred to&para;<br>as the “exceptions clause,” the law exempts from prohibi&para;<br>tion any depiction “that has serious religious, political,&para;<br>scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic&para;<br>value.” §48(b).&para;<br>The legislative background of §48 focused primarily on&para;<br>the interstate market for “crush videos.” According to the&para;<br>House Committee Report on the bill, such videos feature&para;<br>the intentional torture and killing of helpless animals,&para;<br>including cats, dogs, monkeys, mice, and hamsters. H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 106–397, p. 2 (1999) (hereinafter H. R.

Stevens ran a business,&para;<br>“Dogs of Velvet and Steel,” and an associated Web site,&para;<br>through which he sold videos of pit bulls engaging in&para;<br>dogfights and attacking other animals. Among these&para;<br>videos were Japan Pit Fights and Pick-A-Winna: A Pit&para;<br>Bull Documentary, which include contemporary footage of&para;<br>dogfights in Japan (where such conduct is allegedly legal)&para;<br>as well as footage of American dogfights from the 1960’s&para;<br>and 1970’s.2 A third video, Catch Dogs and Country Liv&para;<br>ing, depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar, as well&para;<br>as a “gruesome” scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic&para;<br>farm pig. 533 F. 3d 218, 221 (CA3 2008) (en banc).

It went on to hold that §48 is not sub&para;<br>stantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause suffi&para;<br>ciently narrows the statute to constitutional applications.&para;<br>Id., at 71a–75a. The jury convicted Stevens on all counts,&para;<br>and the District Court sentenced him to three concurrent&para;<br>sentences of 37 months’ imprisonment, followed by three&para;<br>years of supervised release. App. 37.&para;<br>The en banc Third Circuit, over a three-judge dissent,&para;<br>declared §48 facially unconstitutional and vacated Ste&para;<br>vens’s conviction. 533 F. 3d 218. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>first held that §48 regulates speech that is protected by&para;<br>the First Amendment. The Court declined to recognize a&para;<br>new category of unprotected speech for depictions of ani&para;<br>mal cruelty, id., at 224, and n. 6, and rejected the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s analogy between animal cruelty depictions and&para;<br>child pornography, id., at 224–232.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals then held that §48 could not sur&para;<br>vive strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of pro&para;<br>tected speech. Id., at 232. It found that the statute lacked&para;<br>a compelling government interest and was neither nar&para;<br>rowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least&para;<br>restrictive means of doing so. Id., at 232–235. It therefore&para;<br>held §48 facially invalid.&para;<br>In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that&para;<br>§48 “might also be unconstitutionally overbroad,” because&para;<br>it “potentially covers a great deal of constitutionally pro&para;<br>tected speech” and “sweeps [too] widely” to be limited only&para;<br>by prosecutorial discretion.

We&para;<br>disagree.&para;<br>The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall&para;<br>make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” “[A]s a&para;<br>general matter, the First Amendment means that gov&para;<br>ernment has no power to restrict expression because of its&para;<br>message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”&para;<br>Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564,&para;<br>573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 48&para;<br>explicitly regulates expression based on content: The&para;<br>statute restricts “visual [and] auditory depiction[s],” such&para;<br>as photographs, videos, or sound recordings, depending on&para;<br>whether they depict conduct in which a living animal is&para;<br>intentionally harmed. As such, §48 is “ ‘presumptively&para;<br>invalid,’ and the Government bears the burden to rebut&para;<br>that presumption.” United States v. Playboy Entertain&para;<br>ment Group, Inc., 529 U.

The claim is not just that Congress may&para;<br>regulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the First&para;<br>Amendment, but that these depictions are outside the&para;<br>reach of that Amendment altogether—that they fall into a&para;<br>“ ‘First Amendment Free Zone.’ ”&para;<br>Board of Airport&para;<br>Comm’rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S.&para;<br>569, 574 (1987).&para;<br>As the Government notes, the prohibition of animal&para;<br>cruelty itself has a long history in American law, starting&para;<br>with the early settlement of the Colonies. Reply Brief 12,&para;<br>n. 8; see, e.g., The Body of Liberties §92 (Mass. Bay Colony&para;<br>1641), reprinted in American Historical Documents 1000–&para;<br>1904, 43 Harvard Classics 66, 79 (C.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the First Amendment’s protection without any long-settled&para;<br>tradition of subjecting that speech to regulation. Instead,&para;<br>the Government points to Congress’s “ ‘legislative judg&para;<br>ment that . . . depictions of animals being intentionally&para;<br>tortured and killed [are] of such minimal redeeming value&para;<br>as to render [them] unworthy of First Amendment protec&para;<br>tion,’ ” Brief for United States 23 (quoting 533 F. 3d, at 243&para;<br>(Cowen, J., dissenting)), and asks the Court to uphold the&para;<br>ban on the same basis. The Government thus proposes&para;<br>that a claim of categorical exclusion should be considered&para;<br>under a simple balancing test: “Whether a given category&para;<br>of speech enjoys First Amendment protection depends&para;<br>upon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech&para;<br>against its societal costs.” Brief for United States 8; see&para;<br>also id., at 12.&para;<br>As a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage,&para;<br>that sentence is startling and dangerous. The First&para;<br>Amendment’s guarantee of free speech does not extend&para;<br>only to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balanc&para;<br>ing of relative social costs and benefits.&para;<br>The First&para;<br>Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American&para;<br>people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Govern&para;<br>ment outweigh the costs. Our Constitution forecloses any&para;<br>attempt to revise that judgment simply on the basis that&para;<br>some speech is not worth it. The Constitution is not a&para;<br>document “prescribing limits, and declaring that those&para;<br>limits may be passed at pleasure.” Marbury v. Madison, 1&para;<br>Cranch 137, 178 (1803).&para;<br>To be fair to the Government, its view did not emerge&para;<br>from a vacuum. As the Government correctly notes, this&para;<br>Court has often described historically unprotected catego&para;<br>ries of speech as being “ ‘of such slight social value as a&para;<br>step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from&para;<br>them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order&para;<br>and morality.’ ” R.

STEVENS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>747 (1982), we noted that within these categories of unpro&para;<br>tected speech, “the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly&para;<br>outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that&para;<br>no process of case-by-case adjudication is required,” be&para;<br>cause “the balance of competing interests is clearly&para;<br>struck,” id., at 763–764. The Government derives its&para;<br>proposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.&para;<br>See Brief for United States 12–13.&para;<br>But such descriptions are just that—descriptive. They&para;<br>do not set forth a test that may be applied as a general&para;<br>matter to permit the Government to imprison any speaker&para;<br>so long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary,&para;<br>or so long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts&para;<br>in a statute’s favor.&para;<br>When we have identified categories of speech as fully&para;<br>outside the protection of the First Amendment, it has not&para;<br>been on the basis of a simple cost-benefit analysis. In&para;<br>Ferber, for example, we classified child pornography as&para;<br>such a category, 458 U. S., at 763. We noted that the&para;<br>State of New York had a compelling interest in protecting&para;<br>children from abuse, and that the value of using children&para;<br>in these works (as opposed to simulated conduct or adult&para;<br>actors) was de minimis. Id., at 756–757, 762. But our&para;<br>decision did not rest on this “balance of competing inter&para;<br>ests” alone. Id., at 764. We made clear that Ferber pre&para;<br>sented a special case: The market for child pornography&para;<br>was “intrinsically related” to the underlying abuse, and&para;<br>was therefore “an integral part of the production of such&para;<br>materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.” Id.,&para;<br>at 759, 761. As we noted, “ ‘[i]t rarely has been suggested&para;<br>that the constitutional freedom for speech and press ex&para;<br>tends its immunity to speech or writing used as an inte&para;<br>gral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal stat&para;<br>ute.’ ” Id., at 761–762 (quoting Giboney, supra, at 498).&para;<br>Ferber thus grounded its analysis in a previously recog&para;<br>nized, long-established category of unprotected speech,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and our subsequent decisions have shared this under&para;<br>standing. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 110 (1990)&para;<br>(describing Ferber as finding “persuasive” the argument&para;<br>that the advertising and sale of child pornography was “an&para;<br>integral part” of its unlawful production (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted)); Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,&para;<br>535 U. S. 234, 249–250 (2002) (noting that distribution&para;<br>and sale “were intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of&para;<br>children,” giving the speech at issue “a proximate link to&para;<br>the crime from which it came” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)).&para;<br>Our decisions in Ferber and other cases cannot be taken&para;<br>as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new&para;<br>categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amend&para;<br>ment. Maybe there are some categories of speech that&para;<br>have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been&para;<br>specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.&para;<br>But if so, there is no evidence that “depictions of animal&para;<br>cruelty” is among them. We need not foreclose the future&para;<br>recognition of such additional categories to reject the&para;<br>Government’s highly manipulable balancing test as a&para;<br>means of identifying them.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Because we decline to carve out from the First Amend&para;<br>ment any novel exception for §48, we review Stevens’s&para;<br>First Amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Stevens challenged §48 on its face, arguing that any&para;<br>conviction secured under the statute would be unconstitu&para;<br>tional. The court below decided the case on that basis, 533&para;<br>F. 3d, at 231, n. 13, and we granted the Solicitor General’s&para;<br>petition for certiorari to determine “whether 18 U. S. C. 48&para;<br>is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the&para;<br>First Amendment,” Pet. for Cert. i.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have&para;<br>to establish “that no set of circumstances exists under&para;<br>which [§48] would be valid,” United States v. Salerno, 481&para;<br>U. S. 739, 745 (1987), or that the statute lacks any “plainly&para;<br>legitimate sweep,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.&para;<br>702, 740, n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg&para;<br>ments) (internal quotation marks omitted). Which stan&para;<br>dard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that&para;<br>we need not and do not address, and neither Salerno nor&para;<br>Glucksberg is a speech case. Here the Government asserts&para;<br>that Stevens cannot prevail because §48 is plainly legiti&para;<br>mate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depic&para;<br>tions. Deciding this case through a traditional facial&para;<br>analysis would require us to resolve whether these appli&para;<br>cations of §48 are in fact consistent with the Constitution.&para;<br>In the First Amendment context, however, this Court&para;<br>recognizes “a second type of facial challenge,” whereby a&para;<br>law may be invalidated as overbroad if “a substantial&para;<br>number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in&para;<br>relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” Wash&para;<br>ington State Grange v. Washington State Republican&para;<br>Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Stevens argues that §48 applies to com&para;<br>mon depictions of ordinary and lawful activities, and that&para;<br>these depictions constitute the vast majority of materials&para;<br>subject to the statute. Brief for Respondent 22–25. The&para;<br>Government makes no effort to defend such a broad ban as&para;<br>constitutional. Instead, the Government’s entire defense&para;<br>of §48 rests on interpreting the statute as narrowly lim&para;<br>ited to specific types of “extreme” material. Brief for&para;<br>United States 8. As the parties have presented the issue,&para;<br>therefore, the constitutionality of §48 hinges on how&para;<br>broadly it is construed. It is to that question that we now&para;<br>turn.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent contends that because there has not been a ruling on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008). Because §48&para;<br>is a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a state&para;<br>court’s authority to interpret its own law.&para;<br>We read §48 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming&para;<br>breadth. To begin with, the text of the statute’s ban on a&para;<br>“depiction of animal cruelty” nowhere requires that the&para;<br>depicted conduct be cruel. That text applies to “any . . .&para;<br>depiction” in which “a living animal is intentionally&para;<br>maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.”&para;<br>§48(c)(1). “[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey&para;<br>cruelty, but “wounded” or “killed” do not suggest any such&para;<br>limitation.&para;<br>The Government contends that the terms in the defini&para;<br>tion should be read to require the additional element of&para;<br>“accompanying acts of cruelty.” Reply Brief 6; see also Tr.&para;<br>of Oral Arg. 17–19. (The dissent hinges on the same&para;<br>——————&para;<br>the validity of the statute as applied to Stevens, our consideration of his&para;<br>facial overbreadth claim is premature. Post, at 1, and n. 1, 2–3 (opinion&para;<br>of ALITO, J.). Whether or not that conclusion follows, here no as-applied&para;<br>claim has been preserved. Neither court below construed Stevens’s&para;<br>briefs as adequately developing a separate attack on a defined subset of&para;<br>the statute’s applications (say, dogfighting videos). See 533 F. 3d 218,&para;<br>231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc) (“Stevens brings a facial challenge to&para;<br>the statute”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, 74a.

See post, at 1, n. 1. Stevens’s constitutional&para;<br>argument is a general one. And unlike the challengers in Washington&para;<br>State Grange, Stevens does not “rest on factual assumptions . . . that&para;<br>can be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge.” 552&para;<br>U.

The Government bases&para;<br>this argument on the definiendum, “depiction of animal&para;<br>cruelty,” cf. Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), and&para;<br>on “ ‘the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis.’ ” Reply&para;<br>Brief 7 (quoting Williams, 553 U. S., at 294). As that&para;<br>canon recognizes, an ambiguous term may be “given more&para;<br>precise content by the neighboring words with which it is&para;<br>associated.” Ibid. Likewise, an unclear definitional&para;<br>phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined, see&para;<br>Leocal, supra, at 11 (interpreting a “ ‘substantial risk’ ” of&para;<br>the “us[e]” of “physical force” as part of the definition of&para;<br>“ ‘crime of violence’ ”).&para;<br>But the phrase “wounded . . . or killed” at issue here&para;<br>contains little ambiguity. The Government’s opening brief&para;<br>properly applies the ordinary meaning of these words,&para;<br>stating for example that to “ ‘kill’ is ‘to deprive of life.’ ”&para;<br>Brief for United States 14 (quoting Webster’s Third New&para;<br>International Dictionary 1242 (1993)). We agree that&para;<br>“wounded” and “killed” should be read according to their&para;<br>ordinary meaning. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast&para;<br>Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004).&para;<br>Nothing about that meaning requires cruelty.&para;<br>While not requiring cruelty, §48 does require that the&para;<br>depicted conduct be “illegal.” But this requirement does&para;<br>not limit §48 along the lines the Government suggests.&para;<br>There are myriad federal and state laws concerning the&para;<br>proper treatment of animals, but many of them are not&para;<br>designed to guard against animal cruelty. Protections of&para;<br>endangered species, for example, restrict even the humane&para;<br>“wound[ing] or kill[ing]” of “living animal[s].” §48(c)(1).&para;<br>Livestock regulations are often designed to protect the&para;<br>health of human beings, and hunting and fishing rules&para;<br>(seasons, licensure, bag limits, weight requirements) can&para;<br>be designed to raise revenue, preserve animal populations,&para;<br>or prevent accidents. The text of §48(c) draws no distinc&para;<br>tion based on the reason the intentional killing of an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>animal is made illegal, and includes, for example, the&para;<br>humane slaughter of a stolen cow.4&para;<br>What is more, the application of §48 to depictions of&para;<br>illegal conduct extends to conduct that is illegal in only a&para;<br>single jurisdiction. Under subsection (c)(1), the depicted&para;<br>conduct need only be illegal in “the State in which the&para;<br>creation, sale, or possession takes place, regardless of&para;<br>whether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place in&para;<br>[that] State.” A depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs&para;<br>afoul of the ban if that depiction later finds its way into&para;<br>another State where the same conduct is unlawful. This&para;<br>provision greatly expands the scope of §48, because al&para;<br>though there may be “a broad societal consensus” against&para;<br>cruelty to animals, Brief for United States 2, there is&para;<br>substantial disagreement on what types of conduct are&para;<br>properly regarded as cruel. Both views about cruelty to&para;<br>animals and regulations having no connection to cruelty&para;<br>vary widely from place to place.&para;<br>In the District of Columbia, for example, all hunting is&para;<br>unlawful. D. C. Munic. Regs., tit. 19, §1560 (2009). Other&para;<br>jurisdictions permit or encourage hunting, and there is an&para;<br>enormous national market for hunting-related depictions&para;<br>in which a living animal is intentionally killed. Hunting&para;<br>periodicals have circulations in the hundreds of thousands&para;<br>or millions, see Mediaweek, Sept. 29, 2008, p. 28, and&para;<br>hunting television programs, videos, and Web sites are&para;<br>equally popular, see Brief for Professional Outdoor Media&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The citations in the dissent’s appendix are beside the point. The&para;<br>cited statutes stand for the proposition that hunting is not covered by&para;<br>animal cruelty laws. But the reach of §48 is, as we have explained, not&para;<br>restricted to depictions of conduct that violates a law specifically&para;<br>directed at animal cruelty. It simply requires that the depicted conduct&para;<br>be “illegal.” §48(c)(1). The Government implicitly admits as much,&para;<br>arguing that “instructional videos for hunting” are saved by the stat&para;<br>ute’s exceptions clause, not that they fall outside the prohibition in the&para;<br>first place. Reply Brief 6.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Association et al. as Amici Curiae 9–10. The demand for&para;<br>hunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand for&para;<br>crush videos or animal fighting depictions by several&para;<br>orders of magnitude. Compare ibid. and Brief for National&para;<br>Rifle Association of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 12&para;<br>(hereinafter NRA Brief) (estimating that hunting maga&para;<br>zines alone account for $135 million in annual retail sales)&para;<br>with Brief for United States 43–44, 46 (suggesting $1&para;<br>million in crush video sales per year, and noting that&para;<br>Stevens earned $57,000 from his videos). Nonetheless,&para;<br>because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its&para;<br>laws to the rest of the country, §48(a) extends to any&para;<br>magazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as&para;<br>that depiction is sold within the Nation’s Capital.&para;<br>Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewil&para;<br>dering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate juris&para;<br>dictions. Some States permit hunting with crossbows, Ga.&para;<br>Code Ann. §27–3–4(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. §29.1–&para;<br>519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it,&para;<br>Ore. Admin.

An otherwise-lawful image of any of&para;<br>these practices, if sold or possessed for commercial gain&para;<br>within a State that happens to forbid the practice, falls&para;<br>within the prohibition of §48(a).&para;<br>C&para;<br>The only thing standing between defendants who sell&para;<br>such depictions and five years in federal prison—other&para;<br>than the mercy of a prosecutor—is the statute’s exceptions&para;<br>clause. Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition “any&para;<br>depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific,&para;<br>educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.” The&para;<br>Government argues that this clause substantially narrows&para;<br>the statute’s reach: News reports about animal cruelty&para;<br>have “journalistic” value; pictures of bullfights in Spain&para;<br>have “historical” value; and instructional hunting videos&para;<br>have “educational” value. Reply Brief 6. Thus, the Gov&para;<br>ernment argues, §48 reaches only crush videos, depictions&para;<br>of animal fighting (other than Spanish bullfighting, see&para;<br>Brief for United States 47–48), and perhaps other depic&para;<br>tions of “extreme acts of animal cruelty.” Id., at 41.&para;<br>The Government’s attempt to narrow the statutory ban,&para;<br>however, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the&para;<br>exceptions clause.

The Government offers no principled explanation why&para;<br>these depictions of hunting or depictions of Spanish bull&para;<br>fights would be inherently valuable while those of Japa&para;<br>nese dogfights are not. The dissent contends that hunting&para;<br>depictions must have serious value because hunting has&para;<br>serious value, in a way that dogfights presumably do not.&para;<br>Post, at 6–8. But §48(b) addresses the value of the depic&para;<br>tions, not of the underlying activity. There is simply no&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

California,&para;<br>413 U. S. 15 (1973), which excepted from its definition of&para;<br>obscenity any material with “serious literary, artistic,&para;<br>political, or scientific value,” id., at 24. See Reply Brief 8,&para;<br>9, and n. 5. According to the Government, this incorpora&para;<br>tion of the Miller standard into §48 is therefore surely&para;<br>enough to answer any First Amendment objection. Reply&para;<br>Brief 8–9.&para;<br>In Miller we held that “serious” value shields depictions&para;<br>of sex from regulation as obscenity. 413 U.

Wisconsin,&para;<br>408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972) (per curiam)). We did not, how&para;<br>ever, determine that serious value could be used as a&para;<br>general precondition to protecting other types of speech in&para;<br>the first place. Most of what we say to one another lacks&para;<br>“religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,&para;<br>historical, or artistic value” (let alone serious value), but it&para;<br>is still sheltered from government regulation. Even&para;<br>“ ‘[w]holly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection&para;<br>of free speech as fully as do Keats’ poems or Donne’s ser&para;<br>mons.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U.

The Government hits this theme hard, invoking its&para;<br>prosecutorial discretion several times. See id., at 6–7, 10,&para;<br>and n. 6, 19, 22. But the First Amendment protects&para;<br>against the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy&para;<br>of noblesse oblige.

When this legislation was enacted, the Execu&para;<br>tive Branch announced that it would interpret §48 as&para;<br>covering only depictions “of wanton cruelty to animals&para;<br>designed to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.” See&para;<br>Statement by President William J. Clinton upon Signing&para;<br>H. R. 1887, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2557 (Dec. 9,&para;<br>1999). No one suggests that the videos in this case fit that&para;<br>description. The Government’s assurance that it will&para;<br>apply §48 far more restrictively than its language provides&para;<br>is pertinent only as an implicit acknowledgment of the&para;<br>potential constitutional problems with a more natural&para;<br>reading.&para;<br>Nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that&para;<br>“ambiguous statutory language [should] be construed to&para;<br>avoid serious constitutional doubts.” FCC v.

STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>The overbreadth doctrine “strike[s] a balance between&para;<br>competing social costs.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292.&para;<br>Specifically, the doctrine seeks to balance the “harmful&para;<br>effects” of “invalidating a law that in some of its applica&para;<br>tions is perfectly constitutional” against the possibility&para;<br>that “the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law [will]&para;<br>dete[r] people from engaging in constitutionally protected&para;<br>speech.” Ibid. “In order to maintain an appropriate bal&para;<br>ance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a&para;<br>statute’s overbreadth be substantial, not only in an abso&para;<br>lute sense, but also relative to the statute’s plainly legiti&para;<br>mate sweep.” Ibid.&para;<br>In determining whether a statute’s overbreadth is sub&para;<br>stantial, we consider a statute’s application to real-world&para;<br>conduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See, e.g., id., at 301–&para;<br>302; see also Ferber, supra, at 773; Houston v. Hill, 482&para;<br>U. S. 451, 466–467 (1987). Accordingly, we have repeat&para;<br>edly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the&para;<br>burden of demonstrating, “from the text of [the law] and&para;<br>from actual fact,” that substantial overbreadth exists.&para;<br>Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.

Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of&para;<br>argument that §48 is valid as applied to these depictions,&para;<br>but the Court concludes that §48 reaches too much pro&para;<br>tected speech to survive. The Court relies primarily on&para;<br>depictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depic&para;<br>tions of animals being slaughtered for food. I address the&para;<br>Court’s examples below.&para;<br>A&para;<br>I turn first to depictions of hunting. As the Court notes,&para;<br>photographs and videos of hunters shooting game are&para;<br>common. See ante, at 13–14. But hunting is legal in all&para;<br>50 States, and §48 applies only to a depiction of conduct&para;<br>that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is&para;<br>created, sold, or possessed. §§48(a), (c). Therefore, in all&para;<br>50 States, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the&para;<br>vast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls&para;<br>outside §48’s reach.&para;<br>Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that&para;<br>§48 prohibits the sale or possession in the District of Co&para;<br>lumbia of any depiction of hunting because the District—&para;<br>undoubtedly because of its urban character—does not&para;<br>permit hunting within its boundaries. Ante, at 13. The&para;<br>Court also suggests that, because some States prohibit a&para;<br>particular type of hunting (e.g., hunting with a crossbow&para;<br>or “canned” hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal&para;<br>(e.g., the “sharp-tailed grouse”), §48 makes it illegal for&para;<br>persons in such States to sell or possess for sale a depic&para;<br>tion of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in&para;<br>which the hunting took place. See ante, at 12–14.&para;<br>The Court’s interpretation is seriously flawed. “When a&para;<br>federal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged&para;<br>as overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute to&para;<br>avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to&para;<br>such a limiting construction.” Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>n. 24. See also Williams, supra, at 307 (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>concurring) (“[T]o the extent the statutory text alone is&para;<br>unclear, our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes&para;<br>it especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to&para;<br>ascertain the intent of its drafters”).&para;<br>Applying this canon, I would hold that §48 does not&para;<br>apply to depictions of hunting. First, because §48 targets&para;<br>depictions of “animal cruelty,” I would interpret that&para;<br>term to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal&para;<br>cruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law, not&para;<br>to depictions of acts that happen to be illegal for reasons&para;<br>having nothing to do with the prevention of animal cru&para;<br>elty. See ante, at 12–13 (interpreting “[t]he text of §48(c)”&para;<br>to ban a depiction of “the humane slaughter of a stolen&para;<br>cow”). Virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty&para;<br>either expressly define the term “animal” to exclude&para;<br>wildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activi&para;<br>ties,3 so the statutory prohibition set forth in §48(a) may&para;<br>reasonably be interpreted not to reach most if not all&para;<br>hunting depictions.&para;<br>Second, even if the hunting of wild animals were other&para;<br>wise covered by §48(a), I would hold that hunting depic&para;<br>tions fall within the exception in §48(b) for depictions that&para;<br>have “serious” (i.e., not “trifling”4) “scientific,” “educa&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See Appendix, infra (citing statutes); B.

While there are certainly&para;<br>those who find hunting objectionable, the predominant&para;<br>view in this country has long been that hunting serves&para;<br>many important values, and it is clear that Congress&para;<br>shares that view. Since 1972, when Congress called upon&para;<br>the President to designate a National Hunting and Fish&para;<br>ing Day, see S. J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.

Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama&para;<br>2009) (hunting and fishing are “ageless pursuits” that&para;<br>promote “the conservation and restoration of numerous&para;<br>species and their natural habitats”); Presidential Procla&para;<br>mation No. 8295, 73 Fed. Reg. 57233 (Pres.

Reg. 59539 (Pres. Bush 2004) (hunting&para;<br>and fishing are “an important part of our Nation’s heri&para;<br>tage,” and “America’s hunters and anglers represent the&para;<br>great spirit of our country”); Presidential Proclamation No.&para;<br>4682, 44 Fed.

STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>contribution to the exchange of ideas. Accordingly, I&para;<br>would hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within&para;<br>the exception set out in §48(b).&para;<br>I do not have the slightest doubt that Congress, in en&para;<br>acting §48, had no intention of restricting the creation,&para;<br>sale, or possession of depictions of hunting. Proponents of&para;<br>the law made this point clearly. See H. R. Rep. No. 106–&para;<br>397, p. 8 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (“[D]epictions of&para;<br>ordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within&para;<br>the scope of the statute”); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct. 19,&para;<br>1999) (Rep. McCollum) (“[T]he sale of depictions of legal&para;<br>activities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal&para;<br>under this bill”); id., at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (“[L]et us be&para;<br>clear as to what this legislation will not do. It will in no&para;<br>way prohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos”). Indeed,&para;<br>even opponents acknowledged that §48 was not intended&para;<br>to reach ordinary hunting depictions. See ibid. (Rep.&para;<br>Scott); id., at 25897 (Rep. Paul).&para;<br>For these reasons, I am convinced that §48 has no appli&para;<br>cation to depictions of hunting. But even if §48 did imper&para;<br>missibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunt&para;<br>ing in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in&para;<br>Oregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Vir&para;<br>ginia or the sale in Washington State of the hunting of a&para;<br>sharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see ante, at 14), those iso&para;<br>lated applications would hardly show that §48 bans a&para;<br>substantial amount of protected speech.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Although the Court’s overbreadth analysis rests primar&para;<br>ily on the proposition that §48 substantially restricts the&para;<br>sale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court cites&para;<br>a few additional examples, including depictions of methods&para;<br>of slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows. See&para;<br>ante, at 14–15.&para;<br>Such examples do not show that the statute is substan&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tially overbroad, for two reasons. First, as explained&para;<br>above, §48 can reasonably be construed to apply only to&para;<br>depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by&para;<br>applicable state or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do&para;<br>not ban the sorts of acts depicted in the Court’s hypotheti&para;<br>cals. See, e.g., Idaho Code §25–3514 (Lexis 2000) (“No&para;<br>part of this chapter [prohibiting cruelty to animals] shall&para;<br>be construed as interfering with or allowing interference&para;<br>with . . . [t]he humane slaughter of any animal normally&para;<br>and commonly raised as food or for production of fiber . . .&para;<br>[or] [n]ormal or accepted practices of . . . animal hus&para;<br>bandry”); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21–4310(b) (2007) (“The provi&para;<br>sions of this section shall not apply to . . . with respect to&para;<br>farm animals, normal or accepted practices of animal&para;<br>husbandry, including the normal and accepted practices&para;<br>for the slaughter of such animals”); Md. Crim. Law Code&para;<br>Ann. §10–603 (Lexis 2002) (sections prohibiting animal&para;<br>cruelty “do not apply to . . . customary and normal veteri&para;<br>nary and agricultural husbandry practices, including&para;<br>dehorning, castration, tail docking, and limit feeding”).&para;<br>Second, nothing in the record suggests that any one has&para;<br>ever created, sold, or possessed for sale a depiction of the&para;<br>slaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of&para;<br>dairy cows that would not easily qualify under the excep&para;<br>tion set out in §48(b). Depictions created to show proper&para;<br>methods of slaughter or tail-docking would presumably&para;<br>have serious “educational” value, and depictions created to&para;<br>focus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or&para;<br>otherwise objectionable would presumably have either&para;<br>serious “educational” or “journalistic” value or both. In&para;<br>short, the Court’s examples of depictions involving the&para;<br>docking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that&para;<br>§48 suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial&para;<br>overbreadth.&para;<br>The Court notes, finally, that cockfighting, which is&para;<br>illegal in all States, is still legal in Puerto Rico, ante, at 15,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

All 50 States&para;<br>and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes prohib&para;<br>iting animal cruelty. See 533 F. 3d, at 223, and n. 4 (citing&para;<br>statutes); H. R. Rep., at 3. But before the enactment of&para;<br>§48, the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was&para;<br>nearly impossible to prosecute. These videos, which “ often&para;<br>appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,” id., at&para;<br>2, were made in secret, generally without a live audience,&para;<br>and “the faces of the women inflicting the torture in the&para;<br>material often were not shown, nor could the location of&para;<br>the place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date&para;<br>of the activity be ascertained from the depiction.” Id., at 3.&para;<br>Thus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to&para;<br>identify the parties responsible for the torture. See Pun&para;<br>ishing Depictions of Animal Cruelty and the Federal&para;<br>Prisoner Health Care Co-Payment Act of 1999: Hearing&para;<br>before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Commit&para;<br>tee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1 (1999)&para;<br>(hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty). In&para;<br>the rare instances in which it was possible to identify and&para;<br>find the perpetrators, they “often were able to successfully&para;<br>assert as a defense that the State could not prove its&para;<br>jurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that&para;<br>the actions depicted took place within the time specified in&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the State statute of limitations.” H. R. Rep., at 3; see also&para;<br>145 Cong. Rec. 25896 (Rep. Gallegly) (“[I]t is the prosecu&para;<br>tors from around this country, Federal prosecutors as well&para;<br>as State prosecutors, that have made an appeal to us for&para;<br>this”); Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty 21 (“If the&para;<br>production of the video is not discovered during the actual&para;<br>filming, then prosecution for the offense is virtually im&para;<br>possible without a cooperative eyewitness to the filming or&para;<br>an undercover police operation”); id., at 34–35 (discussing&para;<br>example of case in which state prosecutor “had the defen&para;<br>dant telling us he produced these videos,” but where&para;<br>prosecution was not possible because the State could not&para;<br>prove where or when the tape was made).&para;<br>In light of the practical problems thwarting the prosecu&para;<br>tion of the creators of crush videos under state animal&para;<br>cruelty laws, Congress concluded that the only effective&para;<br>way of stopping the underlying criminal conduct was to&para;<br>prohibit the commercial exploitation of the videos of that&para;<br>conduct. And Congress’ strategy appears to have been&para;<br>vindicated. We are told that “[b]y 2007, sponsors of §48&para;<br>declared the crush video industry dead. Even overseas&para;<br>Websites shut down in the wake of §48. Now, after the&para;<br>Third Circuit’s decision [facially invalidating the statute],&para;<br>crush videos are already back online.” Humane Society&para;<br>Brief 5 (citations omitted).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it&para;<br>most certainly does not protect violent criminal conduct,&para;<br>even if engaged in for expressive purposes. Crush videos&para;<br>present a highly unusual free speech issue because they&para;<br>are so closely linked with violent criminal conduct. The&para;<br>videos record the commission of violent criminal acts, and&para;<br>it appears that these crimes are committed for the sole&para;<br>purpose of creating the videos. In addition, as noted&para;<br>above, Congress was presented with compelling evidence&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that the only way of preventing these crimes was to target&para;<br>the sale of the videos. Under these circumstances, I can&para;<br>not believe that the First Amendment commands Con&para;<br>gress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to&para;<br>continue.&para;<br>The most relevant of our prior decisions is Ferber, 458&para;<br>U. S. 747, which concerned child pornography. The Court&para;<br>there held that child pornography is not protected speech,&para;<br>and I believe that Ferber’s reasoning dictates a similar&para;<br>conclusion here.&para;<br>In Ferber, an important factor—I would say the most&para;<br>important factor—was that child pornography involves the&para;<br>commission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury&para;<br>to the “children who are made to engage in sexual conduct&para;<br>for commercial purposes.’ ” Id., at 753 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The Ferber Court repeatedly described&para;<br>the production of child pornography as child “abuse,”&para;<br>“molestation,” or “exploitation.” See, e.g., id., at 749 (“In&para;<br>recent years, the exploitive use of children in the produc&para;<br>tion of pornography has become a serious national prob&para;<br>lem”); id., at 758, n. 9 (“Sexual molestation by adults is&para;<br>often involved in the production of child sexual perform&para;<br>ances”). As later noted in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coali&para;<br>tion, 535 U. S. 234, 249 (2002), in Ferber “[t]he production&para;<br>of the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.”&para;<br>See also 535 U.S., at 250 (Ferber involved “speech that&para;<br>itself is the record of sexual abuse”).&para;<br>Second, Ferber emphasized the fact that these underly&para;<br>ing crimes could not be effectively combated without tar&para;<br>geting the distribution of child pornography. As the Court&para;<br>put it, “the distribution network for child pornography&para;<br>must be closed if the production of material which requires&para;<br>the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively&para;<br>controlled.” 458 U. S., at 759. The Court added:&para;<br>“[T]here is no serious contention that the legislature&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if not&para;<br>impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pur&para;<br>suing only those who produce the photographs and&para;<br>movies. . . . The most expeditious if not the only prac&para;<br>tical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the&para;<br>market for this material by imposing severe criminal&para;<br>penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise&para;<br>promoting the product.” Id., at 759–760.&para;<br>See also id., at 761 (“The advertising and selling of child&para;<br>pornography provide an economic motive for and are thus&para;<br>an integral part of the production of such materials”).&para;<br>Third, the Ferber Court noted that the value of child&para;<br>pornography “is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis,”&para;<br>and that any such value was “overwhelmingly out&para;<br>weigh[ed]” by “the evil to be restricted.” Id., at 762–763.&para;<br>All three of these characteristics are shared by §48, as&para;<br>applied to crush videos. First, the conduct depicted in&para;<br>crush videos is criminal in every State and the District of&para;<br>Columbia. Thus, any crush video made in this country&para;<br>records the actual commission of a criminal act that in&para;<br>flicts severe physical injury and excruciating pain and&para;<br>ultimately results in death. Those who record the under&para;<br>lying criminal acts are likely to be criminally culpable,&para;<br>either as aiders and abettors or conspirators. And in the&para;<br>tight and secretive market for these videos, some who sell&para;<br>the videos or possess them with the intent to make a profit&para;<br>may be similarly culpable. (For example, in some cases,&para;<br>crush videos were commissioned by purchasers who speci&para;<br>fied the details of the acts that they wanted to see per&para;<br>formed. See H. R. Rep., at 3; Hearing on Depictions of&para;<br>Animal Cruelty 27). To the extent that §48 reaches such&para;<br>persons, it surely does not violate the First Amendment.&para;<br>Second, the criminal acts shown in crush videos cannot&para;<br>be prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited by&para;<br>§48—the creation, sale, and possession for sale of depic&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tions of animal torture with the intention of realizing a&para;<br>commercial profit. The evidence presented to Congress&para;<br>posed a stark choice: Either ban the commercial exploita&para;<br>tion of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the crimi&para;<br>nal acts that they record. Faced with this evidence, Con&para;<br>gress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video&para;<br>market.&para;<br>Finally, the harm caused by the underlying crimes&para;<br>vastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions&para;<br>might conceivably be thought to possess. Section 48&para;<br>reaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture;&para;<br>the statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to&para;<br>simulations. And, unlike the child pornography statute in&para;<br>Ferber or its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. §2252, §48(b)&para;<br>provides an exception for depictions having any “serious&para;<br>religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,&para;<br>historical, or artistic value.”&para;<br>It must be acknowledged that §48 differs from a child&para;<br>pornography law in an important respect: preventing the&para;<br>abuse of children is certainly much more important than&para;<br>preventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.&para;<br>It was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals&para;<br>concluded that Ferber did not support the constitutionality&para;<br>of §48. 533 F. 3d, at 228 (“Preventing cruelty to animals,&para;<br>although an exceedingly worthy goal, simply does not&para;<br>implicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting&para;<br>children from physical and psychological harm”). But&para;<br>while protecting children is unquestionably more impor&para;<br>tant than protecting animals, the Government also has a&para;<br>compelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in&para;<br>crush videos.&para;<br>The animals used in crush videos are living creatures&para;<br>that experience excruciating pain. Our society has long&para;<br>banned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the coun&para;<br>try. In Ferber, the Court noted that “virtually all of the&para;<br>States and the United States have passed legislation&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>proscribing the production of or otherwise combating ‘child&para;<br>pornography,’ ” and the Court declined to “second-guess&para;<br>[that] legislative judgment.”6 458 U. S., at 758. Here,&para;<br>likewise, the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing&para;<br>the legislative judgment about the importance of prevent&para;<br>ing cruelty to animals.&para;<br>Section 48’s ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps&para;<br>to enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals&para;<br>do not profit from their crimes. See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897&para;<br>(Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (“The state has an interest&para;<br>in enforcing its existing laws. Right now, the laws are not&para;<br>only being violated, but people are making huge profits&para;<br>from promoting the violations”); id., at 10685 (May 24,&para;<br>1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (explaining that he introduced the&para;<br>House version of the bill because “criminals should not&para;<br>profit from [their] illegal acts”). We have already judged&para;<br>that taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.&para;<br>See Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State&para;<br>Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 119 (1991).&para;<br>In short, Ferber is the case that sheds the most light on&para;<br>the constitutionality of Congress’ effort to halt the produc&para;<br>tion of crush videos. Applying the principles set forth in&para;<br>Ferber, I would hold that crush videos are not protected by&para;<br>the First Amendment.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Application of the Ferber framework also supports the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 In other cases, we have regarded evidence of a national consensus as&para;<br>proof that a particular government interest is compelling. See Simon &amp;&para;<br>Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S.&para;<br>105, 118 (1991) (State’s compelling interest “in ensuring that victims of&para;<br>crime are compensated by those who harm them” evidenced by fact that&para;<br>“[e]very State has a body of tort law serving exactly this interest”);&para;<br>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 624–625 (1984) (citing&para;<br>state laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations as&para;<br>evidence of the compelling governmental interest in ensuring equal&para;<br>access).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

(For convenience, I will focus on videos of&para;<br>dogfights, which appear to be the most common type of&para;<br>animal fight videos.)&para;<br>First, such depictions, like crush videos, record the&para;<br>actual commission of a crime involving deadly violence.&para;<br>Dogfights are illegal in every State and the District of&para;<br>Columbia, Brief for United States 26–27, and n. 8 (citing&para;<br>statutes), and under federal law constitute a felony pun&para;<br>ishable by imprisonment for up to five years, 7 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2156 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 18 U. S. C. §49 (2006&para;<br>ed., Supp. II).&para;<br>Second, Congress had an ample basis for concluding&para;<br>that the crimes depicted in these videos cannot be effec&para;<br>tively controlled without targeting the videos. Like crush&para;<br>videos and child pornography, dogfight videos are very&para;<br>often produced as part of a “low-profile, clandestine indus&para;<br>try,” and “the need to market the resulting products re&para;<br>quires a visible apparatus of distribution.” Ferber, 458&para;<br>U. S., at 760. In such circumstances, Congress had rea&para;<br>sonable grounds for concluding that it would be “difficult,&para;<br>if not impossible, to halt” the underlying exploitation of&para;<br>dogs by pursuing only those who stage the fights. Id., at&para;<br>759–760; see 533 F. 3d, at 246 (Cowen, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(citing evidence establishing “the existence of a lucrative&para;<br>market for depictions of animal cruelty,” including videos&para;<br>of dogfights, “which in turn provides a powerful incentive&para;<br>to individuals to create [such] videos”).&para;<br>The commercial trade in videos of dogfights is “an inte&para;<br>gral part of the production of such materials,” Ferber,&para;<br>supra, at 761.&para;<br>As the Humane Society explains,&para;<br>“[v]ideotapes memorializing dogfights are integral to the&para;<br>success of this criminal industry” for a variety of reasons.&para;<br>Humane Society Brief 5. For one thing, some dogfighting&para;<br>videos are made “solely for the purpose of selling the video&para;<br>(and not for a live audience).” Id., at 9. In addition, those&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. STEVENS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>who stage dogfights profit not just from the sale of the&para;<br>videos themselves, but from the gambling revenue they&para;<br>take in from the fights; the videos “encourage [such] gam&para;<br>bling activity because they allow those reluctant to attend&para;<br>actual fights for fear of prosecution to still bet on the&para;<br>outcome.” Ibid.; accord, Brief for Center on the Admini&para;<br>stration of Criminal Law as Amicus Curiae 12 (“Selling&para;<br>videos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying crimes&para;<br>by providing a market for dogfighting while allowing&para;<br>actual dogfights to remain underground”); ibid. (“These&para;<br>videos are part of a ‘lucrative market’ where videos are&para;<br>produced by a ‘bare-boned, clandestine staff’ in order to&para;<br>permit the actual location of dogfights and the perpetra&para;<br>tors of these underlying criminal activities to go unde&para;<br>tected” (citations omitted)). Moreover, “[v]ideo documen&para;<br>tation is vital to the criminal enterprise because it&para;<br>provides proof of a dog’s fighting prowess—proof de&para;<br>manded by potential buyers and critical to the under&para;<br>ground market.” Humane Society Brief 9. Such re&para;<br>cordings may also serve as “ ‘training’ videos for other fight&para;<br>organizers.” Ibid. In short, because videos depicting live&para;<br>dogfights are essential to the success of the criminal dog&para;<br>fighting subculture, the commercial sale of such videos&para;<br>helps to fuel the market for, and thus to perpetuate the&para;<br>perpetration of, the criminal conduct depicted in them.&para;<br>Third, depictions of dogfights that fall within §48’s reach&para;<br>have by definition no appreciable social value. As noted,&para;<br>§48(b) exempts depictions having any appreciable social&para;<br>value, and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live&para;<br>fight in a larger work that aims at communicating an idea&para;<br>or a message with a modicum of social value would not run&para;<br>afoul of the statute.&para;<br>Finally, the harm caused by the underlying criminal&para;<br>acts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the depic&para;<br>tions might be thought to possess. As the Humane Society&para;<br>explains:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“The abused dogs used in fights endure physical tor&para;<br>ture and emotional manipulation throughout their&para;<br>lives to predispose them to violence; common tactics&para;<br>include feeding the animals hot peppers and gunpow&para;<br>der, prodding them with sticks, and electrocution.&para;<br>Dogs are conditioned never to give up a fight, even if&para;<br>they will be gravely hurt or killed. As a result, dog&para;<br>fights inflict horrific injuries on the participating&para;<br>animals, including lacerations, ripped ears, puncture&para;<br>wounds and broken bones.

As&para;<br>with crush videos, moreover, the statutory ban on com&para;<br>merce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compel&para;<br>ling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the&para;<br>Nation’s criminal laws and preventing criminals from&para;<br>profiting from their illegal activities. See Ferber, supra, at&para;<br>757–758; Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.
