KHOLI&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–868.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 29, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts&para;<br>of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.&para;<br>His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996. In ad&para;<br>dition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions. One, a&para;<br>May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Su&para;<br>perior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied. The State&para;<br>Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998. The second, a state&para;<br>postconviction relief motion, was also denied. That decision was af&para;<br>firmed on December 14, 2006. When respondent filed his federal ha&para;<br>beas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years. The&para;<br>Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gen&para;<br>erally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the&para;<br>date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A),&para;<br>but “a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other col&para;<br>lateral review” tolls that period, §2244(d)(2). Respondent’s postcon&para;<br>viction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule&para;<br>35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas peti&para;<br>tion to be timely. The District Court dismissed the petition as un&para;<br>timely, adopting the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that the Rule 35&para;<br>motion was not “a properly filed application for . . . collateral review”&para;<br>under §2244(d)(2). The First Circuit reversed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The phrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial re&para;<br>view of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.&para;<br>Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(a) The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a&para;<br>motion to reduce sentence is an “application for State post-conviction&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>or other collateral review” turns on the meaning of “collateral re&para;<br>view,” but they disagree about what that meaning should be. Pp.&para;<br>4–5.&para;<br>(b) Because “collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, the&para;<br>Court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase. By&para;<br>definition, “collateral” describes something that is “indirect,” not di&para;<br>rect. 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473. This suggests that “collat&para;<br>eral” review is not part of direct review. This conclusion is supported&para;<br>by the definition of the related phrase “collateral attack” and by the&para;<br>Court’s prior use of the term “collateral” to describe proceedings that&para;<br>are separate from the direct review process. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(c) The term “review” is best understood as a “judicial reexami&para;<br>nation.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1944. Pp.&para;<br>7–8.&para;<br>2. A Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is&para;<br>an application for “collateral review” that triggers AEDPA’s tolling&para;<br>provision. Pp. 8–15.&para;<br>(a) Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal&para;<br>Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing&para;<br>Reform Act of 1984. The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as&para;<br>relevant here, to “reduce any sentence,” and it is generally addressed&para;<br>to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice. Under the limited&para;<br>review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justice’s de&para;<br>cision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly&para;<br>disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>(b) Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduc&para;<br>tion proceeding is “collateral.” The parties agree that the motion is&para;<br>not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower&para;<br>federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old&para;<br>Federal Rule 35 as invoking a “collateral” remedy. Therefore, it is&para;<br>not difficult to conclude that Rhode Island’s motion to reduce sen&para;<br>tence is “collateral.” A Rule 35 motion also calls for “review” of the&para;<br>sentence within §2244(d)(2)’s meaning. The decision to reduce a sen&para;<br>tence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine&para;<br>whether a more lenient sentence is proper. The trial justice is guided&para;<br>by several sentencing factors in making that decision. And those fac&para;<br>tors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial&para;<br>justice’s justifications for the sentence. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(c) Rhode Island’s arguments in support of its opposing view that&para;<br>“collateral review” includes only “legal” challenges to a conviction or&para;<br>sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence re&para;<br>duction, are unpersuasive. Nor does “collateral review” turn on&para;<br>whether a motion is part of the same criminal case. Pp. 11–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>582 F. 3d 147, affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

S. C. §2244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether&para;<br>a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls&para;<br>the limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil&para;<br>Kholi’s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the&para;<br>phrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial&para;<br>review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of&para;<br>direct review. Because the parties agree that a motion to&para;<br>reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the&para;<br>direct review process, we hold that respondent’s motion&para;<br>tolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal&para;<br>habeas petition was therefore timely.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Superior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault,&para;<br>and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life im&para;<br>prisonment. Respondent raised various challenges to&para;<br>his conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of&para;<br>Rhode Island affirmed his conviction. See State v. Kholi,&para;<br>672 A. 2d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respon&para;<br>dent’s conviction became final on direct review when his&para;<br>time expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in&para;<br>this Court. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4; Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 3, n. 1; 582 F. 3d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generally&para;<br>Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 6). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court’s Rules&para;<br>13.1, 13.3, 30.1.&para;<br>In addition to taking a direct appeal, respondent filed&para;<br>two state motions that are relevant to our decision. The&para;<br>first, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sen&para;<br>tence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court&para;<br>Rules of Criminal Procedure.1 App. 8. In that motion,&para;<br>respondent asked the trial court to “reconsider its prior&para;<br>determination” and “order that his life sentences run&para;<br>concurrently.” State v. Kholi, 706 A. 2d 1326 (R. I. 1998)&para;<br>(order). Concluding that “the sentence imposed was ap&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 This Rule provides in relevant part:&para;<br>“The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.

On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court&para;<br>affirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the&para;<br>sentence. Id., at 1326–1327.&para;<br>On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pend&para;<br>ing, respondent also filed an application for state postcon&para;<br>viction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws 10–9.1–1 et seq. (Lexis&para;<br>1997) (titled “Post Conviction Remedy”), which challenged&para;<br>his conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well,&para;<br>and the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on&para;<br>December 14, 2006. See Kholi v. Wall, 911 A. 2d 262, 263–&para;<br>264 (R. I. 2006).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Dis&para;<br>trict of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App. 3. By&para;<br>that time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.&para;<br>AEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be&para;<br>filed within one year of the date on which the judgment&para;<br>became final by the conclusion of direct review. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is&para;<br>tolled during the pendency of “a properly filed application&para;<br>for State post-conviction or other collateral review with&para;<br>respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.” §2244(d)(2).&para;<br>There is no dispute that respondent’s application for&para;<br>postconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over&para;<br>nine years—from May 23, 1997, through December 14,&para;<br>2006. 582 F. 3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that&para;<br>stretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the&para;<br>period between the conclusion of direct review and the&para;<br>filing of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.&para;<br>Thus, in order for respondent’s petition to be timely, the&para;<br>Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the&para;<br>tolling provision.&para;<br>Respondent’s federal habeas petition was referred to a&para;<br>Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion&para;<br>was not a “ ‘properly filed application for post-conviction or&para;<br>other collateral review’ ” under §2244(d)(2) because it was&para;<br>“a ‘plea of leniency,’ and not a motion challenging the legal&para;<br>sufficiency of his sentence.” No. CA 07–346S, 2008 WL&para;<br>60194, *4 (R. I., Jan. 3, 2008). The District Court adopted&para;<br>the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation and&para;<br>therefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as un&para;<br>timely. See id., at *1. On appeal, the First Circuit re&para;<br>versed. 582 F. 3d 147.&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question&para;<br>whether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of&para;<br>limitation under §2244(d)(2).2 We granted certiorari to&para;<br>answer this question with respect to a motion to reduce&para;<br>sentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>AEDPA establishes a 1-year period of limitation for a&para;<br>state prisoner to file a federal application for a writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus. §2244(d)(1). This period runs “from the&para;<br>latest of” four specified dates, including “the date on which&para;<br>the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct&para;<br>review or the expiration of the time for seeking such re&para;<br>view.” §2244(d)(1)(A); see also Jimenez, supra, at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 6) (explaining when “the conclusion of direct review&para;<br>occurs”).

The question&para;<br>in this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence&para;<br>under Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is an “application for State&para;<br>post-conviction or other collateral review.”&para;<br>The parties agree that the answer to this question turns&para;<br>on the meaning of the phrase “collateral review,” see Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12–13, but they&para;<br>disagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island&para;<br>argues that “collateral review” includes only “legal” chal&para;<br>lenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes mo&para;<br>tions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respon&para;<br>dent, on the other hand, maintains that “collateral review”&para;<br>is “review other than review of a judgment in the direct&para;<br>appeal process” and thus includes motions to reduce sen&para;<br>tence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respon&para;<br>dent’s understanding of “collateral review.”&para;<br>B&para;<br>“Collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, and we&para;<br>have never provided a comprehensive definition of that&para;<br>term. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 175–178&para;<br>(2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary&para;<br>understanding of the phrase “collateral review.” See&para;<br>Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) (“We give the&para;<br>words of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common&para;<br>meaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to&para;<br>bear some different import” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)); see also Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 219&para;<br>(2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word&para;<br>“pending” in §2244(d)(2)).&para;<br>The term “collateral,” in its “customary and preferred&para;<br>sense,” Williams, supra, at 431, means “[l]ying aside from&para;<br>the main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . .&para;<br>subordinate, indirect,” 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473&para;<br>(2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Webster’s) (“accompanying as . . . secondary,” “indirect,” or&para;<br>“ancillary”). By definition, something that is “collateral”&para;<br>is “indirect,” not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that&para;<br>“collateral” review is review that is “[l]ying aside from the&para;<br>main” review, i.e., that is not part of direct review. See&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>The definition of the related phrase “collateral attack”&para;<br>points in the same direction. A “collateral attack” is “[a]n&para;<br>attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct&para;<br>appeal.” Black’s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (em&para;<br>phasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code §10.73.090(2) (2008)&para;<br>(defining “collateral attack” as “any form of postconviction&para;<br>relief other than a direct appeal”). This usage buttresses&para;<br>the conclusion that “collateral review” means a form of&para;<br>review that is not part of the direct appeal process.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Our prior usage of the term “collateral” also supports&para;<br>this understanding. We have previously described a vari&para;<br>ety of proceedings as “collateral,” and all of these proceed&para;<br>ings share the characteristic that we have identified, i.e.,&para;<br>they stand apart from the process of direct review.&para;<br>For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus&para;<br>is a form of collateral review. We have used the terms&para;<br>habeas corpus and “collateral review” interchangeably,&para;<br>see, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482–483 (1986),&para;<br>and it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas&para;<br>corpus toll the limitation period, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, 544&para;<br>U. S. 269, 272 (2005) (“[T]he 1-year statute of limitations&para;<br>. . . was tolled while Rhines’ state habeas corpus petition&para;<br>was pending”).&para;<br>We have also described coram nobis as a means of “col&para;<br>lateral attack,” see, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346&para;<br>U. S. 502, 510–511 (1954) (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted), and we have used the term “collateral” to describe&para;<br>proceedings under 28 U. S. C. §2255 and a prior version of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In&para;<br>United States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220 (1960), we distin&para;<br>guished between the process of direct appeal and “a num&para;<br>ber of collateral remedies,” including Federal Rule 35&para;<br>motions, §2255 motions, and coram nobis. Id., at 230,&para;<br>n. 14. Similarly, in Bartone v. United States, 375 U. S. 52&para;<br>(1963) (per curiam), we drew a distinction between a&para;<br>“[d]irect attack” on a criminal judgment and “collateral&para;<br>proceedings,” such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and §2255&para;<br>proceedings. Id., at 53–54.&para;<br>All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions&para;<br>as “collateral” are separate from the direct review process,&para;<br>and thus our prior usage of the term “collateral” but&para;<br>tresses the conclusion that “collateral review” means a&para;<br>form of review that is not direct.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Of course, to trigger the tolling provision, a “collateral”&para;<br>proceeding must also involve a form of “review,” but the&para;<br>meaning of that term seems clear. “Review” is best under&para;<br>stood as an “act of inspecting or examining” or a “judicial&para;<br>reexamination.” Webster’s 1944; see also Black’s, supra,&para;<br>at 1434 (“[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a&para;<br>subject or thing”); 13 OED 831 (“[t]o submit (a decree, act,&para;<br>etc.) to examination or revision”). We thus agree with the&para;<br>First Circuit that “ ‘review’ commonly denotes ‘a looking&para;<br>over or examination with a view to amendment or im&para;<br>provement.’ ” 582 F. 3d, at 153 (quoting Webster’s 1944&para;<br>(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, “collateral review” of a&para;<br>judgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of&para;<br>a judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct&para;<br>review process.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We now apply this definition of “collateral review” to a&para;<br>Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure&para;<br>is much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Pro&para;<br>cedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the&para;<br>federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulga&para;<br>tion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See State v.&para;<br>Byrnes, 456 A. 2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) (per curiam); Re&para;<br>porter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.&para;<br>35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the&para;<br>Rhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to&para;<br>provide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court “may”&para;<br>“correct an illegal sentence,” “correct a sentence imposed&para;<br>in an illegal manner,” and “reduce any sentence.” R. I.&para;<br>Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n. 1, supra. In this&para;<br>case, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,&para;<br>which permits a trial justice to decide “ ‘ “on reflection or&para;<br>on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence&para;<br>originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.” ’ ”&para;<br>State v. Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting&para;<br>State v. Mendoza, 958 A. 2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see&para;<br>also Reporter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.&para;<br>Proc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., at 620–621. Rhode Island&para;<br>courts have, at times, referred to such a motion as a “ ‘plea&para;<br>for leniency.’ ” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Mendoza,&para;<br>supra, at 1161).&para;<br>A Rule 35 motion is made in the Superior Court, and it&para;<br>is generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced&para;<br>the defendant. Byrnes, supra, at 745. The Rhode Island&para;<br>Supreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce&para;<br>sentence is “ ‘addressed to the sound discretion of the trial&para;<br>justice’ ” and that appellate review of the trial justice’s&para;<br>decision is limited. Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Men&para;<br>doza, supra, at 1161). An appellate court may neverthe&para;<br>less disturb the trial justice’s decision “when the trial&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

I. 2009);&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ruffner, su&para;<br>pra, at 867 (asking whether trial justice “abuse[d] his&para;<br>discretion”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>With these principles in mind, we consider whether&para;<br>Rhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an&para;<br>application for “collateral review.”&para;<br>The first—and the critical—question is whether a Rhode&para;<br>Island Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is “collat&para;<br>eral.” Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a&para;<br>motion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover,&para;<br>we have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence&para;<br>under old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce&para;<br>dure as invoking a “collateral” remedy, see Robinson,&para;<br>supra, at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to&para;<br>reduce sentence is “substantially similar” to former Fed&para;<br>eral Rule 35, Byrnes, supra, at 744. Lower courts have&para;<br>also referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction mo&para;<br>tions as “collateral.” See, e.g., Fernandez v. United States,&para;<br>941 F. 2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (“Fernandez initiated a&para;<br>collateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion&para;<br>to reduce his sentence” under the old Federal Rule). We&para;<br>thus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island&para;<br>sentence reduction proceeding is “collateral.”3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 We&para;<br>&para;<br>can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceed&para;<br>ing is in fact part of direct review under §2244(d)(1) because, according&para;<br>to the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to&para;<br>their sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35&para;<br>motion. See, e.g., State v. Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (“It is&para;<br>well settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence&para;<br>must begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion . . . . [W]e will not&para;<br>consider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode&para;<br>Island law “collateral,” but it also undoubtedly calls for&para;<br>“review” of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sen&para;<br>tence, while largely within the discretion of the trial jus&para;<br>tice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to&para;<br>determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.4&para;<br>When ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by&para;<br>several factors, including “(1) the severity of the crime, (2)&para;<br>the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment&para;<br>background, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the&para;<br>element of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness&para;<br>of the punishment.” State v. Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135, 138&para;<br>(R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted); see also Ruffner, supra, at 867; Coleman, supra, at&para;<br>655. On appeal from a trial justice’s decision on a motion&para;<br>to reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island&para;<br>evaluates the trial justice’s justifications in light of the&para;<br>relevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sen&para;<br>tence is “without justification” and “grossly disparate from&para;<br>other sentences.” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted).5 This process surely qualifies as&para;<br>——————&para;<br>extraordinary circumstances exist” (internal quotation marks omitted));&para;<br>State v. McManus, 990 A. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to con&para;<br>sider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because “[t]o&para;<br>challenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to&para;<br>reduce in accordance with Rule 35”); see also Jimenez v. Quarterman,&para;<br>555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6–7). That issue has not been&para;<br>briefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as&para;<br>to the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a&para;<br>Rhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of&para;<br>this case would not change: Respondent’s habeas petition still would be&para;<br>timely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until&para;<br>after the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.&para;<br>4 A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction&para;<br>discovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are&para;<br>not direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide&para;<br>a state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.&para;<br>5 E.g., State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 657 (R. I. 2009) (“Given these&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting&para;<br>AEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this&para;<br>usage and must have intended the phrase to carry this&para;<br>narrow meaning.&para;<br>This argument reads far too much into these prior refer&para;<br>ences to “collateral review.” While our opinions have used&para;<br>the phrase “collateral review” to refer to proceedings that&para;<br>challenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have&para;<br>never suggested that the phrase may properly be used to&para;<br>describe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode&para;<br>Island overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce&para;<br>sentence as “collateral.” E.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230,&para;<br>n. 14; Fernandez, supra, at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>factors, and the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning&para;<br>in sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discre&para;<br>tion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences”); State v.&para;<br>Ferrara, 818 A. 2d 642, 645 (R.

I. 2001) (order) (“Based upon [the court’s] review of&para;<br>the record,” the sentence “was not excessive and was justified under the&para;<br>circumstances,” namely, “the abhorrent conduct of [the] defendant” and&para;<br>“the permissible penalty range” under the statute); State v. Mollicone,&para;<br>746 A. 2d 135, 138 (R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (“[T]he trial justice was&para;<br>aware of these factors and applied them correctly”).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>State Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook §§1:2,&para;<br>1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce&para;<br>sentence as a “collateral” or “postconviction” remedy).&para;<br>In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several&para;<br>other AEDPA provisions use the term “collateral review”&para;<br>to refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the&para;<br>lawfulness of a state-court judgment, see 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§2244(b)(2)(A), (d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),6 and Rhode&para;<br>Island reasons that the phrase “collateral review” in&para;<br>§2244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature.&para;<br>This argument has the same flaw as the argument just&para;<br>discussed. Just because the phrase “collateral review”&para;<br>encompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of&para;<br>a prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings&para;<br>may not also be described as involving “collateral review.”&para;<br>Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the&para;<br>tolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust&para;<br>state remedies and that this purpose is not served when a&para;<br>prisoner’s state application merely seeks sentencing leni&para;<br>ency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas&para;<br>petition. This argument is based on an excessively narrow&para;<br>understanding of §2244(d)(2)’s role.&para;<br>It is certainly true that a purpose—and perhaps the&para;<br>chief purpose—of tolling under §2244(d)(2) is to permit&para;<br>the exhaustion of state remedies, see Duncan, 533 U. S., at&para;<br>178–179, but that is not §2244(d)(2)’s only role. The toll&para;<br>ing provision “provides a powerful incentive for litigants to&para;<br>exhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in&para;<br>the lower federal courts.” Id., at 180 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Tolling the limitation period for all “collateral review”&para;<br>motions provides both litigants and States with an oppor&para;<br>tunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially&para;<br>obviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 All of these provisions refer to a new rule of constitutional law made&para;<br>retroactively applicable by this Court to “cases on collateral review.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>If, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law&para;<br>grounds, there may be no need for federal habeas. The&para;<br>same dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to&para;<br>motions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judg&para;<br>ment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the&para;<br>need for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even&para;<br>obviated, and this furthers principles of “comity, finality,&para;<br>and federalism.” Williams, 529 U. S., at 436.&para;<br>Rhode Island’s interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would also&para;<br>greatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.&para;<br>Rhode Island would require those courts to separate mo&para;<br>tions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that&para;<br>challenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that&para;<br>merely ask for leniency. But this taxonomy is problem&para;<br>atic. Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to&para;<br>exercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence&para;<br>from within a prescribed range, it does not necessarily&para;<br>follow that the judge’s choice is insulated from challenge&para;<br>on legal grounds. “[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a&para;<br>court’s ‘inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment&para;<br>is to be guided by sound legal principles.’ ” Albemarle&para;<br>Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 416 (1975) (quoting&para;<br>United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC&para;<br>Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). If the law of a jurisdiction&para;<br>provides criteria to guide a trial judge’s exercise of sen&para;<br>tencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue&para;<br>that a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria. In that&para;<br>sense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to&para;<br>sentencing law. See, e.g., Ruffner, 5 A. 3d, at 867 (“A trial&para;<br>justice considers a number of factors when determining a&para;<br>fair sentence[,] including the defendant’s potential for&para;<br>rehabilitation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice&para;<br>did not consider defendant’s participation in rehabilitative&para;<br>programs” (citations omitted)). We do not think that&para;<br>§2244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to&para;<br>draw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island’s&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>WALL v. KHOLI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>interpretation would demand.&para;<br>We also reject the argument that the meaning of the&para;<br>phrase “collateral review” should turn on whether the&para;<br>motion or application that triggers that review is cap&para;<br>tioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate pro&para;<br>ceeding. See Walkowiak v. Haines, 272 F. 3d 234, 237&para;<br>(CA4 2001). This interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would&para;<br>produce confusion and inconsistency.&para;<br>For one thing, some “collateral” proceedings are often&para;<br>regarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for&para;<br>example, that a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the crimi&para;<br>nal case and not . . . a separate case and record, the begin&para;<br>ning of a separate civil proceeding.” Morgan, 346 U. S., at&para;<br>505, n. 4; see also United States v. Denedo, 556 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“[A]n application for the writ is&para;<br>properly viewed as a belated extension of the original&para;<br>proceeding during which the error allegedly transpired”).&para;<br>But we have nonetheless suggested that coram nobis is a&para;<br>means of “collateral attack.” Morgan, supra, at 510–511&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robinson, 361&para;<br>U. S., at 230, n. 14. Similarly, a motion under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the&para;<br>original criminal case and is typically referred to the judge&para;<br>who originally presided over the challenged proceedings,&para;<br>see §2255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that&para;<br>§2255 proceedings are “collateral,” see, e.g., Massaro v.&para;<br>United States, 538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003) (describing §2255&para;<br>proceedings as “collateral”); Daniels v. United States, 532&para;<br>U. S. 374, 379 (2001) (same).7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 In other contexts not relevant here, there has been some confusion&para;<br>over whether §2255 proceedings are civil or criminal in nature. See,&para;<br>e.g., Postconviction Remedies §3:5, p. 251 (2010) (“[T]here is a dispute&para;<br>over whether the [§2255] motion initiates an independent civil action&para;<br>or, instead, is merely a further step in the criminal prosecution”); 3 C.&para;<br>Wright &amp; S.

Given the States’ “different forms&para;<br>of collateral review,” Duncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the ap&para;<br>plication of AEDPA’s tolling provision should not turn&para;<br>on such formalities. See ibid. (“Congress may have re&para;<br>frained from exclusive reliance on the term ‘post-conviction’&para;<br>so as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies&para;<br>to all types of state collateral review available after a&para;<br>conviction”).&para;<br>We thus define “collateral review” according to its ordi&para;<br>nary meaning: It refers to judicial review that occurs in a&para;<br>proceeding outside of the direct review process.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals&para;<br>is affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.
