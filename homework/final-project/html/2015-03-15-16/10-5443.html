UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–5443. Argued March 29, 2011—Decided May 26, 2011&para;<br>While preparing to rob a bank, petitioner Fowler and others were dis&para;<br>covered by a local police officer, whom Fowler killed. Fowler was&para;<br>convicted of violating the federal witness tampering statute, which&para;<br>makes it a crime “to kill another person, with intent to . . . prevent&para;<br>the communication by any person to a [Federal] law enforcement offi&para;<br>cer” of “information relating to the . . . possible commission of a Fed&para;<br>eral offense,” 18 U. S. C. §1512(a)(1)(C). Rejecting Fowler’s argument&para;<br>that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had killed the offi&para;<br>cer intending to prevent him from communicating with a federal offi&para;<br>cer, the Eleventh Circuit held that a showing of a possible or poten&para;<br>tial communication to federal authorities was sufficient.&para;<br>Held: In such circumstances, the Government must establish a&para;<br>§1512(a)(1)(C) violation by showing there was a reasonable likelihood&para;<br>that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal of&para;<br>ficer. Pp. 3–10.&para;<br>(a) In a §1512(a)(1)(C) prosecution, “no state of mind need be&para;<br>proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law enforcement&para;<br>officer is an . . . employee of the Federal Government,” §1512(g)(2).&para;<br>Thus, the Government must prove (1) a killing, (2) committed with a&para;<br>particular intent, namely, an intent (a) to “prevent” a “communica&para;<br>tion” (b) about “the commission or possible commission of a Federal&para;<br>offense” (c) to a federal “law enforcement officer.” P. 3.&para;<br>(b) Nothing in §1512(a)(1)(C)’s language limits it to instances in&para;<br>which the defendant has some identifiable law enforcement officers&para;<br>particularly in mind. Any such limitation would conflict with the&para;<br>statute’s basic purpose. Witness tampering may prove more serious&para;<br>(and more effective) when the crime takes place before the victim has&para;<br>engaged in any communication at all with officers—at a time when&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the precise communication and nature of the officer who may receive&para;<br>it are not yet known. Hence, the statute covers a defendant, like pe&para;<br>titioner, who kills with intent to prevent communication with any&para;<br>and all officers. The Court must consequently decide what, if any&para;<br>thing, the Government must show about the likelihood of a hypo&para;<br>thetical communication with a federal officer where the defendant did&para;<br>not think specifically about any particular communication or its re&para;<br>cipient. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(c) To determine what the Government must prove in such in&para;<br>stances, the Court looks to the dictionary definition of the statutory&para;<br>word “prevent,” which means rendering an “intended,” “possible,” or&para;<br>“likely” event impractical or impossible by anticipatory action. No&para;<br>one suggests that the word “intended” sets forth the appropriate&para;<br>standard here. The Government and the Eleventh Circuit would rest&para;<br>their standard on the word “possible.” But that standard would&para;<br>eliminate the independent force of the statutory “federal officer” re&para;<br>quirement, and would extend the statute beyond its intended, basi&para;<br>cally federal, scope. Fashioning a standard based on the word&para;<br>“likely” is consistent with the statute’s language and objectives.&para;<br>Thus, where the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent&para;<br>communication with law enforcement officers generally, that intent&para;<br>includes an intent to prevent communications with federal officers&para;<br>only if there is a reasonable likelihood under the circumstances that,&para;<br>in the absence of the killing, at least one of the relevant communica&para;<br>tions would have been made to a federal officer. The Government&para;<br>need not show that such a communication, had it occurred, would&para;<br>have been federal beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even that it is more&para;<br>likely than not. But it must show that the likelihood of communica&para;<br>tion to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or hypo&para;<br>thetical. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(d) Because Fowler’s argument that the evidence is insufficient to&para;<br>satisfy a “reasonable likelihood” standard was not raised at trial, the&para;<br>lower courts must determine whether, and how, the standard applies&para;<br>in this case.

The question before us concerns what, if any&para;<br>thing, the Government must show beyond this broad in&para;<br>definite intent in order to show that the defendant more&para;<br>particularly intended to prevent communication with&para;<br>federal officers as well.

They met in a cemetery, put on black clothes and&para;<br>gloves, began to drink and use drugs, and discussed the&para;<br>proposed crime. Shortly before daybreak a local police&para;<br>officer, Todd Horner, came upon the group. He pulled out&para;<br>his gun and asked the men to identify themselves.

And&para;<br>he shot and killed Horner.&para;<br>Federal authorities charged Fowler with violating the&para;<br>federal witness tampering statute. He was convicted. On&para;<br>appeal, Fowler argued that the evidence was insufficient&para;<br>to show that he had killed Horner intending to prevent&para;<br>Horner from communicating with a federal officer.

S. C. §1512(a)(1)(C).&para;<br>A related subsection says that in a prosecution for this&para;<br>offense&para;<br>“no state of mind need be proved with respect to&para;<br>the circumstance . . . that the judge is a judge of the&para;<br>United States or that the law enforcement officer is an&para;<br>officer or employee of the Federal Government . . . .”&para;<br>§1512(g)(2).&para;<br>This language makes clear that in a prosecution the Gov&para;<br>ernment must prove (1) a killing or attempted killing, (2)&para;<br>committed with a particular intent, namely, an intent (a)&para;<br>to “prevent” a “communication” (b) about “the commission&para;<br>or possible commission of a Federal offense” (c) to a federal&para;<br>“law enforcement officer or judge.”&para;<br>The question here is how this language applies when a&para;<br>defendant (1) kills a victim, (2) with an intent (a) to pre&para;<br>vent a communication (b) about the commission or possi&para;<br>ble commission of a federal offense but (c) to law enforce&para;<br>ment officers in general rather than to some specific law&para;<br>enforcement officer or set of officers which the defendant&para;<br>has in mind. This kind of circumstance is not necessarily&para;<br>rare, as the facts here illustrate. Fowler (we here assume)&para;<br>was not thinking specifically about federal officers, but he&para;<br>would nonetheless have wanted to prevent communication&para;<br>with federal officers from taking place (had he considered&para;<br>the matter).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>When the defendant has in mind a particular individual&para;<br>or a particular set of individuals with whom he fears the&para;<br>victim might communicate, the application of the statute&para;<br>is relatively clear. For instance, if a defendant kills a&para;<br>victim with the intent of preventing the victim from com&para;<br>municating with a particular individual, say John Smith,&para;<br>who the defendant knows is a federal law enforcement&para;<br>officer, the statute fits like a glove. If a defendant kills a&para;<br>victim with the intent of preventing the victim from com&para;<br>municating with Sam Smith, who is in fact (but who the&para;<br>defendant does not know is) a federal law enforcement&para;<br>officer, the statute still fits, for it specifically says that “no&para;<br>state of mind need be proved” with respect to this last&para;<br>mentioned circumstance.&para;<br>Nothing in the statutory language, however, limits it to&para;<br>these kinds of instances, instances in which the defendant&para;<br>has some law enforcement officer or set of officers, or other&para;<br>identifiable individuals, particularly in mind. Moreover,&para;<br>any such limitation would conflict with the statute’s basic&para;<br>purpose. Witness tampering may prove more serious (and&para;<br>more effective) when the crime takes place before the&para;<br>victim has engaged in any communication at all with law&para;<br>enforcement officers—at a time when the precise commu&para;<br>nication and nature of the officer who may receive it are&para;<br>not yet known. Cf., e.g., S. Rep. No. 97–532, pp. 14, 15&para;<br>(1982) (statute applies “to offenses against witnesses,&para;<br>victims, or informants which occur before the witness&para;<br>testifies or the informant communicates with law en&para;<br>forcement officers”); id., at 19 (witness “[i]ntimidation&para;<br>offenses are particularly insidious and do violence to&para;<br>traditional notions of justice because no one can be con&para;<br>victed of a crime which is not reported. [Section 1512]&para;<br>reaches intimidation offenses committed before a crime is&para;<br>reported to the appropriate authorities”). Hence the stat&para;<br>ute covers a defendant who kills with intent to prevent&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>communication with law enforcement officers generally&para;<br>(i.e., with any and all law enforcement officers). And we&para;<br>must consequently decide what, if anything, the Govern&para;<br>ment must show about the likelihood of a hypothetical&para;<br>communication with a federal law enforcement officer in&para;<br>circumstances where the defendant did not think specifi&para;<br>cally about any particular communication or its recipient.&para;<br>In these circumstances, the application of the statute is&para;<br>not as simple. We cannot determine whether the individ&para;<br>ual the defendant had in mind is in fact a federal officer,&para;<br>because the defendant did not have a particular individual&para;<br>in mind. And we cannot insist that the defendant have&para;<br>had some general thought about federal officers in mind&para;<br>because the statute says that “no state of mind need be&para;<br>proved” in respect to the federal nature of the communica&para;<br>tion’s recipient. §1512(g)(2). What, then, must the Gov&para;<br>ernment show to prove that such a defendant intended to&para;<br>prevent communications to federal officers?&para;<br>We begin with two basic propositions. First, in our&para;<br>view, the Government need not show beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt (or even that it is more likely than not) that the&para;<br>hypothetical communication would have been to a federal&para;<br>officer. No Circuit has adopted this interpretation, and no&para;<br>party argues for it here. But see post, at 1–2 (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment). And for good reason: The rele&para;<br>vant question concerns the defendant’s intent. The Gov&para;<br>ernment will already have shown beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt that the defendant possessed the relevant broad&para;<br>indefinite intent, namely, the intent to prevent the victim&para;<br>from communicating with (unspecified) law enforcement&para;<br>officers. And one can possess an intent (i.e., one can act in&para;<br>order to bring about a certain state of affairs) even if there&para;<br>is considerable doubt whether the event that the intent&para;<br>contemplates will in fact occur. One can, for example, put&para;<br>up shutters with the intent of protecting the furniture&para;<br>from hurricane damage even if there is considerable doubt&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that any hurricane will actually occur. One can drive to&para;<br>Fenway Park with the intent of seeing the Red Sox play&para;<br>that afternoon even if a mistake about the date means the&para;<br>stadium is empty. One can blow up a bridge with the&para;<br>intent of stopping an advancing army, even if the army&para;<br>advances regardless, along a different route. And, simi&para;<br>larly, a defendant can kill a victim with an intent to&para;<br>prevent the victim from communicating with federal law&para;<br>enforcement officers even if there is some considerable&para;<br>doubt that any such communication would otherwise have&para;<br>taken place.&para;<br>But, second, the Government must show more than&para;<br>the broad indefinite intent we have described, the intent&para;<br>to prevent communications to law enforcement officers in&para;<br>general. That is so for two separate reasons. For one&para;<br>thing, the statute speaks of an “intent to prevent” some&para;<br>thing. But (apart from mistakes, as in our Red Sox exam&para;<br>ple) one cannot act with an “intent to prevent” something&para;<br>that could not possibly have taken place regardless. We&para;<br>can speak of a Colorado trout fisherman who tries to&para;<br>prevent his trout stream from being invaded by pike or&para;<br>carp, but in ordinary circumstances we cannot speak&para;<br>about trying to prevent the stream’s invasion by whales.&para;<br>Indeed, the dictionary defines “prevent” as “to render (an&para;<br>intended, possible, or likely action or event) impractical&para;<br>or impossible by anticipatory action.” OED Online (Mar.&para;<br>2011) (emphasis added), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/&para;<br>151073?rskey=QWN6QB&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false (all&para;<br>Internet materials as visited May 23, 2011, and available&para;<br>in Clerk of Court’s case file).&para;<br>For another thing, to allow the Government to show no&para;<br>more than the broad indefinite intent we have described&para;<br>(the intent to prevent communications to law enforcement&para;<br>officers in general) would bring within the scope of this&para;<br>statute many instances of witness tampering in purely&para;<br>state investigations and proceedings, thus extending the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>scope of this federal statute well beyond the primarily&para;<br>federal area that Congress had in mind. See infra, at 8–9.&para;<br>For both these reasons, unlike the dissent, we cannot read&para;<br>the statute as intending to excuse the Government from&para;<br>proving something about the hypothetical communication&para;<br>with federal officers. The question remains, what is that&para;<br>something?&para;<br>IV&para;<br>We find possible answers to this question in the diction&para;<br>ary definition of the word “prevent.” As we have said, that&para;<br>word applies where a defendant, by “anticipatory action,”&para;<br>(here, killing a victim) intended “to render . . . impractical&para;<br>or impossible” an “action or event” (here, the victim’s&para;<br>communication with a federal law enforcement officer)&para;<br>which (1) was “intended,” (2) was “possible,” or (3) was&para;<br>“likely” to have otherwise occurred.&para;<br>No one suggests that the first word, the word “in&para;<br>tended,” sets forth the appropriate standard. That word in&para;<br>this context refers to the victim’s intent. That intent is&para;<br>often difficult to discern. Moreover, to require the Gov&para;<br>ernment to prove it would prevent the statute from apply&para;<br>ing where it is plain that federal officers would have&para;<br>been involved in investigating and prosecuting the offense&para;<br>(for instance, robbing the United States Bullion Depository&para;<br>at Fort Knox), but where the defendant killed the victim&para;<br>before the victim had decided to communicate to law&para;<br>enforcement officers. Congress, however, intended the&para;<br>statute to apply in these last-mentioned circumstances.&para;<br>See supra, at 4.&para;<br>The Government (and the Eleventh Circuit) would rest&para;<br>their standard on the second word, the word “possible.”&para;<br>See Brief for United States 10 (standard is “whether it&para;<br>was reasonably possible that at least one of the communi&para;<br>cations that the murder . . . was intended to prevent would&para;<br>have been with a federal law enforcement official”); 603&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>F. 3d, at 888 (requiring showing of a “possible or potential&para;<br>communication to federal authorities”). But, in our view,&para;<br>that standard is difficult to reconcile with the statute’s&para;<br>language and its intended, basically federal, scope. Cf.&para;<br>supra, at 6–7.&para;<br>Often, when a defendant acts in ways that violate state&para;<br>criminal law, some or all of those acts will violate federal&para;<br>criminal law as well. And where a federal crime is at&para;<br>issue, communication with federal law enforcement offi&para;<br>cers is almost always a possibility. Thus, to allow the&para;<br>Government to show only a mere possibility that a com&para;<br>munication would have been with federal officials is to&para;<br>permit the Government to show little more than the possi&para;<br>ble commission of a federal offense. (That is to say, the&para;<br>latter showing by itself would almost automatically show&para;<br>the statutorily necessary connection with a federal law&para;<br>enforcement officer.) The “possibility” standard would&para;<br>thereby weaken or eliminate the independent force of the&para;<br>separate statutory requirement that the defendant, in&para;<br>killing the victim, must intend to prevent communication&para;<br>with one who is “a law enforcement officer or judge of&para;<br>the United States.” 18 U. S. C. §1512(a)(1)(C) (emphasis&para;<br>added); see §1515(a)(4) (defining “law enforcement officer”&para;<br>as “an officer or employee of the Federal Government”&para;<br>(emphasis added)). Cf. Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167,&para;<br>174 (2001) (normally we must give effect “to every clause&para;<br>and word of a statute” (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted)); Ratzlaf v.

S. 135, 140–141&para;<br>(1994) (expressing particular reluctance to “treat statutory&para;<br>terms” as “surplusage” “when the words describe an ele&para;<br>ment of a criminal offense”).&para;<br>Moreover, because of the frequent overlap between state&para;<br>and federal crimes, the use of a standard based on the&para;<br>word “possible” would transform a federally oriented&para;<br>statute into a statute that would deal with crimes, investi&para;<br>gations, and witness tampering that, as a practical mat&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

We consequently hold that (in a case such as&para;<br>this one where the defendant does not have particular&para;<br>federal law enforcement officers in mind) the Government&para;<br>must show a reasonable likelihood that, had, e.g., the&para;<br>victim communicated with law enforcement officers, at&para;<br>least one relevant communication would have been made&para;<br>to a federal law enforcement officer. That is to say, where&para;<br>the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent&para;<br>communication with law enforcement officers generally,&para;<br>that intent includes an intent to prevent communications&para;<br>with federal law enforcement officers only if it is reasona&para;<br>bly likely under the circumstances that (in the absence of&para;<br>the killing) at least one of the relevant communications&para;<br>would have been made to a federal officer.&para;<br>The Government need not show that such a communica&para;<br>tion, had it occurred, would have been federal beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt, nor even that it is more likely than not.&para;<br>For, as we have said, one can act with an intent to prevent&para;<br>an event from occurring without it being true beyond a&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v.

S. C.&para;<br>§1512(a)(1)(C). In my view, the Government must prove&para;<br>that the defendant intended to prevent a communication&para;<br>which, had it been made, would beyond a reasonable doubt&para;<br>have been made to a federal law enforcement officer. The&para;<br>Court’s vague “reasonable likelihood” standard has no&para;<br>basis in the statutory text and will serve only to confuse&para;<br>judges and juries. Accordingly, although I agree the case&para;<br>should be remanded for the Eleventh Circuit to consider&para;<br>whether the objection to sufficiency of the evidence was&para;<br>preserved or whether the District Court committed plain&para;<br>error, I would hold that there was insufficient evidence to&para;<br>support Fowler’s conviction.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Section 1512(a)(1)(C) of Title 18 makes it a federal crime&para;<br>“to kill another person, with intent to . . . prevent the&para;<br>communication by any person to a law enforcement officer&para;<br>. . . of the United States of information relating to the&para;<br>commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.”&para;<br>Viewed in isolation, this provision contains an ambiguity:&para;<br>Does the mens rea of the statute include a specific intent&para;<br>to prevent communication to a law enforcement officer of&para;<br>the United States; or is it satisfied by the mere intent to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>prevent communication to a law enforcement officer who&para;<br>happens to be a law enforcement officer of the United&para;<br>States?&para;<br>Happily, a different statutory provision resolves this&para;<br>ambiguity. It states that “no state of mind need be proved&para;<br>with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law enforce&para;<br>ment officer is an officer or employee of the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment.” §1512(g)(2). This makes clear that the first&para;<br>possibility is wrong, and the second right. But removing&para;<br>the “federal officer” requirement as an element of the&para;<br>statute’s mens rea does not remove it as an element of the&para;<br>actus reus—that is, as an element of the facts that must be&para;<br>proved for conviction. It must be proved, and proved&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt, that the communication in&para;<br>tended to be prevented was communication to a federal&para;<br>officer. Thus, if a suspect in an investigation murders an&para;<br>informant to prevent him from talking to authorities, but&para;<br>is unaware that the informant was working for the FBI,&para;<br>the suspect would be guilty: He would have committed a&para;<br>murder with the intention of preventing the informant’s&para;<br>communication to authorities about his criminal activities,&para;<br>and the communication he sought to prevent would neces&para;<br>sarily have been to federal law enforcement. Likewise, a&para;<br>suspect would be guilty if he committed a murder to pre&para;<br>vent a witness from informing law enforcement that he&para;<br>lied on his federal income tax return: He sought to pre&para;<br>vent a communication that would have been made to&para;<br>federal officials, because they alone prosecute federal tax&para;<br>violations. But a suspect who commits a murder with the&para;<br>general intent of preventing law enforcement from learn&para;<br>ing about activities that violate both state and federal&para;<br>law would not be guilty, because the Government would&para;<br>be unable to prove that the communication he sought to&para;<br>prevent necessarily would have been to a federal official.&para;<br>Applying that standard, this is an easy case. There was&para;<br>evidence that Fowler murdered Officer Horner in order&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>to prevent him from communicating information about&para;<br>Fowler’s criminal activities. But the only evidence prof&para;<br>fered by the Government to establish that the communica&para;<br>tion would have been to a federal law enforcement agent&para;<br>was the fact that a different state police officer, four years&para;<br>later, contacted federal law enforcement about a robbery&para;<br>by Fowler’s confederate—and that only because the state&para;<br>law statute of limitations for the robbery had expired.&para;<br>That is not nearly enough to demonstrate Fowler’s guilt&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court gives the statute a broader reading than the&para;<br>one I ascribe. The Government can obtain a conviction, it&para;<br>says, so long as it can prove a “reasonable likelihood” that&para;<br>the communication would have been made to a federal&para;<br>law enforcement officer. I know of no precedent for using&para;<br>a “likelihood” standard rather than the “beyond a rea&para;<br>sonable doubt” standard for a finding of fact essential&para;<br>to a criminal conviction; and the justifications the Court&para;<br>presents for that course in the present case are not&para;<br>convincing.&para;<br>The Court maintains that the Government need not&para;<br>show beyond a reasonable doubt that the communication&para;<br>would have been to a federal officer because “[t]he relevant&para;<br>question concerns the defendant’s intent.” Ante, at 5. But&para;<br>that reasoning is directly contrary to §1512(g)(2), which&para;<br>expressly states that the defendant’s intent is not the&para;<br>relevant question with respect to the federal character of&para;<br>law enforcement officer meant to be deprived of the infor&para;<br>mation. The Court’s observation that “a defendant can kill&para;<br>a victim with an intent to prevent the victim from commu&para;<br>nicating with federal law enforcement officers even if&para;<br>there is some considerable doubt that any such communi&para;<br>cation would otherwise have taken place,” ante, at 6, is&para;<br>completely irrelevant to the question presented.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court also proclaims that a narrower view “would&para;<br>conflict with the statute’s basic purpose,” which is to&para;<br>prevent witness tampering “at a time when the precise&para;<br>communication and nature of the officer who may receive&para;<br>it are not yet known.” Ante, at 4. It cites no basis for&para;<br>attributing that purpose, and there is none—other than&para;<br>the fact that it supports the Court’s outcome. Another&para;<br>purpose is just as likely—and indeed more likely, since it&para;<br>can be achieved without abandonment of the ancient rule&para;<br>that in criminal prosecutions facts must be found beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt. Murder, after all, is a crime, and often&para;<br>a capital crime, under all state laws. There is no reason to&para;<br>ascribe to Congress the “purpose” of transferring murder&para;<br>prosecutions that would ordinarily be brought in state&para;<br>court to federal court based on only a tangential federal&para;<br>interest. Congress was concerned with preserving the&para;<br>integrity and effectiveness of federal prosecutions, and&para;<br>where they are not clearly involved (as the ordinary be&para;<br>yond-a-reasonable-doubt standard would require) a federal&para;<br>murder prosecution has no proper place. Limited as I&para;<br>have suggested, the federal law would still have ample&para;<br>scope, reaching what were surely the principal cases Con&para;<br>gress had in mind—the killing of prospective witnesses in&para;<br>federal trials or in ongoing federal investigations. Here,&para;<br>as would be the case in many situations involving a&para;<br>merely hypothetical link to a federal investigation, Fowler&para;<br>murdered a state police officer. The natural place to have&para;<br>prosecuted him would have been state court.&para;<br>The Court’s analysis is even less persuasive in light of&para;<br>the rule of lenity, under which we must construe ambigu&para;<br>ous criminal statutes in favor of the defendant. Here, the&para;<br>Court adopts a kind of rule of harshness, discarding the&para;<br>most straightforward construction of the text in favor of&para;<br>textually implausible one, based on vague intuitions about&para;<br>the statute’s purpose. The Court’s opinion never cites the&para;<br>rule of lenity, probably because it cannot honestly say that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

United States, 553&para;<br>U. S. 124, 136 (2008).&para;<br>To make matters worse, the Court’s standard is hope&para;<br>lessly indeterminate. The Government must show that a&para;<br>communication to a federal officer is “reasonably likely,”&para;<br>which is less likely than “more likely than not,” but more&para;<br>likely than “reasonably possible.” Ante, at 7–9. I doubt&para;<br>that any jury can grasp the distinction between “you must&para;<br>find that a communication to a federal officer was rea&para;<br>sonably likely” and “you must find that a communication&para;<br>to a federal officer was reasonably possible.” Under&para;<br>standably, the Court refuses to give any examples of what&para;<br>“reasonably likely” means, except for an absurd example&para;<br>involving communications with Lithuanian police officers,&para;<br>ante, at 10—which obviously would not be “reasonably&para;<br>possible” either. Indeed, the Court refuses to apply its&para;<br>standard to the facts of this case, leaving that precarious&para;<br>task to the lower court.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The dissent adopts a view of the statute that is even&para;<br>broader than the Government’s. It effectively contends&para;<br>that the Government need not prove anything with respect&para;<br>to the fact that the communication sought to be prevented&para;<br>was “to a law enforcement officer . . . of the United States.”&para;<br>As long as the Government can prove that the defendant&para;<br>sought to prevent the communication of information about&para;<br>a federal crime (including a federal crime that is also a&para;<br>state crime) it will necessarily have proved that the “set of&para;<br>law enforcement officers (whose identities were unknown&para;<br>to him)” he had in mind “included law enforcement officers&para;<br>who were employed by the United States.” Post, at 3&para;<br>(opinion of ALITO, J.). Conviction requires neither any&para;<br>specific intent regarding the federal status of the officer,&para;<br>nor even any likelihood that a communication to a federal&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>officer would have occurred.&para;<br>The principal defect in this interpretation is that it&para;<br>makes the words “of the United States” superfluous.&para;<br>Section 1512(a)(1)(C) specifically requires that the in&para;<br>formation the defendant seeks to prevent from being com&para;<br>municated be “information relating to the commission or&para;<br>possible commission of a Federal offense.” If the phrase&para;<br>“to a law enforcement officer . . . of the United States”&para;<br>requires nothing more than this it is utterly without effect.&para;<br>The implication of this view is that Congress enacted&para;<br>§1512(a)(1)(C)’s reference to “a law enforcement officer . . .&para;<br>of the United States,” only to immediately nullify it by&para;<br>§1512(g)(2)’s “no state of mind” provision. Not likely—and&para;<br>not sound statutory interpretation.&para;<br>The dissent claims that my analysis “confuses what the&para;<br>prosecution must prove with what a rational jury may&para;<br>choose to infer in a particular case.” Post, at 6. I find this&para;<br>contention difficult to understand. In the dissent’s view, a&para;<br>properly instructed jury should be required to find neither&para;<br>that the defendant’s mens rea had any connection to a&para;<br>federal officer, nor that the defendant’s actus reus had any&para;<br>connection to a federal officer. It therefore follows that&para;<br>under the dissent’s view, a properly instructed jury should&para;<br>be required to find nothing about a connection to a federal&para;<br>officer beyond the fact that the information related to a&para;<br>federal offense, which means that, unless the jury is acting&para;<br>irrationally or is engaging in jury nullification, the “of the&para;<br>United States” provision is indeed superfluous. The dis&para;<br>sent is correct that the proof of one element of a crime&para;<br>(such as an overt act) can sometimes be used to prove that&para;<br>a different element (such as a conspiratorial agreement) is&para;<br>satisfied, post, at 6–7, n. 2; but in such cases, the jury is&para;<br>instructed that it is required to make a separate finding to&para;<br>convict (e.g., that a conspiratorial agreement actually&para;<br>occurred). Here, the dissent identifies no separate finding&para;<br>the jury must make beyond the fact of a federal offense.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Post, at 7. This observation convincingly&para;<br>establishes that the statutory words “Federal offense” are&para;<br>not superfluous under the dissent’s view, an observation&para;<br>irrelevant to my point that the dissent makes the statu&para;<br>tory words “of the United States” superfluous.&para;<br>The dissent contends that my interpretation “has no&para;<br>grounding in the language of the statute.” Post, at 4. It&para;<br>asserts that “the text of the statute makes it perfectly&para;<br>clear that the federal officer requirement is exclusively an&para;<br>element of the defendant’s mens rea.” Post, at 5 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Perhaps the only thing “per&para;<br>fectly clear” about this statute is that it states the precise&para;<br>opposite of that proposition: “[N]o state of mind need be&para;<br>proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law&para;<br>enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal&para;<br>Government.” §1512(g)(2).&para;<br>The dissent’s interpretation would federalize crimes&para;<br>that have no connection to any federal investigation. A&para;<br>person caught by a state police officer with marijuana who&para;<br>murders the state police officer to cover it up could be&para;<br>prosecuted in federal court. That would approach the&para;<br>outer limits of Congress’s enumerated powers. We have&para;<br>adopted a federalism principle that applies when a statute&para;<br>would render “traditionally local criminal conduct . . . a&para;<br>matter for federal enforcement”: “[U]nless Congress con&para;<br>veys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have&para;<br>significantly changed the federal-state balance in the&para;<br>prosecution of crimes.” Jones v. United States, 529 U. S.&para;<br>848, 858 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus,&para;<br>the dissent adds to the Court’s “rule of harshness” a rule of&para;<br>antifederalism, under which a court must actually ignore&para;<br>a federal connection that Congress prescribed so as to&para;<br>avoid intrusion into traditionally local law enforcement.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v.

Instead of heeding&para;<br>the statutory text, the Court has effectively amended the&para;<br>statute by adding a new element.&para;<br>I&para;<br>As relevant here, §1512(a)(1)(C) makes it a federal crime&para;<br>“to kill another person, with intent to . . . prevent the&para;<br>communication by any person to a law enforcement officer&para;<br>. . . of the United States of information relating to the&para;<br>commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.”&para;<br>Also important for present purposes is §1512(g)(2), which&para;<br>provides, among other things, that “[i]n a prosecution for&para;<br>an offense under this section, no state of mind need be&para;<br>proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law&para;<br>enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal&para;<br>Government.”&para;<br>Putting these two provisions together, what had to be&para;<br>shown in the present case was as follows:&para;<br>(1) Fowler killed Officer Horner,&para;<br>(2) with the intent to prevent any person (i.e., either Offi&para;<br>cer Horner or someone else) from communicating,&para;<br>(3) to a person who (whether or not known as such to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Fowler) was a federal law enforcement officer,&para;<br>(4) information concerning the possible commission of a&para;<br>federal crime.&para;<br>The question before us is whether there was sufficient&para;<br>evidence to support Fowler’s conviction, and thus we must&para;<br>ask whether any rational jury could find that all of the&para;<br>elements noted above were adequately established. See&para;<br>United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 67 (1984).&para;<br>There can be no dispute that there was sufficient evi&para;<br>dence to establish elements (1), (2), and (4). That is, there&para;<br>was ample evidence to show (1) that Fowler killed Officer&para;<br>Horner, (2) that he did so with the intent to prevent the&para;<br>communication of information about what Officer Horner&para;<br>had seen, and (4) that this information concerned the&para;<br>possible commission of at least one federal crime—for&para;<br>example, conspiracy to rob a bank in violation of 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §§371, 2113.&para;<br>Thus, the only remaining question is whether there was&para;<br>enough evidence to permit a rational jury to infer that&para;<br>element (3) had been satisfied. And in connection with&para;<br>this question, it is important to keep in mind three things&para;<br>that element (3) does not require.&para;<br>First, element (3) does not demand proof that Officer&para;<br>Horner, had he not been killed, would have reported—or&para;<br>even might have reported—what he saw to anyone, much&para;<br>less to a federal officer. Element (3) is solely concerned&para;<br>with a defendant’s intent.&para;<br>Second, while element (3) requires proof that Fowler&para;<br>intended to prevent some law enforcement officer from&para;<br>learning what Officer Horner had seen, element (3) does&para;<br>not require proof that Fowler had any particular law&para;<br>enforcement officer in mind. Section 1512(a)(1)(C) simply&para;<br>demands that the recipient of the information be “a law&para;<br>enforcement officer.” Thus, it would be enough if Fowler’s&para;<br>intent was to prevent Officer Horner’s information from&para;<br>reaching any federal law enforcement officer.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Sec&para;<br>tion 1512(g)(2) specifically rules out any such requirement.&para;<br>It is enough that our generic officer was in fact a federal&para;<br>officer.&para;<br>When the meaning of element (3) is understood, it is&para;<br>clear that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case&para;<br>must be affirmed. A rational jury could infer that Fowler’s&para;<br>intent was to prevent information about what Officer&para;<br>Horner had seen from reaching any person who could&para;<br>bring about his arrest and conviction. In other words, a&para;<br>rational jury could infer that Fowler, in effect, had in mind&para;<br>a set of law enforcement officers (whose identities were&para;<br>unknown to him) who could set in motion a chain of events&para;<br>that would land him in prison. And since the information&para;<br>that Officer Horner possessed related to, among other&para;<br>things, the possible commission of a federal crime, a ra&para;<br>tional jury could infer that this group included law en&para;<br>forcement officers who were employed by the United&para;<br>States. The question presented in this case is as simple as&para;<br>that.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court begins on the right track, observing that the&para;<br>“relevant question concerns the defendant’s intent” and&para;<br>that therefore “the Government need not show beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt (or even that it is more likely than not)&para;<br>that the hypothetical communication would have been to a&para;<br>federal officer.” Ante, at 5 (emphasis in original). But the&para;<br>Court veers off course when it goes on to hold that the&para;<br>prosecution was required to show that, if Officer Horner&para;<br>had not been killed, there was a “reasonable likelihood”&para;<br>that his information would have reached a federal officer.&para;<br>Ante, at 9 (emphasis in original).&para;<br>The Court reaches this conclusion based on the meaning&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of the word “prevent.” See ante, at 6–10. The Court starts&para;<br>with the proposition that “apart from mistakes . . . one&para;<br>cannot act with an ‘intent to prevent’ something that could&para;<br>not possibly have taken place regardless.” Ante, at 6&para;<br>(emphasis in original). I understand this to mean that a&para;<br>rational person will not take action to prevent something&para;<br>that the person knows is not possible. This is true, but it&para;<br>does not follow that a rational person will not take action&para;<br>to prevent an undesirable event unless the event is “rea&para;<br>sonably likely.” Risk-averse people do this all the time.&para;<br>They refrain from flying to avoid dying in a plane crash.&para;<br>They shun rooms on the upper floors of hotels to prevent&para;<br>being trapped in the event of a fire.&para;<br>What matters under §1512(a)(1)(C) is not the likelihood&para;<br>that information about a possible federal crime will be&para;<br>conveyed to a federal officer. What matters is the intent&para;<br>of the person who kills or attempts to kill in order to pre&para;<br>vent that information from reaching such an officer. The&para;<br>Court’s “reasonable likelihood” test has no basis in the text&para;<br>of §1512(a)(1)(C).&para;<br>The Court’s test also makes little sense. Under this test,&para;<br>the application of §1512(a)(1)(C) depends on a witness&para;<br>killer’s toleration of risk.&para;<br>According to the Court,&para;<br>§1512(a)(1)(C) does not reach a killer who has so little&para;<br>regard for human life that he or she is willing to murder in&para;<br>order to prevent even a remote possibility that a witness&para;<br>will inform the authorities. It is hard to imagine why&para;<br>Congress would have wanted to draw this line.&para;<br>III&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s interpretation of §1512(a)(1)(C) also&para;<br>has no grounding in the language of the statute. He&para;<br>makes the fundamental mistake of confusing §1512(a)&para;<br>(1)(C)’s mens rea and actus reus elements.

But noth&para;<br>ing in this provision adds to the actus reus elements in&para;<br>§1512(a)(1)(C).&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s principal criticism of my interpreta&para;<br>tion of the statute is that “it makes the words ‘of the&para;<br>United States’ superfluous.” Ante, at 6.1 He incorrectly&para;<br>states that under my interpretation “the Government need&para;<br>not prove anything with respect to the fact that the com&para;<br>munication sought to be prevented was ‘to a law enforce&para;<br>ment officer . . . of the United States’ ” and that “[a]s long&para;<br>as the Government can prove that the defendant sought to&para;<br>prevent the communication of information about a federal&para;<br>crime (including a federal crime that is also a state crime)&para;<br>it will necessarily have proved that [the set of officers&para;<br>whom the defendant had in mind] ‘included law enforce&para;<br>ment officers who were employed by the United States.’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 5 (emphasis in original). This description of my&para;<br>interpretation confuses what the prosecution must prove&para;<br>with what a rational jury may choose to infer in a particu&para;<br>lar case.&para;<br>In order to violate §1512(a)(1)(C), a defendant must&para;<br>have an intent regarding two things: first, the substance of&para;<br>the communication that the defendant wishes to prevent&para;<br>(information concerning, among other things, the commis&para;<br>sion or possible commission of a federal crime) and, sec&para;<br>ond, the recipient of the communication (a law enforce&para;<br>ment officer or judge who turns out to be a federal officer&para;<br>or judge).&para;<br>It is true that evidence regarding the federal character&para;<br>of an offense may lead a rational jury to infer that the&para;<br>officers whom the defendant had in mind included federal&para;<br>officers.2 But those two elements remain distinct; both&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court makes a related argument. See ante, at 8.&para;<br>is nothing unusual about the proposition that the proof of one&para;<br>&para;<br>2 There&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and it is en&para;<br>tirely possible for a defendant to satisfy one without also&para;<br>satisfying the other. For example, if a uniformed federal&para;<br>officer came upon a defendant during the commission of a&para;<br>purely state offense (for example, a murder, assault, or&para;<br>rape not committed in a federal enclave), the defendant&para;<br>might kill or attempt to kill the officer to prevent the&para;<br>officer from radioing in that information to the officer’s&para;<br>superiors. This defendant would have the intent to pre&para;<br>vent a communication to a federal officer, but there would&para;<br>be no violation of the statute because the information&para;<br>would not concern a federal crime. Thus, contrary to&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, under my interpretation,&para;<br>the two intent elements—relating to the substance of the&para;<br>feared communication and the identity of the feared re&para;<br>cipient—are not redundant.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA invokes a rule that disfavors the inter&para;<br>pretation of a federal criminal statute in a way that&para;<br>“ ‘significantly change[s] the federal-state balance in the&para;<br>prosecution of crimes.’ ”3 Ante, at 7 (quoting Jones v.&para;<br>United States, 529 U. S. 848, 858 (2000)). This rule, how&para;<br>ever, does not justify ignoring the plain terms of the&para;<br>statute.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Court has effectively amended §1512(a)(1)(C) by&para;<br>adding an element that is nowhere to be found in the text&para;<br>of the statute. And the Court’s new element makes little&para;<br>sense and will create confusion for trial judges and juries.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>element of a crime may provide a sufficient basis for inferring that&para;<br>another element may be satisfied. To take a common example, overt&para;<br>acts committed in furtherance of a conspiracy may be sufficient to&para;<br>permit a jury to infer that a conspiratorial agreement was reached. But&para;<br>that does not alter the need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that&para;<br>such an agreement was reached.&para;<br>3 The Court again makes a related argument. See ante, at 8–9.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FOWLER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Following the language of §1512(a)(1)(C), I would hold&para;<br>that the evidence in this case was sufficient to establish all&para;<br>of the elements that Congress saw fit to include.
