Respondents, named plaintiffs in this class-action&para;<br>antitrust suit, claim that they and other Comcast subscribers in the&para;<br>Philadelphia “cluster” are harmed because Comcast’s strategy lessens&para;<br>competition and leads to supra-competitive prices. They sought class&para;<br>certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which&para;<br>requires that “questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”&para;<br>The District Court required them to show (1) that the “antitrust impact” of the violation could be proved at trial through evidence common to the class and (2) that the damages were measurable on a&para;<br>classwide basis through a “common methodology.” The court accepted only one of respondents’ four proposed theories of antitrust impact:&para;<br>that Comcast’s actions lessened competition from “overbuilders,” i.e.,&para;<br>companies that build competing networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already operates. It then certified the class, finding that the damages from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated&para;<br>on a classwide basis, even though respondents’ expert acknowledged&para;<br>that his regression model did not isolate damages resulting from any&para;<br>one of respondents’ theories. In affirming, the Third Circuit refused&para;<br>to consider petitioners’ argument that the model failed to attribute&para;<br>damages to overbuilder deterrence because doing so would require&para;<br>reaching the merits of respondents’ claims at the class certification&para;<br>stage.&para;<br>Held: Respondents’ class action was improperly certified under Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3). Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) A party seeking to maintain a class action must be prepared to&para;<br>show that Rule 23(a)’s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy-of-representation requirements have been met, Wal-Mart&para;<br>Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, and must satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of Rule 23(b)’s provisions. The same analytical principles govern certification under both Rule 23(a) and Rule&para;<br>23(b). Courts may have to “ ‘probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,’ and [a] certification is proper&para;<br>only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that [Rule&para;<br>23’s] prerequisites . . . have been satisfied.’ ” Ibid. The analysis will&para;<br>frequently “overlap with the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying&para;<br>claim” because a “ ‘class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising&para;<br>the plaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Ibid. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) The Third Circuit ran afoul of this Court’s precedents when it&para;<br>refused to entertain arguments against respondents’ damages model&para;<br>that bore on the propriety of class certification simply because they&para;<br>would also be pertinent to the merits determination. If they prevail,&para;<br>respondents would be entitled only to damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition. A model that does not attempt to&para;<br>measure only those damages attributable to that theory cannot establish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire&para;<br>class for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes. The lower courts’ contrary reasoning&para;<br>flatly contradicts this Court’s cases, which require a determination&para;<br>that Rule 23 is satisfied, even when that requires inquiry into the&para;<br>merits of the claim. Wal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n. 6. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(c) Under the proper standard for evaluating certification, respondents’ model falls far short of establishing that damages can be measured classwide. The figure respondents’ expert used was calculated&para;<br>assuming the validity of all four theories of antitrust impact initially&para;<br>advanced by respondents. Because the model cannot bridge the differences between supra-competitive prices in general and supracompetitive prices attributable to overbuilder deterrence, Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3) cannot authorize treating subscribers in the Philadelphia&para;<br>cluster as members of a single class.

We consider&para;<br>whether certification was appropriate under Federal Rule&para;<br>of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).&para;<br>I&para;<br>Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, petitioners&para;<br>here, provide cable-television services to residential and&para;<br>commercial customers. From 1998 to 2007, petitioners&para;<br>engaged in a series of transactions that the parties have&para;<br>described as “clustering,” a strategy of concentrating operations within a particular region. The region at issue&para;<br>here, which the parties have referred to as the Philadelphia “cluster” or the Philadelphia “Designated Market&para;<br>Area” (DMA), includes 16 counties located in Pennsylvania,&para;<br>Delaware, and New Jersey.1 Petitioners pursued their&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 A “Designated Market Area” is a term used by Nielsen Media Re­&para;<br>search to define a broadcast-television market.

BEHREND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>clustering strategy by acquiring competitor cable provid­&para;<br>ers in the region and swapping their own systems outside&para;<br>the region for competitor systems located in the region.&para;<br>For instance, in 2001, petitioners obtained Adelphia Communications’ cable systems in the Philadelphia DMA,&para;<br>along with its 464,000 subscribers; in exchange, petition­&para;<br>ers sold to Adelphia their systems in Palm Beach, Florida,&para;<br>and Los Angeles, California. As a result of nine clustering transactions, petitioners’ share of subscribers in the region allegedly increased from 23.9 percent in 1998 to 69.5&para;<br>percent in 2007. See 264 F. R. D. 150, 156, n. 8, 160 (ED&para;<br>Pa. 2010).&para;<br>The named plaintiffs, respondents here, are subscribers&para;<br>to Comcast’s cable-television services. They filed a class­&para;<br>action antitrust suit against petitioners, claiming that&para;<br>petitioners entered into unlawful swap agreements, in&para;<br>violation of §1 of the Sherman Act, and monopolized or attempted to monopolize services in the cluster, in viola­&para;<br>tion of §2. Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1, 2. Petitioners’ clustering scheme, respondents con­&para;<br>tended, harmed subscribers in the Philadelphia cluster by&para;<br>eliminating competition and holding prices for cable ser­&para;<br>vices above competitive levels.&para;<br>Respondents sought to certify a class under Federal&para;<br>Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). That provision permits&para;<br>certification only if “the court finds that the questions of&para;<br>law or fact common to class members predominate over&para;<br>any questions affecting only individual members.” The&para;<br>District Court held, and it is uncontested here, that to&para;<br>meet the predominance requirement respondents had to&para;<br>show (1) that the existence of individual injury resulting&para;<br>from the alleged antitrust violation (referred to as “anti­&para;<br>trust impact”) was “capable of proof at trial through&para;<br>evidence that [was] common to the class rather than indi­&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>Philadelphia DMA comprises 18 counties, not 16. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

R. D., at&para;<br>154.2&para;<br>Respondents proposed four theories of antitrust impact:&para;<br>First, Comcast’s clustering made it profitable for Comcast&para;<br>to withhold local sports programming from its competi­&para;<br>tors, resulting in decreased market penetration by direct&para;<br>broadcast satellite providers. Second, Comcast’s activities&para;<br>reduced the level of competition from “overbuilders,” com­&para;<br>panies that build competing cable networks in areas&para;<br>where an incumbent cable company already operates.&para;<br>Third, Comcast reduced the level of “benchmark” competi­&para;<br>tion on which cable customers rely to compare prices.&para;<br>Fourth, clustering increased Comcast’s bargaining power&para;<br>relative to content providers. Each of these forms of im­&para;<br>pact, respondents alleged, increased cable subscription&para;<br>rates throughout the Philadelphia DMA.&para;<br>The District Court accepted the overbuilder theory of&para;<br>antitrust impact as capable of classwide proof and rejected&para;<br>the rest. Id., at 165, 174, 178, 181. Accordingly, in its&para;<br>certification order, the District Court limited respondents’&para;<br>“proof of antitrust impact” to “the theory that Comcast&para;<br>engaged in anticompetitive clustering conduct, the effect of&para;<br>which was to deter the entry of overbuilders in the Phila­&para;<br>delphia DMA.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 192a–193a.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Respondents&para;<br>&para;<br>sought certification for the following class: “All cable&para;<br>television customers who subscribe or subscribed at any times since&para;<br>December 1, 1999, to the present to video programming services (other&para;<br>than solely to basic cable services) from Comcast, or any of its subsidi­&para;<br>aries or affiliates in Comcast’s Philadelphia cluster.” App. 35a.&para;<br>3 The District Court did not hold that the three alternative theories of&para;<br>liability failed to establish antitrust impact, but merely that those&para;<br>theories could not be determined in a manner common to all the class&para;<br>plaintiffs. The other theories of liability may well be available for&para;<br>the plaintiffs to pursue as individual actions. Any contention that the&para;<br>plaintiffs should be allowed to recover damages attributable to all four&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court further found that the damages&para;<br>resulting from overbuilder-deterrence impact could be&para;<br>calculated on a classwide basis. To establish such damages, respondents had relied solely on the testimony of Dr.&para;<br>James McClave. Dr. McClave designed a regression model&para;<br>comparing actual cable prices in the Philadelphia DMA&para;<br>with hypothetical prices that would have prevailed but&para;<br>for petitioners’ allegedly anticompetitive activities. The&para;<br>model calculated damages of $875,576,662 for the entire&para;<br>class. App. 1388a (sealed). As Dr. McClave acknowledged,&para;<br>however, the model did not isolate damages resulting&para;<br>from any one theory of antitrust impact. Id., at 189a–&para;<br>190a. The District Court nevertheless certified the class.&para;<br>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. On&para;<br>appeal, petitioners contended the class was improperly&para;<br>certified because the model, among other shortcomings,&para;<br>failed to attribute damages resulting from overbuilder&para;<br>deterrence, the only theory of injury remaining in the case.&para;<br>The court refused to consider the argument because, in its&para;<br>view, such an “attac[k] on the merits of the methodology&para;<br>[had] no place in the class certification inquiry.” 655 F. 3d&para;<br>182, 207 (CA3 2011). The court emphasized that, “[a]t&para;<br>the class certification stage,” respondents were not required&para;<br>to “tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calcula­&para;<br>tion of damages.” Id., at 206. According to the court, it&para;<br>had “not reached the stage of determining on the merits&para;<br>whether the methodology is a just and reasonable infer­&para;<br>ence or speculative.” Ibid. Rather, the court said, re­&para;<br>spondents must “assure us that if they can prove antitrust&para;<br>impact, the resulting damages are capable of measure­&para;<br>ment and will not require labyrinthine individual calcula­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>theories in this class action would erroneously suggest one of two&para;<br>things—either that the plaintiffs may also recover such damages in&para;<br>individual actions or that they are precluded from asserting those&para;<br>theories in individual actions.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions.” Ibid. In the court’s view, that burden was met&para;<br>because respondents’ model calculated “supra-competitive&para;<br>prices regardless of the type of anticompetitive conduct.”&para;<br>Id., at 205.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).4&para;<br>II&para;<br>The class action is “an exception to the usual rule that&para;<br>litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual&para;<br>named parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,&para;<br>700–701 (1979). To come within the exception, a party&para;<br>seeking to maintain a class action “must affirmatively&para;<br>demonstrate his compliance” with Rule 23. Wal-Mart&para;<br>Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at&para;<br>10). The Rule “does not set forth a mere pleading stand­&para;<br>ard.” Ibid. Rather, a party must not only “be prepared to&para;<br>prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,&para;<br>common questions of law or fact,” typicality of claims or&para;<br>defenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by&para;<br>Rule 23(a). Ibid. The party must also satisfy through&para;<br>evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The question presented reads: “Whether a district court may certify&para;<br>a class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class had intro­&para;<br>duced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show that the&para;<br>case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” 567&para;<br>U. S., at ___. Respondents contend that petitioners forfeited their&para;<br>ability to answer this question in the negative because they did not&para;<br>make an objection to the admission of Dr. McClave’s testimony under&para;<br>the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993). Such a forfeit would make it&para;<br>impossible for petitioners to argue that Dr. McClave’s testimony was&para;<br>not “admissible evidence” under the Rules; but it does not make it&para;<br>impossible for them to argue that the evidence failed “to show that the&para;<br>case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” Peti­&para;<br>tioners argued below, and continue to argue here, that certification was&para;<br>improper because respondents had failed to establish that damages&para;<br>could be measured on a classwide basis. That is the question we&para;<br>address here.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>23(b). The provision at issue here is Rule 23(b)(3), which&para;<br>requires a court to find that “the questions of law or fact&para;<br>common to class members predominate over any questions&para;<br>affecting only individual members.”&para;<br>Repeatedly, we have emphasized that it “ ‘may be neces­&para;<br>sary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before&para;<br>coming to rest on the certification question,’ and that&para;<br>certification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied,&para;<br>after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule&para;<br>23(a) have been satisfied.’ ” Ibid. (quoting General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 160–161&para;<br>(1982)). Such an analysis will frequently entail “overlap&para;<br>with the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying claim.” 564&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). That is so because the “ ‘class&para;<br>determination generally involves considerations that are&para;<br>enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the&para;<br>plaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Falcon, supra,&para;<br>at 160).&para;<br>The same analytical principles govern Rule 23(b). If&para;<br>anything, Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance criterion is even&para;<br>more demanding than Rule 23(a). Amchem Products, Inc.&para;<br>v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 623–624 (1997). Rule 23(b)(3),&para;<br>as an “ ‘adventuresome innovation,’ ” is designed for situa­&para;<br>tions “ ‘in which “class-action treatment is not as clearly&para;<br>called for.” ’ ” Wal-Mart, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22)&para;<br>(quoting Amchem, 521 U. S., at 614–615). That explains&para;<br>Congress’s addition of procedural safeguards for (b)(3)&para;<br>class members beyond those provided for (b)(1) or (b)(2)&para;<br>class members (e.g., an opportunity to opt out), and the&para;<br>court’s duty to take a “ ‘close look’ ” at whether common&para;<br>questions predominate over individual ones. Id., at 615.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Respondents’ class action was improperly certified un­&para;<br>der Rule 23(b)(3). By refusing to entertain arguments&para;<br>against respondents’ damages model that bore on the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>propriety of class certification, simply because those ar­&para;<br>guments would also be pertinent to the merits determina­&para;<br>tion, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents&para;<br>requiring precisely that inquiry. And it is clear that,&para;<br>under the proper standard for evaluating certification,&para;<br>respondents’ model falls far short of establishing that&para;<br>damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.&para;<br>Without presenting another methodology, respondents&para;<br>cannot show Rule 23(b)(3) predominance: Questions of&para;<br>individual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm&para;<br>questions common to the class. This case thus turns on&para;<br>the straightforward application of class-certification prin­&para;<br>ciples; it provides no occasion for the dissent’s extended&para;<br>discussion, post, at 5–11 (GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.,&para;<br>dissenting), of substantive antitrust law.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We start with an unremarkable premise. If respondents&para;<br>prevail on their claims, they would be entitled only to&para;<br>damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition,&para;<br>since that is the only theory of antitrust impact accepted&para;<br>for class-action treatment by the District Court. It follows&para;<br>that a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in&para;<br>this class action must measure only those damages at­&para;<br>tributable to that theory. If the model does not even at­&para;<br>tempt to do that, it cannot possibly establish that damages&para;<br>are susceptible of measurement across the entire class for&para;<br>purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Calculations need not be exact,&para;<br>see Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co.,&para;<br>282 U. S. 555, 563 (1931), but at the class-certification&para;<br>stage (as at trial), any model supporting a “plaintiff ’s&para;<br>damages case must be consistent with its liability case,&para;<br>particularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive&para;<br>effect of the violation.” ABA Section of Antitrust Law,&para;<br>Proving Antitrust Damages: Legal and Economic Issues&para;<br>57, 62 (2d ed. 2010); see, e.g., Image Tech. Servs. v. East-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>man Kodak Co., 125 F. 3d 1195, 1224 (CA9 1997). And for&para;<br>purposes of Rule 23, courts must conduct a “ ‘rigorous&para;<br>analysis’ ” to determine whether that is so. Wal-Mart,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>The District Court and the Court of Appeals saw no&para;<br>need for respondents to “tie each theory of antitrust im­&para;<br>pact” to a calculation of damages. 655 F. 3d, at 206. That,&para;<br>they said, would involve consideration of the “merits”&para;<br>having “no place in the class certification inquiry.” Id.,&para;<br>at 206–207. That reasoning flatly contradicts our cases&para;<br>requiring a determination that Rule 23 is satisfied, even&para;<br>when that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim.&para;<br>Wal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n. 6 (slip op., at 10–11, and&para;<br>n. 6). The Court of Appeals simply concluded that re­&para;<br>spondents “provided a method to measure and quantify&para;<br>damages on a classwide basis,” finding it unnecessary to&para;<br>decide “whether the methodology [was] a just and reason­&para;<br>able inference or speculative.” 655 F. 3d, at 206. Under&para;<br>that logic, at the class-certification stage any method of&para;<br>measurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied&para;<br>classwide, no matter how arbitrary the measurements&para;<br>may be. Such a proposition would reduce Rule 23(b)(3)’s&para;<br>predominance requirement to a nullity.&para;<br>B&para;<br>There is no question that the model failed to measure&para;<br>damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury&para;<br>on which petitioners’ liability in this action is premised.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The dissent is of the view that what an econometric model proves is&para;<br>a “question of fact” on which we will not “undertake to review concur­&para;<br>rent findings . . . by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious&para;<br>and exceptional showing of error.” Post, at 9 (quoting United States v.&para;<br>Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 589, n. 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (inter­&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted)). To begin with, neither of the courts&para;<br>below found that the model established damages attributable to over­&para;<br>building alone. Second, while the data contained within an econometric&para;<br>model may well be “questions of fact” in the relevant sense, what those&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Damages would&para;<br>then be determined by comparing to that baseline what&para;<br>the actual prices were during the charged period. The&para;<br>“but for” figure was calculated, however, by assuming a&para;<br>market that contained none of the four distortions that&para;<br>respondents attributed to petitioners’ actions. In other&para;<br>words, the model assumed the validity of all four theories&para;<br>of antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents:&para;<br>decreased penetration by satellite providers, overbuilder&para;<br>deterrence, lack of benchmark competition, and increased&para;<br>bargaining power.&para;<br>At the evidentiary hearing, Dr.&para;<br>McClave expressly admitted that the model calculated&para;<br>damages resulting from “the alleged anticompetitive&para;<br>conduct as a whole” and did not attribute damages to&para;<br>any one particular theory of anticompetitive impact. App.&para;<br>189a–190a, 208a.&para;<br>This methodology might have been sound, and might&para;<br>have produced commonality of damages, if all four of those&para;<br>alleged distortions remained in the case. But as Judge&para;<br>Jordan’s partial dissent pointed out:&para;<br>“[B]ecause the only surviving theory of antitrust im­&para;<br>pact is that clustering reduced overbuilding, for Dr.&para;<br>McClave’s comparison to be relevant, his benchmark&para;<br>counties must reflect the conditions that would have&para;<br>prevailed in the Philadelphia DMA but for the alleged&para;<br>reduction in overbuilding. In all respects unrelated to&para;<br>reduced overbuilding, the benchmark counties should&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>data prove is no more a question of fact than what our opinions hold.&para;<br>&para;<br>And finally, even if it were a question of fact, concluding that the model &para;<br>&para;<br>here established damages attributable to overbuilding alone would be&para;<br>&para;<br>“obvious[ly] and exceptional[ly]” erroneous. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v.

For present&para;<br>purposes, the §2 claim provides the better illustration. A&para;<br>firm is guilty of monopolization under §2 if the plaintiff&para;<br>proves (1) “the possession of monopoly power in the rele­&para;<br>vant market” and (2) “the willful acquisition or mainte­&para;<br>nance of that power[,] as distinguished from growth or&para;<br>development as a consequence of a superior product, busi­&para;<br>ness acumen, or historic accident.” United States v.&para;<br>Grinnell Corp., 384 U.

We&para;<br>have said that antitrust injuries must be “of the type the&para;<br>antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flo[w]&para;<br>from that which makes defendants’ acts unlawful.” Atlantic Richfield Co. v.

A market, such as the one alleged by&para;<br>respondents, where one firm controls 60% is far worse.&para;<br>See id., §5.3, at 18–19, and n. 9 (using a concentration&para;<br>index that determines a market’s concentration level by&para;<br>summing the squares of each firm’s market share, one&para;<br>firm with 100% yielding 10,000, five firms with 20% each&para;<br>yielding 2000, while a market where one firm accounts for&para;<br>60% yields an index number of at least 3,600). The Guide­&para;<br>lines, and any standard antitrust treatise, explain why&para;<br>firms in highly concentrated markets normally have the&para;<br>power to raise prices significantly above competitive lev­&para;<br>els. See, e.g., 2B Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp ¶503, at 115.&para;<br>B&para;<br>So far there is agreement. But consider the last matter&para;<br>respondents must prove: Can they show that Comcast&para;<br>injured them by charging higher prices? After all, a firm&para;<br>with monopoly power will not necessarily exercise that&para;<br>power by charging higher prices. It could instead act less&para;<br>competitively in other ways, such as by leading the quiet&para;<br>life. See J. Hicks, Annual Survey of Economic Theory: The&para;<br>Theory of Monopoly, 3 Econometrica 1, 8 (1935) (“The best&para;<br>of all monopoly profits is a quiet life.”).&para;<br>It is at this point that Dr. McClave’s model enters the&para;<br>scene. His model first selects a group of comparable&para;<br>outside-Philadelphia “benchmark” counties, where Comcast&para;<br>enjoyed a lower market share (and where satellite broad­&para;<br>casting accounted for more of the local business). Using&para;<br>multiple regression analysis, McClave’s model measures&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND&para;<br>GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the effect of the anticompetitive conduct by comparing&para;<br>the class counties to the benchmark counties. The model&para;<br>concludes that the prices Philadelphia area consumers&para;<br>would have paid had the Philadelphia counties shared&para;<br>the properties of the benchmark counties (including a&para;<br>diminished Comcast market share), would have been&para;<br>13.1% lower than those they actually paid. Thus, the model&para;<br>provides evidence that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct,&para;<br>which led to a 60% market share, caused the class to&para;<br>suffer injuriously higher prices.&para;<br>C&para;<br>1&para;<br>The special antitrust-related difficulty present here&para;<br>stems from the manner in which respondents attempted&para;<br>to prove their antitrust injuries. They proffered four&para;<br>“non-exclusive mechanisms” that allegedly “cause[d] the&para;<br>high prices” in the Philadelphia area. App. 403a. Those four&para;<br>theories posit that (1) due to Comcast’s acquisitions of&para;<br>competitors, customers found it more difficult to compare&para;<br>prices; (2) one set of potential competitors, namely Direct&para;<br>Broadcast Satellite companies, found it more difficult to&para;<br>obtain access to local sports broadcasts and consequently&para;<br>decided not to enter the Philadelphia market; (3) Com­&para;<br>cast’s ability to obtain programming material at lower&para;<br>prices permitted it to raise prices; and (4) a number of&para;<br>potential competitors (called “overbuilders”), whose pres­&para;<br>ence in the market would have limited Comcast’s power to&para;<br>raise prices, were ready to enter some parts of the market&para;<br>but decided not to do so in light of Comcast’s anticompeti­&para;<br>tive conduct. 264 F. R. D. 150, 161–162 (ED Pa. 2010).&para;<br>For reasons not here relevant, the District Court found&para;<br>the first three theories inapplicable and limited the&para;<br>liability-phase proof to the “overbuilder” theory. See App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 192a–193a. It then asked the parties to&para;<br>brief whether doing so had any impact on the viability of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

After considering the parties’ argu­&para;<br>ments, the District Court found that striking the three&para;<br>theories “does not impeach Dr. McClave’s damages model”&para;<br>because “[a]ny anticompetitive conduct is reflected in the&para;<br>[higher Philadelphia] price [which Dr. McClave’s model&para;<br>determines], not in the [the model’s] selection of the&para;<br>comparison counties, [i.e., the lower-price ‘benchmark&para;<br>counties’ with which the Philadelphia area prices were&para;<br>compared].” Id., at 190–191. The court explained that&para;<br>“whether or not we accepted all [four] . . . theories . . . is&para;<br>inapposite to Dr. McClave’s methods of choosing bench­&para;<br>marks.” Ibid. On appeal, the Third Circuit held that this&para;<br>finding was not an abuse of discretion. 655 F. 3d 182, 207&para;<br>(2011).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Court, however, concludes that “the model failed to&para;<br>measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust&para;<br>injury on which petitioners’ liability in this action is prem­&para;<br>ised.” Ante, at 8. To reach this conclusion the Court must&para;<br>consider fact-based matters, namely what this econometric&para;<br>multiple-regression model is about, what it proves, and&para;<br>how it does so. And it must overturn two lower courts’&para;<br>related factual findings to the contrary.&para;<br>We are normally “reluctant to disturb findings of fact in&para;<br>which two courts below have concurred.” United States v.&para;<br>Doe, 465 U. S. 605, 614 (1984). See also United States v.&para;<br>Virginia, 518 U.

BEHREND&para;<br>GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>even after striking three of the injury theories. 264&para;<br>F. R. D., at 190–191. Contrary to the Court’s characteriza­&para;<br>tion, see ante, at 8–9, n. 5, this was not a legal conclusion&para;<br>about what the model proved; it was a factual finding&para;<br>about how the model worked. Under our typical practice,&para;<br>we should leave that finding alone.&para;<br>In any event, as far as we can tell, the lower courts were&para;<br>right. On the basis of the record as we understand it, the&para;<br>District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that&para;<br>McClave’s model could measure damages suffered by the&para;<br>class—even if the damages were limited to those caused by&para;<br>deterred overbuilding. That is because respondents al­&para;<br>leged that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct increased&para;<br>Comcast’s market share (and market power) by deterring&para;<br>potential entrants, in particular, overbuilders, from enter­&para;<br>ing the Philadelphia area market. See App. 43a–66a. By&para;<br>showing that this was so, respondents’ proof tends to show&para;<br>the same in respect to other entrants. The overbuilders’&para;<br>failure to enter deprives the market of the price discipline&para;<br>that their entry would have provided in other parts via&para;<br>threat of the overbuilders’ expansion or that of others&para;<br>potentially led on by their example. Indeed, in the District&para;<br>Court, Comcast argued that the three other theories,&para;<br>i.e., the three rejected theories, had no impact on prices.&para;<br>See 264 F. R. D., at 166, 176, 180–181. If Comcast was&para;<br>right, then the damages McClave’s model found must&para;<br>have stemmed exclusively from conduct that deterred new&para;<br>entry, say from “overbuilders.” Not surprisingly, the&para;<br>Court offers no support at all for its contrary conclusion,&para;<br>namely, that the District Court’s finding was “ ‘obvious[ly]&para;<br>and exceptional[ly]’ erroneous.” Ante, at 8–9, n. 5 (quoting&para;<br>Virginia, 518 U.

In most §2 cases, how­&para;<br>ever, the Court’s starting place would seem remarkable, not&para;<br>“unremarkable.”&para;<br>Suppose in a different case a plaintiff were to prove that&para;<br>Widget, Inc. has obtained, through anticompetitive means,&para;<br>a 90% share of the California widget market. Suppose the&para;<br>plaintiff also proves that the two small remaining firms—&para;<br>one in Ukiah, the other in San Diego—lack the capacity to&para;<br>expand their widget output to the point where that pos­&para;<br>sibility could deter Widget, Inc. from raising its prices.&para;<br>Suppose further that the plaintiff introduces a model that&para;<br>shows California widget prices are now twice those in&para;<br>every other State, which, the model concludes is (after&para;<br>accounting for other possible reasons) the result of lack of&para;<br>competition in the California widget market. Why would a&para;<br>court hearing that case restrict damages solely to custom­&para;<br>ers in the vicinity of Ukiah and San Diego?&para;<br>Like the model in this example, Dr. McClave’s model&para;<br>does not purport to show precisely how Comcast’s conduct&para;<br>led to higher prices in the Philadelphia area. It simply&para;<br>shows that Comcast’s conduct brought about higher prices.&para;<br>And it measures the amount of subsequent harm.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Because the parties did not fully argue the question the&para;<br>Court now answers, all Members of the Court may lack a&para;<br>complete understanding of the model or the meaning of&para;<br>related statements in the record. The need for focused&para;<br>argument is particularly strong here where, as we have&para;<br>said, the underlying considerations are detailed, technical,&para;<br>and fact-based. The Court departs from our ordinary&para;<br>practice, risks inaccurate judicial decisionmaking, and is&para;<br>unfair to respondents and the courts below. For these rea­&para;<br>sons, we would not disturb the Court of Appeals’ judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND&para;<br>GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and, instead, would dismiss the writ as improvidently&para;<br>granted.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
