ARCHIE DIXON&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10–1540. Decided November 7, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty&para;<br>Act, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from&para;<br>a federal court “must show that the state court’s ruling on&para;<br>the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking&para;<br>in justification that there was an error well understood&para;<br>and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility&para;<br>for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). The Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such&para;<br>grievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court’s affirmance of&para;<br>respondent Archie Dixon’s murder conviction. Because it&para;<br>is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all,&para;<br>much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist&para;<br>could agree with that court’s decision, the Sixth Circuit’s&para;<br>judgment must be reversed.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer&para;<br>in order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer,&para;<br>tied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling&para;<br>Hammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on&para;<br>top of him. Dixon then used Hammer’s birth certificate&para;<br>and social security card to obtain a state identification&para;<br>card in Hammer’s name. After using that identification&para;<br>card to establish ownership of Hammer’s car, Dixon sold&para;<br>the vehicle for $2,800.&para;<br>Hammer’s mother reported her son missing the day&para;<br>after his murder. While investigating Hammer’s disap­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. DIXON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>pearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three&para;<br>of which are relevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police&para;<br>detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is&para;<br>undisputed that this was a chance encounter—Dixon was&para;<br>apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own&para;<br>car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The&para;<br>detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then&para;<br>asked to talk to him about Hammer’s disappearance. See&para;<br>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Dixon declined&para;<br>to answer questions without his lawyer present and left&para;<br>the station.&para;<br>As their investigation continued, police determined that&para;<br>Dixon had sold Hammer’s car and forged Hammer’s signa­&para;<br>ture when cashing the check he received in that sale.&para;<br>Police arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of No­&para;<br>vember 9. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermit­&para;<br>tently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking&para;<br>with him for about 45 minutes total. Prior to the interro­&para;<br>gation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon&para;<br>with Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again&para;<br>refuse to speak with them.&para;<br>Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification&para;<br>card in Hammer’s name and signing Hammer’s name on&para;<br>the check, but said that Hammer had given him permis­&para;<br>sion to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where&para;<br>Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might&para;<br>have left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the&para;<br>plausibility of Dixon’s tale and told Dixon that Tim&para;<br>Hoffner was providing them more useful information. At&para;<br>one point a detective told Dixon that “now is the time to&para;<br>say” whether he had any involvement in Hammer’s disap­&para;<br>pearance because “if Tim starts cutting a deal over there,&para;<br>this is kinda like, a bus leaving. The first one that gets on&para;<br>it is the only one that’s gonna get on.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew any­&para;<br>thing about Hammer’s disappearance, Hoffner had not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>told him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything&para;<br>he knew and that he had “[n]othing whatsoever” to do&para;<br>with Hammer’s disappearance. Id., at 186a. At approxi­&para;<br>mately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the&para;<br>detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where&para;<br>he was booked on a forgery charge.&para;<br>The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer’s&para;<br>grave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that&para;<br>Hammer was buried there. After concluding their inter­&para;<br>view with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon&para;<br>transported back to the police station.&para;<br>Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.&para;<br>Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had&para;<br>heard the police had found a body and asked whether&para;<br>Hoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that&para;<br>Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, “I talked to&para;<br>my attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.” State&para;<br>v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004–Ohio–1585, 805&para;<br>N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his Miranda&para;<br>rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke&para;<br>with Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police,&para;<br>now using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his&para;<br>Miranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted&para;<br>to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion’s&para;<br>share of the blame on Hoffner.&para;<br>At Dixon’s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both&para;<br>Dixon’s initial confession to forgery and his later confes­&para;<br>sion to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal.&para;<br>The State did not dispute that Dixon’s forgery confession&para;<br>was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder&para;<br>confession was admissible because Dixon had received&para;<br>Miranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio&para;<br>Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon’s murder&para;<br>confession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convict­&para;<br>ed of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sen­&para;<br>tenced to death.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. DIXON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon’s convictions&para;<br>and sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon’s&para;<br>murder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470&para;<br>U. S. 298 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that&para;<br>Dixon’s confession to murder after receiving Miranda&para;<br>warnings was admissible because that confession and his&para;<br>prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.&para;<br>State v. Dixon, supra, at 332–334, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1050–&para;<br>1052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (“We hold today that a&para;<br>suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoer­&para;<br>cive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his&para;<br>rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite&para;<br>Miranda warnings”).&para;<br>Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus&para;<br>under 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the U. S. District Court for the&para;<br>Northern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that&para;<br>the state court decisions allowing the admission of his&para;<br>murder confession contravened clearly established federal&para;<br>law. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel&para;<br>of the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d&para;<br>553 (2010).&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision&para;<br>“was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application&para;<br>of, clearly established Federal law,” as set forth in this&para;<br>Court’s holdings, or was “based on an unreasonable de­&para;<br>termination of the facts” in light of the state court record.&para;<br>§2254(d); see Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court’s&para;<br>decision contained three such egregious errors.&para;<br>First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda deci­&para;<br>sion itself clearly established that police could not speak to&para;<br>Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had&para;<br>refused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is&para;<br>plainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in&para;<br>custody during his chance encounter with police on No­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>vember 4. And this Court has “never held that a person&para;<br>can invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context&para;<br>other than ‘custodial interrogation.’ ” McNeil v. Wisconsin,&para;<br>501 U. S. 171, 182, n. 3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (“If the&para;<br>defendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its proge­&para;<br>ny] do not apply”).&para;<br>Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to “cut a deal” before&para;<br>his accomplice Hoffner did so.1 The Sixth Circuit cited no&para;<br>precedent of this Court—or any court—holding that this&para;<br>common police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad,&para;<br>supra, at 317 (“[T]he Court has refused to find that a&para;<br>defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his&para;<br>codefendant has turned State’s evidence, does so involun­&para;<br>tarily”). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much&para;<br>less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect&para;<br>to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>had no authority to issue the writ on this ground.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In the Sixth Circuit’s view, the Ohio Supreme Court’s contrary con­&para;<br>clusion that Dixon’s confession was voluntary “was based on an unrea­&para;<br>sonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in&para;<br>the State court proceeding.” §2254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not,&para;<br>however, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed&para;<br>with the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of&para;<br>Dixon’s confession as voluntary, and this Court’s cases make clear that&para;<br>“the ultimate issue of ‘voluntariness’ is a legal question.” Miller v.&para;<br>Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 110 (1985); see also Arizona v. Fulminante, 499&para;<br>U. S. 279, 287 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme&para;<br>Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica­&para;<br>tion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States.” §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>2 The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was Mincey v.&para;<br>Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978). Mincey involved the “virtually continu­&para;<br>ous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge&para;<br>of consciousness” who was in a hospital’s intensive care unit and who&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. DIXON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme&para;<br>Court unreasonably applied this Court’s precedent in&para;<br>Elstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received&para;<br>Miranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took&para;<br>him into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he&para;<br>had received Miranda warnings, the suspect again con­&para;<br>fessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the&para;<br>later, warned confession was admissible because “there is&para;<br>no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the sus­&para;<br>pect’s initial inculpatory statement, though technically&para;<br>in violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant&para;<br>inquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement&para;<br>was also voluntarily made.” 470 U. S., at 318 (footnote&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>As the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion explained, the&para;<br>circumstances surrounding Dixon’s interrogations demon­&para;<br>strate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon’s&para;<br>first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given&para;<br>water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.&para;<br>He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer’s&para;<br>name, even stating that the police were “welcome” to that&para;<br>information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had&para;<br>anything to do with Hammer’s disappearance. State v.&para;<br>Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1049.&para;<br>Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolic­&para;<br>ited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and&para;<br>wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.&para;<br>Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice&para;<br>received Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights&para;<br>form which stated that he was acting of his own free will.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>“clearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated” while in a “debilitat­&para;<br>ed and helpless condition.” Id., at 399–401. There is simply nothing in&para;<br>the facts or reasoning of Mincey suggesting that any of Dixon’s state­&para;<br>ments were involuntary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon’s first interrogation involved “an intentional Miranda violation.”&para;<br>The court concluded, however, that “as in Elstad, the&para;<br>breach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual&para;<br>compulsion” and thus there was no reason to suppress&para;<br>Dixon’s later, warned confession. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334,&para;<br>805 N. E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon’s&para;<br>confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was&para;<br>the product of a “deliberate question-first, warn-later&para;<br>strategy.” 627 F. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit relied heavily on this Court’s decision in Missouri&para;<br>v. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600 (2004).3 In Seibert, police em­&para;<br>ployed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda&para;<br>warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert&para;<br>until she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20­&para;<br>minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her&para;<br>to repeat her prior confession. 542 U. S., at 604–606, 616&para;<br>(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert’s second&para;<br>confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even&para;<br>though it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurali­&para;<br>ty of the Court reasoned that “[u]pon hearing warnings&para;<br>only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Seibert was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court’s opin­&para;<br>ion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon’s peti­&para;<br>tion for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision.&para;<br>It is thus an open question whether Seibert was “clearly established&para;<br>Federal law” for purposes of §2254(d). See Smith v. Spisak¸ 558 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). It is not necessary to decide that ques­&para;<br>tion here because Seibert is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme&para;<br>Court’s decision. Thus, if Seibert was clearly established law, the Ohio&para;<br>Supreme Court’s decision was not “contrary to” or “an unreasonable&para;<br>application of” Seibert. §2254(d). And if Seibert was not clearly estab­&para;<br>lished law, Seibert’s explication of Elstad further demonstrates that the&para;<br>Ohio Supreme Court’s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable&para;<br>application of Elstad.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. DIXON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>ing a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a&para;<br>genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so&para;<br>believing once the police began to lead him over the same&para;<br>ground again.” 542 U. S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (de­&para;<br>tailing a “series of relevant facts that bear on whether&para;<br>Miranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective&para;<br>enough to accomplish their object”). JUSTICE KENNEDY&para;<br>concurred in the judgment, noting he “would apply a&para;<br>narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case . . . in&para;<br>which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a&para;<br>calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.” Id.,&para;<br>at 622.&para;<br>In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the&para;<br>type that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the&para;<br>Miranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the sus­&para;<br>pect’s first, unwarned interrogation left “little, if anything,&para;<br>of incriminating potential left unsaid,” making it “unnatu­&para;<br>ral” not to “repeat at the second stage what had been said&para;<br>before.” 542 U. S., at 616–617 (plurality opinion). But in&para;<br>this case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first,&para;<br>unwarned interrogation that he had “[n]othing whatso­&para;<br>ever” to do with Hammer’s disappearance. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 186a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern&para;<br>here that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then&para;<br>led him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because&para;<br>there was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon&para;<br>contradicted his prior unwarned statements when he&para;<br>confessed to Hammer’s murder. Nor is there any evidence&para;<br>that police used Dixon’s earlier admission to forgery to&para;<br>induce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon de­&para;<br>clared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer&para;<br>before the second interrogation session even began. As the&para;<br>Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was&para;<br>simply “no nexus” between Dixon’s unwarned admission to&para;<br>forgery and his later, warned confession to murder. 101&para;<br>Ohio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1051.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the&para;<br>Miranda warnings did not “effectively advise the suspect&para;<br>that he had a real choice about giving an admissible&para;<br>statement” because the unwarned and warned interroga­&para;<br>tions blended into one “continuum.” 542 U. S., at 612, 617.&para;<br>Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so&para;<br>here. Four hours passed between Dixon’s unwarned inter­&para;<br>rogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which&para;<br>time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail&para;<br>and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and&para;<br>learned that police were talking to his accomplice and&para;<br>had found Hammer’s body. Things had changed. Under&para;<br>Seibert, this significant break in time and dramatic&para;<br>change in circumstances created “a new and distinct expe­&para;<br>rience,” ensuring that Dixon’s prior, unwarned interroga­&para;<br>tion did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda&para;<br>warnings he received before confessing to Hammer’s mur­&para;<br>der. 542 U. S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (“For example, a substantial&para;<br>break in time and circumstances between the prewarning&para;<br>statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most&para;<br>circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the&para;<br>two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has&para;<br>taken a new turn”).4&para;<br>The admission of Dixon’s murder confession was con­&para;<br>sistent with this Court’s precedents: Dixon received Mi——————&para;<br>4 The Sixth Circuit also concluded that “the Ohio Supreme Court&para;<br>erroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his&para;<br>confession was coerced.” Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d 553, 558 (2010). But&para;<br>the Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that “the state carries the burden&para;<br>of proving voluntariness.” State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 332,&para;<br>2004–Ohio–1585, 805 N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. That the court’s opinion&para;<br>discusses the absence of evidence of coerciveness alongside the affirma­&para;<br>tive evidence of voluntariness in no way indicates that the court shifted&para;<br>the burden onto Dixon.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. DIXON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>randa warnings before confessing to Hammer’s murder;&para;<br>the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by&para;<br>the sort of “two-step interrogation technique” condemned&para;<br>in Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon’s&para;<br>statements was the product of actual coercion. That does&para;<br>not excuse the detectives’ decision not to give Dixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the&para;<br>Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the ap­&para;<br>propriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon’s forgery confession&para;<br>and the attendant statements given without the benefit of&para;<br>Miranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court&para;<br>required Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without&para;<br>authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State’s&para;<br>highest court.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.
