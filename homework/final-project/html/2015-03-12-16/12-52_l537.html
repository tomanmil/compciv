Argued March 20, 2013—Decided May 13, 2013&para;<br>The Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994&para;<br>(FAAAA) preempts state laws “related to a price, route, or service of&para;<br>any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.”&para;<br>49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1). This provision borrows from the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which preempts state laws “related to a&para;<br>price, route, or service of an air carrier,” §41713(b)(1), but it adds the&para;<br>important qualification, “with respect to transportation of property.”&para;<br>Plaintiff-respondent Pelkey brought suit in New Hampshire Superior Court, alleging that defendant-petitioner Dan’s City Used Cars&para;<br>(Dan’s City), a towing company, took custody of his car after towing it&para;<br>from his landlord’s parking lot without Pelkey’s knowledge, failed to&para;<br>notify him of its plan to auction the car, held an auction despite&para;<br>Pelkey’s notice that he wanted to reclaim the car, and eventually&para;<br>traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his&para;<br>vehicle. In disposing of his car, Pelkey further alleged, Dan’s City did&para;<br>not meet the requirements contained in chapter 262 of the New&para;<br>Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, which regulates the disposal&para;<br>of abandoned vehicles by a “storage company.” Dan’s City’s misconduct, Pelkey charged, both violated New Hampshire’s Consumer Protection Act and breached the towing company’s statutory and common-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession&para;<br>of a bailor’s property. The court granted summary judgment to Dan’s&para;<br>City, concluding that the FAAAA preempted Pelkey’s claims. The&para;<br>New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held the FAAAA’s&para;<br>preemption clause inapplicable because Pelkey’s claims related to&para;<br>Dan’s City’s conduct in disposing of his car post-storage, not to conduct concerning “the transportation of property,” or a towing company’s “service.”&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Section 14501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims stemming&para;<br>from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(a) Where Congress has superseded state legislation by statute,&para;<br>this Court’s task is to “identify the domain expressly pre-empted,”&para;<br>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 541, focusing first on&para;<br>the statutory language, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S.&para;<br>658, 664. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S.&para;<br>364, 370, this Court’s reading of §14501(c)(1) was informed by decisions interpreting parallel language in the ADA’s preemption clause.&para;<br>Thus, the Court held, the phrase “related to” embraces state laws&para;<br>“having a connection with or reference to” carrier “ ‘rates, routes, or&para;<br>services,’ ” whether directly or indirectly. Ibid. At the same time, the&para;<br>breadth of the words “related to” does not mean that the preemption&para;<br>clause should be read with an “uncritical literalism.” New York State&para;<br>Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,&para;<br>514 U. S. 645, 655–656. The Court has cautioned that §14501(c)(1)&para;<br>does not preempt state laws affecting carrier prices, routes, and services “in only a ‘tenuous, remote, or peripheral . . . manner.’ ” Rowe,&para;<br>552 U. S., at 371. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) Pelkey’s state-law claims escape preemption because they are&para;<br>“related to” neither the “transportation of property” nor the “service”&para;<br>of a motor carrier. Although §14501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADA’s&para;<br>air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulation’s one conspicuous alteration—addition of the words “with respect to the transportation of property”—significantly limits the FAAAA’s preemptive&para;<br>scope. It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the “price, route,&para;<br>or service” of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also concern a motor carrier’s “transportation of property.” Title 49 defines&para;<br>“transportation,” in relevant part, as “services related to th[e] movement” of property, “including arranging for . . . storage [and] handling.” §13102(23)(B). Pelkey’s Consumer Protection Act and negligence claims are not “related to th[e] movement” of his car. Chapter&para;<br>262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation—&para;<br>here, by towing—has ended. Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct&para;<br>occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored. Dan’s City&para;<br>maintains that because §13102(23)(B)’s definition of “transportation”&para;<br>includes “storage” and “handling,” Pelkey’s claims fall within&para;<br>§14501(c)(1)’s preemptive ambit. But “storage” and “handling” fit&para;<br>within §13102(23)(B)’s definition only when those services “relat[e] to&para;<br>th[e] movement” of property. Thus temporary storage of an item in&para;<br>transit en route to its final destination qualifies as “transportation,”&para;<br>but permanent storage does not. Here, no storage occurred in the&para;<br>course of transporting Pelkey’s vehicle.&para;<br>Pelkey’s claims are also unrelated to a “service” a motor carrier&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>renders its customers. The transportation service Dan’s City provided—removal of Pelkey’s car from his landlord’s parking lot—did&para;<br>involve the movement of property, but that service ended months before the conduct on which Pelkey’s claims are based. Because chapter&para;<br>262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses “storage compan[ies]” and&para;<br>“garage owner[s] or keeper[s],” not transportation activities, it has&para;<br>neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services&para;<br>a motor carrier offers its customers. See Rowe, 552 U. S., at 371.&para;<br>The conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal of towed&para;<br>vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with Congress’ purpose in&para;<br>enacting §14501(c)(1), which was to displace “a State’s direct substitution of its own governmental commands for ‘competitive market&para;<br>forces’ in determining . . . the services that motor carriers will provide.” Id., at 372. The New Hampshire prescriptions Pelkey invokes&para;<br>hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a&para;<br>motor carrier to offer services not available in the market. Nor do&para;<br>they “freez[e] into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.” Ibid. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(c) Dan’s City’s additional arguments in favor of preemption are not&para;<br>persuasive. Dan’s City contends that because none of Pelkey’s claims&para;<br>fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), his claims must be preempted. But exceptions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in themselves delineate the scope of the rule. Here, the exceptions identify&para;<br>matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded&para;<br>from doing so, but they do not control more than that.&para;<br>Dan’s City also maintains that Pelkey’s claims are “related to” its&para;<br>towing service because selling Pelkey’s car was the means by which&para;<br>Dan’s City obtained payment for the tow. If such state-law claims&para;<br>were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contractbased dispute arising from a towing company’s disposal of a vehicle&para;<br>previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal. No such&para;<br>design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See Silkwood v.&para;<br>Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>163 N.

Codified at 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1), the provision reads:&para;<br>“[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of&para;<br>law related to a price, route, or service of any motor&para;<br>carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of&para;<br>property.”&para;<br>Plaintiff-respondent Robert Pelkey brought suit under&para;<br>New Hampshire law against defendant-petitioner Dan’s&para;<br>City Used Cars (Dan’s City), a towing company. Pelkey alleged that Dan’s City took custody of his car after towing&para;<br>it without Pelkey’s knowledge, failed to notify him of its&para;<br>plan to auction the car, held an auction despite Pelkey’s&para;<br>communication that he wanted to arrange for the car’s&para;<br>return, and eventually traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.&para;<br>Disposal of abandoned vehicles by a “storage company”&para;<br>is regulated by chapter 262 of the New Hampshire Revised&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Statutes Annotated. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§262:31 to&para;<br>262:40–c (West 2004 and 2012 West Cum. Supp.). Dan’s&para;<br>City relied on those laws to dispose of Pelkey’s vehicle&para;<br>for nonpayment of towing and storage fees. According to&para;<br>Pelkey, however, Dan’s City failed to comply with New&para;<br>Hampshire’s provisions governing the sale of stored vehicles and the application of sale proceeds. Pelkey charged&para;<br>that Dan’s City’s disposal of his car without following the&para;<br>requirements contained in chapter 262 violated the New&para;<br>Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, §358–A:2 (West&para;<br>2009), as well as Dan’s City’s statutory and common-law&para;<br>duties as bailee to exercise reasonable care while in possession of a bailor’s property.&para;<br>We hold, in accord with the New Hampshire Supreme&para;<br>Court, that state-law claims stemming from the storage&para;<br>and disposal of a car, once towing has ended, are not&para;<br>sufficiently connected to a motor carrier’s service with&para;<br>respect to the transportation of property to warrant preemption under §14501(c)(1). The New Hampshire law in&para;<br>point regulates no towing services, no carriage of property. Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles&para;<br>seeking to sell them. Congress did not displace the State’s&para;<br>regulation of that activity by any federal prescription.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 92 Stat.&para;<br>1705, largely deregulated the domestic airline industry.&para;<br>In keeping with the statute’s aim to achieve “maximum&para;<br>reliance on competitive market forces,” id., at 1706, Congress sought to “ensure that the States would not undo&para;<br>federal deregulation with regulation of their own.” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378&para;<br>(1992). Congress therefore included a preemption provision, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §41713(b)(1), prohibiting&para;<br>States from enacting or enforcing any law “related to a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>price, route, or service of an air carrier.”&para;<br>Two years later, the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 94&para;<br>Stat. 793, extended deregulation to the trucking industry.&para;<br>Congress completed the deregulation 14 years thereafter,&para;<br>in 1994, by expressly preempting state trucking regulation. Congress did so upon finding that state governance&para;<br>of intrastate transportation of property had become “unreasonably burden[some]” to “free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.” Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 440 (2002)&para;<br>(citing FAAAA §601(a)(1), 108 Stat. 1605). Borrowing&para;<br>from the ADA’s preemption clause, but adding a new&para;<br>qualification, §601(c) of the FAAAA supersedes state laws&para;<br>“related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier&para;<br>. . . with respect to the transportation of property.” 108&para;<br>Stat. 1606, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1) (emphasis added).1 The Act exempts certain measures from&para;<br>its preemptive scope, including state laws regulating&para;<br>motor vehicle safety, size, and weight; motor carrier insurance; and the intrastate transportation of household&para;<br>goods. §§14501(c)(2)(A)–(B). Also exempted from preemption are state laws “relating to the price” of “vehicle transportation by a tow truck,” if towing occurs without prior&para;<br>consent of the vehicle owner. §14501(c)(2)(C).&para;<br>This case involves the interaction between the FAAAA’s&para;<br>preemption clause and the State of New Hampshire’s&para;<br>regulation of the removal, storage, and disposal of abandoned motor vehicles.

Ours Garage &amp;&para;<br>Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 430 (2002).

N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§262:31 to 262:34, 262:40–&para;<br>a(I). It generally makes the owner of a towed vehicle&para;<br>responsible for reasonable removal and storage fees. See&para;<br>§262:33(I) (reasonable removal and storage charges “shall&para;<br>be a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the&para;<br>owner”); §262:33(II) (owner entitled to recover vehicle&para;<br>after “payment of all reasonable towing and storage&para;<br>charges”); §262:40–a(II) (owner of a vehicle towed from a&para;<br>parking lot or parking garage is responsible for “removal&para;<br>and storage charges” when the lot or garage conspicuously&para;<br>posts notice of parking restrictions).&para;<br>Under chapter 262, the custodian of a car that remains&para;<br>unclaimed for 30 days following a tow may dispose of the&para;<br>vehicle upon compliance with notice requirements.&para;<br>§§262:36–a(I), (II). A “garage owner or keeper” must post&para;<br>notices of an impending sale in public places and provide&para;<br>mail notice to the vehicle owner whenever the owner’s&para;<br>address may “be ascertained . . . by the exercise of reasonable diligence.” §262:38.

Pelkey’s 2004 Honda Civic remained in the&para;<br>lot during and after a February 2007 snowstorm. At the&para;<br>landlord’s request, Dan’s City towed and stored the vehicle. Confined to his bed with a serious medical condition,&para;<br>Pelkey did not know his car had been towed. Soon after&para;<br>removal of his car, Pelkey was admitted to the hospital for&para;<br>a procedure to amputate his left foot, during which he&para;<br>suffered a heart attack. He remained under hospital care&para;<br>until his discharge on April 9, 2007.&para;<br>Unaware of Pelkey’s identity or illness, Dan’s City&para;<br>sought permission from New Hampshire’s Department of&para;<br>Public Safety to sell the Honda at auction without notice.&para;<br>In response, the department identified Pelkey as the last&para;<br>known owner of the vehicle. Dan’s City wrote to Pelkey,&para;<br>notifying him that it had towed and was storing his car.&para;<br>When the post office returned the letter, checking the box&para;<br>“moved, left no address,” Dan’s City scheduled an auction&para;<br>for April 19. Meanwhile, in the days following Pelkey’s&para;<br>discharge from the hospital, his attorney learned from&para;<br>counsel for the apartment complex that the car had been&para;<br>towed by Dan’s City and was scheduled to be sold at public auction. On April 17, Pelkey’s attorney informed&para;<br>Dan’s City that Pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and&para;<br>reclaim his vehicle. Dan’s City nevertheless proceeded&para;<br>with the auction. Attracting no bidders, Dan’s City later&para;<br>disposed of the car by trading it to a third party.

Granting summary judgment to&para;<br>Dan’s City, the New Hampshire Superior Court concluded&para;<br>that Pelkey’s claims were preempted by the FAAAA.&para;<br>The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held&para;<br>the FAAAA’s preemption clause, 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1),&para;<br>inapplicable because Pelkey’s claims related to Dan’s&para;<br>City’s conduct in disposing of his Honda post-storage, not&para;<br>to conduct concerning “the transportation of property.”&para;<br>163 N. H. 483, 490–493, 44 A. 3d 480, 487–489 (2012)&para;<br>(emphasis deleted). Alternatively, the court ruled that,&para;<br>even if Pelkey’s claims could be said to concern the transportation of property, they did not “sufficiently relat[e] to a&para;<br>towing company’s ‘service’ to be preempted.” Id., at 493,&para;<br>44 A. 3d, at 490.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion in&para;<br>state supreme courts on whether 49 U.

S., at 449 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).4 As the New Hampshire Supreme Court correctly&para;<br>understood, for purposes of FAAAA preemption, it is not&para;<br>sufficient that a state law relates to the “price, route, or&para;<br>service” of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must&para;<br>also concern a motor carrier’s “transportation of property.”&para;<br>See 163 N. H., at 490, 44 A. 3d, at 487.&para;<br>Title 49 defines “transportation,” in relevant part, as&para;<br>“services related to th[e] movement” of property, “including arranging for, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in&para;<br>transit, refrigeration, icing, ventilation, storage, handling,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Although this statement appears in the Ours Garage dissent, nothing in the Court’s opinion in that case is in any way inconsistent with&para;<br>the dissent’s characterization of §14501(c)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Pelkey’s Consumer Protection&para;<br>Act and negligence claims are not “related to th[e] movement” of his car. Ibid. (emphasis added). He charges&para;<br>Dan’s City with failure to comply with chapter 262 and&para;<br>neglect of its statutory and common-law duties of care as&para;<br>a bailee of his stored vehicle. Chapter 262 does not limit&para;<br>when, where, or how tow trucks may be operated. The&para;<br>Chapter regulates, instead, the disposal of vehicles once&para;<br>their transportation—here, by towing—has ended. Pelkey&para;<br>does not object to the manner in which his car was moved&para;<br>or the price of the tow; he seeks redress only for conduct&para;<br>subsequent to “transportation,” conduct occurring after&para;<br>the car ceased moving and was stored.&para;<br>Dan’s City maintains that because §13102(23)(B)’s&para;<br>definition of “transportation” includes “storage” and “handling,” Pelkey’s claims, which do concern the storage and&para;<br>handling of his car, fall within §14501(c)(1)’s preemptive ambit. Dan’s City overlooks, however, that under&para;<br>§13102(23)(B), services such as “storage” and “handling”&para;<br>fit within the definition of “transportation” only when&para;<br>those services “relat[e] to th[e] movement” of property.&para;<br>Temporary storage of an item in transit en route to its&para;<br>final destination relates to the movement of property and&para;<br>therefore fits within §13102(23)(B)’s definition. But property stored after delivery is no longer in transit. Cf. 49&para;<br>CFR §375.609 (2012) (distinguishing between “storage-intransit” and “permanent storage” (regulation of Federal&para;<br>Motor Carrier Safety Administration)). Here, no storage&para;<br>occurred in the course of transporting Pelkey’s vehicle.&para;<br>Dan’s City’s storage of Pelkey’s car after the towing job&para;<br>was done, in short, does not involve “transportation” within the meaning of the federal Act.&para;<br>Pelkey’s claims also survive preemption under&para;<br>§14501(c)(1) because they are unrelated to a “service” a&para;<br>motor carrier renders its customers. The transportation&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>service Dan’s City provided was the removal of Pelkey’s&para;<br>car from his landlord’s parking lot. That service, which&para;<br>did involve the movement of property, ended months&para;<br>before the conduct on which Pelkey’s claims are based.&para;<br>His claims rely on New Hampshire’s abandoned vehicle&para;<br>disposal regime, prescribed in chapter 262, for the rules&para;<br>governing Dan’s City’s conduct.5 Chapter 262 addresses&para;<br>“storage compan[ies]” and “garage owner[s] or keeper[s],”&para;<br>not transportation activities.&para;<br>See N. H. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §§262:36–a, 262:38. Unlike Maine’s tobacco delivery&para;<br>regulations at issue in Rowe, chapter 262 has neither a&para;<br>direct nor an indirect connection to any transportation&para;<br>services a motor carrier offers its customers. See 552&para;<br>U. S., at 371. We need not venture an all-purposes definition of transportation “service[s]” in order to conclude that&para;<br>state-law claims homing in on the disposal of stored vehicles fall outside §14501(c)(1)’s preemptive compass.&para;<br>Our conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal&para;<br>of towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord&para;<br>with Congress’ purpose in enacting §14501(c)(1). Concerned&para;<br>that state regulation “impeded the free flow of trade,&para;<br>traffic, and transportation of interstate commerce,” Congress resolved to displace “certain aspects of the State&para;<br>regulatory process.” FAAAA §601(a), 108 Stat. 1605 (emphasis added). The target at which it aimed was “a State’s&para;<br>direct substitution of its own governmental commands for&para;<br>competitive market forces in determining (to a significant degree) the services that motor carriers will provide.” Rowe, 552 U. S., at 372 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Pelkey’s claims are far removed from Congress’ driving&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The parties dispute whether, as Pelkey alleges, conduct that violates&para;<br>chapter 262 may qualify as an unfair or deceptive act or practice&para;<br>proscribed by New Hampshire’s Consumer Protection Act. This dispute&para;<br>turns on interpretation of state law, a matter on which we express no&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

He sued under state consumer protection and&para;<br>tort laws to gain compensation for the alleged unlawful&para;<br>disposal of his vehicle. The state laws in question hardly&para;<br>constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a motor carrier to offer services not available in the&para;<br>market. Nor do the state laws invoked by Pelkey “freez[e]&para;<br>into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.” Ibid. New Hampshire’s laws on disposal of stored vehicles, moreover, will not open the way for&para;<br>“a patchwork of state service-determining laws, rules, and&para;<br>regulations.” Id., at 373. As Dan’s City concedes, abandoned vehicle laws like chapter 262 “do not hamper the&para;<br>operations of tow truckers” and “are not the kind of burdensome state economic regulation Congress sought to&para;<br>preempt.” Reply Brief 21.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Dan’s City advances two further arguments in favor of&para;<br>preemption. First, Dan’s City contends that Congress’&para;<br>enumeration of exceptions to preemption, detailed in 49&para;<br>U. S. C. §§14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), permits state regulation of motor carriers only when the State’s law comes&para;<br>within a specified exception. Because Pelkey’s claims do&para;<br>not fit within any exception to preemption, Dan’s City&para;<br>urges, those claims must be preempted. This argument&para;<br>exceeds sensible bounds. Exceptions to a general rule,&para;<br>while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in&para;<br>themselves delineate the scope of the rule. The exceptions&para;<br>to §14501(c)(1)’s general rule of preemption identify matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be&para;<br>precluded from doing so, but they do not control more than&para;<br>that.&para;<br>An example may clarify the point. Section 14501(c) does&para;<br>not exempt zoning regulations. Such laws, however, “are&para;<br>peculiarly within the province of state and local legislative&para;<br>authorities.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508, n. 18&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1975). It is hardly doubtful that state or local regulation&para;<br>of the physical location of motor-carrier operations falls&para;<br>outside the preemptive sweep of §14501(c)(1). That is so&para;<br>because zoning ordinances ordinarily are not “related to&para;<br>a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.” §14501(c)(1). The&para;<br>same is true of New Hampshire’s regulation of the disposal of stored vehicles.&para;<br>Dan’s City, in a second argument, urges otherwise.&para;<br>Pelkey’s claims, Dan’s City maintains, are “related to” the&para;<br>towing service it rendered because selling Pelkey’s car was&para;<br>the means by which Dan’s City obtained payment for the&para;<br>tow. But if such state-law claims are preempted, no law&para;<br>would govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute&para;<br>arising from a towing company’s disposal of a vehicle&para;<br>previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.&para;<br>Federal law does not speak to these issues.6 Thus, not&para;<br>only would the preemption urged by Dan’s City leave&para;<br>vehicle owners without any recourse for damages, it would&para;<br>eliminate the sole legal authorization for a towing company’s disposal of stored vehicles that go unclaimed. No&para;<br>such design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See&para;<br>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984)&para;<br>(“It is difficult to believe that Congress would, without&para;<br>comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those&para;<br>injured by illegal conduct.”).&para;<br>In sum, Dan’s City cannot have it both ways. It cannot&para;<br>rely on New Hampshire’s regulatory framework as authorization for the sale of Pelkey’s car, yet argue that Pelkey’s&para;<br>claims, invoking the same state-law regime, are preempted.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 There is an exception to Congress’ silence, but it is of no aid to Dan’s&para;<br>City: The Act spares from preemption laws “relating to the price of forhire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation&para;<br>is performed [as it was here] without the prior consent or authorization&para;<br>of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.”&para;<br>49 U.
