Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–8561. Argued January 22, 2014—Decided April 23, 2014&para;<br>The respondent victim in this case was sexually abused as a young girl&para;<br>in order to produce child pornography. When she was 17, she learned&para;<br>that images of her abuse were being trafficked on the Internet, in effect repeating the original wrongs, for she knew that her humiliation&para;<br>and hurt would be renewed well into the future as thousands of additional wrongdoers witnessed those crimes. Petitioner Paroline pleaded guilty in federal court to possessing images of child pornography,&para;<br>which included two of the victim, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §2252.&para;<br>The victim then sought restitution under §2259, requesting nearly $3&para;<br>million in lost income and about $500,000 in future treatment and&para;<br>counseling costs. The District Court declined to award restitution,&para;<br>concluding that the Government had not met its burden of proving&para;<br>what losses, if any, were proximately caused by Paroline’s offense.&para;<br>The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the Fifth Circuit to direct the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitution. Granting&para;<br>the writ on rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit held, inter alia, that&para;<br>§2259 did not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by the defendant, and that each defendant who possessed the victim’s images&para;<br>should be made liable for the victim’s entire losses from the trade in&para;<br>her images.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Restitution is proper under §2259 only to the extent the defendant’s offense proximately caused a victim’s losses. This provision has&para;<br>a broad restitutionary purpose, stating that a district court “shall order restitution for any offense” under Chapter 110 of Title 18, such as&para;<br>Paroline’s possession offense; requiring district courts to order defendants “to pay the victim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses&para;<br>as determined by the court,” §2259(b)(1); and expressly making “is-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>suance of a restitution order . . . mandatory,” §2259(b)(4)(A). The&para;<br>Government has the “burden of demonstrating the amount of the&para;<br>[victim’s] loss.” §3664(e).&para;<br>To say one event proximately caused another means, first, that the&para;<br>former event caused the latter, i.e., actual cause or cause in fact; and&para;<br>second, that it is a proximate cause, i.e., it has a sufficient connection&para;<br>to the result. The concept of proximate causation is applicable in&para;<br>both criminal and tort law, and the analysis is parallel in many instances. Section 2259(c) defines a victim as “the individual harmed&para;<br>as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter.” The words&para;<br>“as a result of ” plainly suggest causation, and the referent of “a&para;<br>crime” is the offense of conviction. The “full amount of the victim’s&para;<br>losses,” §2259(b)(1), includes “any costs incurred by the victim” for six&para;<br>enumerated categories of expense, §2259(b)(3). The reference to&para;<br>“costs incurred by the victim” is most naturally understood as costs&para;<br>arising “as a result of ” the offense of conviction, i.e., the defendant’s&para;<br>conduct. And the last of the six enumerated categories—for “other&para;<br>losses suffered . . . as a proximate result of the offense,”&para;<br>§2259(b)(3)(F)—clearly states that the causal requirement is one of&para;<br>proximate cause. This reading is supported by the canon of construction that, “[w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as&para;<br>applicable to all.” Porto Rico Railway, Light &amp; Power Co. v. Mor, 253&para;<br>U. S. 345, 348. The reading also presents a commonsense way to impose sensible limitations on claims for attenuated costs. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>2. Applying the statute’s causation requirements in this case, victims should be compensated and defendants should be held to account for the impact of their conduct on those victims, but defendants&para;<br>should only be made liable for the consequences and gravity of their&para;<br>own conduct, not the conduct of others. Pp. 11–25.&para;<br>(a) A somewhat atypical causal process underlies the losses here.&para;<br>It may be simple to prove aggregate losses, i.e., “general losses,”&para;<br>stemming from the ongoing traffic in the victim’s images, but the&para;<br>question for §2259 purposes is how much of these general losses were&para;<br>the “proximate result” of an individual defendant’s offense. Here, the&para;<br>victim’s costs of treatment and lost income resulting from the trauma&para;<br>of knowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over and over&para;<br>are direct and foreseeable results of child-pornography crimes, provided the prerequisite of factual causation is satisfied. The primary&para;<br>problem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(b) A showing of but-for causation is not the proper standard&para;<br>here, for it is not possible to prove that the victim’s losses would be&para;<br>less but for one possessor’s individual role in the large, loosely con-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>nected network through which her images circulate. The victim and&para;<br>the Government urge the Court to read §2259 to require a less restrictive causation standard in child-pornography cases like this.&para;<br>They endorse the theory of “aggregate causation,” one formulation of&para;<br>which finds factual causation satisfied where a wrongdoer’s conduct,&para;<br>though alone “insufficient . . . to cause the plaintiff ’s harm,” is, “when&para;<br>combined with conduct by other persons,” “more than sufficient to&para;<br>cause the harm.” 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical&para;<br>and Emotional Harm §27, Comment f. Tort law teaches that such alternative causal tests, though a kind of legal fiction, may be necessary to vindicate the law’s purposes, for it would be anomalous to&para;<br>turn away a person harmed by the combined acts of many wrongdoers simply because none of those wrongdoers alone caused the harm,&para;<br>and nonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by the combined wrongful acts of many would have no redress, while those hurt&para;<br>by the acts of one person alone would. These are sound principles.&para;<br>Taken too far, however, such alternative causal standards would&para;<br>treat each possessor as the cause in fact of all the trauma and attendant losses incurred as a result of all the ongoing traffic in the victim’s images. Aggregate causation logic should not be adopted in an&para;<br>incautious manner in the context of criminal restitution, which differs from tort law in numerous respects. Paroline’s contribution to&para;<br>the causal process underlying the victim’s losses was very minor,&para;<br>both compared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders&para;<br>and compared to the contributions of other individual offenders, particularly distributors and the initial producer of the child pornography. Congress gave no indication that it intended the statute to be&para;<br>applied in an expansive manner so starkly contrary to the principle&para;<br>that restitution should reflect the consequences of the defendant’s&para;<br>own conduct. The victim claims that holding each possessor liable for&para;<br>her entire losses would be fair and practical in part because offenders&para;<br>can seek contribution from one another, but there is no general federal right to contribution and no specific statutory authorization for&para;<br>contribution here. Her severe approach could also raise questions&para;<br>under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Pp. 12–&para;<br>19.&para;<br>(c) While the victim’s expansive reading must be rejected, that&para;<br>does not mean the broader principles underlying aggregate causation&para;<br>theories are irrelevant to determining the proper outcome in cases&para;<br>like this. The cause of the victim’s general losses is the trade in her&para;<br>images, and Paroline is a part of that cause. Just as it undermines&para;<br>the purposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by several&para;<br>wrongdoers, it would undermine §2259’s purposes to turn away victims in cases like this. With respect to the statute’s remedial pur-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>pose, there is no question that it would produce anomalous results to&para;<br>say that no restitution is appropriate in these circumstances, for&para;<br>harms of the kind the victim endured here are a major reason why&para;<br>child pornography is outlawed. The unlawful conduct of everyone&para;<br>who reproduces, distributes, or possesses images of the victim’s&para;<br>abuse—including Paroline—plays a part in sustaining and aggravating this tragedy. And there is no doubt Congress wanted restitution&para;<br>for such victims. Denying restitution would also be at odds with&para;<br>§2259’s penological purposes, which include the need to impress upon&para;<br>offenders that their conduct produces concrete and devastating&para;<br>harms for real, identifiable victims. Thus, where it can be shown&para;<br>both that a defendant possessed a victim’s images and that a victim&para;<br>has outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in her images&para;<br>but where it is impossible to trace a particular amount of those losses&para;<br>to the individual defendant utilizing a more traditional causal inquiry, a court should order restitution in an amount that comports&para;<br>with the defendant’s relative role in the causal process underlying&para;<br>the victim’s general losses.&para;<br>District courts should use discretion and sound judgment in determining the proper amount of restitution. A variety of factors may&para;<br>serve as guideposts. Courts might, as a start, determine the amount&para;<br>of the victim’s losses caused by the continuing traffic in the victim’s&para;<br>images, and then base an award on factors bearing on the relative&para;<br>causal significance of the defendant’s conduct in producing those&para;<br>losses. The victim finds this approach untenable because her losses&para;<br>are “indivisible,” but the Court is required to define a causal standard&para;<br>that effects the statute’s purposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a&para;<br>mechanical way in the criminal restitution context. She also argues&para;<br>she will be consigned to “piecemeal” restitution that may never lead&para;<br>to full recovery, but Congress has not promised victims full and swift&para;<br>restitution at the cost of holding a defendant liable for an amount&para;<br>drastically out of proportion to his individual causal relation to those&para;<br>losses. Furthermore, this approach better effects the need to impress&para;<br>upon defendants that their acts are not irrelevant or victimless.&para;<br>Pp. 19–25.&para;<br>(d) Though this approach is not without difficulties, courts can&para;<br>only do their best to apply the statute as written in a workable manner, faithful to the competing principles at stake: that victims should&para;<br>be compensated and that defendants should be held to account for the&para;<br>impact of their own conduct, not the conduct of others. District&para;<br>courts, which routinely exercise wide discretion both in sentencing&para;<br>generally and in fashioning restitution orders, should be able to apply&para;<br>the causal standard defined here without further detailed guidance.&para;<br>P. 25.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The relevant statutory provisions are set forth at 18 U. S. C. §2259. Enacted&para;<br>as a component of the Violence Against Women Act of&para;<br>1994, §2259 requires district courts to award restitution&para;<br>for certain federal criminal offenses, including childpornography possession.&para;<br>Petitioner Doyle Randall Paroline pleaded guilty to such&para;<br>an offense. He admitted to possessing between 150 and&para;<br>300 images of child pornography, which included two that&para;<br>depicted the sexual exploitation of a young girl, now a&para;<br>young woman, who goes by the pseudonym “Amy” for this&para;<br>litigation. The question is what causal relationship must&para;<br>be established between the defendant’s conduct and a&para;<br>victim’s losses for purposes of determining the right to,&para;<br>and the amount of, restitution under §2259.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Three decades ago, this Court observed that “the ex-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ploitive use of children in the production of pornography&para;<br>has become a serious national problem.” New York v.&para;<br>Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 749 (1982). The demand for child&para;<br>pornography harms children in part because it drives&para;<br>production, which involves child abuse. The harms caused&para;<br>by child pornography, however, are still more extensive&para;<br>because child pornography is “a permanent record” of the&para;<br>depicted child’s abuse, and “the harm to the child is exacerbated by [its] circulation.” Id., at 759. Because child&para;<br>pornography is now traded with ease on the Internet, “the&para;<br>number of still images and videos memorializing the&para;<br>sexual assault and other sexual exploitation of children,&para;<br>many very young in age, has grown exponentially.” United&para;<br>States Sentencing Comm’n, P. Saris et al., Federal&para;<br>Child Pornography Offenses 3 (2012) (hereinafter Sentencing Comm’n Report).&para;<br>One person whose story illustrates the devastating&para;<br>harm caused by child pornography is the respondent&para;<br>victim in this case. When she was eight and nine years&para;<br>old, she was sexually abused by her uncle in order to&para;<br>produce child pornography. Her uncle was prosecuted,&para;<br>required to pay about $6,000 in restitution, and sentenced&para;<br>to a lengthy prison term. The victim underwent an initial&para;<br>course of therapy beginning in 1998 and continuing into&para;<br>1999. By the end of this period, her therapist’s notes&para;<br>reported that she was “ ‘back to normal’ ”; her involvement&para;<br>in dance and other age-appropriate activities, and the&para;<br>support of her family, justified an optimistic assessment.&para;<br>App. 70–71. Her functioning appeared to decline in her&para;<br>teenage years, however; and a major blow to her recovery&para;<br>came when, at the age of 17, she learned that images of&para;<br>her abuse were being trafficked on the Internet. Id., at 71.&para;<br>The digital images were available nationwide and no&para;<br>doubt worldwide. Though the exact scale of the trade in&para;<br>her images is unknown, the possessors to date easily&para;<br>number in the thousands. The knowledge that her images&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>were circulated far and wide renewed the victim’s trauma&para;<br>and made it difficult for her to recover from her abuse. As&para;<br>she explained in a victim impact statement submitted to&para;<br>the District Court in this case:&para;<br>“Every day of my life I live in constant fear that someone will see my pictures and recognize me and that I&para;<br>will be humiliated all over again. It hurts me to know&para;<br>someone is looking at them—at me—when I was just&para;<br>a little girl being abused for the camera. I did not&para;<br>choose to be there, but now I am there forever in pictures that people are using to do sick things. I want it&para;<br>all erased. I want it all stopped. But I am powerless&para;<br>to stop it just like I was powerless to stop my uncle. . . . My life and my feelings are worse now because&para;<br>the crime has never really stopped and will never really stop. . . . It’s like I am being abused over and over&para;<br>and over again.” Id., at 60–61.&para;<br>The victim says in her statement that her fear and trauma&para;<br>make it difficult for her to trust others or to feel that she&para;<br>has control over what happens to her. Id., at 63.&para;<br>The full extent of this victim’s suffering is hard to grasp.&para;<br>Her abuser took away her childhood, her self-conception of&para;<br>her innocence, and her freedom from the kind of nightmares and memories that most others will never know.&para;<br>These crimes were compounded by the distribution of&para;<br>images of her abuser’s horrific acts, which meant the&para;<br>wrongs inflicted upon her were in effect repeated; for she&para;<br>knew her humiliation and hurt were and would be renewed into the future as an ever-increasing number of&para;<br>wrongdoers witnessed the crimes committed against her.&para;<br>Petitioner Paroline is one of the individuals who possessed this victim’s images. In 2009, he pleaded guilty in&para;<br>federal court to one count of possession of material involving the sexual exploitation of children in violation of 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §2252. 672 F. Supp. 2d 781, 783 (ED Tex. 2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Paroline admitted to knowing possession of between 150&para;<br>and 300 images of child pornography, two of which depicted&para;<br>the respondent victim. Ibid. The victim sought restitution&para;<br>under §2259, asking for close to $3.4 million, consisting&para;<br>of nearly $3 million in lost income and about $500,000&para;<br>in future treatment and counseling costs. App. 52, 104.&para;<br>She also sought attorney’s fees and costs. 672 F. Supp. 2d,&para;<br>at 783. The parties submitted competing expert reports.&para;<br>They stipulated that the victim did not know who Paroline&para;<br>was and that none of her claimed losses flowed from any&para;<br>specific knowledge about him or his offense conduct. Id.,&para;<br>at 792, and n. 11; App. 230.&para;<br>After briefing and hearings, the District Court declined&para;<br>to award restitution. 672 F. Supp. 2d, at 793. The District Court observed that “everyone involved with child&para;<br>pornography—from the abusers and producers to the endusers and possessors—contribute[s] to [the victim’s] ongoing harm.” Id., at 792. But it concluded that the Government had the burden of proving the amount of the victim’s&para;<br>losses “directly produced by Paroline that would not have&para;<br>occurred without his possession of her images.” Id., at&para;<br>791. The District Court found that, under this standard,&para;<br>the Government had failed to meet its burden of proving&para;<br>what losses, if any, were proximately caused by Paroline’s&para;<br>offense. It thus held that “an award of restitution is not&para;<br>appropriate in this case.” Id., at 793.&para;<br>The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the&para;<br>United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to&para;<br>direct the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitution in the amount requested. In re Amy, 591 F. 3d 792,&para;<br>793 (2009). The Court of Appeals denied relief. Id., at&para;<br>795. The victim sought rehearing. Her rehearing request&para;<br>was granted, as was her petition for a writ of mandamus.&para;<br>In re Amy Unknown, 636 F. 3d 190, 201 (2011).&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit reheard the case en banc along with&para;<br>another case, in which the defendant, Michael Wright, had&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Wright, 639 F. 3d 679,&para;<br>681 (2011) (per curiam). As relevant, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>set out to determine the level of proof required to award&para;<br>restitution to victims in cases like this. It held that §2259&para;<br>did not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by&para;<br>the defendant, and each defendant who possessed the&para;<br>victim’s images should be made liable for the victim’s&para;<br>entire losses from the trade in her images, even though&para;<br>other offenders played a role in causing those losses. In re&para;<br>Amy Unknown, 701 F. 3d 749, 772–774 (2012) (en banc).&para;<br>Paroline sought review here. Certiorari was granted to&para;<br>resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over the proper&para;<br>causation inquiry for purposes of determining the entitlement to and amount of restitution under §2259. 570 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2013). For the reasons set forth, the decision of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals is vacated.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Title 18 U. S. C. §2259(a) provides that a district court&para;<br>“shall order restitution for any offense” under Chapter 110&para;<br>of Title 18, which covers a number of offenses involving&para;<br>the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography&para;<br>in particular. Paroline was convicted of knowingly possessing child pornography under §2252, a Chapter 110&para;<br>offense.&para;<br>Section 2259 states a broad restitutionary purpose: It&para;<br>requires district courts to order defendants “to pay the&para;<br>victim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses as determined by the court,” §2259(b)(1), and expressly states that&para;<br>“[t]he issuance of a restitution order under this section is&para;<br>mandatory,” §2259(b)(4)(A). Section 2259(b)(2) provides&para;<br>that “[a]n order of restitution under this section shall be&para;<br>issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664,”&para;<br>which in turn provides in relevant part that “[t]he burden&para;<br>of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for&para;<br>the Government,” §3664(e).&para;<br>The threshold question the Court faces is whether §2259&para;<br>limits restitution to those losses proximately caused by the&para;<br>defendant’s offense conduct. The Fifth Circuit held that it&para;<br>does not, contrary to the holdings of other Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question. Compare, e.g., 701&para;<br>F. 3d, at 752 (no general proximate-cause requirement&para;<br>applies under §2259), with United States v. Rogers, 714&para;<br>F. 3d 82, 89 (CA1 2013) (general proximate-cause requirement applies under §2259); United States v. Benoit,&para;<br>713 F. 3d 1, 20 (CA10 2013) (same); United States v.

First, it means the former event caused the&para;<br>latter. This is known as actual cause or cause in fact. The&para;<br>concept of actual cause “is not a metaphysical one but an&para;<br>ordinary, matter-of-fact inquiry into the existence . . . of a&para;<br>causal relation as laypeople would view it.” 4 F.

So to say that one event was a proximate cause of&para;<br>another means that it was not just any cause, but one with&para;<br>a sufficient connection to the result.

A requirement of proximate cause&para;<br>thus serves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations&para;<br>where the causal link between conduct and result is so&para;<br>attenuated that the consequence is more aptly described&para;<br>as mere fortuity. Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517&para;<br>U. S. 830, 838–839 (1996).&para;<br>All parties agree §2259 imposes some causation requirement. The statute defines a victim as “the individual&para;<br>harmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this&para;<br>chapter.” §2259(c). The words “as a result of ” plainly&para;<br>suggest causation. See Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v.&para;<br>Valladolid, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 13); see&para;<br>also Burrage v. United States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)&para;<br>(slip op., at 5). And a straightforward reading of §2259(c)&para;<br>indicates that the term “a crime” refers to the offense of&para;<br>conviction. Cf. Hughey v. United States, 495 U. S. 411,&para;<br>416 (1990). So if the defendant’s offense conduct did not&para;<br>cause harm to an individual, that individual is by definition not a “victim” entitled to restitution under §2259.&para;<br>As noted above, §2259 requires a court to order restitu-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion for “the full amount of the victim’s losses,”&para;<br>§2259(b)(1), which the statute defines to include “any costs&para;<br>incurred by the victim” for six enumerated categories of&para;<br>expense, §2259(b)(3). The reference to “costs incurred by&para;<br>the victim” is most naturally understood as costs stemming from the source that qualifies an individual as a&para;<br>“victim” in the first place—namely, ones arising “as a&para;<br>result of ” the offense. Thus, as is typically the case with&para;<br>criminal restitution, §2259 is intended to compensate&para;<br>victims for losses caused by the offense of conviction. See&para;<br>id., at 416. This is an important point, for it means the&para;<br>central concern of the causal inquiry must be the conduct&para;<br>of the particular defendant from whom restitution is&para;<br>sought.&para;<br>But there is a further question whether restitution&para;<br>under §2259 is limited to losses proximately caused by the&para;<br>offense. As noted, a requirement of proximate cause is&para;<br>more restrictive than a requirement of factual cause alone.&para;<br>Even if §2259 made no express reference to proximate&para;<br>causation, the Court might well hold that a showing of&para;<br>proximate cause was required. Proximate cause is a&para;<br>standard aspect of causation in criminal law and the law&para;<br>of torts. See 1 LaFave §6.4(a), at 464–466; W. Keeton, D.&para;<br>Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law&para;<br>of Torts §41, p. 263 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and&para;<br>Keeton). Given proximate cause’s traditional role in causation analysis, this Court has more than once found a&para;<br>proximate-cause requirement built into a statute that did&para;<br>not expressly impose one. See Holmes, supra, at 265–268;&para;<br>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459&para;<br>U.

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Here, however, the interpretive task is easier, for the&para;<br>requirement of proximate cause is in the statute’s text.&para;<br>The statute enumerates six categories of covered losses.&para;<br>§2259(b)(3).&para;<br>These include certain medical services,&para;<br>§2259(b)(3)(A); physical and occupational therapy,&para;<br>§2259(b)(3)(B); transportation, temporary housing, and&para;<br>child care, §2259(b)(3)(C); lost income, §2259(b)(3)(D);&para;<br>attorney’s fees and costs, §2259(b)(3)(E); and a final&para;<br>catchall category for “any other losses suffered by the&para;<br>victim as a proximate result of the offense,” §2259(b)(3)(F).&para;<br>The victim argues that because the “proximate result”&para;<br>language appears only in the final, catchall category of&para;<br>losses set forth at §2259(b)(3)(F), the statute has no&para;<br>proximate-cause requirement for losses falling within the&para;<br>prior enumerated categories. She justifies this reading of&para;<br>§2259(b) in part on the grammatical rule of the last antecedent, “according to which a limiting clause or phrase . . .&para;<br>should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or&para;<br>phrase that it immediately follows.” Barnhart v. Thomas,&para;<br>540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). But that rule is “not an absolute&para;<br>and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.” Ibid. The Court has not applied it in a mechanical&para;<br>way where it would require accepting “unlikely premises.”&para;<br>United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 425 (2009).&para;<br>Other canons of statutory construction, moreover, work&para;<br>against the reading the victim suggests. “When several&para;<br>words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much&para;<br>to the first and other words as to the last, the natural&para;<br>construction of the language demands that the clause be&para;<br>read as applicable to all.” Porto Rico Railway, Light &amp;&para;<br>Power Co. v. Mor, 253 U. S. 345, 348 (1920). Furthermore,&para;<br>“[i]t is . . . a familiar canon of statutory construction that&para;<br>[catchall] clauses are to be read as bringing within a statute categories similar in type to those specifically enumerated.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc.,&para;<br>411 U. S. 726, 734 (1973). Here, §2259(b)(3)(F) defines a&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>broad, final category of “other losses suffered . . . as a&para;<br>proximate result of the offense.” That category is most&para;<br>naturally understood as a summary of the type of losses&para;<br>covered—i.e., losses suffered as a proximate result of the&para;<br>offense.&para;<br>The victim says that if Congress had wanted to limit the&para;<br>losses recoverable under §2259 to those proximately&para;<br>caused by the offense, it could have written the statute the&para;<br>same way it wrote §2327, which provides for restitution to&para;<br>victims of telemarketing fraud. Section 2327, which is&para;<br>written and structured much like §2259, simply defines&para;<br>the term “full amount of the victim’s losses” as “all losses&para;<br>suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.” §2327(b)(3). In essence the victim argues that the&para;<br>first five categories of losses enumerated in §2259(b)(3)&para;<br>would be superfluous if all were governed by a proximatecause requirement. That, however, is unpersuasive. The&para;<br>first five categories provide guidance to district courts as&para;<br>to the specific types of losses Congress thought would&para;<br>often be the proximate result of a Chapter 110 offense and&para;<br>could as a general matter be included in an award of&para;<br>restitution.&para;<br>Reading the statute to impose a general proximatecause limitation accords with common sense. As noted&para;<br>above, proximate cause forecloses liability in situations&para;<br>where the causal link between conduct and result is so&para;<br>attenuated that the so-called consequence is more akin to&para;<br>mere fortuity. For example, suppose the traumatized&para;<br>victim of a Chapter 110 offender needed therapy and had a&para;<br>car accident on the way to her therapist’s office. The&para;<br>resulting medical costs, in a literal sense, would be a&para;<br>factual result of the offense. But it would be strange&para;<br>indeed to make a defendant pay restitution for these costs.&para;<br>The victim herself concedes Congress did not intend costs&para;<br>like these to be recoverable under §2259. Brief for Respondent Amy 45. But she claims that it is unnecessary to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“read . . . into” §2259 a proximate-cause limitation in order&para;<br>to exclude costs of that sort. Ibid. She says the statute&para;<br>“contextually and inferentially require[s] a nexus for why”&para;<br>the losses were sustained—i.e., a sufficient connection to&para;<br>child pornography. Id., at 46.&para;<br>The victim may be right that the concept of proximate&para;<br>cause is not necessary to impose sensible limitations on&para;<br>restitution for remote consequences. But one very effective way, and perhaps the most obvious way, of excluding&para;<br>costs like those arising from the hypothetical car accident&para;<br>described above would be to incorporate a proximate-cause&para;<br>limitation into the statute. Congress did so, and for reasons given above the proximate-cause requirement applies&para;<br>to all the losses described in §2259. Restitution is therefore proper under §2259 only to the extent the defendant’s&para;<br>offense proximately caused a victim’s losses.&para;<br>III&para;<br>There remains the difficult question of how to apply the&para;<br>statute’s causation requirements in this case. The problem stems from the somewhat atypical causal process&para;<br>underlying the losses the victim claims here. It is perhaps&para;<br>simple enough for the victim to prove the aggregate losses,&para;<br>including the costs of psychiatric treatment and lost income, that stem from the ongoing traffic in her images as&para;<br>a whole. (Complications may arise in disaggregating&para;<br>losses sustained as a result of the initial physical abuse,&para;<br>but those questions may be set aside for present purposes.)&para;<br>These losses may be called, for convenience’s sake, a victim’s “general losses.” The difficulty is in determining the&para;<br>“full amount” of those general losses, if any, that are the&para;<br>proximate result of the offense conduct of a particular&para;<br>defendant who is one of thousands who have possessed&para;<br>and will in the future possess the victim’s images but who&para;<br>has no other connection to the victim.&para;<br>In determining the amount of general losses a defendant&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>must pay under §2259 the ultimate question is how much&para;<br>of these losses were the “proximate result,” §2259(b)(3)(F),&para;<br>of that individual’s offense. But the most difficult aspect&para;<br>of this inquiry concerns the threshold requirement of&para;<br>causation in fact. To be sure, the requirement of proximate causation, as distinct from mere causation in fact,&para;<br>would prevent holding any possessor liable for losses&para;<br>caused in only a remote sense. But the victim’s costs of&para;<br>treatment and lost income resulting from the trauma of&para;<br>knowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over&para;<br>and over are direct and foreseeable results of childpornography crimes, including possession, assuming the&para;<br>prerequisite of factual causation is satisfied. The primary&para;<br>problem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The traditional way to prove that one event was a factual cause of another is to show that the latter would not&para;<br>have occurred “but for” the former. This approach is a&para;<br>familiar part of our legal tradition, see 1 LaFave §6.4(b),&para;<br>at 467–468; Prosser and Keeton §41, at 266, and no party&para;<br>disputes that a showing of but-for causation would satisfy&para;<br>§2259’s factual-causation requirement. Sometimes that&para;<br>showing could be made with little difficulty. For example,&para;<br>but-for causation could be shown with ease in many cases&para;<br>involving producers of child pornography, see §2251(a);&para;<br>parents who permit their children to be used for childpornography production, see §2251(b); individuals who sell&para;<br>children for such purposes, see §2251A; or the initial&para;<br>distributor of the pornographic images of a child, see&para;<br>§2252.&para;<br>In this case, however, a showing of but-for causation&para;<br>cannot be made. The District Court found that the Government failed to prove specific losses caused by Paroline&para;<br>in a but-for sense and recognized that it would be “incredibly difficult” to do so in a case like this. 672 F. Supp. 2d,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 791–793. That finding has a solid foundation in the&para;<br>record, and it is all but unchallenged in this Court. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Amy 63; Brief for United States 19,&para;<br>25. But see Supp. Brief for United States 8–10. From the&para;<br>victim’s perspective, Paroline was just one of thousands of&para;<br>anonymous possessors. To be sure, the victim’s precise&para;<br>degree of trauma likely bears a relation to the total number of offenders; it would probably be less if only 10 rather&para;<br>than thousands had seen her images. But it is not possible to prove that her losses would be less (and by how&para;<br>much) but for one possessor’s individual role in the large,&para;<br>loosely connected network through which her images&para;<br>circulate. See Sentencing Comm’n Report, at ii, xx. Even&para;<br>without Paroline’s offense, thousands would have viewed&para;<br>and would in the future view the victim’s images, so it&para;<br>cannot be shown that her trauma and attendant losses&para;<br>would have been any different but for Paroline’s offense.&para;<br>That is especially so given the parties’ stipulation that the&para;<br>victim had no knowledge of Paroline. See supra, at 4.&para;<br>Recognizing that losses cannot be substantiated under a&para;<br>but-for approach where the defendant is an anonymous&para;<br>possessor of images in wide circulation on the Internet,&para;<br>the victim and the Government urge the Court to read&para;<br>§2259 to require a less restrictive causation standard, at&para;<br>least in this and similar child-pornography cases. They&para;<br>are correct to note that courts have departed from the butfor standard where circumstances warrant, especially&para;<br>where the combined conduct of multiple wrongdoers produces a bad outcome. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 10) (acknowledging “the undoubted reality that&para;<br>courts have not always required strict but-for causality,&para;<br>even where criminal liability is at issue”).&para;<br>The victim and the Government look to the literature on&para;<br>criminal and tort law for alternatives to the but-for test.&para;<br>The Court has noted that the “most common” exception to&para;<br>the but-for causation requirement is applied where “mul-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tiple sufficient causes independently . . . produce a result,”&para;<br>ibid.; see also 1 LaFave §6.4(b), at 467–469; 1 Restatement&para;<br>§27, at 376. This exception is an ill fit here, as all parties&para;<br>seem to recognize. Paroline’s possession of two images of&para;<br>the victim was surely not sufficient to cause her entire&para;<br>losses from the ongoing trade in her images. Nor is there&para;<br>a practical way to isolate some subset of the victim’s general losses that Paroline’s conduct alone would have been&para;<br>sufficient to cause. See Brief for United States 26, n. 11.&para;<br>Understandably, the victim and the Government thus&para;<br>concentrate on a handful of less demanding causation&para;<br>tests endorsed by authorities on tort law. One prominent&para;<br>treatise suggests that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more&para;<br>actors is so related to an event that their combined conduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,&para;<br>and application of the but-for rule to them individually&para;<br>would absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in&para;<br>fact of the event.” Prosser and Keeton §41, at 268. The&para;<br>Restatement adopts a similar exception for “[m]ultiple&para;<br>sufficient causal sets.” 1 Restatement §27, Comment f, at&para;<br>380–381. This is where a wrongdoer’s conduct, though&para;<br>alone “insufficient . . . to cause the plaintiff ’s harm,” is,&para;<br>“when combined with conduct by other persons,” “more&para;<br>than sufficient to cause the harm.” Ibid. The Restatement offers as an example a case in which three people&para;<br>independently but simultaneously lean on a car, creating&para;<br>enough combined force to roll it off a cliff. Ibid. Even if&para;<br>each exerted too little force to move the car, and the force&para;<br>exerted by any two was sufficient to the move the car, each&para;<br>individual is a factual cause of the car’s destruction. Ibid.&para;<br>The Government argues that these authorities “provide&para;<br>ample support for an ‘aggregate’ causation theory,” Brief&para;<br>for United States 18, and that such a theory would best&para;<br>effectuate congressional intent in cases like this, id., at&para;<br>18–19. The victim says much the same. Brief for Respondent Amy 42–43.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>These alternative causal tests are a kind of legal fiction&para;<br>or construct. If the conduct of a wrongdoer is neither&para;<br>necessary nor sufficient to produce an outcome, that conduct cannot in a strict sense be said to have caused the&para;<br>outcome. Nonetheless, tort law teaches that alternative&para;<br>and less demanding causal standards are necessary in&para;<br>certain circumstances to vindicate the law’s purposes. It&para;<br>would be anomalous to turn away a person harmed by the&para;<br>combined acts of many wrongdoers simply because none of&para;<br>those wrongdoers alone caused the harm. And it would be&para;<br>nonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by&para;<br>the combined wrongful acts of many (and thus in many&para;<br>instances hurt more badly than otherwise) would have&para;<br>no redress, whereas individuals hurt by the acts of one&para;<br>person alone would have a remedy. Those are the principles that underlie the various aggregate causation tests&para;<br>the victim and the Government cite, and they are sound&para;<br>principles.&para;<br>These alternative causal standards, though salutary&para;<br>when applied in a judicious manner, also can be taken too&para;<br>far. That is illustrated by the victim’s suggested approach&para;<br>to applying §2259 in cases like this. The victim says that&para;<br>under the strict logic of these alternative causal tests,&para;<br>each possessor of her images is a part of a causal set sufficient to produce her ongoing trauma, so each possessor&para;<br>should be treated as a cause in fact of all the trauma and&para;<br>all the attendant losses incurred as a result of the entire&para;<br>ongoing traffic in her images. Id., at 43. And she argues&para;<br>that if this premise is accepted the further requirement of&para;<br>proximate causation poses no barrier, for she seeks restitution only for those losses that are the direct and foreseeable result of child-pornography offenses. Because the&para;<br>statute requires restitution for the “full amount of the&para;<br>victim’s losses,” including “any . . . losses suffered by the&para;<br>victim as a proximate result of the offense,” §2259(b), she&para;<br>argues that restitution is required for the entire aggre-&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gately caused amount.&para;<br>The striking outcome of this reasoning—that each possessor of the victim’s images would bear the consequences&para;<br>of the acts of the many thousands who possessed those&para;<br>images—illustrates why the Court has been reluctant to&para;<br>adopt aggregate causation logic in an incautious manner,&para;<br>especially in interpreting criminal statutes where there is&para;<br>no language expressly suggesting Congress intended that&para;<br>approach. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–&para;<br>12). Even if one were to refer just to the law of torts, it&para;<br>would be a major step to say there is a sufficient causal&para;<br>link between the injury and the wrong so that all the&para;<br>victim’s general losses were “suffered . . . as a proximate&para;<br>result of [Paroline’s] offense,” §2259(b)(3)(F).&para;<br>And there is special reason not to do so in the context of&para;<br>criminal restitution. Aside from the manifest procedural&para;<br>differences between criminal sentencing and civil tort&para;<br>lawsuits, restitution serves purposes that differ from&para;<br>(though they overlap with) the purposes of tort law. See,&para;<br>e.g., Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 49, n. 10 (1986) (noting that restitution is, inter alia, “an effective rehabilitative penalty”). Legal fictions developed in the law of torts&para;<br>cannot be imported into criminal restitution and applied&para;<br>to their utmost limits without due consideration of these&para;<br>differences.&para;<br>Contrary to the victim’s suggestion, this is not akin to a&para;<br>case in which a “gang of ruffians” collectively beats a&para;<br>person, or in which a woman is “gang raped by five men on&para;<br>one night or by five men on five sequential nights.” Brief&para;<br>for Respondent Amy 55. First, this case does not involve a&para;<br>set of wrongdoers acting in concert, see Prosser and Keeton&para;<br>§52, at 346 (discussing full liability for a joint enterprise); for Paroline had no contact with the overwhelming&para;<br>majority of the offenders for whose actions the victim&para;<br>would hold him accountable. Second, adopting the victim’s&para;<br>approach would make an individual possessor liable for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the combined consequences of the acts of not just 2, 5, or&para;<br>even 100 independently acting offenders; but instead, a&para;<br>number that may reach into the tens of thousands. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Amy 65.&para;<br>It is unclear whether it could ever be sensible to embrace the fiction that this victim’s entire losses were the&para;<br>“proximate result,” §2259(b)(3)(F), of a single possessor’s&para;<br>offense. Paroline’s contribution to the causal process&para;<br>underlying the victim’s losses was very minor, both compared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders,&para;<br>and in comparison to the contributions of other individual&para;<br>offenders, particularly distributors (who may have caused&para;<br>hundreds or thousands of further viewings) and the initial&para;<br>producer of the child pornography. See 1 Restatement&para;<br>§36, and Comment a, at 597–598 (recognizing a rule excluding from liability individuals whose contribution to a&para;<br>causal set that factually caused the outcome “pales by&para;<br>comparison to the other contributions to that causal set”).&para;<br>But see id., §27, Reporters’ Note, Comment i, at 395 (“The&para;<br>conclusion that none of ” two dozen small contributions to&para;<br>a sufficient causal set was a cause of the outcome “is obviously untenable”). Congress gave no indication that it&para;<br>intended its statute to be applied in the expansive manner&para;<br>the victim suggests, a manner contrary to the bedrock&para;<br>principle that restitution should reflect the consequences&para;<br>of the defendant’s own conduct, see Hughey, 495 U. S., at&para;<br>416, not the conduct of thousands of geographically and&para;<br>temporally distant offenders acting independently, and&para;<br>with whom the defendant had no contact.&para;<br>The victim argues that holding each possessor liable for&para;<br>her entire losses would be fair and practical, in part because offenders may seek contribution from one another.&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Amy 58. If that were so, it might&para;<br>mitigate to some degree the concerns her approach presents. But there is scant authority for her contention that&para;<br>offenders convicted in different proceedings in different&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v.

There is&para;<br>no general federal right to contribution. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 96–97&para;<br>(1981). Nor does the victim point to any clear statutory&para;<br>basis for a right to contribution in these circumstances.&para;<br>She thus suggests that this Court should imply a cause of&para;<br>action. Brief for Respondent Amy 58. But that is a rare&para;<br>step in any circumstance. See, e.g., Stoneridge Investment&para;<br>Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.

S. 286, 291 (1993) (noting that this&para;<br>Court’s precedents “teach that the creation of new rights&para;<br>ought to be left to legislatures, not courts”). And it would&para;<br>do little to address the practical problems offenders would&para;<br>face in seeking contribution in any event, see Brief for&para;<br>United States 45–46, problems with which the victim fails&para;<br>to grapple.&para;<br>The reality is that the victim’s suggested approach&para;<br>would amount to holding each possessor of her images&para;<br>liable for the conduct of thousands of other independently&para;<br>acting possessors and distributors, with no legal or practical avenue for seeking contribution. That approach is so&para;<br>severe it might raise questions under the Excessive Fines&para;<br>Clause of the Eighth Amendment. To be sure, this Court&para;<br>has said that “the Excessive Fines Clause was intended to&para;<br>limit only those fines directly imposed by, and payable to,&para;<br>the government.” Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.&para;<br>v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 268 (1989). But&para;<br>while restitution under §2259 is paid to a victim, it is&para;<br>imposed by the Government “at the culmination of a criminal proceeding and requires conviction of an underlying”&para;<br>crime, United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 328&para;<br>(1998).

C. §3663A “is . . . to mete&para;<br>out appropriate criminal punishment”); Kelly, 479 U. S., at&para;<br>49, n. 10. That may be “sufficient to bring [it] within the&para;<br>purview of the Excessive Fines Clause,” Bajakajian, supra, at 329, n. 4. And there is a real question whether&para;<br>holding a single possessor liable for millions of dollars in&para;<br>losses collectively caused by thousands of independent&para;<br>actors might be excessive and disproportionate in these&para;<br>circumstances. These concerns offer further reason not to&para;<br>interpret the statute the way the victim suggests.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The contention that the victim’s entire losses from the&para;<br>ongoing trade in her images were “suffered . . . as a proximate result” of Paroline’s offense for purposes of §2259&para;<br>must be rejected. But that does not mean the broader&para;<br>principles underlying the aggregate causation theories the&para;<br>Government and the victim cite are irrelevant to determining the proper outcome in cases like this. The cause of&para;<br>the victim’s general losses is the trade in her images. And&para;<br>Paroline is a part of that cause, for he is one of those who&para;<br>viewed her images. While it is not possible to identify a&para;<br>discrete, readily definable incremental loss he caused, it is&para;<br>indisputable that he was a part of the overall phenomenon&para;<br>that caused her general losses. Just as it undermines the&para;<br>purposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by&para;<br>several wrongdoers, it would undermine the remedial and&para;<br>penological purposes of §2259 to turn away victims in&para;<br>cases like this.&para;<br>With respect to the statute’s remedial purpose, there&para;<br>can be no question that it would produce anomalous results to say that no restitution is appropriate in these&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>circumstances. It is common ground that the victim suffers continuing and grievous harm as a result of her&para;<br>knowledge that a large, indeterminate number of individuals have viewed and will in the future view images of the&para;<br>sexual abuse she endured. Brief for Petitioner 50; Brief&para;<br>for Respondent Wright 4; Brief for United States 23; Brief&para;<br>for Respondent Amy 60. Harms of this sort are a major&para;<br>reason why child pornography is outlawed. See Ferber,&para;<br>458 U. S., at 759. The unlawful conduct of everyone who&para;<br>reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of the&para;<br>victim’s abuse—including Paroline—plays a part in sustaining and aggravating this tragedy. And there can be no&para;<br>doubt Congress wanted victims to receive restitution for&para;<br>harms like this. The law makes restitution “mandatory,”&para;<br>§2259(b)(4), for child-pornography offenses under Chapter&para;<br>110, language that indicates Congress’ clear intent that&para;<br>victims of child pornography be compensated by the perpetrators who contributed to their anguish. It would undermine this intent to apply the statute in a way that&para;<br>would render it a dead letter in child-pornography prosecutions of this type.&para;<br>Denying restitution in cases like this would also be at&para;<br>odds with the penological purposes of §2259’s mandatory&para;<br>restitution scheme. In a sense, every viewing of child&para;<br>pornography is a repetition of the victim’s abuse. One&para;<br>reason to make restitution mandatory for crimes like this&para;<br>is to impress upon offenders that their conduct produces&para;<br>concrete and devastating harms for real, identifiable&para;<br>victims. See Kelly, supra, at 49, n. 10 (“Restitution is an&para;<br>effective rehabilitative penalty because it forces the defendant to confront, in concrete terms, the harm his actions have caused”). It would be inconsistent with this&para;<br>purpose to apply the statute in a way that leaves offenders&para;<br>with the mistaken impression that child-pornography&para;<br>possession (at least where the images are in wide circulation) is a victimless crime.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>If the statute by its terms required a showing of strict&para;<br>but-for causation, these purposes would be beside the&para;<br>point. But the text of the statute is not so limited. Although Congress limited restitution to losses that are the&para;<br>“proximate result” of the defendant’s offense, such unelaborated causal language by no means requires but-for&para;<br>causation by its terms. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 8) (courts need not read phrases like “results from”&para;<br>to require but-for causality where there is “textual or&para;<br>contextual” reason to conclude otherwise). As the authorities the Government and the victim cite show, the availability of alternative causal standards where circumstances&para;<br>warrant is, no less than the but-for test itself as a default,&para;<br>part of the background legal tradition against which Congress has legislated, cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). It&para;<br>would be unacceptable to adopt a causal standard so strict&para;<br>that it would undermine congressional intent where neither the plain text of the statute nor legal tradition demands such an approach.&para;<br>In this special context, where it can be shown both that&para;<br>a defendant possessed a victim’s images and that a victim&para;<br>has outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in&para;<br>those images but where it is impossible to trace a particular amount of those losses to the individual defendant by&para;<br>recourse to a more traditional causal inquiry, a court&para;<br>applying §2259 should order restitution in an amount that&para;<br>comports with the defendant’s relative role in the causal&para;<br>process that underlies the victim’s general losses. The&para;<br>amount would not be severe in a case like this, given the&para;<br>nature of the causal connection between the conduct of a&para;<br>possessor like Paroline and the entirety of the victim’s&para;<br>general losses from the trade in her images, which are the&para;<br>product of the acts of thousands of offenders. It would not,&para;<br>however, be a token or nominal amount. The required&para;<br>restitution would be a reasonable and circumscribed&para;<br>award imposed in recognition of the indisputable role of&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the offender in the causal process underlying the victim’s&para;<br>losses and suited to the relative size of that causal role.&para;<br>This would serve the twin goals of helping the victim&para;<br>achieve eventual restitution for all her child-pornography&para;<br>losses and impressing upon offenders the fact that childpornography crimes, even simple possession, affect real&para;<br>victims.&para;<br>There remains the question of how district courts should&para;<br>go about determining the proper amount of restitution. At&para;<br>a general level of abstraction, a court must assess as best&para;<br>it can from available evidence the significance of the individual defendant’s conduct in light of the broader causal&para;<br>process that produced the victim’s losses. This cannot be a&para;<br>precise mathematical inquiry and involves the use of&para;<br>discretion and sound judgment. But that is neither unusual nor novel, either in the wider context of criminal&para;<br>sentencing or in the more specific domain of restitution. It&para;<br>is well recognized that district courts by necessity “exercise . . . discretion in fashioning a restitution order.”&para;<br>§3664(a). Indeed, a district court is expressly authorized&para;<br>to conduct a similar inquiry where multiple defendants&para;<br>who have “contributed to the loss of a victim” appear&para;<br>before it. §3664(h). In that case it may “apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim’s loss . . . of each defendant.” Ibid.&para;<br>Assessing an individual defendant’s role in the causal&para;<br>process behind a child-pornography victim’s losses does&para;<br>not involve a substantially different or greater exercise of&para;<br>discretion.&para;<br>There are a variety of factors district courts might consider in determining a proper amount of restitution, and it&para;<br>is neither necessary nor appropriate to prescribe a precise&para;<br>algorithm for determining the proper restitution amount&para;<br>at this point in the law’s development. Doing so would&para;<br>unduly constrain the decisionmakers closest to the facts of&para;<br>any given case. But district courts might, as a starting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

These could include the&para;<br>number of past criminal defendants found to have contributed to the victim’s general losses; reasonable predictions of the number of future offenders likely to be caught&para;<br>and convicted for crimes contributing to the victim’s general losses; any available and reasonably reliable estimate&para;<br>of the broader number of offenders involved (most of whom&para;<br>will, of course, never be caught or convicted); whether the&para;<br>defendant reproduced or distributed images of the victim;&para;<br>whether the defendant had any connection to the initial&para;<br>production of the images; how many images of the victim&para;<br>the defendant possessed; and other facts relevant to the&para;<br>defendant’s relative causal role. See Brief for United&para;<br>States 49.&para;<br>These factors need not be converted into a rigid formula,&para;<br>especially if doing so would result in trivial restitution&para;<br>orders. They should rather serve as rough guideposts for&para;<br>determining an amount that fits the offense. The resulting amount fixed by the court would be deemed the&para;<br>amount of the victim’s general losses that were the “proximate result of the offense” for purposes of §2259, and thus&para;<br>the “full amount” of such losses that should be awarded.&para;<br>The court could then set an appropriate payment schedule&para;<br>in consideration of the defendant’s financial means. See&para;<br>§3664(f)(2).&para;<br>The victim says this approach is untenable because her&para;<br>losses are “indivisible” in the sense that term is used by&para;<br>tort law, i.e., that there is no “reasonable basis for the&para;<br>factfinder to determine . . . the amount of damages separately caused by” any one offender’s conduct.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability §26, p. 320&para;<br>(1999). The premise of her argument is that because it is&para;<br>in a sense a fiction to say Paroline caused $1,000 in losses,&para;<br>$10,000 in losses, or any other lesser amount, it is necessary to embrace the much greater fiction that Paroline&para;<br>caused all the victim’s losses from the ongoing trade in her&para;<br>images. But that is a non sequitur. The Court is required&para;<br>to define a causal standard that effects the statute’s purposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a mechanical way&para;<br>in the criminal restitution context. Even if the victim’s&para;<br>losses are fully “indivisible” in this sense (which is debatable), treating Paroline as a proximate cause of all the&para;<br>victim’s losses—especially in the absence of a workable&para;<br>system of contribution—stretches the fiction of aggregate&para;<br>causation to its breaking point. Treating him as a cause of&para;<br>a smaller amount of the victim’s general losses, taking&para;<br>account of his role in the overall causal process behind&para;<br>those losses, effects the statute’s purposes; avoids the&para;<br>nonsensical result of turning away victims emptyhanded;&para;<br>and does so without sacrificing the need for proportionality in sentencing.&para;<br>The victim also argues that this approach would consign&para;<br>her to “piecemeal” restitution and leave her to face “decades of litigation that might never lead to full recovery,”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Amy 57, which “would convert Congress’s promise to child pornography victims into an empty&para;<br>gesture,” id., at 66. But Congress has not promised&para;<br>victims full and swift restitution at all costs. To be sure,&para;<br>the statute states a strong restitutionary purpose; but that&para;<br>purpose cannot be twisted into a license to hold a defendant liable for an amount drastically out of proportion to&para;<br>his own individual causal relation to the victim’s losses.&para;<br>Furthermore, an approach of this sort better effects the&para;<br>need to impress upon defendants that their acts are not&para;<br>irrelevant or victimless. As the Government observes,&para;<br>Reply Brief for United States 18, it would undermine this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Of course the victim&para;<br>should someday collect restitution for all her childpornography losses, but it makes sense to spread payment&para;<br>among a larger number of offenders in amounts more&para;<br>closely in proportion to their respective causal roles and&para;<br>their own circumstances so that more are made aware,&para;<br>through the concrete mechanism of restitution, of the&para;<br>impact of child-pornography possession on victims.&para;<br>C&para;<br>This approach is not without its difficulties. Restitution&para;<br>orders should represent “an application of law,” not “a&para;<br>decisionmaker’s caprice,” Philip Morris USA v. Williams,&para;<br>549 U. S. 346, 352 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), and the approach articulated above involves discretion and estimation. But courts can only do their best to&para;<br>apply the statute as written in a workable manner, faithful to the competing principles at stake: that victims&para;<br>should be compensated and that defendants should be&para;<br>held to account for the impact of their conduct on those&para;<br>victims, but also that defendants should be made liable for&para;<br>the consequences and gravity of their own conduct, not the&para;<br>conduct of others. District courts routinely exercise wide&para;<br>discretion both in sentencing as a general matter and&para;<br>more specifically in fashioning restitution orders. There is&para;<br>no reason to believe they cannot apply the causal standard&para;<br>defined above in a reasonable manner without further&para;<br>detailed guidance at this stage in the law’s elaboration.&para;<br>Based on its experience in prior cases of this kind, the&para;<br>Government—which, as noted above, see supra, at 5–6,&para;<br>bears the burden of proving the amount of the victim’s&para;<br>losses, §3664(e)—could also inform district courts of restitution sought and ordered in other cases.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v.

But this inquiry, sensible as it may&para;<br>be, is not the one Congress adopted.

I must regretfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Section 2259(a) of Title 18 directs that a district court&para;<br>“shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter,”&para;<br>which includes Paroline’s offense of knowingly possessing&para;<br>child pornography in violation of section 2252. In case&para;<br>Congress’s purpose were not clear from its use of “shall,”&para;<br>section 2259(b)(4) then emphasizes that “[t]he issuance of&para;<br>a restitution order under this section is mandatory.”&para;<br>Section 2259(b)(1) spells out who may receive restitution, and for what. It provides that “[t]he order of restitution under this section shall direct the defendant to pay&para;<br>the victim (through the appropriate court mechanism) the&para;<br>full amount of the victim’s losses as determined by the&para;<br>court pursuant to [section 2259(b)(2)].” The term “ ‘victim’ ” is defined as “the individual harmed as a result of a&para;<br>commission of a crime under this chapter.” §2259(c). And&para;<br>the term “ ‘full amount of the victim’s losses’ includes any&para;<br>costs incurred by the victim for . . . medical services relating to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care”; “lost&para;<br>income”; and “any other losses suffered by the victim as a&para;<br>proximate result of the offense.” §§2259(b)(3)(A), (D), (F).&para;<br>Section 2259(b)(2) then describes how the district court&para;<br>must calculate restitution.

See ante, at 9–11 (citing §2259(b)(3)).&para;<br>Contrary to Paroline’s argument, the proximate cause requirement is easily satisfied in this case. It was readily&para;<br>foreseeable that Paroline’s crime could cause Amy to&para;<br>suffer precisely the types of losses that she claims: future&para;<br>lost wages, costs for treatment and counseling, and attorney’s fees and costs, all of which are eligible losses enumerated in section 2259(b)(3). There is a “direct relation”&para;<br>between those types of injuries and Paroline’s “injurious&para;<br>conduct.” Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992).

That is, restitution&para;<br>may not be imposed for losses caused by any other crime&para;<br>or any other defendant.1&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent dismisses section 3664(e),&para;<br>which is Congress’s direct answer to the very question&para;<br>presented by this case, namely, how to resolve a “dispute&para;<br>as to the proper amount . . . of restitution.” JUSTICE&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR thinks the answer to that question begins and&para;<br>ends with the statement in section 2259(b)(1) that the&para;<br>defendant must pay “the full amount of the victim’s losses.”&para;<br>See post, at 1, 2, 10, 15. But losses from what? The&para;<br>answer is found in the rest of that sentence: “the full&para;<br>amount of the victim’s losses as determined by the court&para;<br>pursuant to paragraph 2.” §2259(b)(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>“[P]aragraph 2,” of course, instructs that “[a]n order of&para;<br>restitution under this section shall be issued and enforced&para;<br>in accordance with section 3664 in the same manner as an&para;<br>order under section 3663A.” §2259(b)(2).

When&para;<br>Congress passed §2259 in 1994, it was common knowledge&para;<br>that child pornography victims suffer harm at the hands of&para;<br>numerous offenders who possess their images in common,&para;<br>whether in print, film, or electronic form.

The Government nonetheless requested restitution for additional losses based on different&para;<br>counts in the indictment that the Government had agreed&para;<br>to dismiss. Id., at 413.

Id., at 418.&para;<br>That commonsense holding, of course, casts no doubt on&para;<br>the ordinary practice of requiring restitution for losses&para;<br>caused by an offense for which a defendant is convicted,&para;<br>where the loss is the product of the combined conduct of&para;<br>multiple offenders. What troubles my colleagues in this&para;<br>case, then, is not the concept of restitution in cases involving losses caused by more than one offender. Their objection is instead to restitution in cases where the victim’s&para;<br>losses are caused by too many offenders. As THE CHIEF&para;<br>JUSTICE puts it, Congress wrote a law that would enable&para;<br>Amy to recover if only her images had been circulated by&para;<br>“a single distributor” to just a “handful of possessors.”&para;<br>Ante, at 6–7. But because she has been victimized by&para;<br>numerous distributors and thousands of possessors, she&para;<br>gets nothing. It goes without saying that Congress did not&para;<br>intend that result.&para;<br>My colleagues in dissent next assert that no restitution&para;<br>may be awarded because of §3664(e), which describes the&para;<br>Government’s burden of showing the “loss sustained by a&para;<br>victim as a result of the offense.” But that provision is&para;<br>nothing close to a “direct answer” to this case. Ante, at 4.&para;<br>It simply restates the question: What should a court do&para;<br>when the losses sustained by a victim are the “result of the&para;<br>[defendant’s] offense,” §3664(e), but that result is produced&para;<br>in combination with the offenses of others? One answer is&para;<br>that the defendant’s offense is a cause-in-fact only of losses&para;<br>for which it was a but-for cause. A second is that the&para;<br>offense is a cause-in-fact of losses for which it was part of&para;<br>the aggregate cause. The former would preclude restitution in cases like this; the latter would allow it. Given&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress’ “mandatory” command that courts “shall order&para;<br>restitution for any offense,” §§2259(a), (b)(4), it is beyond&para;<br>clear which answer Congress chose.2&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent also fails to contend with&para;<br>the ramifications of the suggestion that §3664(e) forecloses&para;<br>entry of restitution in cases where a victim suffers indivisible losses as a result of the aggregate conduct of numerous offenders. It claims that this reading of §3664(e)&para;<br>“will work just fine” for “common crimes” such as assault.&para;<br>Ante, at 5–6. But what about a victim of a vicious gang&para;<br>assault, where a single offender’s conduct cannot be labeled a but-for cause of any discrete injury? Such offenses&para;<br>are, unfortunately, all too common. See, e.g., Wheelock v.&para;<br>United States, 2013 WL 2318145, *2 (ED Wisc., May 28,&para;<br>2013) (defendant convicted for his participation in a gang&para;<br>rape of a 13-year-old victim in which he “and several other&para;<br>individuals had provided alcohol to the girl and, after she&para;<br>became intoxicated and unconscious, sexually assaulted&para;<br>her”); United States v. Homer B., 1990 WL 79705 (CA9,&para;<br>June 14, 1990) (similar). I would have thought it beyond&para;<br>refute that the victim of such a tragic offense would be&para;<br>entitled to restitution even though none of her losses may&para;<br>be attributed solely to any individual defendant.

Despite “assum[ing], for purposes of argument,” that §2259 incorporates aggregate causation, the dissent nevertheless applies but-for causation to determine the “full amount” of&para;<br>losses Paroline must pay. See ante, at 5, and n. 2 (arguing that Paroline can only be asked to pay “the full amount of the losses he caused,”&para;<br>not losses that he and others combined to cause). My dissenting&para;<br>colleagues cannot have it both ways. Either §2259 incorporates aggregate causation (in which case the full amount of Amy’s losses is all of&para;<br>the losses aggregately caused by Paroline and like offenders), or it&para;<br>requires but-for causation (in which case Amy gets nothing).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The majority accordingly holds&para;<br>that “a court applying §2259 should order restitution in an&para;<br>amount that comports with the defendant’s relative”&para;<br>contribution to “the victim’s general losses.” Ante, at 21.&para;<br>The majority’s apportionment approach appears to be a&para;<br>sensible one. It would, for instance, further the goal of&para;<br>“proportionality in sentencing,” avoid “turning away victims emptyhanded,” and “spread payment among” offenders. Ante, at 24–25.

But individuals need not act together&para;<br>to trigger joint and several liability; such liability applies equally to&para;<br>multiple actors who independently commit intentional torts that&para;<br>combine to produce an indivisible injury. Infra, at 11–14. And in any&para;<br>event, the offenders at issue in this case do act together, with the&para;<br>common end of trafficking in the market for images of child sexual&para;<br>abuse. See infra, at 12–13. While these offenders may not be physically in the same room when they commit their crimes, there is no reason to read §2259(b)(4)’s “mandatory” restitution command out of the&para;<br>statute for child abusers who hide behind the anonymity of a computer&para;<br>screen.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v.

That&para;<br>command is unequivocal, and it is buttressed by the tort&para;<br>law tradition of joint and several liability within which&para;<br>Congress legislated.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Once a defendant is found to bear a sufficient causal&para;<br>nexus to a victim’s harm, §2259 provides a straightforward instruction on how much restitution a court is to&para;<br>order: “The order of restitution under this section shall&para;<br>direct the defendant to pay the victim . . . the full amount&para;<br>of the victim’s losses.” §2259(b)(1). Because the word&para;<br>“shall” imposes a “discretionless obligatio[n],” Lopez v.&para;<br>Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241 (2001), a court considering a&para;<br>§2259 restitution request has no license to deviate from&para;<br>the statute’s command. It must enter an order for the “full&para;<br>amount of the victim’s losses,” regardless of whether other&para;<br>defendants may have contributed to the same victim’s&para;<br>harm.&para;<br>If there were any doubt on the matter, Congress eliminated it in §2259(b)(4)(B)(ii), which bars a court from&para;<br>“declin[ing] to issue [a restitution] order under this section” on the ground that a victim “is entitled to receive&para;<br>compensation for his or her injuries from the proceeds of&para;<br>insurance or any other source.” One “other source” from&para;<br>which a victim would be “entitled to receive compensation”&para;<br>is, of course, other offenders who possess images of her&para;<br>sexual abuse. It is unthinkable that Congress would have&para;<br>expressly forbidden courts to award victims no restitution&para;<br>because their harms have been aggregately caused by&para;<br>many offenders, only to permit restitution orders for a&para;<br>single penny for the same reason.&para;<br>B&para;<br>As the majority recognizes, Congress did not draft §2259&para;<br>in a vacuum; it did so in the context of settled tort law&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

And the nature of the child&para;<br>pornography industry and the indivisible quality of the&para;<br>injuries suffered by its victims make this a paradigmatic&para;<br>situation in which traditional tort law principles would&para;<br>require joint and several liability. By requiring restitution&para;<br>for the “full amount of the victim’s losses,” §2259(b)(1),&para;<br>Congress did not depart from these principles; it embraced&para;<br>them.&para;<br>First, the injuries caused by child pornography possessors are impossible to apportion in any practical sense. It&para;<br>cannot be said, for example, that Paroline’s offense alone&para;<br>required Amy to attend five additional minutes of therapy,&para;<br>or that it caused some discrete portion of her lost income.&para;<br>The majority overlooks this fact, ordering courts to surmise some “circumscribed” amount of loss based on a list&para;<br>of factors. Ante, at 21, 22–23; see also ante, at 7–10&para;<br>(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Section 2259’s full restitution requirement dispenses with this guesswork, however,&para;<br>and in doing so it harmonizes with the settled tort law&para;<br>tradition concerning indivisible injuries. As this Court&para;<br>explained this rule in Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale&para;<br>Transatlantique, 443 U.

The&para;<br>degree of concerted action required by the rule is not&para;<br>inordinate; “if one person acts to produce injury with full&para;<br>knowledge that others are acting in a similar manner and&para;<br>that his conduct will contribute to produce a single harm,&para;<br>a joint tort has been consummated even when there is no&para;<br>prearranged plan.” 1 F.

As Congress itself recognized, “possessors of such material” are an integral part of the “market&para;<br>for the sexual exploitative use of children.” §2251 Finding&para;<br>(12). Moreover, although possessors like Paroline may not&para;<br>be familiar with every last participant in the market for&para;<br>child sexual abuse images, there is little doubt that they&para;<br>act with knowledge of the inevitable harms caused by&para;<br>their combined conduct. Paroline himself admitted to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

See 672 F. Supp. 2d 781,&para;<br>783; App. 146.

Indeed, one expert describes Internet&para;<br>child pornography networks as “an example of a complex&para;<br>criminal conspiracy,” ibid.—the quintessential concerted&para;<br>action to which joint and several liability attaches.&para;<br>Lastly, §2259’s full restitution requirement conforms to&para;<br>what Congress would have understood to be the uniform&para;<br>rule governing joint and several liability for intentional&para;<br>torts. Under that rule, “[e]ach person who commits a tort&para;<br>that requires intent is jointly and severally liable for any&para;<br>indivisible injury legally caused by the tortious conduct.”&para;<br>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability&para;<br>§12, p. 110 (2007). There is little doubt that the possession of images of a child being sexually abused would&para;<br>amount to an intentional invasion of privacy tort—and an&para;<br>extreme one at that. See Restatement (Second) of Torts&para;<br>§652B, p. 378 (1976) (“One who intentionally intrudes,&para;<br>physically or otherwise, upon [another’s] private affairs or&para;<br>concerns, is subject to liability . . . if the intrusion would&para;<br>be highly offensive to a reasonable person”).4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Possession of child pornography under §2252 constitutes an intentional tort notwithstanding that the offense requires a mens rea of&para;<br>knowledge. See §2252(a)(3)(B) (punishing one who “knowingly sells or&para;<br>possesses” child pornography). One is “said to act knowingly if he is&para;<br>aware ‘ “that [a] result is practically certain to follow from his conduct.” ’ ” United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 404 (1980). That&para;<br>definition is, if anything, more exacting than the kind of “intent”&para;<br>required for an intentional tort under the Restatement, which defines&para;<br>“intent” to include situations where an actor “believes that . . . consequences are substantially certain to result from [his act].” Restatement&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Section 2259’s imposition of joint and several liability&para;<br>makes particular sense when viewed in light of this intentional tort rule. For at the end of the day, the question of&para;<br>how to allocate losses among defendants is really a choice&para;<br>between placing the risk of loss on the defendants (since&para;<br>one who is caught first may be required to pay more than&para;<br>his fair share) or the victim (since an apportionment regime would risk preventing her from obtaining full recovery). Whatever the merits of placing the risk of loss on a&para;<br>victim in the context of a negligence-based offense, Congress evidently struck the balance quite differently in this&para;<br>context, placing the risk on the morally culpable possessors of child pornography and not their innocent child&para;<br>victims.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Notwithstanding §2259’s text and the longstanding tort&para;<br>law traditions that support it, the majority adopts an&para;<br>apportionment approach based on its concern that joint&para;<br>and several liability might lead to unfairness as applied to&para;<br>individual defendants. See ante, at 15–22. The majority&para;<br>finds this approach necessary because §2259 does not&para;<br>provide individual defendants with the ability to seek&para;<br>contribution from other offenders. Ante, at 17–18. I agree&para;<br>that the statute does not create a cause of action for contribution, but unlike the majority I do not think the absence of contribution suggests that Congress intended the&para;<br>phrase “full amount of the victim’s losses” to mean something less than that. For instead of expending judicial&para;<br>resources on disputes between intentional tortfeasors,&para;<br>Congress crafted a different mechanism for preventing&para;<br>inequitable treatment of individual defendants—the use of&para;<br>periodic payment schedules.&para;<br>Section 2259(b)(2) directs that “[a]n order of restitution&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>(Second) of Torts §8A, p. 15 (1965). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>under this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.” Section 3664(f )(1)(A) in turn&para;<br>reiterates §2259’s command that courts “shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim’s&para;<br>losses.” But §3664 goes on to distinguish between the&para;<br>amount of restitution ordered and the schedule on which&para;<br>payments are to be made. Thus, §3664(f )(2) states that a&para;<br>court “shall . . . specify in the restitution order . . . the&para;<br>schedule according to whic[h] the restitution is to be paid,”&para;<br>and §3664(f)(3)(A) provides that “[a] restitution order may&para;<br>direct the defendant to make a single, lump sum payment”&para;<br>or “partial payments at specified intervals.” Critically, in&para;<br>choosing between lump-sum and partial payments, courts&para;<br>“shall” consider “the financial resources and other assets&para;<br>of the defendant,” along with “any financial obligations&para;<br>of the defendant, including obligations to dependents.”&para;<br>§§3664(f )(2)(A), (C).&para;<br>Applying these factors to set an appropriate payment&para;<br>schedule in light of any individual child pornography&para;<br>possessor’s financial circumstances would not be difficult;&para;<br>indeed, there is already a robust body of case law clarifying how payment schedules are to be set under §3664(f ).&para;<br>For example, Courts of Appeals have uniformly found it an&para;<br>abuse of discretion to require defendants to make immediate lump-sum payments for the full amount of a restitution award when they do not have the ability to do so. In&para;<br>such cases, Congress has instead required courts to impose periodic payment schedules. See, e.g., United States&para;<br>v. McGlothlin, 249 F. 3d 783, 784 (CA8 2001) (reversing&para;<br>lump-sum payment order where defendant “had no ability&para;<br>to pay the restitution immediately,” and requiring District&para;<br>Court to set a periodic payment schedule); United States v.&para;<br>Myers, 198 F. 3d 160, 168–169 (CA5 1999) (same). The&para;<br>existing body of law also provides guidance as to proper&para;<br>payment schedules. Compare, e.g., United States v. Calbat, 266 F. 3d 358, 366 (CA5 2001) (annual payment of&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>$41,000 an abuse of discretion where defendant had a net&para;<br>worth of $6,400 and yearly income of $39,000), with United&para;<br>States v. Harris, 60 F. Supp. 2d 169, 180 (SDNY 1999)&para;<br>(setting payment schedule for the greater of $35 per&para;<br>month or 10% of defendant’s gross income).&para;<br>Section 3664’s provision for partial periodic payments&para;<br>thus alleviates any concerns of unfairness for the vast&para;<br>number of child pornography defendants who have modest&para;<br>financial resources. A more difficult challenge is presented,&para;<br>however, by the case of a wealthy defendant who would&para;<br>be able to satisfy a large restitution judgment in an immediate lump-sum payment. But the statute is fully capable&para;<br>of ensuring just results for these defendants, too. For in&para;<br>addition to an offender’s financial circumstances, §3664&para;<br>permits courts to consider other factors “in the interest of&para;<br>justice” when deciding whether to impose a payment&para;<br>schedule. See §3664(f )(2) (district court shall specify&para;<br>payment schedule “pursuant to section 3572”); §3572(d)(1)&para;<br>(restitution order shall be payable in periodic installments&para;<br>if “in the interest of justice”).&para;<br>Accordingly, in the context of a restitution order against&para;<br>a wealthy child pornography possessor, it would likely be&para;<br>in the interest of justice for a district court to set a payment schedule requiring the defendant to pay restitution&para;<br>in amounts equal to the periodic losses that the district&para;<br>court finds will actually be “incurred by the victim,”&para;<br>§2259(b)(3), in the given timeframe. In this case, for&para;<br>example, Amy’s expert estimates that she will suffer&para;<br>approximately $3.4 million in losses from medical costs&para;<br>and lost income over the next 60 years of her life, or approximately $56,000 per year. If that estimate is deemed&para;<br>accurate, a court would enter a restitution order against a&para;<br>wealthy defendant for the full $3.4 million amount of&para;<br>Amy’s losses, and could make it payable on an annual&para;<br>schedule of $56,000 per year. Doing so would serve the&para;<br>interest of justice because the periodic payment schedule&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would allow the individual wealthy defendant’s ultimate&para;<br>burden to be substantially offset by payments made by&para;<br>other offenders,5 while the entry of the full restitution&para;<br>award would provide certainty to Amy that she will be&para;<br>made whole for her losses.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Although I ultimately reach a different conclusion as to&para;<br>the proper interpretation of the statutory scheme, I do&para;<br>appreciate the caution with which the Court has announced its approach. For example, the Court expressly&para;<br>rejects the possibility of district courts entering restitution&para;<br>orders for “token or nominal amount[s].” Ante, at 21.&para;<br>That point is important because, if taken out of context,&para;<br>aspects of the Court’s opinion might be construed otherwise. For instance, the Court states that in estimating a&para;<br>restitution amount, a district court may consider “the&para;<br>broader number of offenders involved (most of whom will,&para;<br>of course, never be caught or convicted).” Ante, at 23. If&para;<br>that factor is given too much weight, it could lead to exactly the type of trivial restitution awards the Court disclaims. Amy’s counsel has noted, for instance, that in&para;<br>light of the large number of persons who possess her images, a truly proportional approach to restitution would&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 As the facts of this case show, the offset would be significant. Between June 2009 and December 11, 2013, Amy obtained restitution&para;<br>awards from 182 persons, 161 of whom were ordered to pay an amount&para;<br>between $1,000 and $530,000. See Restitution Awards for Amy&para;<br>Through December 11, 2013, Lodging of United States. If these offenders (and new offenders caught each month) were instead ordered to pay&para;<br>the full amount of restitution in periodic amounts according to their&para;<br>financial means, a wealthy defendant’s annual obligation would terminate long before he would be required to pay anything close to the full&para;<br>$3.4 million. For once a victim receives the full amount of restitution,&para;<br>all outstanding obligations expire because §2259 does not displace the&para;<br>settled joint and several liability rule forbidding double recovery. See&para;<br>Restatement (Second) of Torts §885(3) (1979), see also, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Nucci, 364 F. 3d 419, 423 (CA2 2004).&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>PAROLINE v.

Congress obviously&para;<br>did not intend that outcome, and the Court wisely refuses&para;<br>to permit it.6&para;<br>In the end, of course, it is Congress that will have the&para;<br>final say. If Congress wishes to recodify its full restitution&para;<br>command, it can do so in language perhaps even more&para;<br>clear than §2259’s “mandatory” directive to order restitution for the “full amount of the victim’s losses.” Congress&para;<br>might amend the statute, for example, to include the term&para;<br>“aggregate causation.” Alternatively, to avoid the uncertainty in the Court’s apportionment approach, Congress&para;<br>might wish to enact fixed minimum restitution amounts.&para;<br>See, e.g., §2255 (statutorily imposed $150,000 minimum&para;<br>civil remedy). In the meanwhile, it is my hope that the&para;<br>Court’s approach will not unduly undermine the ability of&para;<br>victims like Amy to recover for—and from—the unfathomable harms they have sustained.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The Court mentions that Amy received roughly $6,000 from her&para;<br>uncle, the person responsible for abusing her as a child.
