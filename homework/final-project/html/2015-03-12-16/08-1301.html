UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1301. Argued February 24, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010&para;<br>Enacted in 2006, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act&para;<br>(SORNA) makes it a federal crime for, inter alia, any person (1) who&para;<br>“is required to register under [SORNA],” and (2) who “travels in in&para;<br>terstate or foreign commerce,” to (3) “knowingly fai[l] to register or&para;<br>update a registration,” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). Before SORNA’s enact&para;<br>ment, petitioner Carr, a registered sex offender in Alabama, relocated&para;<br>to Indiana without complying with the latter State’s registration re&para;<br>quirements. Carr was indicted under §2250 post-SORNA. The Fed&para;<br>eral District Court denied Carr’s motion to dismiss, which asserted&para;<br>that the §2250 prosecution would violate the Constitution’s Ex Post&para;<br>Facto Clause because he had traveled to Indiana before SORNA’s ef&para;<br>fective date. Carr then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.&para;<br>Affirming the conviction, the Seventh Circuit held that §2250 does&para;<br>not require that a defendant’s travel postdate SORNA and that reli&para;<br>ance on a defendant’s pre-SORNA travel poses no ex post facto prob&para;<br>lem so long as the defendant had a reasonable time to register postSORNA but failed to do so, as had Carr.&para;<br>Held: Section 2250 does not apply to sex offenders whose interstate&para;<br>travel occurred before SORNA’s effective date. Pp. 5–18.&para;<br>(a) The Court rejects the Government’s view that §2250(a) requires&para;<br>a sex-offense conviction, subsequent interstate travel, and then a&para;<br>failure to register, and that only the last of these events must occur&para;<br>after SORNA took effect. The Court instead accepts Carr’s interpre&para;<br>tation that the statute does not impose liability unless a person, after&para;<br>becoming subject to SORNA’s registration requirements, travels&para;<br>across state lines and then fails to register. That interpretation bet&para;<br>ter accords with §2250(a)’s text, the first element of which can only be&para;<br>satisfied when a person “is required to register under SORNA.”&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§2250(a)(1). That §2250 sets forth the travel requirement in the pre&para;<br>sent tense (“travels”) rather than in the past or present perfect&para;<br>(“traveled” or “has traveled”) reinforces this conclusion. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333. And because the Dic&para;<br>tionary Act’s provision that statutory “words used in the present&para;<br>tense include the future as well as the present,” 1 U. S. C. §1, implies&para;<br>that the present tense generally does not include the past, regulating&para;<br>a person who “travels” is not readily understood to encompass a per&para;<br>son whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect. Indeed,&para;<br>there appears to be no instance in which this Court has construed a&para;<br>present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.&para;<br>The statutory context also supports a forward-looking construction of&para;<br>“travels.” First, the word “travels” is followed in §2250(a)(2)(B) by a&para;<br>series of other present tense verbs—“enters or leaves, or resides.” A&para;<br>statute’s “undeviating use of the present tense” is a “striking&para;<br>indic[ator]” of its “prospective orientation.” Gwaltney of Smithfield,&para;<br>Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 59. Second,&para;<br>the other elements of a §2250 violation are similarly set forth in the&para;<br>present tense: Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to&para;<br>any person who “is required to register under [SORNA]” and who&para;<br>“knowingly fails to register or update a registration.” (Emphasis&para;<br>added.) Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy&para;<br>§2250’s first two requirements but not the third, it presumably would&para;<br>have varied the verb tenses, as it has in numerous other federal stat&para;<br>utes. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(b) The Government’s two principal arguments for construing the&para;<br>statute to cover pre-SORNA travel are unpersuasive. Pp. 11–18.&para;<br>(1) The claim that such a reading avoids an “anomaly” in the&para;<br>statute’s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders is rejected.&para;<br>Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons&para;<br>who fail to adhere to SORNA’s registration requirements: any person&para;<br>who is a sex offender “by reason of a conviction under Federal law&para;<br>. . . ,” §2250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under&para;<br>SORNA who “travels in interstate or foreign commerce,”&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(B). The Government’s assertion that §2250(a)(2)’s juris&para;<br>dictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both&para;<br>federal and state sex offenders is little more than ipse dixit. It is en&para;<br>tirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNA’s registra&para;<br>tion requirements by federal sex offenders, who typically would have&para;<br>spent time under federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reason&para;<br>able for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for&para;<br>supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and&para;<br>to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>when, after SORNA’s enactment, they use interstate commerce&para;<br>channels to evade a State’s reach. The Seventh Circuit erred in&para;<br>analogizing §2250 to 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which prohibits convicted&para;<br>felons from “possess[ing] in . . . commerc[e] any firearm or ammuni&para;<br>tion.” According to the lower court, §2250(a), like §922(g), uses&para;<br>movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to es&para;<br>tablish a constitutional predicate for the statute, not to create a tem&para;<br>poral requirement. However, the proper analogy here is not between&para;<br>the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm, but be&para;<br>tween the sex offender who “travels” and the convicted felon who&para;<br>“possesses.” The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve&para;<br>as a jurisdictional predicate for §2250, but it is also, like the act of&para;<br>possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(2) Also unavailing is the Government’s invocation of one of&para;<br>SORNA’s purposes, to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by&para;<br>their registration obligations. The Government’s argument confuses&para;<br>SORNA’s general goal with §2250’s specific purpose. Section 2250 is&para;<br>not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it&para;<br>is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address defi&para;<br>ciencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through&para;<br>the cracks. By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information&para;<br>and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these other provisions, not&para;<br>§2250, stand at the center of Congress’ effort to account for missing&para;<br>sex offenders. While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment&para;<br>under §2250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing&para;<br>sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad&para;<br>goal. Taking account of SORNA’s overall structure, there is little&para;<br>reason to doubt that Congress intended §2250 to do exactly what it&para;<br>says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude&para;<br>SORNA’s registration requirements by traveling in interstate com&para;<br>merce. Pp. 14–17.&para;<br>(3) None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evi&para;<br>dence of SORNA’s purpose calls this reading into question. To the&para;<br>contrary, the House Judiciary Committee’s Report suggests not only&para;<br>that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Con&para;<br>gress’ goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to&para;<br>adopt. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(c) Because §2250 liability cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA&para;<br>travel, the Court need not address whether the statute violates the&para;<br>Ex Post Facto Clause.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 1, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Since 1994, federal law has required States, as a condi&para;<br>tion for the receipt of certain law enforcement funds, to&para;<br>maintain federally compliant systems for sex-offender&para;<br>registration and community notification. In an effort to&para;<br>make these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform,&para;<br>and effective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender&para;<br>Registration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part&para;<br>of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub.&para;<br>L. 109–248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590. Among its provisions,&para;<br>the Act established a federal criminal offense covering,&para;<br>inter alia, any person who (1) “is required to register&para;<br>under [SORNA],” (2) “travels in interstate or foreign com&para;<br>merce,” and (3) “knowingly fails to register or update a&para;<br>registration.” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). At issue in this case is&para;<br>whether §2250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate&para;<br>travel occurred prior to SORNA’s effective date and, if so,&para;<br>whether the statute runs afoul of the Constitution’s prohi&para;<br>bition on ex post facto laws. See Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Liability&para;<br>under §2250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA&para;<br>travel. We therefore do not address the ex post facto&para;<br>question.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>In May 2004, petitioner Thomas Carr pleaded guilty in&para;<br>Alabama state court to first-degree sexual abuse. He was&para;<br>sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, with all but two&para;<br>years suspended. Receiving credit for time previously&para;<br>served, Carr was released on probation on July 3, 2004,&para;<br>and he registered as a sex offender as required by Ala&para;<br>bama law.&para;<br>In late 2004 or early 2005, prior to SORNA’s enactment,&para;<br>Carr relocated from Alabama to Indiana. He did not&para;<br>comply with Indiana’s sex-offender registration require&para;<br>ments. In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law&para;<br>enforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his in&para;<br>volvement in a fight.&para;<br>On August 22, 2007, federal prosecutors filed an indict&para;<br>ment in the United States District Court for the Northern&para;<br>District of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in&para;<br>violation of §2250. Carr moved to dismiss the indictment,&para;<br>asserting that because he traveled to Indiana prior to&para;<br>SORNA’s effective date, it would violate the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause to prosecute him under §2250. The District Court&para;<br>denied Carr’s motion, and Carr entered a conditional&para;<br>guilty plea, preserving his right to appeal. He received a&para;<br>30-month prison sentence.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit consolidated Carr’s appeal with that of a similarly&para;<br>situated defendant, who, in addition to raising an ex post&para;<br>facto claim, asserted that §2250, by its terms, does not&para;<br>apply to persons whose interstate travel preceded&para;<br>SORNA’s enactment. Beginning with the statutory argu&para;<br>ment, the Court of Appeals held that §2250 “does not&para;<br>require that the defendant’s travel postdate the Act.”&para;<br>United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008). The&para;<br>court relied principally on its understanding of SORNA’s&para;<br>underlying purpose:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“The evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that convicted&para;<br>sex offenders registered in one state might move to&para;<br>another state, fail to register there, and thus leave the&para;<br>public unprotected. The concern is as acute in a case&para;<br>in which the offender moved before the Act was&para;<br>passed as in one in which he moved afterward.” Ibid.&para;<br>(citation omitted).&para;<br>The court drew an analogy to 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which&para;<br>prohibits convicted felons from “possess[ing] in or affecting&para;<br>commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.” “The danger&para;<br>posed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun&para;<br>crossed state lines . . . , and so it need not have crossed&para;<br>after the statute was passed.” 551 F. 3d, at 582 (citing&para;<br>Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563 (1977)).&para;<br>According to the court, §2250(a), like §922(g), uses move&para;<br>ment in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element&para;<br>“to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute . . .&para;<br>rather than to create a temporal requirement.” 551 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 583.&para;<br>Reading §2250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel, the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit’s decision in United States v. Husted, 545&para;<br>F. 3d 1240 (2008). In holding that §2250’s coverage “is&para;<br>limited to those individuals who travel in interstate com&para;<br>merce after the Act’s effective date,” the Tenth Circuit&para;<br>emphasized “Congress’s use of the present tense form of&para;<br>the verb ‘to travel’ . . . , which according to ordinary Eng&para;<br>lish grammar, does not refer to travel that has already&para;<br>occurred.” Id., at 1243–1244. Rejecting this analysis, the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit characterized Congress’ choice of tenses&para;<br>as “ ‘not very revealing.’ ” 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting Scar&para;<br>borough, 431 U. S., at 571).&para;<br>Having dispensed with the statutory question, the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his co&para;<br>appellant that predicating a §2250 prosecution on pre&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>SORNA travel violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Reliance&para;<br>on a defendant’s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded,&para;<br>poses no ex post facto problem so long as the defendant&para;<br>had “reasonable time” to register after SORNA took effect&para;<br>but failed to do so. 551 F. 3d, at 585. Noting that Carr&para;<br>remained unregistered five months after SORNA became&para;<br>applicable to him, the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convic&para;<br>tion. Id., at 586–587. The court reversed the conviction of&para;<br>Carr’s co-appellant, finding that he had not been given a&para;<br>sufficient grace period to register.&para;<br>In view of the division among the Circuits as to the&para;<br>meaning of §2250’s “travel” requirement,1 we granted&para;<br>certiorari, 557 U. S. __ (2009), to decide the statute’s&para;<br>applicability to pre-SORNA travel and, if necessary, to&para;<br>consider the statute’s compliance with the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 While the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have confronted the question&para;<br>directly, other Circuits have also touched on it. Aligning itself with the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit has analogized 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2250(a) to the felon-in-possession statute, §922(g), and applied it to a&para;<br>sex offender who traveled before SORNA became applicable to him.&para;<br>United States v. Dumont, 555 F. 3d 1288, 1291–1292 (2009) (per cu&para;<br>riam). In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has stated in dictum that&para;<br>§2250(a) “punishes convicted sex offenders who travel in interstate&para;<br>commerce after the enactment of SORNA.” United States v. May, 535&para;<br>F. 3d 912, 920 (2008) (emphasis added).&para;<br>2 There is a separate conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to when&para;<br>SORNA’s registration requirements became applicable to persons&para;<br>convicted of sex offenses prior to the statute’s enactment. Several&para;<br>Circuits, including the Seventh, have taken the position that the Act&para;<br>did not apply to such sex offenders until the Attorney General provided&para;<br>for their inclusion by issuing an interim regulation, 28 CFR §72.3, 72&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 8897, on February 28, 2007. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Cain, 583&para;<br>F. 3d 408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v.

See, e.g., May, 535 F. 3d, at 915–919; United States v. Hinckley,&para;<br>550 F. 3d 926, 929–935 (CA10 2008). Because Carr traveled from&para;<br>Alabama to Indiana before both the enactment of SORNA and the&para;<br>Attorney General’s regulation, we have no occasion to consider whether&para;<br>a pre-SORNA sex offender whose travel and failure to register occurred&para;<br>between July 2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under&para;<br>§2250, and we express no view on that question. We similarly express&para;<br>no view as to whether §72.3 was properly promulgated—a question that&para;<br>has also divided the Circuits. Compare Cain, 583 F. 3d, at 419–424&para;<br>(holding that the Attorney General lacked good cause for issuing the&para;<br>interim regulation without adhering to the notice-and-comment and&para;<br>publication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)),&para;<br>with United States v.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ure to register.” Brief for United States 13; see also Reply&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 4, 7, n. 6. A sequential reading, the&para;<br>parties recognize, helps to assure a nexus between a de&para;<br>fendant’s interstate travel and his failure to register as a&para;<br>sex offender. Persons convicted of sex offenses under state&para;<br>law who fail to register in their State of conviction would&para;<br>otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under §2250&para;<br>even if they had not left the State after being convicted—&para;<br>an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal&para;<br>interest in punishing such state offenders.3&para;<br>While both parties accept that the elements of §2250&para;<br>should be read sequentially, they disagree on the event&para;<br>that sets the sequence in motion. In the Government’s&para;<br>view, the statute is triggered by a sex-offense conviction,&para;<br>which must be followed by interstate travel, and then a&para;<br>failure to register under SORNA. Only the last of these&para;<br>events, the Government maintains, must occur after&para;<br>SORNA took effect; the predicate conviction and the travel&para;<br>may both have predated the statute’s enactment. Carr, in&para;<br>contrast, asserts that the statutory sequence begins when&para;<br>a person becomes subject to SORNA’s registration re&para;<br>quirements. The person must then travel in interstate&para;<br>commerce and thereafter fail to register. All of these&para;<br>events, Carr avers, necessarily postdate SORNA’s enact&para;<br>ment because a sex offender could not have been required&para;<br>to register under SORNA until SORNA became the law.&para;<br>Carr’s interpretation better accords with the statutory&para;<br>text. By its terms, the first element of §2250(a) can only&para;<br>be satisfied when a person “is required to register under&para;<br>the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.”&para;<br>§2250(a)(1) (emphasis added). In an attempt to reconcile&para;<br>its preferred construction with the words of the statute,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 For persons convicted of sex offenses under federal or Indian tribal&para;<br>law, interstate travel is not a prerequisite to §2250 liability. See&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(A).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Government insists that this language is merely “a&para;<br>shorthand way of identifying those persons who have a&para;<br>[sex-offense] conviction in the classes identified by&para;<br>SORNA.” Brief for United States 19–20. To reach this&para;<br>conclusion, the Government observes that another provi&para;<br>sion of SORNA, 42 U. S. C. §16913(a), states that the Act’s&para;<br>registration requirements apply to “sex offender[s].” A&para;<br>“sex offender” is elsewhere defined as “an individual who&para;<br>was convicted of a sex offense.” §16911(1). Thus, as the&para;<br>Government would have it, Congress used 12 words and&para;<br>two implied cross-references to establish that the first&para;<br>element of §2250(a) is that a person has been convicted of&para;<br>a sex offense. Such contortions can scarcely be called&para;<br>“shorthand.” It is far more sensible to conclude that Con&para;<br>gress meant the first precondition to §2250 liability to be&para;<br>the one it listed first: a “require[ment] to register under&para;<br>[SORNA].” Once a person becomes subject to SORNA’s&para;<br>registration requirements, which can occur only after the&para;<br>statute’s effective date, that person can be convicted under&para;<br>§2250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.4&para;<br>That §2250 sets forth the travel requirement in the&para;<br>present tense (“travels”) rather than in the past or present&para;<br>perfect (“traveled” or “has traveled”) reinforces the conclu&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Offering&para;<br>&para;<br>a variation on the Government’s argument, the dissent&para;<br>contends that, “[i]n accordance with current drafting conventions,&para;<br>§2250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law went into effect, but&para;<br>as of the time when the first act necessary for conviction is committed.”&para;<br>Post, at 7 (opinion of ALITO, J.). This occurs, the dissent maintains,&para;<br>“when an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is&para;<br>that act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.” Ibid.&para;<br>The dissent’s account cannot be squared with the statutory text. “[T]he&para;<br>first act necessary for conviction” under §2250(a) is not a predicate sex&para;<br>offense conviction. It is a requirement “to register under [SORNA].”&para;<br>§2250(a)(1). Thus, even if the dissent is correct that legislative drafters&para;<br>do not invariably use the moment of enactment to mark the dividing&para;<br>line between covered and uncovered acts, they have clearly done so&para;<br>here.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion that preenactment travel falls outside the statute’s&para;<br>compass. Consistent with normal usage, we have fre&para;<br>quently looked to Congress’ choice of verb tense to ascer&para;<br>tain a statute’s temporal reach. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333 (1992) (“Congress’ use of a verb&para;<br>tense is significant in construing statutes”); Gwaltney of&para;<br>Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484&para;<br>U. S. 49, 57 (1987) (“Congress could have phrased its&para;<br>requirement in language that looked to the past . . . , but it&para;<br>did not choose this readily available option”); Barrett v.&para;<br>United States, 423 U. S. 212, 216 (1976) (observing that&para;<br>Congress used the present perfect tense to “denot[e] an act&para;<br>that has been completed”). The Dictionary Act also as&para;<br>cribes significance to verb tense. It provides that, “[i]n&para;<br>determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless&para;<br>the context indicates otherwise[,] . . . words used in the&para;<br>present tense include the future as well as the present.” 1&para;<br>U. S. C. §1. By implication, then, the Dictionary Act in&para;<br>structs that the present tense generally does not include&para;<br>the past. Accordingly, a statute that regulates a person&para;<br>who “travels” is not readily understood to encompass a&para;<br>person whose only travel occurred before the statute took&para;<br>effect. Indeed, neither the Government nor the dissent&para;<br>identifies any instance in which this Court has construed&para;<br>a present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenact&para;<br>ment conduct.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Appeals quoted a Ninth Circuit decision for the propo&para;<br>sition that “ ‘the present tense is commonly used to refer to past, pre&para;<br>sent, and future all at the same time.’ ” 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting&para;<br>Coalition for Clean Air v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 971 F. 2d 219, 225&para;<br>(CA9 1992)). Neither court offered examples of such usage. Perhaps,&para;<br>as the Dictionary Act itself recognizes, there may be instances in which&para;<br>“context” supports this sort of omnitemporality, but it is not the typical&para;<br>understanding of the present tense in either normal discourse or&para;<br>statutory construction. Taken in context, the word “travels” as it&para;<br>appears in §2250 is indistinguishable from the present-tense verbs that&para;<br>appear in myriad other criminal statutes to proscribe conduct on a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In this instance, the statutory context strongly supports&para;<br>a forward-looking construction of “travels.” First, the&para;<br>word “travels” is followed in §2250(a)(2)(B) by a series of&para;<br>other present tense verbs—“enters or leaves, or resides in,&para;<br>Indian country.” (Emphasis added.) This Court has previ&para;<br>ously described a statute’s “undeviating use of the present&para;<br>tense” as a “striking indic[ator]” of its “prospective orien&para;<br>tation.” Gwaltney, 484 U. S., at 59. The Seventh Circuit&para;<br>thought otherwise, reasoning that it would “mak[e] no&para;<br>sense” for “a sex offender who has resided in Indian coun&para;<br>try since long before the Act was passed [to be] subject to&para;<br>the Act but not someone who crossed state lines before the&para;<br>Act was passed.” 551 F. 3d, at 583. As a textual matter,&para;<br>however, it is the Seventh Circuit’s approach that makes&para;<br>little sense: If “travels” means “traveled” (i.e., a person&para;<br>“travels” if he crossed state lines before SORNA’s enact&para;<br>ment), then the only way to avoid an incongruity among&para;<br>neighboring verbs would be to construe the phrase “re&para;<br>sides i[n] Indian country” to encompass persons who once&para;<br>resided in Indian country but who left before SORNA’s&para;<br>enactment and have not since returned—an implausible&para;<br>reading that neither the Seventh Circuit, nor the Govern&para;<br>ment, nor the dissent endorses.&para;<br>Second, the other elements of a §2250 violation are&para;<br>similarly set forth in the present tense.&para;<br>Sections&para;<br>2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who&para;<br>“is required to register under [SORNA]” and who “know&para;<br>ingly fails to register or update a registration as required&para;<br>——————&para;<br>prospective basis. Examining a criminal law with a travel element&para;<br>similar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently agreed&para;<br>that “the present tense verb ‘travels,’ most sensibly read, does not refer&para;<br>to travel that occurred in the past—that is, before the enactment of the&para;<br>statute.” United States v. Jackson, 480 F. 3d 1014, 1019 (CA9 2007)&para;<br>(interpreting 18 U. S. C. §2423(c), which imposes criminal penalties on&para;<br>“[a]ny United States citizen . . . who travels in foreign commerce, and&para;<br>engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person”).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>by [SORNA].” (Emphasis added.) The Government ac&para;<br>cepts that this last element—a knowing failure to register&para;<br>or update a registration—must postdate SORNA’s enact&para;<br>ment. Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to&para;<br>satisfy the first two requirements of §2250 but not the&para;<br>third, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to&para;<br>convey this meaning. Indeed, numerous federal statutes&para;<br>use the past-perfect tense to describe one or more ele&para;<br>ments of a criminal offense when coverage of preenact&para;<br>ment events is intended.&para;<br>See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. A.&para;<br>§249(a)(2)(B)(iii) (Supp. 2010) (proscribing hate crimes in&para;<br>which “the defendant employs a firearm, dangerous&para;<br>weapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other weapon&para;<br>that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce” (em&para;<br>phasis added)); 18 U.

(proscrib&para;<br>ing firearm possession or transport by any person “who&para;<br>has been convicted” of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence (emphasis added)); §2252(a)(2) (2006&para;<br>ed., Supp. II) (making it unlawful for any person to receive&para;<br>or distribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in&para;<br>sexually explicit conduct that “has been mailed, or has&para;<br>been shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or&para;<br>foreign commerce” (emphasis added)). The absence of&para;<br>similar phrasing here provides powerful evidence that&para;<br>§2250 targets only postenactment travel.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The dissent identifies several “SORNA provisions that plainly use&para;<br>the present tense to refer to events that . . . may have occurred before&para;<br>SORNA took effect.” Post, at 10. All of these examples appear in 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §16911, a definitional section that merely elucidates the&para;<br>meaning of certain statutory terms and proscribes no conduct. All but&para;<br>two of the provisions, moreover, rely on the term “sex offender,” which&para;<br>§16911(1) defines to mean “an individual who was convicted of a sex&para;<br>offense.” (Emphasis added.) The remaining provisions are §16911(7),&para;<br>which simply uses “involves” rather than “involved” to define whether a&para;<br>prior conviction qualifies as a “specified offense against a minor,” and&para;<br>§16911(8), which makes plain that its present-tense reference to an&para;<br>offender’s age refers to age “at the time of the offense.” These examples&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

According to the Government, these cate&para;<br>gories correspond to “two alternate sources of power to&para;<br>achieve Congress’s aim of broadly registering sex offend&para;<br>ers.” Id., at 22. Placing pre-SORNA travelers within the&para;<br>statute’s coverage, the Government maintains, “ensures&para;<br>that the jurisdictional reach of Section 2250(a)(2) has a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>thus provide scant support for the proposition that §2250 uses “travels”&para;<br>to refer to pre-SORNA travel. Given the well-established presumption&para;<br>against retroactivity and, in the criminal context, the constitutional bar&para;<br>on ex post facto laws, it cannot be the case that a statutory prohibition&para;<br>set forth in the present tense applies by default to acts completed before&para;<br>the statute’s enactment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.

That it declined to do so&para;<br>indicates that Congress instead chose to handle federal&para;<br>and state sex offenders differently. There is nothing&para;<br>“anomal[ous]” about such a choice. To the contrary, it is&para;<br>entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the&para;<br>Federal Government a special role in ensuring compliance&para;<br>with SORNA’s registration requirements by federal sex&para;<br>offenders—persons who typically would have spent time&para;<br>under federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reason&para;<br>able for Congress to have given the States primary re&para;<br>sponsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance&para;<br>among state sex offenders and to have subjected such&para;<br>offenders to federal criminal liability only when, after&para;<br>SORNA’s enactment, they use the channels of interstate&para;<br>commerce in evading a State’s reach.&para;<br>In this regard, it is notable that the federal sex-offender&para;<br>registration laws have, from their inception, expressly&para;<br>relied on state-level enforcement. Indeed, when it initially&para;<br>set national standards for state sex-offender registration&para;<br>programs in 1994, Congress did not include any federal&para;<br>criminal liability. Congress instead conditioned certain&para;<br>federal funds on States’ adoption of “criminal penalties” on&para;<br>any person “required to register under a State program . . .&para;<br>who knowingly fails to so register and keep such registra&para;<br>tion current.” Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children&para;<br>and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Pub.

No statutory gap necessitated&para;<br>coverage of unregistered offenders who “change[d] ad&para;<br>dress” before the statute’s enactment; the prosecution of&para;<br>such persons remained the province of the States.&para;<br>In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this basic&para;<br>allocation of enforcement responsibilities. To strengthen&para;<br>state enforcement of registration requirements, Congress&para;<br>established, as a funding condition, that “[e]ach jurisdic&para;<br>tion, other than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall&para;<br>provide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term&para;<br>of imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure&para;<br>of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this&para;<br>subchapter.” §16913(e).8 Meanwhile, Congress in §2250&para;<br>exposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up&para;<br>to 10 years’ imprisonment, persons required to register&para;<br>under SORNA over whom the Federal Government has a&para;<br>direct supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of&para;<br>the statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Pre-SORNA&para;<br>&para;<br>law also exposed to federal criminal liability any person&para;<br>whose State “ha[d] not established a minimally sufficient sexual&para;<br>offender registration program” and who was thus required to register&para;<br>with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§14072(c), (g)(2), (i). SORNA does not include a similar FBI registra&para;<br>tion requirement, presumably because, by the time of the statute’s&para;<br>enactment, “every State . . . had enacted some” type of registration&para;<br>system.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Understanding the act of travel as an aspect of the harm&para;<br>Congress sought to punish serves to distinguish §2250&para;<br>from the felon-in-possession statute to which the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit analogized. See 551 F. 3d, at 582–583. In Scar&para;<br>borough, this Court held that a prior version of the stat&para;<br>ute, which imposed criminal liability on any convicted&para;<br>felon who “ ‘possesses . . . in commerce or affecting com&para;<br>merce . . . any firearm,’ ” 431 U. S., at 564 (quoting 18&para;<br>U. S. C. App. §1202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the&para;<br>Government to prove postenactment movement of the&para;<br>firearm across state lines. According to the Court, Con&para;<br>gress had given “no indication of any concern with either&para;<br>the movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time&para;<br>of acquisition.” 431 U. S., at 572. Its aim was simply “to&para;<br>keep guns out of the hands of” convicted felons, ibid., and,&para;<br>by using the phrase “in commerce or affecting commerce,”&para;<br>it invoked the full breadth of its Commerce Clause author&para;<br>ity to achieve that end. No one in Scarborough disputed,&para;<br>however, that the act of possession had to occur post&para;<br>enactment; a felon who “possess[ed]” a firearm only pre&para;<br>enactment was plainly outside the statute’s sweep. In this&para;<br>case, the proper analogy is not, as the Seventh Circuit&para;<br>suggested, between the travel of a sex offender and the&para;<br>movement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who&para;<br>“travels” and the convicted felon who “possesses.” The act&para;<br>of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a juris&para;<br>dictional predicate for §2250, but it is also, like the act of&para;<br>possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In a final effort to justify its position, the Government&para;<br>invokes one of SORNA’s underlying purposes: to locate sex&para;<br>offenders who had failed to abide by their registration&para;<br>obligations.&para;<br>SORNA, the Government observes, was&para;<br>motivated at least in part by Congress’ concern about&para;<br>these “missing” sex offenders—a problem the House&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Committee on the Judiciary expressly linked to interstate&para;<br>travel: “The most significant enforcement issue in the sex&para;<br>offender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders, or&para;<br>nearly one-fifth in the Nation[,] are ‘missing,’ meaning&para;<br>they have not complied with sex offender registration&para;<br>requirements. This typically occurs when the sex offender&para;<br>moves from one State to another.” H. R. Rep. No. 109–&para;<br>218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The goal of tracking down missing&para;<br>sex offenders, the Government maintains, “is surely better&para;<br>served by making Section 2250 applicable to them in their&para;<br>new States of residence immediately than by waiting for&para;<br>them to travel in interstate commerce and fail to register&para;<br>yet again.” Brief for United States 23–24. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals expressed a similar view. See 551 F. 3d, at 582.9&para;<br>The Government’s argument confuses a general goal of&para;<br>SORNA with the specific purpose of §2250. Section 2250&para;<br>is not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Also making this point, the dissent maintains that “[i]nterpreting&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment travel severely impairs&para;<br>§2250(a)’s effectiveness” by “plac[ing] beyond the reach of the federal&para;<br>criminal laws” “the many sex offenders who had managed to avoid pre&para;<br>existing registration regimes.” Post, at 14. The dissent sees “no appar&para;<br>ent reason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a require&para;<br>ment.” Ibid. Yet the dissent approves an even greater impairment.&para;<br>Addressing a dispute we leave unresolved, see n. 2, supra, the dissent&para;<br>would hold that, in enacting SORNA, “Congress remained neutral on&para;<br>the question whether the Act reaches those with pre-SORNA sex&para;<br>offense convictions.” Post, at 10. The dissent’s view, in other words, is&para;<br>that SORNA does not apply of its own force to any sex offenders con&para;<br>victed prior to the statute’s enactment—a reading wholly inconsistent&para;<br>with the dissent’s description of SORNA as “a response to a dangerous&para;<br>gap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration laws.” Post, at 13. If,&para;<br>as the dissent accepts, Congress left open the possibility that no preen&para;<br>actment offenders would face liability under §2250, then it is certainly&para;<br>not unreasonable to conclude that Congress limited the statute’s&para;<br>coverage to offenders who travel after its enactment. Indeed, it is&para;<br>strange to think that Congress might have enacted a statute that&para;<br>declined to cover pre-SORNA offenders but nevertheless covered preSORNA travel.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme&para;<br>enacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had&para;<br>enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §16901 (“Congress in this chapter establishes a&para;<br>comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex]&para;<br>offenders”). Among its many provisions, SORNA instructs&para;<br>States to maintain sex-offender registries that compile an&para;<br>array of information about sex offenders, §16914; to make&para;<br>this information publicly available online, §16918; to share&para;<br>the information with other jurisdictions and with the&para;<br>Attorney General for inclusion in a comprehensive na&para;<br>tional sex-offender registry, §§16919–16921; and to “pro&para;<br>vide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of&para;<br>imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of&para;<br>a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this&para;<br>subchapter,” §16913(e). Sex offenders, in turn, are re&para;<br>quired to “register, and keep the registration current, in&para;<br>each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the&para;<br>offender is an employee, and where the offender is a stu&para;<br>dent,” §16913(a), and to appear in person periodically to&para;<br>“allow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph, and&para;<br>verify the information in each registry in which that of&para;<br>fender is required to be registered,” §16916. By facilitat&para;<br>ing the collection of sex-offender information and its dis&para;<br>semination among jurisdictions, these provisions, not&para;<br>§2250, stand at the center of Congress’ effort to account for&para;<br>missing sex offenders.&para;<br>Knowing that Congress aimed to reduce the number of&para;<br>noncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the&para;<br>specific policy choice Congress made in enacting §2250.&para;<br>While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment&para;<br>under §2250 may well be consistent with the aim of find&para;<br>ing missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no&para;<br>way frustrates that broad goal.&para;<br>Taking account of&para;<br>SORNA’s overall structure, we have little reason to doubt&para;<br>that Congress intended §2250 to do exactly what it says:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

This earlier&para;<br>version imposed federal criminal penalties on any person&para;<br>who “receives a notice from an official that such person is&para;<br>required to register under [SORNA] and . . . thereafter&para;<br>travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or&para;<br>leaves Indian country.” H.

The question&para;<br>that we must decide is whether §2250(a) applies only to&para;<br>those sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce&para;<br>after SORNA became law or whether the statute also&para;<br>reaches sex offenders, like petitioner, who were convicted2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Section 2250(a) also applies to persons with federal sex-offense con&para;<br>victions, those who travel in foreign commerce, and those who enter,&para;<br>leave, or reside in Indian country. For convenience, I will refer in this&para;<br>opinion solely to interstate travel.&para;<br>2 The Court holds only that §2250(a)(2)(B) does not apply to a person&para;<br>who moved in interstate commerce before SORNA took effect. The&para;<br>Court does not address the separate question whether §2250(a) may&para;<br>validly be applied to a person who was convicted of a qualifying offense&para;<br>before SORNA was enacted.

The Court reaches this conclusion for two&para;<br>reasons: (1) the verb tense used in §2250(a)(2)(B); and (2)&para;<br>the sequence in which the elements of the offense are&para;<br>listed.&para;<br>As I will attempt to show, the Court’s textual arguments&para;<br>are thoroughly unsound. And the conclusion that the&para;<br>Court reaches makes no sense. To appreciate the folly of&para;<br>the Court’s interpretation, consider the following two&para;<br>cases.&para;<br>The first involves a situation in which, for present pur&para;<br>poses, I assume that §2250(a) applies.3 A man convicted&para;<br>in State A for sexual abuse is released from custody in&para;<br>that State and then, after the enactment of SORNA,&para;<br>moves to State B and fails to register as required by State&para;<br>B law. Section 2250(a) makes this offender’s failure to&para;<br>register in State B a federal crime because his interstate&para;<br>movement frustrates SORNA’s registration requirements.&para;<br>Because this offender is convicted and then released from&para;<br>custody in State A, the State A authorities know of his&para;<br>presence in their State and are thus in a position to try to&para;<br>ensure that he remains registered. At the time of his&para;<br>release, they can ascertain where he intends to live, and&para;<br>they can make sure that he registers as required by state&para;<br>law. Thereafter, they can periodically check the address&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ments—and thus §2250(a)’s criminal penalties—should apply to per&para;<br>sons in the latter category, 42 U. S. C. §16913(d), and the Attorney&para;<br>General has promulgated a regulation providing that they do, 72 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 8897 (2007) (codified at 28 CFR §72.3 (2009)). Because the Court&para;<br>does not address the validity of this regulation, I proceed on the as&para;<br>sumption that 18 U. S. C. §2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA&para;<br>sex-offense convictions.&para;<br>3 See n. 2, supra.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at which he is registered to confirm that he still resides&para;<br>there. And even if he moves without warning to some&para;<br>other address in the State, they can try to track him down.&para;<br>Once this offender leaves State A, however, the authorities&para;<br>in that State are severely limited in their ability to moni&para;<br>tor his movements. And because the State B authorities&para;<br>have no notice of his entry into their State, they are at a&para;<br>great disadvantage in trying to enforce State B’s registra&para;<br>tion law. Congress enacted §2250(a) in order to punish&para;<br>and deter interstate movement that seriously undermines&para;<br>the enforcement of sex-offender-registration laws.&para;<br>The second case is the same as the first in all respects&para;<br>except that the sex offender travels from State A to State&para;<br>B before SORNA’s enactment. In other words, the sex&para;<br>offender is convicted and later released in State A; prior to&para;<br>SORNA’s enactment, he moves to State B; and then, after&para;<br>SORNA takes effects, he fails to register in State B, as&para;<br>SORNA requires.&para;<br>Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to&para;<br>treat the second case any differently from the first? In&para;<br>both cases, a sex offender’s interstate movement frustrates&para;<br>enforcement of SORNA’s registration requirements. In&para;<br>both cases, as a result of that interstate travel, the sex&para;<br>offender’s new neighbors in State B are unaware of the&para;<br>presence of a potentially dangerous person in their com&para;<br>munity, and the State B law enforcement authorities are&para;<br>hampered in their ability to protect the public. The second&para;<br>case is the case now before the Court, and the Court offers&para;<br>no plausible explanation why Congress might have&para;<br>wanted to treat this case any differently from the first.&para;<br>If the text of §2250(a) commanded this result, we would,&para;<br>of course, be obligated to heed that command. But the text&para;<br>of §2250(a) dictates no such thing. On the contrary, when&para;<br>properly read, it reaches both cases.&para;<br>Section 2250(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v.

And&para;<br>petitioner’s argument fails because it begs the relevant&para;<br>question. Petitioner belabors the obvious—that the pre&para;<br>sent tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in&para;<br>the past—but studiously avoids the critical question: At&para;<br>what point in time does §2250(a) speak? Does it speak as&para;<br>of the time when SORNA took effect? Or does it speak as&para;<br>of the time when the proscribed conduct occurs? Without&para;<br>knowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is&para;<br>impossible to tell what is past and what is present or&para;<br>future.&para;<br>The unspoken premise of petitioner’s argument is that&para;<br>§2250(a) speaks as of the time when it became law. And if&para;<br>that premise is accepted, it follows that the use of the&para;<br>present tense in §2250(a)(2)(B) means that the requisite&para;<br>interstate travel must occur after, not before, SORNA took&para;<br>effect. Petitioner’s premise, however, flies in the face of&para;<br>the widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention&para;<br>that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of&para;<br>enactment. The United States Senate Legislative Draft&para;<br>ing Manual directly addresses this point: “A legislative&para;<br>provision speaks as of any date on which it is read (rather&para;<br>than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).”&para;<br>Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Draft&para;<br>ing Manual §103(a), p. 4 (1997) (emphasis added). The&para;<br>House Manual makes the same point:&para;<br>“Your draft should be a movable feast—that is, it&para;<br>speaks as of whatever time it is being read (rather&para;<br>than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).”&para;<br>House Legislative Counsel’s Manual on Drafting&para;<br>Style, HLC No. 104–1, §102(c), p. 2 (1995).&para;<br>In accordance with this convention, modern legislative&para;<br>drafting manuals teach that, except in unusual circum&para;<br>stances, all laws, including penal statutes, should be&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>written in the present tense. The Senate Manual, supra,&para;<br>§103(a), at 4, states: “[A]lways use the present tense&para;<br>unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or&para;<br>a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.”&para;<br>Similarly, the House Manual, supra, §102(c), at 2, advises:&para;<br>“STAY IN THE PRESENT.–– Whenever possible, use the&para;<br>present tense (rather than the past or future).” Numerous&para;<br>state legislative drafting manuals and other similar hand&para;<br>books hammer home this same point.

In accordance with current drafting conven&para;<br>tions, §2250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law&para;<br>went into effect, but as of the time when the first act&para;<br>necessary for conviction is committed. In the case of&para;<br>§2250(a), that occurs when an individual is convicted of a&para;<br>qualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the&para;<br>requirement to register under SORNA.4 For present&para;<br>purposes, we must proceed on the assumption that this&para;<br>event may have occurred before SORNA was enacted.&para;<br>Viewed as of the time when such a pre-SORNA conviction&para;<br>takes place, every subsequent act, including movement&para;<br>from State to State, occurs in the future and is thus prop&para;<br>erly described using the present tense. Accordingly,&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(B)’s use of the present tense (“travels”) sup&para;<br>ports the application of the statute to a sex offender, like&para;<br>petitioner, who moved from State to State after conviction&para;<br>but before SORNA went into effect.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Under&para;<br>&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §16913, a “sex offender” is required to register,&para;<br>and the term “sex offender” is defined as a person who was convicted of&para;<br>a “sex offense.” §16911(1). The Court relies on the artificial argument&para;<br>that the first act necessary for conviction under 18 U. S. C. §2250(a) is&para;<br>the failure to register, ante, at 6–7, and n. 4, but in real-world terms the&para;<br>first necessary act is plainly the commission of a qualifying offense.&para;<br>5 Contrary to the Court’s interpretation, see ante, at 8–9, Gwaltney of&para;<br>Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49&para;<br>(1987), does not support petitioner’s argument. Gwaltney involved a&para;<br>civil action brought under §505 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S.

When SORNA was enacted, Congress elected not&para;<br>to decide for itself whether the Act’s registration require&para;<br>ments—and thus §2250(a)’s criminal penalties—would&para;<br>apply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex&para;<br>offenses before SORNA took effect. Instead, Congress&para;<br>delegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide&para;<br>that question. See §113(d), 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§16913(d) (“The Attorney General shall have the authority&para;<br>to specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I&para;<br>of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enact&para;<br>ment of this Act”).6 Pursuant to this delegation, the At&para;<br>——————&para;<br>violation” of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System&para;<br>permit. In Gwaltney, the permit holder had violated its permit between&para;<br>1981 and 1984, but the permit holder claimed that it had ceased all&para;<br>violations by the time the suit was filed. 484 U. S., at 53–55. This&para;<br>Court held that the phrase “alleged to be in violation” showed that the&para;<br>provision was meant to apply only where an ongoing violation is al&para;<br>leged. Id., at 59.&para;<br>The provision at issue in Gwaltney differs from §2250(a) in that it&para;<br>specifies the relevant temporal point of reference, namely, the point in&para;<br>time when the allegation of an ongoing violation is made. Section&para;<br>2250(a) contains no similar specification. Moreover, the Gwaltney&para;<br>Court did not read the provision at issue there as speaking at the time&para;<br>when the provision was enacted. As noted above, however, the silent&para;<br>premise of petitioner’s argument is that §2250(a) must be read as&para;<br>speaking as of the time of SORNA’s enactment.&para;<br>6 To be sure, at least two Courts of Appeals have held that SORNA’s&para;<br>registration requirements apply by the Act’s own terms to those indi&para;<br>viduals with sex-offense convictions that predate SORNA’s enactment.&para;<br>See United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d 926, 929–935 (CA10 2008);&para;<br>United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912, 918–919 (CA8 2008). Other&para;<br>Courts of Appeals, however, have disagreed, reasoning that SORNA’s&para;<br>explicit grant of authority to the Attorney General to determine the&para;<br>Act’s applicability to offenders with pre-SORNA convictions implies&para;<br>that the Act would not apply to those sex offenders absent the Attorney&para;<br>General’s regulation. See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d 408,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any&para;<br>such phrasing, however, would have strongly suggested&para;<br>that §2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex&para;<br>offense convictions—the very question that Congress chose&para;<br>not to decide but instead to leave for the Attorney General.&para;<br>A brief explanation is needed to make clear why word&para;<br>ing §2250(a)(2)(B) in the past tense (or the present perfect&para;<br>or past perfect tense) would have had such an effect. The&para;<br>Court and I agree that §2250(a) applies only to persons&para;<br>who travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted&para;<br>of a qualifying sex offense. See ante, at 6; infra, at 11–12.&para;<br>Therefore, if §2250(a) had been phrased in the past tense&para;<br>(or the present perfect or past perfect tense), it would&para;<br>——————&para;<br>414–415, 419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226–&para;<br>229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008)&para;<br>(case below); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852, 856–859 (CA11&para;<br>2008). Those Courts of Appeals in the latter group, in my view, have&para;<br>the better of the argument. Section 113(d) of SORNA delegates to the&para;<br>Attorney General the “authority to specify the applicability of the&para;<br>requirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the&para;<br>enactment of [the] Act.” 120 Stat. 594, 42 U.

The clear&para;<br>negative implication of that delegation is that, without such a determi&para;<br>nation by the Attorney General, the Act would not apply to those with&para;<br>pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.&para;<br>7 Although not controlling, it is worth noting that one of the two ex&para;<br>amples the Attorney General included in his February 2007 rule&para;<br>contemplated that pre-SORNA travel would be sufficient to satisfy&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(B)’s interstate-travel requirement.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>seem necessarily to follow that the provision reaches preSORNA convictions. By using the present tense, Congress&para;<br>remained neutral on the question whether the Act reaches&para;<br>those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions and left&para;<br>that question open for the Attorney General.&para;<br>The conclusion that §2250(a)(2)(B) embraces preSORNA travel is reinforced by the presence of quite a few&para;<br>other SORNA provisions that plainly use the present&para;<br>tense to refer to events that, as a result of the Attorney&para;<br>General’s regulation, may have occurred before SORNA&para;<br>took effect. For example, an individual may qualify as a&para;<br>“tier II sex offender” under the Act if, among other things,&para;<br>his sex offense “involves . . . (i) use of a minor in sexual&para;<br>performance; (ii) solicitation of a minor to practice prosti&para;<br>tution; or (iii) production or distribution of child pornogra&para;<br>phy.” 42 U. S. C. §16911(3)(B) (emphasis added); see also&para;<br>§16911(4)(B) (offense “involves kidnapping a minor” (em&para;<br>phasis added)); §16911(7) (offense “involves” certain speci&para;<br>fied conduct). Similarly, a sex offender can qualify as a&para;<br>“tier II sex offender” if his sex offense “occurs after the&para;<br>offender becomes a tier I sex offender.” §16911(3)(C) (em&para;<br>phasis added); see also §16911(4)(C) (offense “occurs after&para;<br>the offender becomes a tier II sex offender” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). A juvenile adjudication, moreover, may qualify as&para;<br>a conviction for purposes of the Act only if, among other&para;<br>things, the “offender is 14 years of age or older at the time&para;<br>of the offense.” §16911(8) (emphasis added).8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 That many of these provisions rely on §16911(1)’s definition of the&para;<br>term “sex offender” changes nothing. See ante, at 10, n. 6. Had the&para;<br>Attorney General not exercised his discretion to make SORNA’s regis&para;<br>tration requirements applicable to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense&para;<br>convictions, all of these provisions would have applied to only pos&para;<br>tenactment conduct—notwithstanding §16911(1)’s reference to “an&para;<br>individual who was convicted of a sex offense.” (Emphasis added.) But&para;<br>now that the Attorney General has so exercised his discretion, all of&para;<br>these present-tense-phrased provisions necessarily must be interpreted&para;<br>as reaching pre-enactment conduct. The same conclusion should follow&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress cast all of these provisions in the present&para;<br>tense, but now that the Attorney General has made&para;<br>SORNA applicable to individuals with pre-SORNA sex&para;<br>offense convictions, all of these provisions must necessar&para;<br>ily be interpreted as embracing pre-enactment conduct.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court’s second reason for holding that 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2250(a) reaches only post-SORNA travel is based on the&para;<br>sequence in which the elements of §2250(a) are listed. The&para;<br>Court concludes (and I agree) that the first listed element&para;<br>(subsection (a)(1) (“is required to register under the Sex&para;<br>Offender Registration and Notification Act”)) cannot have&para;<br>been violated until the Act took effect. The Court then&para;<br>reasons that the third listed element (subsection (a)(2)(B)&para;<br>(“travels in interstate . . . commerce”)) must be violated&para;<br>after the first. See ante, at 6. The Court explains: “Per&para;<br>sons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to&para;<br>register in their State of conviction would otherwise be&para;<br>subject to federal prosecution under §2250 even if they&para;<br>had not left the State after being convicted—an illogical&para;<br>result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in&para;<br>punishing such state offenders.” Ibid. In other words, the&para;<br>Court reasons that it would be illogical to interpret the&para;<br>statute as reaching a person who first moves from State A&para;<br>——————&para;<br>with respect to 18 U. S. C. §2250(a)(2)(B).&para;<br>Additionally, I do not suggest that the “default” rule is that provi&para;<br>sions written in the present tense apply to past conduct. To the con&para;<br>trary, I had thought it an uncontroversial proposition of statutory&para;<br>interpretation that statutes must be interpreted in context. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America,&para;<br>Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993); see also 1 U. S. C. § 1. And when&para;<br>§2250(a) is read with an eye to the context in which SORNA was&para;<br>enacted, it becomes quite clear that §2250(a)(2)(B) should be inter&para;<br>preted as reaching pre-enactment travel. Giving effect to those contex&para;<br>tual indicators, moreover, does not offend the presumption against&para;<br>retroactivity or the Ex Post Facto Clause. See n. 10, infra.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to State B, then commits and is convicted of a qualifying&para;<br>sex offense in State B, and subsequently, upon release&para;<br>from custody in State B, fails to register as required under&para;<br>the law of that State.&para;<br>I agree with the Court that there is a good argument&para;<br>that §2250(a) should not be read to apply to such a case,&para;<br>where there is little if any connection between the of&para;<br>fender’s prior interstate movement and his subsequent&para;<br>failure to register. In the two hypothetical cases discussed&para;<br>at the beginning of this opinion, the offender’s interstate&para;<br>movement seriously frustrated the ability of the law en&para;<br>forcement authorities in his new State (State B) to enforce&para;<br>its registration requirements. By contrast, where an&para;<br>offender’s interstate movement predates his sex offense&para;<br>and conviction, his interstate movement has little if any&para;<br>effect on the ability of the law enforcement authorities in&para;<br>State B to enforce that State’s laws. When a sex offender&para;<br>is released from custody in State B, the ability of the State&para;<br>B authorities to enforce that State’s registration laws&para;<br>would appear to be the same regardless of whether that&para;<br>offender had lived his entire life in that State or had&para;<br>moved to the State prior to committing the offense for&para;<br>which he was convicted. Accordingly, it can be argued&para;<br>that Congress cannot have meant to reach this situation.&para;<br>As the Seventh Circuit put it, “[s]ince the statutory aim is&para;<br>to prevent a convicted sex offender from circumventing&para;<br>registration by leaving the state in which he is registered,&para;<br>it can be argued that the travel must postdate the convic&para;<br>tion.” United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008).&para;<br>It can also be argued that a broader construction would&para;<br>mean that Congress exceeded its authority under the&para;<br>Commerce Clause. See Brief for National Association of&para;<br>Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 16–17.&para;<br>What the Court’s argument shows, however, is not that&para;<br>the interstate travel required by §2250(a) must come after&para;<br>SORNA’s enactment. Rather, what the Court’s argument&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>suggests is that the interstate travel must come after the&para;<br>sex-offense conviction. And because, under the regulation&para;<br>promulgated by the Attorney General, §2250(a) reaches&para;<br>pre-SORNA convictions, this argument does not support&para;<br>the Court’s conclusion that the interstate travel needed&para;<br>under §2250(a) must have occurred after SORNA was&para;<br>enacted.&para;<br>III&para;<br>When an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a&para;<br>result that makes no sense, a court should at a minimum&para;<br>go back and verify that the textual analysis is correct.&para;<br>Here, not only are the Court’s textual arguments unsound&para;<br>for the reasons explained above, but the indefensible&para;<br>results produced by the Court’s interpretation should have&para;<br>led the Court to doublecheck its textual analysis.&para;<br>SORNA was a response to a dangerous gap in the then&para;<br>existing sex-offender-registration laws. In the years prior&para;<br>to SORNA’s enactment, the Nation had been shocked by&para;<br>cases in which children had been raped and murdered by&para;<br>persons who, unbeknownst to their neighbors or the police,&para;<br>were convicted sex offenders. In response, Congress and&para;<br>state legislatures passed laws requiring the registration of&para;<br>sex offenders. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89–90&para;<br>(2003); Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and&para;<br>Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Tit. 17, 108&para;<br>Stat. 2038; Megan’s Law, 110 Stat. 1345. Despite those&para;<br>efforts, by 2006 an estimated 100,000 convicted sex of&para;<br>fenders—nearly one-fifth of the Nation’s total sex-offender&para;<br>population—remained unregistered. H. R. Rep. No. 109–&para;<br>218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The principal problem, a House&para;<br>Report determined, was that sex offenders commonly&para;<br>moved from one State to another and then failed to regis&para;<br>ter in their new State of residence. Ibid. In other words,&para;<br>interstate travel was dangerously undermining the effec&para;<br>tiveness of state sex-offender-registration laws.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CARR v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Interpreting §2250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment&para;<br>travel severely impairs §2250(a)’s effectiveness. As inter&para;<br>preted by the Court, §2250(a) applies to a pre-SORNA sex&para;<br>offender only if that offender traveled in interstate com&para;<br>merce at some point after SORNA’s enactment. As the&para;<br>examples discussed at the beginning of this opinion illus&para;<br>trate, however, there is no apparent reason why Congress&para;<br>would have wanted to impose such a requirement. To the&para;<br>contrary, under the Court’s interpretation, the many sex&para;<br>offenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registra&para;<br>tion regimes, mainly by moving from one State to another&para;<br>before SORNA’s enactment, are placed beyond the reach of&para;<br>the federal criminal laws. It surely better serves the&para;<br>enforcement of SORNA’s registration requirements to&para;<br>apply §2250(a) to all pre-SORNA sex offenders, regardless&para;<br>of whether their interstate travel occurred before or after&para;<br>the statute’s enactment.&para;<br>The Court provides only a weak defense of the result its&para;<br>analysis produces. The Court suggests that enhanced&para;<br>information collection and sharing and state enforcement&para;<br>of registration laws were the sole weapons that Congress&para;<br>chose to wield in order to deal with those convicted sex&para;<br>offenders whose whereabouts were unknown when&para;<br>SORNA was passed. See ante, at 14–16. I see no basis for&para;<br>this conclusion. There can be no dispute that the enact&para;<br>ment of §2250(a) shows that Congress did not think these&para;<br>measures were sufficient to deal with persons who have&para;<br>qualifying sex-offense convictions and who move from&para;<br>State to State after SORNA’s enactment. And in light of&para;<br>that congressional judgment, is there any plausible reason&para;<br>to think that Congress concluded that these same meas&para;<br>ures would be adequate for those with qualifying sex&para;<br>offense convictions who had already disappeared at the&para;<br>time of SORNA’s enactment?9 The Court has no answer,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Contrary&para;<br>&para;<br>to the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 15, n. 9, it is no an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Of course, that delegation&para;<br>created the possibility that the Attorney General would decide that&para;<br>§2250(a) should not apply to such offenders, and if he had so decided it&para;<br>would likely follow that post-SORNA interstate travel would also be&para;<br>required. (This is the case because, as previously explained, there is a&para;<br>strong argument that §2250(a) requires interstate travel that comes&para;<br>after a qualifying conviction.)&para;<br>Now that the Attorney General has decided that §2250(a) reaches&para;<br>persons with pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, however, the relevant&para;<br>question is this: Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted&para;<br>to draw a distinction between (1) persons with pre-SORNA convictions&para;<br>and pre-SORNA travel and (2) persons with pre-SORNA convictions&para;<br>and post-SORNA travel? And to this question, the Court offers no&para;<br>plausible answer.&para;<br>10 Petitioner makes the additional argument that interpreting&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(B) to reach pre-enactment travel renders the statute an&para;<br>unlawful ex post facto law. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Petitioner&para;<br>remained unregistered in Indiana five months after the promulgation&para;<br>of the regulation making SORNA applicable to persons with preSORNA sex-offense convictions. For essentially the reasons explained&para;<br>by the Court of Appeals, see United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d, at 585–&para;<br>587, I would reject petitioner’s ex post facto argument.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
