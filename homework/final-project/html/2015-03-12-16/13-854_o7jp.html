When respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and other firms), tried to&para;<br>market a generic version of the drug, Teva sued them for patent in­&para;<br>fringement. Sandoz countered that the patent was invalid. Specifi­&para;<br>cally, Sandoz argued that the claim that Copaxone’s active ingredient&para;<br>had “a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons” was fatally indefinite,&para;<br>see 35 U. S. C. §112 ¶2, because it did not state which of three meth­&para;<br>ods of calculation—the weight of the most prevalent molecule, the&para;<br>weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or weight&para;<br>as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for&para;<br>more—was used to determine that weight. After considering conflict­&para;<br>ing expert evidence, the District Court concluded that the patent&para;<br>claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was thus valid. As rel­&para;<br>evant here, it found that in context a skilled artisan would under­&para;<br>stand that the term “molecular weight” referred to molecular weight&para;<br>as calculated by the first method. In finding the “molecular weight”&para;<br>term indefinite and the patent invalid on appeal, the Federal Circuit&para;<br>reviewed de novo all aspects of the District Court’s claim construc­&para;<br>tion, including the District Court’s determination of subsidiary facts.&para;<br>Held: When reviewing a district court’s resolution of subsidiary factual&para;<br>matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the&para;<br>Federal Circuit must apply a “clear error,” not a de novo, standard of&para;<br>review. Pp. 4–16.&para;<br>(a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a court of&para;<br>appeals “must not . . . set aside” a district court’s “[f]indings of fact”&para;<br>unless they are “clearly erroneous.” It sets out a “clear command,”&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574, and “does not make&para;<br>exceptions or . . . exclude certain categories of factual findings” from&para;<br>the court of appeals’ obligation, Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456&para;<br>U. S. 273, 287. The Rule thus applies to both subsidiary and ulti­&para;<br>mate facts. Ibid. And the function of an appeals court reviewing the&para;<br>findings of a “ ‘district court sitting without a jury . . . is not to decide&para;<br>factual issues de novo.’ ” Anderson, supra, at 573. Even if exceptions&para;<br>to the Rule were permissible, there is no convincing ground for creat­&para;<br>ing an exception here. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517&para;<br>U. S. 370, neither created, nor argued for, such an exception. There,&para;<br>the Court held that the ultimate question of claim construction is for&para;<br>the judge, not the jury, id., at 372, but it did not thereby create an ex­&para;<br>ception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual&para;<br>matters. Instead, the Court pointed out that a judge, in construing a&para;<br>patent claim, is engaged in much the same task as the judge would&para;<br>be in construing other written instruments, such as deeds, contracts,&para;<br>or tariffs. Id., at 384, 386, 388, 389. Construction of written instru­&para;<br>ments often presents a “question solely of law,” at least when the&para;<br>words in those instruments are “used in their ordinary meaning.”&para;<br>Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291.&para;<br>But if a written instrument uses “technical words or phrases not&para;<br>commonly understood,” id., at 292, those words may give rise to a fac­&para;<br>tual dispute. If so, extrinsic evidence may help to “establish a usage&para;<br>of trade or locality.” Ibid. And in that circumstance, the “determina­&para;<br>tion of the matter of fact” will “preced[e]” the “function of construc­&para;<br>tion.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Markman Court also recognized that courts will sometimes&para;<br>have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes in patent construction;&para;<br>Rule 52 requires appellate courts to review such disputes under the&para;<br>“clearly erroneous” standard. Application of this standard is further&para;<br>supported by precedent and by practical considerations. Clear error&para;<br>review is “particularly” important in patent cases because a district&para;<br>court judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entire pro­&para;<br>ceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain the neces­&para;<br>sary “familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles,”&para;<br>Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605,&para;<br>610, than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript&para;<br>or perhaps just those portions referenced by the parties. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(b) Arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Sandoz claims that&para;<br>separating “factual” from “legal” questions may be difficult and, like&para;<br>the Federal Circuit, posits that it is simpler for the appellate court to&para;<br>review the entirety of the district court’s claim construction de novo&para;<br>than to apply two separate standards. But courts of appeals have&para;<br>long been able to separate factual from legal matters, see, e.g., First&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 947–948, and the&para;<br>Federal Circuit’s efforts to treat factual findings and legal conclu­&para;<br>sions similarly have brought with them their own complexities. As&para;<br>for Sandoz’s argument that “clear error” review will bring about less&para;<br>uniformity, neither the Circuit nor Sandoz has shown that divergent&para;<br>claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact on sub­&para;<br>sidiary matters should occur more than occasionally. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(c) This leaves the question of how the clear error standard should&para;<br>be applied when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in patent claim&para;<br>construction. When the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic&para;<br>to the patent, the judge’s determination is solely a determination of&para;<br>law, and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo.&para;<br>However, where the district court needs to consult extrinsic evidence&para;<br>in order to understand, for example, the background science or the&para;<br>meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time peri­&para;<br>od, and where those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will need&para;<br>to make subsidiary factual findings about the extrinsic evidence. The&para;<br>district judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then interpret&para;<br>the patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them. The ulti­&para;<br>mate construction of the claim is a legal conclusion that the appellate&para;<br>court can review de novo. But to overturn the judge’s resolution of an&para;<br>underlying factual dispute, the appellate court must find that the&para;<br>judge, in respect to those factual findings, has made a clear error.&para;<br>Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(d) Here, for example, the District Court made a factual finding,&para;<br>crediting Teva’s expert’s account, and thereby rejecting Sandoz’s ex­&para;<br>pert’s contrary explanation, about how a skilled artisan would under­&para;<br>stand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data re­&para;<br>flects molecular weights. Based on that factual finding, the District&para;<br>Court reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not undermine&para;<br>Teva’s argument that molecular weight referred to the first method of&para;<br>calculating molecular weight. When the Federal Circuit reviewed the&para;<br>District Court’s decision, it did not accept Teva’s expert’s explanation,&para;<br>and it failed to accept that explanation without finding that the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court’s contrary determination was “clearly erroneous.” The&para;<br>Federal Circuit erred in failing to review this factual finding only for&para;<br>clear error. Teva asserts that there are two additional instances in&para;<br>which the Federal Circuit rejected the District Court’s factual find­&para;<br>ings without concluding that they were clearly erroneous; those mat­&para;<br>ters are left for the Federal Circuit to consider on remand.

Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.&para;<br>370 (1996), we explained that a patent claim is that “por­&para;<br>tion of the patent document that defines the scope of the&para;<br>patentee’s rights.” Id., at 372. We held that “the con­&para;<br>struction of a patent, including terms of art within its&para;<br>claim,” is not for a jury but “exclusively” for “the court” to&para;<br>determine. Ibid. That is so even where the construction&para;<br>of a term of art has “evidentiary underpinnings.” Id., at&para;<br>390.&para;<br>Today’s case involves claim construction with “eviden­&para;<br>tiary underpinnings.” See Part III, infra. And, it requires&para;<br>us to determine what standard the Court of Appeals&para;<br>should use when it reviews a trial judge’s resolution of an&para;<br>underlying factual dispute. Should the Court of Appeals&para;<br>review the district court’s factfinding de novo as it would&para;<br>review a question of law? Or, should it review that factfinding as it would review a trial judge’s factfinding in&para;<br>other cases, namely by taking them as correct “unless&para;<br>clearly erroneous?” See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). We&para;<br>hold that the appellate court must apply a “clear error,”&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not a de novo, standard of review.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The basic dispute in this case concerns the meaning of&para;<br>the words “molecular weight” as those words appear in a&para;<br>patent claim. The petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals&para;<br>(along with related firms), own the relevant patent. The&para;<br>patent covers a manufacturing method for Copaxone, a&para;<br>drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drug’s active&para;<br>ingredient, called “copolymer-1,” is made up of molecules&para;<br>of varying sizes. App. 1143a. And the relevant claim&para;<br>describes that ingredient as having “a molecular weight of&para;<br>5 to 9 kilodaltons.” Id., at 1145a.&para;<br>The respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and several other firms),&para;<br>tried to market a generic version of Copaxone. Teva sued&para;<br>Sandoz for patent infringement. 810 F. Supp. 2d 578, 581&para;<br>(SDNY 2011). Sandoz defended the suit by arguing that&para;<br>the patent was invalid. Ibid. The Patent Act requires&para;<br>that a claim “particularly poin[t] out and distinctly clai[m]&para;<br>the subject matter which the applicant regards as his&para;<br>invention.” 35 U. S. C. §112 ¶2 (2006 ed.); see Nautilus,&para;<br>Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1&para;<br>(2014) (slip op., at 3, n. 1)). The phrase “molecular weight&para;<br>of 5 to 9 kilodaltons,” said Sandoz, did not satisfy this&para;<br>requirement.&para;<br>The reason that the phrase is fatally indefinite, Sandoz&para;<br>argued, is that, in the context of this patent claim, the&para;<br>term “molecular weight” might mean any one of three&para;<br>different things. The phrase might refer (1) to molecular&para;<br>weight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that is&para;<br>most prevalent in the mix that makes up copolymer-1.&para;<br>(The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is,&para;<br>we are told, “peak average molecular weight.”) The phrase&para;<br>might refer (2) to molecular weight as calculated by taking&para;<br>all the different-sized molecules in the mix that makes up&para;<br>copolymer-1 and calculating the average weight, i.e.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>adding up the weight of each molecule and dividing by the&para;<br>number of molecules. (The scientific term for molecular&para;<br>weight so calculated is, we are told, “number average&para;<br>molecular weight.”) Or, the phrase might refer (3) to&para;<br>molecular weight as calculated by taking all the differentsized molecules in the mix that makes up copolymer-1 and&para;<br>calculating their average weight while giving heavier&para;<br>molecules a weight-related bonus when doing so. (The&para;<br>scientific term for molecular weight so calculated, we are&para;<br>told, is “weight average molecular weight.”) See 723 F. 3d&para;<br>1363, 1367 (CA Fed. 2013); App. 124a. In Sandoz’s view,&para;<br>since Teva’s patent claim does not say which method of&para;<br>calculation should be used, the claim’s phrase “molecular&para;<br>weight” is indefinite, and the claim fails to satisfy the&para;<br>critical patent law requirement.&para;<br>The District Court, after taking evidence from experts,&para;<br>concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite.&para;<br>Among other things, it found that in context a skilled&para;<br>artisan would understand that the term “molecular&para;<br>weight” referred to molecular weight as calculated by the&para;<br>first method, i.e., “peak average molecular weight.” 810&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 596; see Nautilus, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>12) (“[T]he definiteness inquiry trains on the understand­&para;<br>ing of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent applica­&para;<br>tion”). In part for this reason, the District Court held the&para;<br>patent valid. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 596.&para;<br>On appeal, the Federal Circuit held to the contrary. It&para;<br>found that the term “molecular weight” was indefinite.&para;<br>And it consequently held the patent invalid. 723 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1369. In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Circuit&para;<br>reviewed de novo all aspects of the District Court’s claim&para;<br>construction, including the District Court’s determination&para;<br>of subsidiary facts. Id., at 1369, 1373; see also Lighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North&para;<br>Am.

SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>construction).&para;<br>Teva filed a petition for certiorari. And we granted that&para;<br>petition. The Federal Circuit reviews the claim construc­&para;<br>tion decisions of federal district courts throughout the&para;<br>Nation, and we consequently believe it important to clarify&para;<br>the standard of review that it must apply when doing so.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a&para;<br>court of appeals “must not . . . set aside” a district court’s&para;<br>“[f ]indings of fact” unless they are “clearly erroneous.” In&para;<br>our view, this rule and the standard it sets forth must&para;<br>apply when a court of appeals reviews a district court’s&para;<br>resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the&para;<br>course of its construction of a patent claim. We have made&para;<br>clear that the Rule sets forth a “clear command.” Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985). “It does&para;<br>not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain catego­&para;<br>ries of factual findings from the obligation of a court of&para;<br>appeals to accept a district court’s findings unless clearly&para;<br>erroneous.” Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273,&para;<br>287 (1982). Accordingly, the Rule applies to both subsidi­&para;<br>ary and ultimate facts. Ibid. And we have said that,&para;<br>when reviewing the findings of a “ ‘district court sitting&para;<br>without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in&para;<br>mind that their function is not to decide factual issues&para;<br>de novo.’ ” Anderson, supra, at 573 (quoting Zenith Radio&para;<br>Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U. S. 100, 123&para;<br>(1969)).&para;<br>Even if exceptions to the Rule were permissible, we&para;<br>cannot find any convincing ground for creating an excep­&para;<br>tion to that Rule here. The Rules Advisory Committee&para;<br>pointed out that, in general, exceptions “would tend to&para;<br>undermine the legitimacy of the district courts . . . , multi­&para;<br>ply appeals . . . , and needlessly reallocate judicial author­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

App., pp. 908–909; see also&para;<br>Anderson, supra, at 574–575 (de novo review of factual findings “would very likely contribute only negligibly”&para;<br>to accuracy “at a huge cost in diversion of judicial&para;<br>resources”).&para;<br>Our opinion in Markman neither created, nor argued&para;<br>for, an exception to Rule 52(a). The question presented in&para;<br>that case was a Seventh Amendment question: Should a&para;<br>jury or a judge construe patent claims? 517 U. S., at 372.&para;<br>We pointed out that history provides no clear answer. Id.,&para;<br>at 388. The task primarily involves the construction of&para;<br>written instruments. Id., at 386, 388, 389. And that task&para;<br>is better matched to a judge’s skills. Id., at 388 (“The&para;<br>construction of written instruments is one of those things&para;<br>that judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors&para;<br>unburdened by training in exegesis”). We consequently&para;<br>held that claim construction falls “exclusively within the&para;<br>province of the court,” not that of the jury. Id., at 372.&para;<br>When describing claim construction we concluded that it&para;<br>was proper to treat the ultimate question of the proper&para;<br>construction of the patent as a question of law in the way&para;<br>that we treat document construction as a question of law.&para;<br>Id., at 388–391. But this does not imply an exception to&para;<br>Rule 52(a) for underlying factual disputes. We used the&para;<br>term “question of law” while pointing out that a judge, in&para;<br>construing a patent claim, is engaged in much the same&para;<br>task as the judge would be in construing other written&para;<br>instruments, such as deeds, contracts, or tariffs. Id., at&para;<br>384, 386, 388, 389; see also Motion Picture Patents Co. v.&para;<br>Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510 (1917) (patent&para;<br>claims are “aptly likened to the description in a deed,&para;<br>which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains”);&para;<br>Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 227&para;<br>(1880) (analogizing patent construction to the construction&para;<br>of other written instruments like contracts). Construction&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of written instruments often presents a “question solely of&para;<br>law,” at least when the words in those instruments are&para;<br>“used in their ordinary meaning.” Great Northern R. Co.&para;<br>v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291 (1922). But&para;<br>sometimes, say when a written instrument uses “technical&para;<br>words or phrases not commonly understood,” id., at 292,&para;<br>those words may give rise to a factual dispute. If so, ex­&para;<br>trinsic evidence may help to “establish a usage of trade or&para;<br>locality.” Ibid. And in that circumstance, the “determina­&para;<br>tion of the matter of fact” will “preced[e]” the “function of&para;<br>construction.” Ibid.; see also 12 R. Lord, Williston on&para;<br>Contracts §§34:1, p. 2, 34:19, p. 174 (4th ed. 2012) (In&para;<br>contract interpretation, the existence of a “usage”—a&para;<br>“practice or method” in the relevant industry—“is a ques­&para;<br>tion of fact” (internal quotation marks omitted)). This&para;<br>factual determination, like all other factual determina­&para;<br>tions, must be reviewed for clear error. See PullmanStandard, supra at 287 (The Rule does not “exclude cer­&para;<br>tain categories of factual findings” and applies to both&para;<br>“subsidiary” and “ultimate” facts (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)).&para;<br>Accordingly, when we held in Markman that the ulti­&para;<br>mate question of claim construction is for the judge and&para;<br>not the jury, we did not create an exception from the ordi­&para;<br>nary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.&para;<br>Markman no more creates an exception to Rule 52(a) than&para;<br>would a holding that judges, not juries, determine equit­&para;<br>able claims, such as requests for injunctions. A conclusion&para;<br>that an issue is for the judge does not indicate that Rule&para;<br>52(a) is inapplicable. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52 (setting&para;<br>the standard of review for “[Factual] Findings and Conclu­&para;<br>sions by the Court” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>While we held in Markman that the ultimate issue of&para;<br>the proper construction of a claim should be treated as a&para;<br>question of law, we also recognized that in patent con­&para;<br>struction, subsidiary factfinding is sometimes necessary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Indeed, we referred to claim construction as a practice&para;<br>with “evidentiary underpinnings,” a practice that “falls&para;<br>somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple&para;<br>historical fact.” 517 U. S., at 378, 388, 390. We added&para;<br>that sometimes courts may have to make “credibility&para;<br>judgments” about witnesses. Id., at 389. In other words,&para;<br>we recognized that courts may have to resolve subsidiary&para;<br>factual disputes. And, as explained above, the Rule re­&para;<br>quires appellate courts to review all such subsidiary fac­&para;<br>tual findings under the “clearly erroneous” standard.&para;<br>Precedent further supports application of the “clearly&para;<br>erroneous” standard. Before the creation of the Federal&para;<br>Circuit, the Second Circuit explained that in claim con­&para;<br>struction, the subsidiary “question . . . of how the art understood the term . . . was plainly a question of fact; and&para;<br>unless the [district court’s] finding was ‘clearly erroneous,’&para;<br>we are to take” it “as controlling.” Harries v. Air King&para;<br>Products, Co., 183 F. 2d 158, 164 (CA2 1950) (L. Hand,&para;<br>C. J.). We have said the same as to subsidiary factual&para;<br>findings concerning other patent law inquiries, including&para;<br>“obviousness.” Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475&para;<br>U. S. 809, 811 (1986) (per curiam) (“subsidiary determina­&para;<br>tions of the District Court” subject to Rule 52(a)’s clear&para;<br>error standard).&para;<br>Finally, practical considerations favor clear error re­&para;<br>view. We have previously pointed out that clear error&para;<br>review is “particularly” important where patent law is at&para;<br>issue because patent law is “a field where so much de­&para;<br>pends upon familiarity with specific scientific problems&para;<br>and principles not usually contained in the general store­&para;<br>house of knowledge and experience.” Graver Tank &amp; Mfg.&para;<br>Co. v.

Indeed, as&para;<br>discussed in Part III, infra, this case provides a perfect&para;<br>example of the factfinding that sometimes underlies claim&para;<br>construction: The parties here presented the District&para;<br>Court with competing fact-related claims by different&para;<br>experts, and the District Court resolved the issues of fact&para;<br>that divided those experts.&para;<br>The dissent’s contention also runs contrary to Sandoz’s&para;<br>concession at oral argument that claim construction will&para;<br>sometimes require subsidiary factfinding. Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>33–34, 38–40. It is in tension with our interpretation of&para;<br>related areas of patent law, such as the interpretation of&para;<br>“obviousness,” which we have said involves subsidiary&para;<br>factfinding subject to Rule 52(a)’s clear error review. See&para;<br>Dennison, 475 U. S., at 811. And it fights the question&para;<br>presented in this case, which assumes the existence of&para;<br>such factfinding. See Pet. for Cert. i (whether “a district&para;<br>court’s factual finding in support of its construction of a&para;<br>patent claim term may be reviewed de novo, . . . or only&para;<br>for clear error”).&para;<br>Neither do we find factfinding in this context sufficiently&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>similar to the factfinding that underlies statutory inter­&para;<br>pretation. Statutes, in general, address themselves to the&para;<br>general public; patent claims concern a small portion of&para;<br>that public. Statutes typically (though not always) rest&para;<br>upon congressional consideration of general facts related&para;<br>to a reasonably broad set of social circumstances; patents&para;<br>typically (though not always) rest upon consideration by a&para;<br>few private parties, experts, and administrators of more&para;<br>narrowly circumscribed facts related to specific technical&para;<br>matters. The public, and often an adversarial public,&para;<br>typically considers and discusses the relevant general&para;<br>facts before Congress enacts a statute; only private par­&para;<br>ties, experts, and administrators likely consider the rele­&para;<br>vant technical facts before the award of a patent. Given&para;<br>these differences, it is not surprising that this Court has&para;<br>never previously compared patent claim construction in&para;<br>any here relevant way to statutory construction. As dis­&para;<br>cussed supra, at 5, however, the Court has repeatedly&para;<br>compared patent claim construction to the construction of&para;<br>other written instruments such as deeds and contracts.&para;<br>See, e.g., Markman, supra, at 384, 386, 388, 389; Motion&para;<br>Picture Patent Co., 243 U. S., at 510; Goodyear, 102 U. S.,&para;<br>at 227.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Now that we have set forth why the Federal Circuit&para;<br>must apply clear error review when reviewing subsidiary&para;<br>factfinding in patent claim construction, it is necessary to&para;<br>explain how the rule must be applied in that context. We&para;<br>recognize that a district court’s construction of a patent&para;<br>claim, like a district court’s interpretation of a written&para;<br>instrument, often requires the judge only to examine and&para;<br>to construe the document’s words without requiring the&para;<br>judge to resolve any underlying factual disputes. As all&para;<br>parties agree, when the district court reviews only evi­&para;<br>dence intrinsic to the patent (the patent claims and speci­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fications, along with the patent’s prosecution history), the&para;<br>judge’s determination will amount solely to a determina­&para;<br>tion of law, and the Court of Appeals will review that&para;<br>construction de novo. See Brief for Petitioners 27, Reply Brief 16; Brief for Respondents 43; see also Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 12–13.&para;<br>In some cases, however, the district court will need to&para;<br>look beyond the patent’s intrinsic evidence and to consult&para;<br>extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the&para;<br>background science or the meaning of a term in the rele­&para;<br>vant art during the relevant time period. See, e.g., Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 546 (1871) (a patent may&para;<br>be “so interspersed with technical terms and terms of art&para;<br>that the testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable&para;<br>to a correct understanding of its meaning”). In cases&para;<br>where those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will&para;<br>need to make subsidiary factual findings about that ex­&para;<br>trinsic evidence. These are the “evidentiary underpin­&para;<br>nings” of claim construction that we discussed in Markman, and this subsidiary factfinding must be reviewed for&para;<br>clear error on appeal.&para;<br>For example, if a district court resolves a dispute be­&para;<br>tween experts and makes a factual finding that, in gen­&para;<br>eral, a certain term of art had a particular meaning to a&para;<br>person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the inven­&para;<br>tion, the district court must then conduct a legal analysis:&para;<br>whether a skilled artisan would ascribe that same mean­&para;<br>ing to that term in the context of the specific patent claim&para;<br>under review. That is because “[e]xperts may be examined&para;<br>to explain terms of art, and the state of the art, at any&para;<br>given time,” but they cannot be used to prove “the proper&para;<br>or legal construction of any instrument of writing.”&para;<br>Winans v. New York &amp; Erie R. Co., 21 How. 88, 100–101&para;<br>(1859); see also Markman, supra, at 388 (“ ‘Where tech­&para;<br>nical terms are used, or where the qualities of substances&para;<br>. . . or any similar data necessary to the comprehension of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

Robinson, Law of Patents §732, pp.&para;<br>482–483 (1890); emphasis in original)).&para;<br>Accordingly, the question we have answered here con­&para;<br>cerns review of the district court’s resolution of a subsidi­&para;<br>ary factual dispute that helps that court determine the&para;<br>proper interpretation of the written patent claim. The&para;<br>district judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then&para;<br>interpret the patent claim in light of the facts as he has&para;<br>found them. This ultimate interpretation is a legal con­&para;<br>clusion. The appellate court can still review the district&para;<br>court’s ultimate construction of the claim de novo. But, to&para;<br>overturn the judge’s resolution of an underlying factual&para;<br>dispute, the Court of Appeals must find that the judge, in&para;<br>respect to those factual findings, has made a clear error.&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).&para;<br>In some instances, a factual finding will play only a&para;<br>small role in a judge’s ultimate legal conclusion about the&para;<br>meaning of the patent term. But in some instances, a&para;<br>factual finding may be close to dispositive of the ultimate&para;<br>legal question of the proper meaning of the term in the&para;<br>context of the patent. Nonetheless, the ultimate question&para;<br>of construction will remain a legal question. Simply be­&para;<br>cause a factual finding may be nearly dispositive does not&para;<br>render the subsidiary question a legal one. “[A]n issue&para;<br>does not lose its factual character merely because its&para;<br>resolution is dispositive of the ultimate” legal question.&para;<br>Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 113 (1985). It is analogous&para;<br>to a judge (sitting without a jury) deciding whether a&para;<br>defendant gave a confession voluntarily.

An appellate court similarly should&para;<br>review for clear error those factual findings that underlie&para;<br>a district court’s claim construction.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We can illustrate our holding by considering an instance&para;<br>in which Teva, with the support of the Solicitor General,&para;<br>argues that the Federal Circuit wrongly reviewed the&para;<br>District Court’s factual finding de novo. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 54–56; Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 31–32. Recall that Teva’s patent claim specifies an&para;<br>active ingredient with a “molecular weight of about 5 to 9&para;<br>kilodaltons.” Recall Sandoz’s basic argument, namely that&para;<br>the term “molecular weight” is indefinite or ambiguous.&para;<br>The term might refer to the weight of the most numerous&para;<br>molecule, it might refer to weight as calculated by the&para;<br>average weight of all molecules, or it might refer to weight&para;<br>as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules&para;<br>count for more. The claim, Sandoz argues, does not tell us&para;<br>which way we should calculate weight. See Part I, supra.&para;<br>To illustrate, imagine we have a sample of copolymer-1&para;<br>(the active ingredient) made up of 10 molecules: 4 weigh 6&para;<br>kilodaltons each, 3 weigh 8 kilodaltons each, and 3 weigh&para;<br>9 kilodaltons each. Using the first method of calculation,&para;<br>the “molecular weight” would be 6 kilodaltons, the weight&para;<br>of the most prevalent molecule. Using the second method,&para;<br>the molecular weight would be 7.5 (total weight, 75, divided by the number of molecules, 10). Using the third&para;<br>method, the molecular weight would be more than 8, depend-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing upon how much extra weight we gave to the heavier&para;<br>molecules.&para;<br>Teva argued in the District Court that the term “molec­&para;<br>ular weight” in the patent meant molecular weight calcu­&para;<br>lated in the first way (the weight of the most prevalent&para;<br>molecule, or peak average molecular weight). Sandoz,&para;<br>however, argued that figure 1 of the patent showed that&para;<br>Teva could not be right. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590. (We&para;<br>have set forth figure 1 in the Appendix, infra). That fig­&para;<br>ure, said Sandoz, helped to show that the patent term did&para;<br>not refer to the first method of calculation. Figure 1 shows&para;<br>how the weights of a sample’s molecules were distributed&para;<br>in three different samples. The curves indicate the num­&para;<br>ber of molecules of each weight that were present in each&para;<br>of the three. For example, the figure’s legend says that&para;<br>the first sample’s “molecular weight” is 7.7. According to&para;<br>Teva, that should mean that molecules weighing 7.7 kilo­&para;<br>daltons were the most prevalent molecules in the sample.&para;<br>But, look at the curve, said Sandoz. It shows that the&para;<br>most prevalent molecule weighed, not 7.7 kilodaltons, but&para;<br>slightly less than 7.7 (about 6.8) kilodaltons. See App.&para;<br>138a–139a. After all, the peak of the first molecular&para;<br>weight distribution curve (the solid curve in the figure) is&para;<br>not at precisely 7.7 kilodaltons, but at a point just before&para;<br>7.7. Thus, argued Sandoz, the figure shows that the pa­&para;<br>tent claim term “molecular weight” did not mean molecu­&para;<br>lar weight calculated by the first method. It must mean&para;<br>something else. It is indefinite. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590.&para;<br>The District Court did not accept Sandoz’s argument.&para;<br>Teva’s expert testified that a skilled artisan would under­&para;<br>stand that converting data from a chromatogram to mo­&para;<br>lecular weight distribution curves like those in figure 1&para;<br>would cause the peak on each curve to shift slightly; this&para;<br>could explain the difference between the value indicated&para;<br>by the peak of the curve (about 6.8) and the value in the&para;<br>figure’s legend (7.7).

The District Court’s&para;<br>finding about this matter was a factual finding—about&para;<br>how a skilled artisan would understand the way in which&para;<br>a curve created from chromatogram data reflects molecu­&para;<br>lar weights. Based on that factual finding, the District&para;<br>Court reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not&para;<br>undermine Teva’s argument that molecular weight re­&para;<br>ferred to the first method of calculation (peak average&para;<br>molecular weight). 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590–591.&para;<br>When the Federal Circuit reviewed the District Court’s&para;<br>decision, it recognized that the peak of the curve did not&para;<br>match the 7.7 kilodaltons listed in the legend of figure 1.&para;<br>723 F. 3d, at 1369. But the Federal Circuit did not accept&para;<br>Teva’s expert’s explanation as to how a skilled artisan&para;<br>would expect the peaks of the curves to shift.

See ante, at 5.&para;<br>But in certain contexts, a court construing a written in­&para;<br>strument makes subsidiary determinations that the law&para;<br>treats as findings of fact.&para;<br>The classic case of a written instrument whose construc­&para;<br>tion does not involve subsidiary findings of fact is a stat­&para;<br>ute. Our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings&para;<br>underlying statutory construction as conclusions of law&para;<br>makes sense for two reasons.&para;<br>First, although statutory construction may demand&para;<br>some inquiry into legislative “intent,” that inquiry is analytically legal: The meaning of a statute does not turn&para;<br>on what an individual lawmaker intended as a matter of&para;<br>fact, but only on what intent has been enacted into law&para;<br>through the constitutionally defined channels of bicamer­&para;<br>alism and presentment. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.&para;<br>555, 587 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>This remains so even if deciding what passed through&para;<br>those channels requires a court to determine a “fact” of&para;<br>historical understanding through an examination of ex­&para;<br>trinsic evidence. See, e.g., Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542&para;<br>U. S. 692, 714–715 (2004) (examining the historical under­&para;<br>standing of the term “law of nations” when the Alien Tort&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Statute was enacted); see also, e.g., McIntyre v. Ohio&para;<br>Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 359–366 (1995)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (construing a consti­&para;<br>tutional provision by asking how the words were originally&para;<br>understood and marshaling evidence of that understand­&para;<br>ing). The Court has given no hint that this practice&para;<br>changes when the statute it construes is a land patent—&para;<br>that is, a public land grant. See Leo Sheep Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 440 U. S. 668, 669 (1979) (making detailed histori­&para;<br>cal findings in the course of construing a land grant be­&para;<br>cause “ ‘courts, in construing a statute, may with propriety&para;<br>recur to the history of the times when it was passed . . . in&para;<br>order to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of&para;<br>particular provisions in it’ ”); see also Marvin M.

S. ___, ___ (2014)&para;<br>(slip op., at 10) (looking to the historical background&para;<br>against which a land grant was passed to confirm its&para;<br>interpretation).&para;<br>Second, statutes govern the rights and duties of the&para;<br>public as a whole, so subsidiary evidentiary findings shape&para;<br>legal rules that apply far beyond the boundaries of the&para;<br>dispute involved. Our rules of construction for legislative&para;<br>acts have long been consciously shaped by the public’s&para;<br>stake in those acts. See, e.g., The Binghamton Bridge, 3&para;<br>Wall. 51, 75 (1866) (describing a rule of construction bor­&para;<br>rowed from English common law and reflected in the&para;<br>decisions of the several States).&para;<br>The construction of contracts and deeds, by contrast,&para;<br>sometimes involves subsidiary findings of fact.&para;<br>Our&para;<br>treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings as findings of&para;<br>fact in this context makes sense because, in construing&para;<br>contracts and deeds, “the avowed purpose and primary&para;<br>function of the court is to ascertain the intention of the&para;<br>parties.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:2, pp. 17–&para;<br>18 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston); see also Reed v.

Sometimes that intention is clearly “set forth&para;<br>in the express language of the contract,” 11 Williston&para;<br>§31:1, at 341–342, so no subsidiary findings of fact are&para;<br>necessary to its construction, id., §30:1. But when ambi­&para;<br>guities require a court to look beyond the express lan­&para;<br>guage, its search for intent becomes factual in nature.&para;<br>That search focuses on “real intention[s]”—embodied in an&para;<br>actual meeting of minds or an actual conveyance of a&para;<br>physical parcel of land—that have an existence outside the&para;<br>written instrument and that the instrument merely rec­&para;<br>ords. See William &amp; James Brown &amp; Co. v. McGran, 14&para;<br>Pet. 479, 493 (1840) (Story, J.); Reed, supra, at 289. See&para;<br>generally Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 10 Ct.

Brandt Revocable Trust, supra, at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 5). Invention patents originated not as private&para;<br>property rights, but as royal prerogatives. See 4 W.&para;<br>Holdsworth, A History of English Law 350–351 (1924).&para;<br>They could be issued and revoked only by the Crown,&para;<br>which sometimes used the patent to delegate governmen­&para;<br>tal power to regulate an industry. Id., at 344–347. Pro­&para;<br>voked by the Crown’s use of these so-called “monopoly&para;<br>patents” to promote private economic interests over inno­&para;<br>vation and beneficial commerce, Parliament enacted the&para;<br>Statute of Monopolies in 1624. Id., at 353. But even&para;<br>under the regime that Parliament put in place, patents&para;<br>remained sovereign grants, issued, enforced, and revoked&para;<br>by the Privy Council. Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide if&para;<br>Patents are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1681 (2013).&para;<br>The Framers adopted a similar scheme. Article I of the&para;<br>U. S. Constitution vests the patent power in Congress,&para;<br>authorizing it “[t]o promote the Progress of Science and&para;<br>useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and&para;<br>Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings&para;<br>and Discoveries.” U. S. Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Although&para;<br>Congress could issue such patents as special statutes, see,&para;<br>e.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549–550 (1853),&para;<br>it has mostly acted by authorizing the Executive Branch to&para;<br>issue patents when certain statutory requirements are&para;<br>met. See 35 U. S. C. §151; see also Act of July 8, 1870,&para;<br>§31, 16 Stat. 202; Act of July 4, 1836, §7, 5 Stat. 119; Act&para;<br>of Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1, 1 Stat. 109–110.&para;<br>Like the royal prerogatives that were their historical&para;<br>antecedents, patents have a regulatory effect: They “re­&para;<br>strain others from manufacturing, using or selling that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal&para;<br>Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510 (1917) (emphasis added).&para;<br>And because the regulatory scope of a patent is deter­&para;<br>mined by the claims in the patent, the subsidiary findings&para;<br>that a court makes during claim construction contribute to&para;<br>rules that limit conduct by the public at large.&para;<br>Because they are governmental dispositions and provide&para;<br>rules that bind the public at large, patent claims resemble&para;<br>statutes. The scope of a patent holder’s monopoly right is&para;<br>defined by claims legally actualized through the proce­&para;<br>dures established by Congress pursuant to its patent&para;<br>power. Thus, a patent holder’s actual intentions have&para;<br>effect only to the extent that they are expressed in the&para;<br>public record. See Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron&para;<br>Co., 95 U. S. 274, 279 (1877); see also Goodyear Dental&para;<br>Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 227 (1880) (examin­&para;<br>ing “the avowed understanding of the patentee,” but dis­&para;<br>claiming any holding that such understanding “c[ould] be&para;<br>allowed to enlarge, diminish, or vary the language of a&para;<br>patent afterwards issued”).&para;<br>Moreover, because the ultimate meaning of a patent&para;<br>claim, like the ultimate meaning of a statute, binds the&para;<br>public at large, it should not depend on the specific evi­&para;<br>dence presented in a particular infringement case. Al­&para;<br>though the party presentations shape even statutory construction, de novo review on appeal helps to ensure that&para;<br>the construction is not skewed by the specific evidence&para;<br>presented in a given case.&para;<br>C&para;<br>For purposes of construction, contracts and deeds are&para;<br>less natural analogies for patents. In particular, patents&para;<br>lack the characteristics of those instruments that have&para;<br>justified departing from the usual practice of treating&para;<br>document construction as a wholly legal inquiry, not sub­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v.

But, as&para;<br>our decisions have also recognized, the patent is perhaps&para;<br>better characterized as a reward for feats already accom­&para;<br>plished—that is, innovation and public disclosure—than&para;<br>as a mutual exchange of executory promises. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Motion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 513; Seymour v.&para;<br>Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533–534 (1871); Grant, supra, at&para;<br>242; see also Markman v.

In grant­&para;<br>ing a patent, the Government is acting not as a party to a&para;<br>bilateral contract binding upon itself alone, but instead as&para;<br>a sovereign bestowing upon the inventor a right to exclude&para;<br>the public at large from the invention marked out by his&para;<br>claims.&para;<br>In this sense, patents are more closely analogous to&para;<br>deeds, Motion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 510 (collecting&para;<br>cases), because they share the common characteristic of&para;<br>describing rights that the owner holds against the world.&para;<br>See Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489&para;<br>U. S. 141, 162 (1989). But in the context of land patents,&para;<br>we have been unwilling to interpret sovereign dispositions&para;<br>in the same way we interpret analogous private convey­&para;<br>ances. See, e.g., Leo Sheep Co., 440 U. S., at 680–682;&para;<br>Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co. v. Kansas Pacific R. Co., 97 U. S.&para;<br>491, 497 (1878); Leavenworth, L. &amp; G. R. Co. v.

But the subsidiary&para;<br>determinations about patent claims that the majority&para;<br>identifies as factual do not concern historical facts, such as&para;<br>what the parties agreed to do or how a given parcel of land&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Anglo-American legal tradition has long distinguished between&para;<br>“core” private rights—including the traditional property rights repre­&para;<br>sented by deeds—and other types of rights. Nelson, Adjudication in the&para;<br>Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 567 (2007) (Nelson). These&para;<br>other rights fall into two categories: “ ‘public rights belonging to the&para;<br>people at large,’ ” and “privileges” or “franchises,” “which public author­&para;<br>ities ha[ve] created purely for reasons of public policy and which ha[ve]&para;<br>no counterpart in the Lockean state of nature.” Id., at 566–567 Not­&para;<br>withstanding a movement to recognize a “core” property right in inven­&para;<br>tions, the English common law placed patents squarely in the final&para;<br>category, as franchises that “depend upon express legislation,” and&para;<br>“hath [their] essence by positive municipal law.” 7 W. Holdsworth, A&para;<br>History of English Law 479, n. 7, 480, and n. 4, 497 (1926). The distinc­&para;<br>tion between “core” private rights, on the one hand, and public rights&para;<br>and government-created privileges, on the other, has traditionally had&para;<br>significant implications for the way in which rights are adjudicated.&para;<br>Nelson, supra. Thus, no matter how closely a franchise resembles some&para;<br>“core” private right, it does not follow that it must be subject to the&para;<br>same rules of judicial interpretation as its counterpart.&para;<br>Cases interpreting deeds and land patents exemplify this rule and&para;<br>show why the majority’s assertion that patents affect fewer people than&para;<br>statutes, in addition to being a dubious overgeneralization, is not a&para;<br>material distinction. Land patents are more like deeds than statutes in&para;<br>the sense that their effects are more localized, yet the judicial power&para;<br>approaches them differently because they dispose of public rights held&para;<br>by the government on behalf of the people, Nelson 566. See also The&para;<br>Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 75 (1866) (interpreting a state grant of&para;<br>a corporate charter as a “contract” but subject to the special commonlaw rule that all ambiguities must be construed in favor of the State&para;<br>because “in grants by the public nothing passes by implication”).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v.

See William &amp; James Brown &amp; Co., 14 Pet., at&para;<br>493; Reed, 8 How., at 289.&para;<br>For example, the “fact” of how a skilled artisan would&para;<br>understand a given term or phrase at a particular point in&para;<br>history is a legal fiction; it has no existence independent of&para;<br>the claim construction process. There is no actual “skilled&para;<br>artisan” who, at the moment the application was filed,&para;<br>formed an understanding of the terms of the claim—an&para;<br>understanding that an omniscient factfinder could ascer­&para;<br>tain. Neither is the skilled artisan’s understanding a&para;<br>proxy for some external fact that, could the court know it,&para;<br>would supply the meaning of a patent claim. Whatever&para;<br>the scope of the inventor’s right under the patent before&para;<br>the introduction of claims, the law has limited that right&para;<br>to the claims as written in the patent. See Markman,&para;<br>supra, at 379. Our decision in Markman rested in part on&para;<br>this characteristic of claim construction, distinguishing it&para;<br>from other patent determinations that must go to a jury&para;<br>because they require the factfinder to inspect “ ‘an embod­&para;<br>ied conception outside of the patent itself ’ ” or things&para;<br>“ ‘which have their existence in pais.’ ” 517 U.

S. 285, 292 (1922), the majority compares the search for the meaning of “ ‘technical&para;<br>words or phrases not commonly understood’ ” in claim&para;<br>construction to “questions of fact” about the scope of a&para;<br>railway tariff. See ante, at 6. It is true that, in Great&para;<br>Northern, the Court referred to questions of fact arising in&para;<br>the context of contract construction, which, it pointed out,&para;<br>must go to a jury. 259 U. S., at 292–293. But the Court’s&para;<br>conclusion that similar questions must be settled by the&para;<br>Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) when they relate&para;<br>to the interpretation of a railway tariff merely proves the&para;<br>point that the allocation of a technical usage inquiry de­&para;<br>pends upon the legal instrument that the court is constru­&para;<br>ing. In that case, the Court was faced with a tariff filed&para;<br>with, and administered by, the ICC. And it was not con­&para;<br>cerned with allocating evidentiary determinations be­&para;<br>tween trial and appellate courts, but with allocating them&para;<br>between an agency and the judiciary. Id., at 289. So&para;<br>understood, the distinction the Court drew pertains more&para;<br>to an emerging rule of administrative deference than to a&para;<br>definitive classification of judicial determinations.&para;<br>Further reinforcing the point that the nature of the legal&para;<br>instrument dictates our treatment of subsidiary findings is&para;<br>that, although terms in statutes and regulations frequently&para;<br>have technical meanings unknown outside the specialized community they are meant to regulate, we treat the&para;<br>inquiry into those meanings as involving only conclusions&para;<br>of law. See, e.g., Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Hiles, 516&para;<br>U. S. 400, 401–407, 413–414 (1996); Aluminum Co. of&para;<br>America v. Central Lincoln Peoples’ Util. Dist., 467 U. S.&para;<br>380, 390 (1984). The majority’s unexamined reliance on&para;<br>technical usage could be read to cast doubt on this prac­&para;<br>tice, as well as on our holding in Markman that claim&para;<br>construction is exclusively for the court. If claim construc­&para;<br>tion involves subsidiary questions of technical meaning or&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v.

Ante, at 11 (citing Dennison Mfg. Co. v.&para;<br>Panduit Corp., 475 U.

Id., at 810–811. Cf. Markman,&para;<br>supra, at 386 (distinguishing the novelty inquiry from&para;<br>claim construction on these grounds).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Nor does the majority attempt to justify its holding by&para;<br>reference to which “ ‘judicial actor is better positioned . . .&para;<br>to decide the issue in question,’ ” Markman, supra, at&para;<br>388—an inquiry that we have also treated as relevant to&para;<br>the classification of fact versus law, Miller, 474 U. S., at&para;<br>114. In resolving issues of judicial administration, we&para;<br>have considered that federal appellate courts are “exposi­&para;<br>tor[s] of law,” ibid., and have acknowledged that they are&para;<br>better positioned than district courts to promote uniformity, Markman, supra, at 390; see also Ornelas v. United&para;<br>States, 517 U. S. 690, 697–698 (1996). We have recog­&para;<br>nized, however, that trial courts have a special competence&para;<br>in judging witness credibility and weighing the evidence,&para;<br>Miller, supra, at 114, and have been cautious not to waste&para;<br>judicial and party resources through needless relitigation,&para;<br>see Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 575 (1985).&para;<br>To the extent that the construction of a patent claim&para;<br>turns on testimony of expert witnesses, especially live&para;<br>testimony, there is no denying that it falls within the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

But as we&para;<br>recognized in Markman, and as the majority is careful to&para;<br>reiterate today, “subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom&para;<br>large in the universe of litigated claim construction.”&para;<br>Ante, at 10. The majority’s reluctance to highlight “alloca­&para;<br>tion,” Miller, supra at 113, is thus understandable. The&para;<br>arguments favoring allocation to the district court, dimin­&para;<br>ished by the majority’s own prediction, are outweighed by&para;<br>the remaining rule-of-law and uniformity considerations&para;<br>that factored into our allocation in Markman, 517 U. S., at&para;<br>388–391.&para;<br>1&para;<br>We have long been cautious not to allocate issues in a&para;<br>way that would “strip a federal appellate court of its pri­&para;<br>mary function as an expositor of law.” Miller, 474 U. S., at&para;<br>114. Although we have recognized that “an issue does not&para;<br>lose its factual character merely because its resolution is&para;<br>dispositive of the ultimate” dispute, id., at 113, we have&para;<br>been less inclined to defer to seemingly factual determina­&para;<br>tions that play a dispositive role in the development of&para;<br>legal rules. For example, we have sanctioned de novo&para;<br>appellate review of the mixed determinations of “probable&para;<br>cause” and “reasonable suspicion” on the ground that “the&para;<br>legal rules . . . acquire content only through application.”&para;<br>Ornelas, supra, 697; see also Miller, supra, at 116. Although such determinations depend on the specific facts in&para;<br>a case, their role in shaping rules of law demand a de novo&para;<br>standard of review.&para;<br>As previously noted, patents are authoritative govern­&para;<br>mental dispositions. Thus, when a judge construes a&para;<br>patent, he is, in a very real sense, “say[ing] what the law&para;<br>is,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), not&para;<br>just for the parties to the dispute, but for the public at&para;<br>large. It follows that, any time a district court’s claim&para;<br>construction turns on subsidiary evidentiary disputes, the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>majority’s rule will distort the appellate court’s construc­&para;<br>tion of the law by requiring it to defer to subsidiary deter­&para;<br>minations that are dispositive as to its meaning. Surely&para;<br>the majority would not countenance such an abdication&para;<br>of the appellate court’s role in the construction of statutes.&para;<br>Yet the majority has not justified applying a different rule&para;<br>to the construction of legislative acts that take the form of&para;<br>a patent.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The need for uniformity in claim construction also&para;<br>weighs heavily in favor of de novo review of subsidiary&para;<br>evidentiary determinations. Uniformity is a critical fea­&para;<br>ture of our patent system because “ ‘[t]he limits of a patent&para;<br>must be known for the protection of the patentee, the&para;<br>encouragement of the inventive genius of others and the&para;<br>assurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated&para;<br>ultimately to the public.’ ” Markman, 517 U. S., at 390. If&para;<br>the boundaries of the patent right could shift from case to&para;<br>case, then the result would be “a ‘zone of uncertainty&para;<br>which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at&para;<br>the risk of infringement.’ ” Ibid.; see also Festo Corp. v.&para;<br>Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731&para;<br>(2002). So damaging is this unpredictability that we&para;<br>identified uniformity as an “independent” reason justify­&para;<br>ing our allocation of claim construction to the court. See&para;<br>Markman, supra, at 390.&para;<br>The majority attempts to downplay the effect its deci­&para;<br>sion will have on uniformity by pointing out that “prior&para;<br>cases [construing the same claim] will sometimes be bind­&para;<br>ing because of issue preclusion, and sometimes will serve&para;<br>as persuasive authority.” Ante, at 9–10 (citing Markman,&para;<br>supra, at 391; citation omitted). But we have already&para;<br>rejected the notion that issue preclusion adequately safe­&para;<br>guards the uniformity that our patent system requires.&para;<br>See Markman, supra, at 391.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Perhaps the majority is correct that “subsidiary factfind­&para;<br>ing is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated&para;<br>claim construction.” Ante, at 10. But I doubt it. If this&para;<br>case proves anything, it is that the line between fact and&para;<br>law is an uncertain one—made all the more uncertain by&para;<br>the majority’s failure to identify sound principles for the&para;<br>lines it draws. The majority’s rule provides litigants who&para;<br>prevail in district court a significant opportunity and&para;<br>incentive to take advantage of this uncertainty by arguing&para;<br>on appeal that the district court’s claim construction in­&para;<br>volved subsidiary findings of fact. At best, today’s holding&para;<br>will spawn costly—and, if the majority is correct about the&para;<br>frequency with which these evidentiary determinations&para;<br>make a difference, meritless—collateral litigation over the&para;<br>line between law and fact. We generally avoid any rule of&para;<br>judicial administration that “results in a substantial&para;<br>expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult ques­&para;<br>tions that have no effect on the outcome of the case,” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236–237 (2009), and there&para;<br>is no reason to embrace one here. But I fear worse: that&para;<br>today’s decision will result in fewer claim construction&para;<br>decisions receiving precedential effect, thereby injecting&para;<br>uncertainty into the world of invention and innovation.&para;<br>In short, the majority’s rule finds no support in either&para;<br>the historical understanding of “findings of fact” or consid­&para;<br>erations of policy that have served as our guide when we&para;<br>have been confronted with a difficult question of fact-law&para;<br>classification. I would not adopt it.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reviewed de novo not only the&para;<br>District Court’s claim construction, but also its holding&para;<br>that the claims were sufficiently definite to satisfy 35&para;<br>U. S. C. §112, ¶2 (2006 ed.). I would hold that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals correctly treated the indefiniteness inquiry as a&para;<br>question of law because it depends entirely on claim&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>construction.&para;<br>“[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read&para;<br>in light of the specification delineating the patent, and the&para;<br>prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable cer­&para;<br>tainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the in­&para;<br>vention.” Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1). This standard falls&para;<br>somewhere between a notice requirement and a prohibi­&para;<br>tion on ambiguity. See id., at ___ –___ (slip op., at 9–11).&para;<br>Determining whether a claim is indefinite is thus akin to&para;<br>other legal inquiries commonly performed in the course of&para;<br>interpreting written instruments. See, e.g., Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562&para;<br>U.

Thus, the Court of Appeals properly re­&para;<br>viewed the District Court’s conclusions of law de novo. I&para;<br>respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
