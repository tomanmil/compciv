ANDREW CARMAN, ET UX.&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 14–212.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided November 10, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>On July 3, 2009, the Pennsylvania State Police Department received a report that a man named Michael Zita&para;<br>had stolen a car and two loaded handguns. The report&para;<br>also said that Zita might have fled to the home of Andrew&para;<br>and Karen Carman. The department sent Officers Jeremy&para;<br>Carroll and Brian Roberts to the Carmans’ home to investigate. Neither officer had been to the home before. 749&para;<br>F. 3d 192, 195 (CA3 2014).&para;<br>The officers arrived in separate patrol cars around 2:30&para;<br>p.m. The Carmans’ house sat on a corner lot—the front of&para;<br>the house faced a main street while the left (as viewed&para;<br>from the front) faced a side street. The officers initially&para;<br>drove to the front of the house, but after discovering that&para;<br>parking was not available there, turned right onto the side&para;<br>street. As they did so, they saw several cars parked sideby-side in a gravel parking area on the left side of the&para;<br>Carmans’ property. The officers parked in the “first available spot,” at “the far rear of the property.” Ibid. (quoting&para;<br>Tr. 70 (Apr. 8, 2013)).&para;<br>The officers exited their patrol cars. As they looked&para;<br>toward the house, the officers saw a small structure (either a carport or a shed) with its door open and a light on.&para;<br>Id., at 71. Thinking someone might be inside, Officer&para;<br>Carroll walked over, “poked [his] head” in, and said&para;<br>“Pennsylvania State Police.” 749 F. 3d, at 195 (quoting Tr.&para;<br>71 (Apr. 8, 2013); alteration in original). No one was&para;<br>there, however, so the officers continued walking toward&para;<br>the house. As they approached, they saw a sliding glass&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CARROLL v. CARMAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>door that opened onto a ground-level deck. Carroll&para;<br>thought the sliding glass door “looked like a customary&para;<br>entryway,” so he and Officer Roberts decided to knock on&para;<br>it. 749 F. 3d, at 195 (quoting Tr. 83 (Apr. 8, 2013)).&para;<br>As the officers stepped onto the deck, a man came out&para;<br>of the house and “belligerent[ly] and aggressively approached” them. 749 F. 3d, at 195. The officers identified&para;<br>themselves, explained they were looking for Michael Zita,&para;<br>and asked the man for his name. The man refused to&para;<br>answer. Instead, he turned away from the officers and&para;<br>appeared to reach for his waist. Id., at 195–196. Carroll&para;<br>grabbed the man’s right arm to make sure he was not&para;<br>reaching for a weapon. The man twisted away from Carroll, lost his balance, and fell into the yard. Id., at 196.&para;<br>At that point, a woman came out of the house and asked&para;<br>what was happening. The officers again explained that&para;<br>they were looking for Zita. The woman then identified&para;<br>herself as Karen Carman, identified the man as her husband, Andrew Carman, and told the officers that Zita was&para;<br>not there. In response, the officers asked for permission to&para;<br>search the house for Zita. Karen Carman consented, and&para;<br>everyone went inside. Ibid.&para;<br>The officers searched the house, but did not find Zita.&para;<br>They then left. The Carmans were not charged with any&para;<br>crimes. Ibid.&para;<br>The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in Federal&para;<br>District Court under 42 U. S. C. §1983. Among other&para;<br>things, they alleged that Carroll unlawfully entered their&para;<br>property in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he&para;<br>went into their backyard and onto their deck without a&para;<br>warrant. 749 F. 3d, at 196.&para;<br>At trial, Carroll argued that his entry was lawful under&para;<br>the “knock and talk” exception to the warrant requirement. That exception, he contended, allows officers to&para;<br>knock on someone’s door, so long as they stay “on those&para;<br>portions of [the] property that the general public is al-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>lowed to go on.” Tr. 7 (Apr. 8, 2013). The Carmans responded that a normal visitor would have gone to their&para;<br>front door, rather than into their backyard or onto their&para;<br>deck. Thus, they argued, the “knock and talk” exception&para;<br>did not apply.&para;<br>At the close of Carroll’s case in chief, the parties each&para;<br>moved for judgment as a matter of law. The District Court&para;<br>denied both motions, and sent the case to a jury. As relevant here, the District Court instructed the jury that the&para;<br>“knock and talk” exception “allows officers without a&para;<br>warrant to knock on a resident’s door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants,&para;<br>just as any private citizen might.” Id., at 24 (Apr. 10,&para;<br>2013). The District Court further explained that “officers&para;<br>should restrict their movements to walkways, driveways,&para;<br>porches and places where visitors could be expected to go.”&para;<br>Ibid. The jury then returned a verdict for Carroll.&para;<br>The Carmans appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Third Circuit reversed in relevant part. The court held&para;<br>that Officer Carroll violated the Fourth Amendment as a&para;<br>matter of law because the “knock and talk” exception&para;<br>“requires that police officers begin their encounter at the&para;<br>front door, where they have an implied invitation to go.”&para;<br>749 F. 3d, at 199. The court also held that Carroll was not&para;<br>entitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated&para;<br>clearly established law. Ibid. The court therefore reversed the District Court and held that the Carmans were&para;<br>entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&para;<br>Carroll petitioned for certiorari. We grant the petition&para;<br>and reverse the Third Circuit’s determination that Carroll&para;<br>was not entitled to qualified immunity.&para;<br>A government official sued under §1983 is entitled to&para;<br>qualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory&para;<br>or constitutional right that was clearly established at the&para;<br>time of the challenged conduct. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,&para;<br>563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). A right is clearly&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CARROLL v. CARMAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that&para;<br>“a reasonable official would understand that what he is&para;<br>doing violates that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483&para;<br>U. S. 635, 640 (1987). In other words, “existing precedent&para;<br>must have placed the statutory or constitutional question&para;<br>beyond debate.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>This doctrine “gives government officials breathing room&para;<br>to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting&para;<br>Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)).&para;<br>Here the Third Circuit cited only a single case to support its decision that Carroll was not entitled to qualified&para;<br>immunity—Estate of Smith v. Marasco, 318 F. 3d 497&para;<br>(CA3 2003). Assuming for the sake of argument that a&para;<br>controlling circuit precedent could constitute clearly established federal law in these circumstances, see Reichle v.&para;<br>Howards, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7), Marasco&para;<br>does not clearly establish that Carroll violated the Carmans’ Fourth Amendment rights.&para;<br>In Marasco, two police officers went to Robert Smith’s&para;<br>house and knocked on the front door. When Smith did not&para;<br>respond, the officers went into the backyard, and at least&para;<br>one entered the garage. 318 F. 3d, at 519. The court&para;<br>acknowledged that the officers’ “entry into the curtilage&para;<br>after not receiving an answer at the front door might be&para;<br>reasonable.” Id., at 520. It held, however, that the District Court had not made the factual findings needed to&para;<br>decide that issue. Id., at 521. For example, the Third&para;<br>Circuit noted that the record “did not discuss the layout of&para;<br>the property or the position of the officers on that property,” and that “there [was] no indication of whether the&para;<br>officers followed a path or other apparently open route&para;<br>that would be suggestive of reasonableness.” Ibid. The&para;<br>court therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.&para;<br>In concluding that Officer Carroll violated clearly estab-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>lished law in this case, the Third Circuit relied exclusively&para;<br>on Marasco’s statement that “entry into the curtilage after&para;<br>not receiving an answer at the front door might be reasonable.” Id., at 520; see 749 F. 3d, at 199 (quoting Marasco,&para;<br>supra, at 520). In the court’s view, that statement clearly&para;<br>established that a “knock and talk” must begin at the&para;<br>front door. But that conclusion does not follow. Marasco&para;<br>held that an unsuccessful “knock and talk” at the front&para;<br>door does not automatically allow officers to go onto other&para;<br>parts of the property. It did not hold, however, that&para;<br>knocking on the front door is required before officers go&para;<br>onto other parts of the property that are open to visitors.&para;<br>Thus, Marasco simply did not answer the question whether&para;<br>a “knock and talk” must begin at the front door when&para;<br>visitors may also go to the back door. Indeed, the house at&para;<br>issue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone&para;<br>one that visitors could use. 318 F. 3d, at 521.&para;<br>Moreover, Marasco expressly stated that “there [was] no&para;<br>indication of whether the officers followed a path or other&para;<br>apparently open route that would be suggestive of reasonableness.” Ibid. That makes Marasco wholly different&para;<br>from this case, where the jury necessarily decided that&para;<br>Carroll “restrict[ed] [his] movements to walkways, driveways, porches and places where visitors could be expected&para;<br>to go.” Tr. 24 (Apr. 10, 2013).&para;<br>To the extent that Marasco says anything about this&para;<br>case, it arguably supports Carroll’s view. In Marasco, the&para;<br>Third Circuit noted that “[o]fficers are allowed to knock on&para;<br>a residence’s door or otherwise approach the residence&para;<br>seeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private&para;<br>citizen may.” 318 F. 3d, at 519. The court also said that,&para;<br>“ ‘when the police come on to private property . . . and&para;<br>restrict their movements to places visitors could be expected to go (e.g., walkways, driveways, porches), observations made from such vantage points are not covered by&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 1 W. LaFave,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CARROLL v. CARMAN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Search and Seizure §2.3(f ) (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2003)&para;<br>(footnotes omitted)). Had Carroll read those statements&para;<br>before going to the Carmans’ house, he may have concluded—&para;<br>quite reasonably—that he was allowed to knock on any&para;<br>door that was open to visitors.*&para;<br>The Third Circuit’s decision is even more perplexing in&para;<br>comparison to the decisions of other federal and state&para;<br>courts, which have rejected the rule the Third Circuit&para;<br>adopted here. For example, in United States v. Titemore,&para;<br>437 F. 3d 251 (CA2 2006), a police officer approached a&para;<br>house that had two doors. The first was a traditional door&para;<br>that opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding&para;<br>glass door that opened onto a small porch. The officer&para;<br>chose to knock on the latter. Id., at 253–254. On appeal,&para;<br>the defendant argued that the officer had unlawfully&para;<br>entered his property without a warrant in violation of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment. Id., at 255–256. But the Second&para;<br>Circuit rejected that argument. As the court explained,&para;<br>the sliding glass door was “a primary entrance visible to&para;<br>and used by the public.” Id., at 259. Thus, “[b]ecause [the&para;<br>officer] approached a principal entrance to the home using&para;<br>a route that other visitors could be expected to take,” the&para;<br>court held that he did not violate the Fourth Amendment.&para;<br>Id., at 252.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States v.&para;<br>James, 40 F. 3d 850 (1994), vacated on other grounds, 516&para;<br>U. S. 1022 (1995), provides another example. There, police&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* In a footnote, the Court of Appeals “recognize[d] that there may be&para;<br>some instances in which the front door is not the entrance used by&para;<br>visitors,” but noted that “this is not one such instance.” 749 F. 3d 192,&para;<br>198, n. 6 (2014) (emphasis added). This footnote still reflects the Third&para;<br>Circuit’s view that the “knock and talk” exception is available for only&para;<br>one entrance to a dwelling, “which in most circumstances is the front&para;<br>door.” Id., at 198. Cf. United States v. Perea-Rey, 680 F. 3d 1179, 1188&para;<br>(CA9 2012) (“Officers conducting a knock and talk . . . need not approach only a specific door if there are multiple doors accessible to the&para;<br>public.”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>officers approached a duplex with multiple entrances.&para;<br>Bypassing the front door, the officers “used a paved walkway along the side of the duplex leading to the rear side&para;<br>door.” 40 F. 3d, at 862. On appeal, the defendant argued&para;<br>that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights&para;<br>when they went to the rear side door. The Seventh Circuit&para;<br>rejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door&para;<br>was “accessible to the general public” and “was commonly&para;<br>used for entering the duplex from the nearby alley.” Ibid.&para;<br>In situations “where the back door of a residence is readily&para;<br>accessible to the general public,” the court held, “the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment is not implicated when police officers&para;<br>approach that door in the reasonable belief that it is a&para;<br>principal means of access to the dwelling.” Ibid. See also,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Garcia, 997 F. 2d 1273, 1279–1280&para;<br>(CA9 1993) (“If the front and back of a residence are readily accessible from a public place, like the driveway and&para;<br>parking area here, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated&para;<br>when officers go to the back door reasonably believing it&para;<br>is used as a principal entrance to the dwelling”); State v.&para;<br>Domicz, 188 N. J. 285, 302, 907 A. 2d 395, 405 (2006)&para;<br>(“when a law enforcement officer walks to a front or back&para;<br>door for the purpose of making contact with a resident and&para;<br>reasonably believes that the door is used by visitors, he is&para;<br>not unconstitutionally trespassing on to the property”).&para;<br>We do not decide today whether those cases were correctly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a&para;<br>“knock and talk” at any entrance that is open to visitors&para;<br>rather than only the front door. “But whether or not the&para;<br>constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct,&para;<br>it was not ‘beyond debate.’ ” Stanton v. Sims, 571 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8) (quoting alKidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)).
