ROGERS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA&para;<br>No. 10–10. Argued March 23, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011&para;<br>After a South Carolina family court ordered petitioner Turner to pay&para;<br>$51.73 per week to respondent Rogers to help support their child,&para;<br>Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in con&para;<br>tempt five times. For the first four, he was sentenced to 90 days’ im&para;<br>prisonment, but he ultimately paid what he owed (twice without be&para;<br>ing jailed, twice after spending a few days in custody). The fifth time&para;<br>he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence. After his release,&para;<br>the family court clerk issued a new “show cause” order against&para;<br>Turner because he was $5728.76 in arrears. Both he and Rogers&para;<br>were unrepresented by counsel at his brief civil contempt hearing.&para;<br>The judge found Turner in willful contempt and sentenced him to 12&para;<br>months in prison without making any finding as to his ability to pay&para;<br>or indicating on the contempt order form whether he was able to&para;<br>make support payments. After Turner completed his sentence, the&para;<br>South Carolina Supreme Court rejected his claim that the Federal&para;<br>Constitution entitled him to counsel at his contempt hearing, declar&para;<br>ing that civil contempt does not require all the constitutional safe&para;<br>guards applicable in criminal contempt proceedings.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Even though Turner has completed his 12-month sentence, and&para;<br>there are not alleged to be collateral consequences of the contempt&para;<br>determination that might keep the dispute alive, this case is not&para;<br>moot, because it is “capable of repetition” while “evading review,”&para;<br>Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 219&para;<br>U. S. 498, 515. A case remains live if “(1) the challenged action [is] in&para;<br>its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or ex&para;<br>piration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same&para;<br>complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.”&para;<br>Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149. Here, the “challenged ac&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion,” Turner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its duration&para;<br>too short to be fully litigated” through the state courts (and arrive&para;<br>here) prior to its “expiration.” First Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,&para;<br>435 U. S. 765, 774. And there is a more than “reasonable” likelihood&para;<br>that Turner will again be “subjected to the same action” because he&para;<br>has frequently failed to make his support payments, has been the&para;<br>subject of several civil contempt proceedings, has been imprisoned&para;<br>several times, and is, once again, the subject of civil contempt pro&para;<br>ceedings for failure to pay. DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, and&para;<br>St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41, distinguished. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>2. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause does not auto&para;<br>matically require the State to provide counsel at civil contempt pro&para;<br>ceedings to an indigent noncustodial parent who is subject to a child&para;<br>support order, even if that individual faces incarceration. In particu&para;<br>lar, that Clause does not require that counsel be provided where the&para;<br>opposing parent or other custodian is not represented by counsel and&para;<br>the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to&para;<br>adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair oppor&para;<br>tunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and express&para;<br>court findings as to the supporting parent’s ability to comply with the&para;<br>support order. Pp. 7–16.&para;<br>(a) This Court’s precedents provide no definitive answer to the&para;<br>question whether counsel must be provided. The Sixth Amendment&para;<br>grants an indigent criminal defendant the right to counsel, see, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696, but does not govern civil&para;<br>cases. Civil and criminal contempt differ. A court may not impose&para;<br>punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly estab&para;<br>lished that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms&para;<br>of the order.” Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9. And once a&para;<br>civil contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is purged of&para;<br>the contempt and is free. Id., at 633. The Due Process Clause allows&para;<br>a State to provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt pro&para;<br>ceedings than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641. Cases directly con&para;<br>cerning a right to counsel in civil cases have found a presumption of&para;<br>such a right “only” in cases involving incarceration, but have not held&para;<br>that a right to counsel exists in all such cases. See In re Gault, 387&para;<br>U. S. 1; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480; and Lassiter v. Department of&para;<br>Social Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(b) Because a contempt proceeding to compel support payments&para;<br>is civil, the question whether the “specific dictates of due process” re&para;<br>quire appointed counsel is determined by examining the “distinct fac&para;<br>tors” this Court has used to decide what specific safeguards are&para;<br>needed to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair. Mathews v.&para;<br>Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335. As relevant here those factors include&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(1) the nature of “the private interest that will be affected,” (2) the&para;<br>comparative “risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with&para;<br>and without “additional or substitute procedural safeguards,” and (3)&para;<br>the nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not pro&para;<br>viding “additional or substitute procedural requirement[s].” Ibid.&para;<br>The “private interest that will be affected” argues strongly for the&para;<br>right to counsel here. That interest consists of an indigent defen&para;<br>dant’s loss of personal liberty through imprisonment. Freedom “from&para;<br>bodily restraint” lies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due&para;<br>Process Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80. Thus, accu&para;<br>rate decisionmaking as to the “ability to pay”—which marks a divid&para;<br>ing line between civil and criminal contempt, Hicks, supra, at 635, n.&para;<br>7—must be assured because an incorrect decision can result in a&para;<br>wrongful incarceration. And because ability to comply divides civil&para;<br>and criminal contempt proceedings, an erroneous determination&para;<br>would also deprive a defendant of the procedural protections a crimi&para;<br>nal proceeding would demand. Questions about ability to pay are&para;<br>likely to arise frequently in child custody cases. On the other hand,&para;<br>due process does not always require the provision of counsel in civil&para;<br>proceedings where incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon v. Scar&para;<br>pelli, 411 U. S. 778. To determine whether a right to counsel is re&para;<br>quired here, opposing interests and the probable value of “additional&para;<br>or substitute procedural safeguards” must be taken into account.&para;<br>Mathews, supra, at 335.&para;<br>Doing so reveals three related considerations that, taken together,&para;<br>argue strongly against requiring counsel in every proceeding of the&para;<br>present kind. First, the likely critical question in these cases is the&para;<br>defendant’s ability to pay, which is often closely related to his indi&para;<br>gence and relatively straightforward. Second, sometimes, as here,&para;<br>the person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the govern&para;<br>ment represented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented&para;<br>by counsel. A requirement that the State provide counsel to the non&para;<br>custodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of repre&para;<br>sentation that would “alter significantly the nature of the proceed&para;<br>ing,” Gagnon, supra, at 787, creating a degree of formality or delay&para;<br>that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need and&para;<br>make the proceedings less fair overall. Third, as the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment points out, an available set of “substitute procedural safe&para;<br>guards,” Mathews, supra, at 335, if employed together, can signifi&para;<br>cantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty. These&para;<br>include (1) notice to the defendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical&para;<br>issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equiva&para;<br>lent) to elicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an oppor&para;<br>tunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court&para;<br>that the defendant has the ability to pay.&para;<br>This decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where&para;<br>the underlying support payment is owed to the State, e.g., for reim&para;<br>bursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent, or the ques&para;<br>tion what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a&para;<br>defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate,”&para;<br>Gagnon, supra, at 788. Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>3. Under the circumstances, Turner’s incarceration violated due&para;<br>process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alter&para;<br>native procedures like those the Court describes. He did not have&para;<br>clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical ques&para;<br>tion in his civil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a&para;<br>form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information about his fi&para;<br>nancial circumstances. And the trial court did not find that he was&para;<br>able to pay his arrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil con&para;<br>tempt and ordered him incarcerated. P. 16.&para;<br>&para;<br>387 S.

We must&para;<br>decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process&para;<br>Clause requires the State to provide counsel (at a civil&para;<br>contempt hearing) to an indigent person potentially faced&para;<br>with such incarceration. We conclude that where as here&para;<br>the custodial parent (entitled to receive the support) is&para;<br>unrepresented by counsel, the State need not provide&para;<br>counsel to the noncustodial parent (required to provide the&para;<br>support). But we attach an important caveat, namely,&para;<br>that the State must nonetheless have in place alternative&para;<br>procedures that assure a fundamentally fair determina&para;<br>tion of the critical incarceration-related question, whether&para;<br>the supporting parent is able to comply with the support&para;<br>order.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>South Carolina family courts enforce their child support&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>orders in part through civil contempt proceedings. Each&para;<br>month the family court clerk reviews outstanding child&para;<br>support orders, identifies those in which the supporting&para;<br>parent has fallen more than five days behind, and sends&para;<br>that parent an order to “show cause” why he should not be&para;<br>held in contempt. S. C. Rule Family Ct. 24 (2011). The&para;<br>“show cause” order and attached affidavit refer to the&para;<br>relevant child support order, identify the amount of&para;<br>the arrearage, and set a date for a court hearing. At the&para;<br>hearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in&para;<br>contempt, say, by showing that he is not able to make the&para;<br>required payments. See Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S. C. 348,&para;<br>351, 306 S. E. 2d 624, 626 (1983) (“When the parent is&para;<br>unable to make the required payments, he is not in con&para;<br>tempt”). If he fails to make the required showing, the&para;<br>court may hold him in civil contempt. And it may require&para;<br>that he be imprisoned unless and until he purges himself&para;<br>of contempt by making the required child support pay&para;<br>ments (but not for more than one year regardless). See&para;<br>S. C. Code Ann. §63–3–620 (Supp. 2010) (imprisonment&para;<br>for up to one year of “adult who wilfully violates” a court&para;<br>order); Price v. Turner, 387 S. C. 142, 145, 691 S. E. 2d&para;<br>470, 472 (2010) (civil contempt order must permit purging&para;<br>of contempt through compliance).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In June 2003 a South Carolina family court entered an&para;<br>order, which (as amended) required petitioner, Michael&para;<br>Turner, to pay $51.73 per week to respondent, Rebecca&para;<br>Rogers, to help support their child. (Rogers’ father, Larry&para;<br>Price, currently has custody of the child and is also a&para;<br>respondent before this Court.) Over the next three years,&para;<br>Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was&para;<br>held in contempt on five occasions. The first four times he&para;<br>was sentenced to 90 days’ imprisonment, but he ultimately&para;<br>paid the amount due (twice without being jailed, twice&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>after spending two or three days in custody). The fifth&para;<br>time he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.&para;<br>After his release in 2006 Turner remained in arrears.&para;<br>On March 27, 2006, the clerk issued a new “show cause”&para;<br>order. And after an initial postponement due to Turner’s&para;<br>failure to appear, Turner’s civil contempt hearing took&para;<br>place on January 3, 2008. Turner and Rogers were pre&para;<br>sent, each without representation by counsel.&para;<br>The hearing was brief. The court clerk said that Turner&para;<br>was $5,728.76 behind in his payments. The judge asked&para;<br>Turner if there was “anything you want to say.” Turner&para;<br>replied,&para;<br>“Well, when I first got out, I got back on dope. I done&para;<br>meth, smoked pot and everything else, and I paid a&para;<br>little bit here and there. And, when I finally did get to&para;<br>working, I broke my back, back in September. I filed&para;<br>for disability and SSI. And, I didn’t get straightened&para;<br>out off the dope until I broke my back and laid up for&para;<br>two months. And, now I’m off the dope and every&para;<br>thing. I just hope that you give me a chance. I don’t&para;<br>know what else to say. I mean, I know I done wrong,&para;<br>and I should have been paying and helping her, and&para;<br>I’m sorry. I mean, dope had a hold to me.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 17a.&para;<br>The judge then said, “[o]kay,” and asked Rogers if she had&para;<br>anything to say. Ibid. After a brief discussion of federal&para;<br>benefits, the judge stated,&para;<br>“If there’s nothing else, this will be the Order of&para;<br>the Court. I find the Defendant in willful contempt.&para;<br>I’m [going to] sentence him to twelve months in the&para;<br>Oconee County Detention Center. He may purge him&para;<br>self of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having&para;<br>a zero balance on or before his release. I’ve also&para;<br>placed a lien on any SSI or other benefits.” Id., at&para;<br>18a.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The judge added that Turner would not receive good-time&para;<br>or work credits, but “[i]f you’ve got a job, I’ll make you&para;<br>eligible for work release.” Ibid. When Turner asked why&para;<br>he could not receive good-time or work credits, the judge&para;<br>said, “[b]ecause that’s my ruling.” Ibid.&para;<br>The court made no express finding concerning Turner’s&para;<br>ability to pay his arrearage (though Turner’s wife had&para;<br>voluntarily submitted a copy of Turner’s application for&para;<br>disability benefits, cf. post, at 7, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissent&para;<br>ing); App. 135a–136a). Nor did the judge ask any followup&para;<br>questions or otherwise address the ability-to-pay issue.&para;<br>After the hearing, the judge filled out a prewritten form&para;<br>titled “Order for Contempt of Court,” which included the&para;<br>statement:&para;<br>“Defendant (was) (was not) gainfully employed and/or&para;<br>(had) (did not have) the ability to make these support&para;<br>payments when due.” Id., at 60a, 61a.&para;<br>But the judge left this statement as is without indicating&para;<br>whether Turner was able to make support payments.&para;<br>C&para;<br>While serving his 12-month sentence, Turner, with the&para;<br>help of pro bono counsel, appealed. He claimed that&para;<br>the Federal Constitution entitled him to counsel at his con&para;<br>tempt hearing. The South Carolina Supreme Court de&para;<br>cided Turner’s appeal after he had completed his sentence.&para;<br>And it rejected his “right to counsel” claim. The court&para;<br>pointed out that civil contempt differs significantly from&para;<br>criminal contempt. The former does not require all the&para;<br>“constitutional safeguards” applicable in criminal proceed&para;<br>ings. 387 S. C., at 145, 691 S. E. 2d, at 472. And the right&para;<br>to government-paid counsel, the Supreme Court held, was&para;<br>one of the “safeguards” not required. Ibid.&para;<br>Turner sought certiorari.

See Massa&para;<br>chusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 480 (1923) (Article III&para;<br>judicial power extends only to actual “cases” and “contro&para;<br>versies”); Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 4) (“An actual controversy must be extant at all stages&para;<br>of review” (internal quotation marks omitted)). They point&para;<br>out that Turner completed his 12-month prison sentence&para;<br>in 2009. And they add that there are no “collateral conse&para;<br>quences” of that particular contempt determination that&para;<br>might keep the dispute alive. Compare Sibron v. New&para;<br>York, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56 (1968) (release from prison does&para;<br>not moot a criminal case because “collateral consequences”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v.

S. 1, 14 (1998) (declining to extend the presumption to&para;<br>parole revocation).&para;<br>The short, conclusive answer to respondents’ mootness&para;<br>claim, however, is that this case is not moot because it&para;<br>falls within a special category of disputes that are “capable&para;<br>of repetition” while “evading review.” Southern Pacific&para;<br>Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911). A dispute&para;<br>falls into that category, and a case based on that dispute&para;<br>remains live, if “(1) the challenged action [is] in its dura&para;<br>tion too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or&para;<br>expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that&para;<br>the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same&para;<br>action again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149&para;<br>(1975) (per curiam).&para;<br>Our precedent makes clear that the “challenged action,”&para;<br>Turner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its&para;<br>duration too short to be fully litigated” through the state&para;<br>courts (and arrive here) prior to its “expiration.” See, e.g.,&para;<br>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,&para;<br>774 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (18-month&para;<br>period too short); Southern Pacific Terminal Co., supra, at&para;<br>514–516 (2-year period too short). At the same time, there&para;<br>is a more than “reasonable” likelihood that Turner will&para;<br>again be “subjected to the same action.” As we have&para;<br>pointed out, supra, at 2–3, Turner has frequently failed to&para;<br>make his child support payments. He has been the subject&para;<br>of several civil contempt proceedings. He has been im&para;<br>prisoned on several of those occasions. Within months of&para;<br>his release from the imprisonment here at issue he was&para;<br>again the subject of civil contempt proceedings. And he&para;<br>was again imprisoned, this time for six months. As of&para;<br>December 9, 2010, Turner was $13,814.72 in arrears, and&para;<br>another contempt hearing was scheduled for May 4, 2011.&para;<br>App. 104a; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 1. These facts&para;<br>bring this case squarely within the special category of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cases that are not moot because the underlying dispute&para;<br>is “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” See, e.g.,&para;<br>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 546–547&para;<br>(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Moreover, the underlying facts make this case unlike&para;<br>DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam),&para;<br>and St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41 (1943) (per&para;<br>curiam), two cases that respondents believe require us to&para;<br>find this case moot regardless. DeFunis was moot, but&para;<br>that is because the plaintiff himself was unlikely to again&para;<br>suffer the conduct of which he complained (and others&para;<br>likely to suffer from that conduct could bring their own&para;<br>lawsuits). Here petitioner himself is likely to suffer future&para;<br>imprisonment.&para;<br>St. Pierre was moot because the petitioner (a witness&para;<br>held in contempt and sentenced to five months’ imprison&para;<br>ment) had failed to “apply to this Court for a stay” of the&para;<br>federal-court order imposing imprisonment. 319 U. S., at&para;<br>42–43. And, like the witness in St. Pierre, Turner did not&para;<br>seek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprison&para;<br>ment. But this case, unlike St. Pierre, arises out of a&para;<br>state-court proceeding. And respondents give us no reason&para;<br>to believe that we would have (or that we could have)&para;<br>granted a timely request for a stay had one been made.&para;<br>Cf. 28 U. S. C. §1257 (granting this Court jurisdiction to&para;<br>review final state-court judgments). In Sibron, we re&para;<br>jected a similar “mootness” argument for just that reason.&para;<br>392 U. S., at 53, n. 13. And we find this case similar in&para;<br>this respect to Sibron, not to St. Pierre.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We must decide whether the Due Process Clause grants&para;<br>an indigent defendant, such as Turner, a right to state&para;<br>appointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding, which&para;<br>may lead to his incarceration. This Court’s precedents&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>provide no definitive answer to that question. This Court&para;<br>has long held that the Sixth Amendment grants an indi&para;<br>gent defendant the right to state-appointed counsel in&para;<br>a criminal case. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335&para;<br>(1963). And we have held that this same rule applies to&para;<br>criminal contempt proceedings (other than summary&para;<br>proceedings). United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696&para;<br>(1993); Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925).&para;<br>But the Sixth Amendment does not govern civil cases.&para;<br>Civil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it&para;<br>seeks only to “coerc[e] the defendant to do” what a court&para;<br>had previously ordered him to do. Gompers v. Bucks Stove&para;<br>&amp; Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 442 (1911). A court may not&para;<br>impose punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when&para;<br>it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is&para;<br>unable to comply with the terms of the order.” Hicks v.&para;<br>Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9 (1988). And once a civil&para;<br>contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is&para;<br>purged of the contempt and is free. Id., at 633 (he&para;<br>“carr[ies] the keys of [his] prison in [his] own pockets”&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Consequently, the Court has made clear (in a case not&para;<br>involving the right to counsel) that, where civil contempt&para;<br>is at issue, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process&para;<br>Clause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protec&para;<br>tions than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641 (State may&para;<br>place the burden of proving inability to pay on the defen&para;<br>dant).&para;<br>This Court has decided only a handful of cases that&para;<br>more directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters.&para;<br>And the application of those decisions to the present case&para;<br>is not clear. On the one hand, the Court has held that the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to pay for&para;<br>representation by counsel in a civil “juvenile delinquency”&para;<br>proceeding (which could lead to incarceration). In re&para;<br>Gault, 387 U. S. 1, 35–42 (1967). Moreover, in Vitek v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Jones, 445 U. S. 480, 496–497 (1980), a plurality of four&para;<br>Members of this Court would have held that the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment requires representation by counsel in&para;<br>a proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital&para;<br>for the mentally ill. Further, in Lassiter v. Department of&para;<br>Social Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18 (1981), a case&para;<br>that focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of pa&para;<br>rental rights, the Court wrote that the&para;<br>“pre-eminent generalization that emerges from this&para;<br>Court’s precedents on an indigent’s right to appointed&para;<br>counsel is that such a right has been recognized to ex&para;<br>ist only where the litigant may lose his physical lib&para;<br>erty if he loses the litigation.” Id., at 25.&para;<br>And the Court then drew from these precedents “the pre&para;<br>sumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed&para;<br>counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his&para;<br>physical liberty.” Id., at 26–27.&para;<br>On the other hand, the Court has held that a criminal&para;<br>offender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment&para;<br>does not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation&para;<br>revocation hearing. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778&para;<br>(1973); see also Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25 (1976)&para;<br>(no due process right to counsel in summary court-martial&para;<br>proceedings). And, at the same time, Gault, Vitek, and&para;<br>Lassiter are readily distinguishable. The civil juvenile&para;<br>delinquency proceeding at issue in Gault was “little differ&para;<br>ent” from, and “comparable in seriousness” to, a criminal&para;<br>prosecution. 387 U. S., at 28, 36. In Vitek, the controlling&para;<br>opinion found no right to counsel. 445 U. S., at 499–500&para;<br>(Powell, J., concurring in part) (assistance of mental&para;<br>health professionals sufficient). And the Court’s state&para;<br>ments in Lassiter constitute part of its rationale for deny&para;<br>ing a right to counsel in that case. We believe those&para;<br>statements are best read as pointing out that the Court&para;<br>previously had found a right to counsel “only” in cases&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>involving incarceration, not that a right to counsel exists&para;<br>in all such cases (a position that would have been difficult&para;<br>to reconcile with Gagnon).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Civil contempt proceedings in child support cases constitute one part of a highly complex system designed to&para;<br>assure a noncustodial parent’s regular payment of funds&para;<br>typically necessary for the support of his children. Often&para;<br>the family receives welfare support from a state&para;<br>administered federal program, and the State then seeks&para;<br>reimbursement from the noncustodial parent. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §§608(a)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. III), 656(a)(1) (2006&para;<br>ed.); S. C. Code Ann. §§43–5–65(a)(1), (2) (2010 Cum.&para;<br>Supp.). Other times the custodial parent (often the&para;<br>mother, but sometimes the father, a grandparent, or an&para;<br>other person with custody) does not receive government&para;<br>benefits and is entitled to receive the support payments&para;<br>herself.&para;<br>The Federal Government has created an elaborate&para;<br>procedural mechanism designed to help both the govern&para;<br>ment and custodial parents to secure the payments to&para;<br>which they are entitled. See generally Blessing v. Free&para;<br>stone, 520 U. S. 329, 333 (1997) (describing the “interlock&para;<br>ing set of cooperative federal-state welfare programs” as&para;<br>they relate to child support enforcement); 45 CFR pt. 303&para;<br>(2010) (prescribing standards for state child support agen&para;<br>cies). These systems often rely upon wage withholding,&para;<br>expedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child&para;<br>support orders, and automated data processing.&para;<br>42&para;<br>U. S. C. §§666(a), (b), 654(24). But sometimes States will&para;<br>use contempt orders to ensure that the custodial parent&para;<br>receives support payments or the government receives&para;<br>reimbursement. Although some experts have criticized&para;<br>this last-mentioned procedure, and the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment believes that “the routine use of contempt for non&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>payment of child support is likely to be an ineffective&para;<br>strategy,” the Government also tells us that “coercive&para;<br>enforcement remedies, such as contempt, have a role to&para;<br>play.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21–22,&para;<br>and n. 8 (citing Dept. of Health and Human Services,&para;<br>National Child Support Enforcement, Strategic Plan: FY&para;<br>2005–2009, pp. 2, 10). South Carolina, which relies heav&para;<br>ily on contempt proceedings, agrees that they are an im&para;<br>portant tool.&para;<br>We here consider an indigent’s right to paid counsel at&para;<br>such a contempt proceeding. It is a civil proceeding. And&para;<br>we consequently determine the “specific dictates of due&para;<br>process” by examining the “distinct factors” that this&para;<br>Court has previously found useful in deciding what spe&para;<br>cific safeguards the Constitution’s Due Process Clause re&para;<br>quires in order to make a civil proceeding fundamentally&para;<br>fair. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976) (con&para;<br>sidering fairness of an administrative proceeding). As&para;<br>relevant here those factors include (1) the nature of “the&para;<br>private interest that will be affected,” (2) the comparative&para;<br>“risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with&para;<br>and without “additional or substitute procedural safe&para;<br>guards,” and (3) the nature and magnitude of any counter&para;<br>vailing interest in not providing “additional or substitute&para;<br>procedural requirement[s].” Ibid. See also Lassiter, 452&para;<br>U. S., at 27–31 (applying the Mathews framework).&para;<br>The “private interest that will be affected” argues&para;<br>strongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates.&para;<br>That interest consists of an indigent defendant’s loss of&para;<br>personal liberty through imprisonment. The interest in&para;<br>securing that freedom, the freedom “from bodily restraint,”&para;<br>lies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process&para;<br>Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992).&para;<br>And we have made clear that its threatened loss through&para;<br>legal proceedings demands “due process protection.”&para;<br>Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 425 (1979).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Given the importance of the interest at stake, it is ob&para;<br>viously important to assure accurate decisionmaking in&para;<br>respect to the key “ability to pay” question. Moreover, the&para;<br>fact that ability to comply marks a dividing line between&para;<br>civil and criminal contempt, Hicks, 485 U. S., at 635, n. 7,&para;<br>reinforces the need for accuracy. That is because an incor&para;<br>rect decision (wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding&para;<br>as civil) can increase the risk of wrongful incarceration by&para;<br>depriving the defendant of the procedural protections&para;<br>(including counsel) that the Constitution would demand in&para;<br>a criminal proceeding. See, e.g., Dixon, 509 U. S., at 696&para;<br>(proof beyond a reasonable doubt, protection from double&para;<br>jeopardy); Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 512–&para;<br>513, 517 (1974) (jury trial where the result is more than&para;<br>six months’ imprisonment). And since 70% of child sup&para;<br>port arrears nationwide are owed by parents with either&para;<br>no reported income or income of $10,000 per year or less,&para;<br>the issue of ability to pay may arise fairly often. See&para;<br>E. Sorensen, L. Sousa, &amp; S. Schaner, Assessing Child&para;<br>Support Arrears in Nine Large States and the Nation&para;<br>22 (2007) (prepared by The Urban Institute), online at&para;<br>http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/07/assessing-CS-debt/report.pdf (as&para;<br>visited June 16, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s&para;<br>case file); id., at 23 (“research suggests that many obligors&para;<br>who do not have reported quarterly wages have relatively&para;<br>limited resources”); Patterson, Civil Contempt and the&para;<br>Indigent Child Support Obligor: The Silent Return of&para;<br>Debtor’s Prison, 18 Cornell J.

E. 2d 14, 19, n. 4 (1993) (surveying North&para;<br>Carolina contempt orders and finding that the “failure of&para;<br>trial courts to make a determination of a contemnor’s&para;<br>ability to comply is not altogether infrequent”).&para;<br>On the other hand, the Due Process Clause does not&para;<br>always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings&para;<br>where incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon, 411 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>778. And in determining whether the Clause requires a&para;<br>right to counsel here, we must take account of opposing&para;<br>interests, as well as consider the probable value of “addi&para;<br>tional or substitute procedural safeguards.” Mathews,&para;<br>supra, at 335.&para;<br>Doing so, we find three related considerations that,&para;<br>when taken together, argue strongly against the Due&para;<br>Process Clause requiring the State to provide indigents&para;<br>with counsel in every proceeding of the kind before us.&para;<br>First, the critical question likely at issue in these cases&para;<br>concerns, as we have said, the defendant’s ability to pay.&para;<br>That question is often closely related to the question of the&para;<br>defendant’s indigence. But when the right procedures are&para;<br>in place, indigence can be a question that in many—but&para;<br>not all—cases is sufficiently straightforward to warrant&para;<br>determination prior to providing a defendant with counsel,&para;<br>even in a criminal case. Federal law, for example, re&para;<br>quires a criminal defendant to provide information show&para;<br>ing that he is indigent, and therefore entitled to state&para;<br>funded counsel, before he can receive that assistance. See&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §3006A(b).&para;<br>Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing the&para;<br>defendant at the hearing is not the government repre&para;<br>sented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented&para;<br>by counsel. See Dept. of Health and Human Services,&para;<br>Office of Child Support Enforcement, Understanding Child&para;<br>Support Debt: A Guide to Exploring Child Support Debt in&para;<br>Your State 5, 6 (2004) (51% of nationwide arrears, and&para;<br>58% in South Carolina, are not owed to the government).&para;<br>The custodial parent, perhaps a woman with custody of&para;<br>one or more children, may be relatively poor, unemployed,&para;<br>and unable to afford counsel. Yet she may have encour&para;<br>aged the court to enforce its order through contempt. Cf.&para;<br>Tr. Contempt Proceedings (Sept. 14, 2005), App. 44a–45a&para;<br>(Rogers asks court, in light of pattern of nonpayment, to&para;<br>confine Turner). She may be able to provide the court&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v. ROGERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with significant information. Cf. id., at 41a–43a (Rogers&para;<br>describes where Turner lived and worked). And the pro&para;<br>ceeding is ultimately for her benefit.&para;<br>A requirement that the State provide counsel to the&para;<br>noncustodial parent in these cases could create an asym&para;<br>metry of representation that would “alter significantly the&para;<br>nature of the proceeding.” Gagnon, supra, at 787. Doing&para;<br>so could mean a degree of formality or delay that would&para;<br>unduly slow payment to those immediately in need. And,&para;<br>perhaps more important for present purposes, doing so&para;<br>could make the proceedings less fair overall, increasing the&para;<br>risk of a decision that would erroneously deprive a family&para;<br>of the support it is entitled to receive. The needs of such&para;<br>families play an important role in our analysis. Cf. post,&para;<br>at 10–12 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).&para;<br>Third, as the Solicitor General points out, there is avail&para;<br>able a set of “substitute procedural safeguards,” Mathews,&para;<br>424 U. S., at 335, which, if employed together, can signifi&para;<br>cantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of lib&para;<br>erty. They can do so, moreover, without incurring some of&para;<br>the drawbacks inherent in recognizing an automatic right&para;<br>to counsel. Those safeguards include (1) notice to the de&para;<br>fendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the&para;<br>contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equiva&para;<br>lent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an oppor&para;<br>tunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to&para;<br>statements and questions about his financial status, (e.g.,&para;<br>those triggered by his responses on the form); and (4) an&para;<br>express finding by the court that the defendant has the&para;<br>ability to pay. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27; Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 23–25. In presenting these al&para;<br>ternatives, the Government draws upon considerable&para;<br>experience in helping to manage statutorily mandated&para;<br>federal-state efforts to enforce child support orders. See&para;<br>supra, at 10. It does not claim that they are the only&para;<br>possible alternatives, and this Court’s cases suggest, for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>example, that sometimes assistance other than purely&para;<br>legal assistance (here, say, that of a neutral social worker)&para;<br>can prove constitutionally sufficient. Cf. Vitek, 445 U. S.,&para;<br>at 499–500 (Powell, J., concurring in part) (provision of&para;<br>mental health professional). But the Government does&para;<br>claim that these alternatives can assure the “fundamental&para;<br>fairness” of the proceeding even where the State does not&para;<br>pay for counsel for an indigent defendant.&para;<br>While recognizing the strength of Turner’s arguments,&para;<br>we ultimately believe that the three considerations we&para;<br>have just discussed must carry the day. In our view, a&para;<br>categorical right to counsel in proceedings of the kind&para;<br>before us would carry with it disadvantages (in the form of&para;<br>unfairness and delay) that, in terms of ultimate fairness,&para;<br>would deprive it of significant superiority over the alterna&para;<br>tives that we have mentioned. We consequently hold that&para;<br>the Due Process Clause does not automatically require the&para;<br>provision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an&para;<br>indigent individual who is subject to a child support order,&para;<br>even if that individual faces incarceration (for up to a&para;<br>year). In particular, that Clause does not require the&para;<br>provision of counsel where the opposing parent or other&para;<br>custodian (to whom support funds are owed) is not repre&para;<br>sented by counsel and the State provides alternative&para;<br>procedural safeguards equivalent to those we have men&para;<br>tioned (adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay,&para;<br>fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant in&para;<br>formation, and court findings).&para;<br>We do not address civil contempt proceedings where the&para;<br>underlying child support payment is owed to the State, for&para;<br>example, for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the&para;<br>parent with custody. See supra, at 10. Those proceedings&para;<br>more closely resemble debt-collection proceedings. The&para;<br>government is likely to have counsel or some other compe&para;<br>tent representative. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458,&para;<br>462–463 (1938) (“[T]he average defendant does not have&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v.

And this kind of&para;<br>proceeding is not before us. Neither do we address what&para;<br>due process requires in an unusually complex case where&para;<br>a defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained&para;<br>advocate.” Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 788; see also Reply Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 18–20 (not claiming that Turner’s case is&para;<br>especially complex).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The record indicates that Turner received neither coun&para;<br>sel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those we&para;<br>have described. He did not receive clear notice that his&para;<br>ability to pay would constitute the critical question in his&para;<br>civil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a&para;<br>form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information&para;<br>about his financial circumstances. The court did not find&para;<br>that Turner was able to pay his arrearage, but instead left&para;<br>the relevant “finding” section of the contempt order blank.&para;<br>The court nonetheless found Turner in contempt and&para;<br>ordered him incarcerated.

ROGERS&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>Under an original understanding of the Constitution,&para;<br>there is no basis for concluding that the guarantee of due&para;<br>process secures a right to appointed counsel in civil con&para;<br>tempt proceedings. It certainly does not do so to the ex&para;<br>tent that the Due Process Clause requires “ ‘that our&para;<br>Government must proceed according to the “law of the&para;<br>land”—that is, according to written constitutional and statu&para;<br>tory provisions.’” Hamdi v.

Moreover, as originally understood, the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment guaranteed only the “right to employ counsel, or to&para;<br>use volunteered services of counsel”; it did not require the&para;<br>court to appoint counsel in any circumstance.

ROGERS&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“civil contempt is not a ‘criminal prosecution’ within the&para;<br>meaning of the Sixth Amendment”). He argues instead&para;<br>that “the right to the assistance of counsel for persons&para;<br>facing incarceration arises not only from the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment, but also from the requirement of fundamen&para;<br>tal fairness under the Due Process Clause of the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment.” Brief for Petitioner 28. In his view,&para;<br>this Court has relied on due process to “rejec[t] formalistic&para;<br>distinctions between criminal and civil proceedings, in&para;<br>stead concluding that incarceration or other confinement&para;<br>triggers the right to counsel.” Id., at 33.&para;<br>But if the Due Process Clause created a right to ap&para;<br>pointed counsel in all proceedings with the potential for&para;<br>detention, then the Sixth Amendment right to appointed&para;<br>counsel would be unnecessary. Under Turner’s theory,&para;<br>every instance in which the Sixth Amendment guarantees&para;<br>a right to appointed counsel is covered also by the Due&para;<br>Process Clause. The Sixth Amendment, however, is the&para;<br>only constitutional provision that even mentions the assis&para;<br>tance of counsel; the Due Process Clause says nothing&para;<br>about counsel. Ordinarily, we do not read a general provi&para;<br>sion to render a specific one superfluous. Cf. Morales v.&para;<br>Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384 (1992)&para;<br>(“[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the&para;<br>specific governs the general”). The fact that one constitu&para;<br>tional provision expressly provides a right to appointed&para;<br>counsel in specific circumstances indicates that the Con&para;<br>stitution does not also sub silentio provide that right far&para;<br>more broadly in another, more general, provision.

Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 789, n. 12 (1973) (dis&para;<br>cussing In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967)). This is consistent&para;<br>with the conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not&para;<br>expand the right to counsel beyond the boundaries set by&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>After countless factors weighed, mores evaluated, and&para;<br>practices surveyed, the Court has not determined that due&para;<br>process principles of fundamental fairness categorically&para;<br>require counsel in any context outside criminal proceed&para;<br>ings. See, e.g., Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of&para;<br>Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18, 31–32 (1981); Wolff v. McDon&para;<br>nell, 418 U.

Even when the defendant’s liberty is at stake, the&para;<br>Court has not concluded that fundamental fairness re&para;<br>quires that counsel always be appointed if the proceeding&para;<br>is not criminal.2 See, e.g., Scarpelli, supra, at 790 (proba&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 “Criminal&para;<br>&para;<br>contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense”; therefore,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TURNER v.

Indeed, the only circumstance in which the Court has&para;<br>found that due process categorically requires appointed&para;<br>counsel is juvenile delinquency proceedings, which the&para;<br>Court has described as “functionally akin to a criminal&para;<br>trial.” Scarpelli, supra, at 789, n. 12 (discussing In re&para;<br>Gault, supra); see ante, at 9.&para;<br>Despite language in its opinions that suggests it could&para;<br>find otherwise, the Court’s consistent judgment has been&para;<br>that fundamental fairness does not categorically require&para;<br>appointed counsel in any context outside of criminal&para;<br>proceedings.
