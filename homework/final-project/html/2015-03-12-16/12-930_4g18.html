S. citizens&para;<br>and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to petition for certain family&para;<br>members to obtain immigrant visas. A sponsored individual, known&para;<br>as the principal beneficiary, is placed into a “family preference” category based on his relationship with the petitioner. 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1153(a)(1)–(4). The principal beneficiary’s spouse and minor children in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries, “entitled to the same&para;<br>status” and “order of consideration” as the principal. §1153(d). The&para;<br>beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of “priority date”—that is, the date a petition was filed. §1153(e)(1). Because&para;<br>the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete, a&para;<br>child seeking to immigrate may “age out”—i.e., reach adulthood and&para;<br>lose her immigration status—before she reaches the front of the visa&para;<br>queue. The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) sets forth a remedy&para;<br>in that circumstance, providing that “[i]f the age of an alien is determined . . . to be 21 years of age or older,” notwithstanding certain allowances for bureaucratic delay, §§1153(h)(1)–(2), “the alien’s petition&para;<br>shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the&para;<br>alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the&para;<br>original petition.” §1153(h)(3).&para;<br>Respondents, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed petitions for their aged-out children, asserting that the newly filed petitions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions.&para;<br>Instead, U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) gave&para;<br>the new petitions current priority dates. The District Court granted&para;<br>the Government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immi-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>gration Appeals’ (BIA’s) determination that only those petitions that&para;<br>can be seamlessly converted from one family preference category to&para;<br>another without the need for a new sponsor are entitled to conversion&para;<br>under §1153(h)(3). The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that&para;<br>the provision unambiguously entitled all aged-out derivative beneficiaries to automatic conversion and priority date retention.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>695 F. 3d 1003, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded that the BIA’s textually reasonable construction of&para;<br>§1153(h)(3)’s ambiguous language was entitled to deference. Pp. 13–&para;<br>33.&para;<br>(a) Because §1153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the issue&para;<br>here, a court must defer to the BIA’s reasonable interpretation. See&para;<br>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467&para;<br>U. S. 837, 844. The first clause of §1153(h)(3) states a condition that&para;<br>encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition. The second clause, however, does not easily cohere with the&para;<br>first. It prescribes a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the&para;<br>beneficiaries described in the first clause. This remedial prescription&para;<br>directs immigration officials to take the alien’s petition and convert it&para;<br>from a category benefitting a child to an appropriate category for&para;<br>adults, without any change in the petition, including its sponsor, or&para;<br>any new filing. Moreover, this conversion is to be “automati[c]”—that&para;<br>is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.&para;<br>Thus, the only aliens who may benefit from §1153(h)(3)’s back half&para;<br>are those for whom automatic conversion is possible.&para;<br>The understanding that “automatic conversion” entails nothing&para;<br>more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it&para;<br>into another for which the alien now qualifies matches the exclusive&para;<br>way immigration law used the term when §1153(h)(3) was enacted.&para;<br>See 8 CFR §204.2(i)(1)–(3) (2002). And Congress used the word “conversion” in the identical way elsewhere in the CSPA. See, e.g.,&para;<br>§§1151(f)(2), (3).&para;<br>If the term meant more than that in §1153(h)(3), it would undermine the family preference system’s core premise: that each immigrant must have a qualified and willing sponsor. See §§1154(a), (b).&para;<br>If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship&para;<br>with the aged-out derivative beneficiary, another sponsor, e.g., the&para;<br>old principal beneficiary, must be swapped in for the alien to qualify&para;<br>for a new family preference category. But immigration officials cannot assume that a new sponsor is eligible and willing to petition on&para;<br>the alien’s behalf, given the numerous requirements the law imposes&para;<br>on family preference petitioners. See, e.g., §1154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II). Nei-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ther can they figure out whether a valid sponsor exists unless he files&para;<br>and USCIS approves a new petition—the very thing §1153(h)(3) says&para;<br>is not required.&para;<br>In any case, a new qualified sponsor will rarely exist at the requisite time. An alien is deemed to age out on “the date on which an&para;<br>immigrant visa number became available for the alien’s parent.”&para;<br>§1153(h)(1)(A). Since aging out triggers automatic conversion, the&para;<br>date of automatic conversion is best viewed as the same. But at that&para;<br>time, the aged-out beneficiary’s parent cannot yet be a citizen or LPR,&para;<br>and so no new, qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old&para;<br>one’s shoes.&para;<br>On the above account, §1153(h)(3)’s second clause provides a remedy to those principal and derivative beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out. In&para;<br>contrast, aliens like respondents’ children—the nieces, nephews, and&para;<br>grandchildren of the initial sponsors—cannot qualify for “automatic&para;<br>conversion”: they lacked a qualifying preference relationship with&para;<br>the initial petitioner, and so cannot fit into a new preference category&para;<br>without obtaining a new sponsor.&para;<br>The ambiguity created by §1153(h)(3)’s ill-fitting clauses left the&para;<br>BIA to choose how to reconcile the statute’s different commands. It&para;<br>reasonably opted to abide by the inherent limits of §1153(h)(3)’s remedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the&para;<br>sweep of the first clause’s condition. When an agency thus resolves&para;<br>statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require this Court to defer. See National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 666. Pp. 13–22.&para;<br>(b) Respondents take issue with the BIA’s interpretation, but none&para;<br>of their contentions is persuasive. Pp. 22–33.&para;<br>(1) Respondents aver that every aged-out beneficiary could be&para;<br>automatically converted if immigration officials substituted new&para;<br>sponsors and managed the timing of conversion so that a new sponsor&para;<br>existed on the relevant date. These administrative maneuvers are&para;<br>not in keeping with the natural and long-established meaning of “automatic conversion,” they require conversion to occur on a date that&para;<br>has no connection to the alien’s aging out, and they demand administrative juggling to make automatic conversion work. And that painstakingly managed process still cannot succeed because a derivative’s&para;<br>parent may never become able to sponsor a visa—and immigration&para;<br>officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so.&para;<br>Pp. 22–27.&para;<br>(2) Respondents argue that the word “and” in the second clause&para;<br>of §1153(h)(3) indicates that priority date retention is a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion. But “and” does not neces-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sarily disjoin two phrases, and context suggests that the instructions&para;<br>work in tandem. In other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting “conversions,” retention of a priority date is conditional on a&para;<br>conversion occurring. See, e.g., §§1154(k)(1)–(3). Respondent’s reading would make priority date retention conditional on something the&para;<br>statute nowhere mentions. And it would engender unusual results&para;<br>that, without some clearer statement, the Court cannot conclude that&para;<br>Congress intended. Pp. 27–30.&para;<br>(3) Finally, respondents contend that, assuming §1153(h)(3) is&para;<br>ambiguous, the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restrictive reading. But the BIA’s interpretation benefits from administrative simplicity and fits with immigration law’s basic first-come, firstserved rule. By contrast, respondents would scramble the priority&para;<br>order Congress established by allowing aged-out derivative beneficiaries, like respondents’ sons and daughters, to enter the visa queue&para;<br>ahead of beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR&para;<br>for a far longer time. Pp. 31–33.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, agreed that the&para;<br>BIA’s interpretation was reasonable, but not because an agency has&para;<br>authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute. There is no conflict or internal tension in §1153(h)(3). The first clause of the provision defines the persons potentially affected, but does not grant anything to anyone. The particular benefit provided by the statute—&para;<br>automatic conversion and retention of priority date—is found exclusively in the second clause, and that relief requires, at minimum,&para;<br>that an aged-out beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is&para;<br>committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary. Beyond&para;<br>that, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be automatically converted.&para;<br>The BIA’s reasonable interpretation of&para;<br>§1153(h)(3) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory&para;<br>terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigration system.

S. C.&para;<br>§1101 et seq., citizens and lawful permanent residents&para;<br>(LPRs) of the United States may petition for certain family members—spouses, siblings, and children of various&para;<br>ages—to obtain immigrant visas. Such a sponsored individual is known as the petition’s principal beneficiary. In&para;<br>turn, any principal beneficiary’s minor child—meaning an&para;<br>unmarried child under the age of 21—qualifies as a derivative beneficiary, “entitled to the same [immigration]&para;<br>status” and “order of consideration” as his parent.&para;<br>§1153(d). Accordingly, when a visa becomes available to&para;<br>the petition’s principal beneficiary, one also becomes&para;<br>available to her minor child.&para;<br>But what happens if, sometime after the relevant petition was filed, a minor child (whether a principal or a&para;<br>derivative beneficiary) has turned 21—or, in immigration&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>lingo, has “aged out”? The immigration process may take&para;<br>years or even decades to complete, due in part to bureaucratic delays associated with reviewing immigration documents and in (still greater) part to long queues for the&para;<br>limited number of visas available each year. So someone&para;<br>who was a youngster at the start of the process may be an&para;<br>adult at the end, and no longer qualify for an immigration&para;<br>status given to minors. The Child Status Protection Act&para;<br>(CSPA), 116 Stat. 927, ensures that the time Government&para;<br>officials have spent processing immigration papers will not&para;<br>count against the beneficiary in assessing his status. See&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §1153(h)(1). But even with that provision, the&para;<br>beneficiary may age out solely because of the time he&para;<br>spent waiting in line for a visa to become available.&para;<br>The question presented in this case is whether the&para;<br>CSPA grants a remedy to all aliens who have thus outpaced the immigration process—that is, all aliens who&para;<br>counted as child beneficiaries when a sponsoring petition&para;<br>was filed, but no longer do so (even after excluding administrative delays) by the time they reach the front of the&para;<br>visa queue. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or&para;<br>Board) said no. It interpreted the CSPA as providing&para;<br>relief to only a subset of that group—specifically, those&para;<br>aged-out aliens who qualified or could have qualified as&para;<br>principal beneficiaries of a visa petition, rather than only&para;<br>as derivative beneficiaries piggy-backing on a parent.

Five other categories—&para;<br>crucial to this case, and often denominated “preference”&para;<br>categories—are for “family-sponsored immigrants,” who&para;<br>include more distant or independent relatives of U. S.&para;<br>citizens, and certain close relatives of LPRs.2 Specifically,&para;<br>those family preference categories are:&para;<br>F1: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and daughters of U. S. citizens;&para;<br>F2A: the spouses and unmarried, minor (under 21)&para;<br>children of LPRs;&para;<br>F2B: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and&para;<br>daughters of LPRs;&para;<br>F3: the married sons and daughters of U.

S. citizens. See Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 1.&para;<br>3 Immigrant visas can also go to aliens with special, marketable&para;<br>skills, see §§1151(a)(2), 1153(b), or to aliens from countries with historically low immigration to the United States, see §§1151(a)(3), 1153(c).&para;<br>None of the respondents here sought visas under those “employmentbased” or “diversity” categories.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The road to obtaining any family-based immigrant visa&para;<br>begins when a sponsoring U. S. citizen or LPR files a&para;<br>petition on behalf of a foreign relative, termed the principal beneficiary. See §§1154(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(1)(B)(i)(I), (b); 8&para;<br>CFR §204.1(a)(1) (2014). The sponsor (otherwise known&para;<br>as the petitioner—we use the words interchangeably)&para;<br>must provide U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services&para;<br>(USCIS) with evidence showing, among other things, that&para;<br>she has the necessary familial relationship with the&para;<br>beneficiary, see §§204.2(a)(2), (d)(2), (g)(2), and that she&para;<br>has not committed any conduct disqualifying her from&para;<br>sponsoring an alien for a visa, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) (barring an LPR from submitting a&para;<br>petition if she has committed certain offenses against&para;<br>minors). USCIS thereafter reviews the petition, and&para;<br>approves it if found to meet all requirements. See&para;<br>§1154(b).&para;<br>For a family preference beneficiary, that approval results not in getting a visa then and there, but only in&para;<br>getting a place in line. (The case is different for “immediate relatives” of U. S. citizens, who can apply for and&para;<br>receive a visa as soon as a sponsoring petition is approved.) The law caps the number of visas issued each&para;<br>year in the five family preference categories, see&para;<br>§§1151(c)(1), 1152, 1153(a)(1)–(4), and demand regularly&para;<br>exceeds the supply. As a consequence, the principal beneficiary of an approved petition is placed in a queue with&para;<br>others in her category (F1, F2A, or what have you) in&para;<br>order of “priority date”—that is, the date a petition was&para;<br>filed with USCIS. See §1153(e)(1); 8 CFR §204.1(b); 22&para;<br>CFR 42.53(a) (2013). Every month, the Department of&para;<br>State sets a cut-off date for each family preference category,&para;<br>indicating that visas (sometimes referred to by “visa&para;<br>numbers”) are available for beneficiaries with priority&para;<br>dates earlier than the cut-off. See 8 CFR §245.1(g)(1); 22&para;<br>CFR §42.51(b). The system is thus first-come, first-served&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Those persons, labeled the petition’s&para;<br>“derivative beneficiar[ies],” are “entitled to the same status, and the same order of consideration” as the principal.&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §§1153(d), (h). Accordingly, when a visa becomes available for the principal, one becomes available&para;<br>for her spouse and minor children too. And that is so even&para;<br>when (as is usually but not always the case) the spouse&para;<br>and children would not qualify for any family preference&para;<br>category on their own. For example, the child of an F4&para;<br>petition’s principal beneficiary is the niece or nephew of a&para;<br>U. S. citizen, and federal immigration law does not recognize that relationship. Nonetheless, the child can piggyback on his qualifying parent in seeking an immigrant&para;<br>visa—although, as will be further discussed, he may not&para;<br>immigrate without her. See 22 CFR §40.1(a)(2); infra, at&para;<br>6, 20–21, 31–32.&para;<br>Once visas become available, the principal and any&para;<br>derivative beneficiaries must separately file visa applications. See 8 U. S. C. §1202(a). Such an application requires an alien to demonstrate in various ways her admissibility to the United States. See, e.g., §1182(a)&para;<br>(1)(A) (alien may not have serious health problems);&para;<br>§1182(a)(2)(A) (alien may not have been convicted of certain crimes); §1182(a)(3)(B) (alien may not have engaged&para;<br>in terrorist activity). Notably, one necessary showing&para;<br>involves the U. S. citizen or LPR who filed the initial&para;<br>petition: To mitigate any possibility of becoming a “public&para;<br>charge,” the visa applicant (whether a principal or derivative beneficiary) must append an “affidavit of support”&para;<br>executed&para;<br>by&para;<br>that&para;<br>sponsoring&para;<br>individual.&para;<br>§§1182(a)(4)(C)(ii), 1183a(a)(1). Such an affidavit legally&para;<br>commits the sponsor to support the alien, usually for at&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>least 10 years, with an annual income “not less than&para;<br>125% of the federal poverty line.” §1183a(a)(1)(A); see&para;<br>§§1183a(a)(2)–(3).&para;<br>After the beneficiaries have filed their applications, a&para;<br>consular official reviews the documents and, if everything&para;<br>is in order, schedules in-person interviews. See §1202(h).&para;<br>The interviews for a principal and her children (or spouse)&para;<br>usually occur back-to-back, although those for the children&para;<br>may also come later.4 The consular official will determine&para;<br>first whether the principal should receive a visa; if (but&para;<br>only if) the answer is yes, the official will then consider the&para;<br>derivatives’ applications. See 22 CFR §§40.1(a)(2), 42.62,&para;<br>42.81(a). Provided all goes well, everyone exits the consulate with visas in hand—but that still does not make them&para;<br>LPRs. See 8 U. S. C. §1154(e). Each approved alien must&para;<br>then travel to the United States within a set time, undergo&para;<br>inspection, and confirm her admissibility. See §§1201(c),&para;<br>1222, 1225(a)–(b). Once again, a derivative’s fate is tied to&para;<br>the principal’s: If the principal cannot enter the country,&para;<br>neither can her children (or spouse). See §1153(d); 22 CFR&para;<br>§40.1(a)(2). When, but only when, an alien with an immigrant visa is approved at the border does she finally become an LPR.5&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See Dept. of State, The Immigrant Visa Process: Visa Applicant&para;<br>Interview,&para;<br>online&para;<br>at&para;<br>http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/&para;<br>immigrate/immigrant-process/interview/applicant_interview.html (all&para;<br>Internet materials as visited June 5, 2014, and available in Clerk of&para;<br>Court’s case file).&para;<br>5 The last part of the immigration process is streamlined for aliens&para;<br>already residing in the United States who have applied for adjustment&para;<br>of status. See n. 1, supra. The immigration officer interviewing such&para;<br>an alien, upon finding her visa-eligible, may declare her an LPR on the&para;<br>spot. See 8 U. S. C. §1255(i)(2). But here too, the officer will not make&para;<br>a derivative beneficiary an LPR unless and until he approves that&para;<br>status for the principal.

At the front&para;<br>end, many months may go by before USCIS approves the&para;<br>initial sponsoring petition.6 On the back end, several&para;<br>additional months may elapse while a consular official&para;<br>considers the alien’s visa application and schedules an&para;<br>interview.7 And the middle is the worst. After a sponsoring petition is approved but before a visa application can&para;<br>be filed, a family-sponsored immigrant may stand in line&para;<br>for years—or even decades—just waiting for an immigrant&para;<br>visa to become available. See, e.g., Dept. of State, Bureau&para;<br>of Consular Affairs, 9 Visa Bulletin, Immigrant Numbers&para;<br>for December 2013 (Nov. 8, 2013).&para;<br>And as the years tick by, young people grow up, and&para;<br>thereby endanger their immigration status. Remember&para;<br>that not all offspring, but only those under the age of 21&para;<br>can qualify as an “immediate relative” of a U. S. citizen, or&para;<br>as the principal beneficiary of an LPR’s F2A petition, or&para;<br>(most crucially here) as the derivative beneficiary of any&para;<br>family preference petition. See supra, at 3, 5. So an alien&para;<br>eligible to immigrate at the start of the process (when a&para;<br>sponsor files a petition) might not be so at the end (when&para;<br>an immigration official reviews his documents for admission).

The months that&para;<br>elapse before USCIS personnel approve a family preference petition (“the period during which the applicable&para;<br>petition described in paragraph (2) was pending”) do not&para;<br>count against an alien in determining his statutory “age.”&para;<br>Neither do the months a consular officer lets pass before&para;<br>adjudicating the alien’s own visa application (the period&para;<br>after “an immigrant visa number becomes available for&para;<br>such alien (or . . . [his] parent)”). But the time in between—the months or, more likely, years the alien spends&para;<br>simply waiting for a visa to become available—is not&para;<br>similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the&para;<br>alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the&para;<br>immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative&para;<br>beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A&para;<br>petitions, can still “age out”—in other words, turn 21,&para;<br>notwithstanding §1153(h)(1)’s dual age adjustments—&para;<br>prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.&para;<br>What happens then (if anything) is the subject of&para;<br>§1153(h)’s third paragraph—the provision at issue in this&para;<br>case. That paragraph states:&para;<br>“If the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes&para;<br>of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section, the&para;<br>alien’s petition shall automatically be converted to the&para;<br>appropriate category and the alien shall retain the&para;<br>original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.”&para;<br>The provision thus first references the aged-out beneficiaries of family preference petitions, and then directs immigration officials to do something whose meaning this&para;<br>opinion will further consider—i.e., “automatically convert”&para;<br>an alien’s petition to an “appropriate category.”&para;<br>The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) addressed the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>meaning of §1153(h)(3) in Matter of Wang, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec.&para;<br>28 (2009); its interpretation there is what we review in&para;<br>this case. Wang was the principal beneficiary of an F4&para;<br>petition that his sister, a U. S. citizen, filed in 1992. At&para;<br>that time, Wang’s daughter was 10 years old, and thus&para;<br>qualified as a derivative beneficiary. But Wang waited in&para;<br>line for a visa for more than a decade, and by the time his&para;<br>priority date finally came up, his daughter had turned 22&para;<br>(even after applying §1153(h)(1)’s age-reduction formula).&para;<br>Wang thus obtained a visa for himself, boarded a plane&para;<br>alone, and entered the United States as an LPR. He then&para;<br>filed a new preference petition on his daughter’s behalf—&para;<br>this one under F2B, the category for LPRs’ adult sons and&para;<br>daughters. USCIS approved that petition, with a priority&para;<br>date corresponding to the date of Wang’s filing. Wang&para;<br>contended that under §1153(h)(3), his daughter was instead entitled to “retain the original priority date” given to&para;<br>his sister’s old F4 petition, because that petition could&para;<br>“automatically be converted” to the F2B category.&para;<br>The Board rejected that argument. It explained that&para;<br>“the language of [§1153(h)(3)] does not expressly state&para;<br>which petitions qualify for automatic conversion and&para;<br>retention of priority dates.” Id., at 33. Given that “ambiguity,” the BIA looked to the “recognized meaning” of “the&para;<br>phrase ‘automatic conversion’ ” in immigration statutes&para;<br>and regulations—which it “presume[d]” Congress understood when enacting the CSPA. Id., at 33–35. “Historically,”&para;<br>the BIA showed, that language applied only when a&para;<br>petition could move seamlessly from one family preference&para;<br>category to another—not when a new sponsor was needed&para;<br>to fit a beneficiary into a different category. Id., at 35.&para;<br>Some aged-out aliens’ petitions could accomplish that&para;<br>maneuver, because the alien had a qualifying relationship&para;<br>with the original sponsor, and continued to do so upon&para;<br>aging out; in that event, the Board held, §1153(h)(3) ensured that the alien would retain his original priority date.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>See id., at 34–35. But the F4 petition filed by Wang’s&para;<br>sister could not “automatically be converted” in that way&para;<br>because Wang’s daughter never had a qualifying relationship with the sponsor: “[N]o category exists for the niece of&para;<br>a United States citizen.” Id., at 35–36. That is why Wang&para;<br>himself had to file a new petition on his daughter’s behalf&para;<br>once she aged out and could no longer ride on his sibling&para;<br>status. The Board saw no evidence that Congress meant&para;<br>“to expand the use of the concept[ ] of automatic conversion” to reach such a case. Id., at 36. And the Board&para;<br>thought such an expansion unwarranted because it would&para;<br>allow aliens like Wang’s daughter, who lacked any independent entitlement to a visa during the years her father&para;<br>spent standing on the F4 queue, to “cut[ ] in line ahead of&para;<br>others awaiting visas in other preference categories.” Id.,&para;<br>at 38.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The respondents in this case are similarly situated to&para;<br>Wang, and they seek the same relief. Each was once the&para;<br>principal beneficiary of either an F3 petition filed by a&para;<br>U. S. citizen parent or an F4 petition filed by a U. S. citizen sibling. Each also has a son or daughter who, on the&para;<br>date of filing, was under 21 and thus qualified as a derivative beneficiary of the petition. But as was true of Wang’s&para;<br>daughter, the respondents’ offspring had all turned 21&para;<br>(even accounting for §1153(h)(1)’s age adjustments) by the&para;<br>time visas became available. Accordingly, the respondents&para;<br>immigrated to the United States alone and, as new LPRs,&para;<br>filed F2B petitions for their sons and daughters. Each&para;<br>argued that under §1153(h)(3), those petitions should get&para;<br>the same priority date as the original F3 and F4 petitions&para;<br>once had. USCIS instead gave the new F2B petitions&para;<br>current priority dates, meaning that the sons and daughters could not leapfrog over others in the F2B line.&para;<br>This case began as two separate suits, one joining many&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

In each suit, the District Court deferred to the&para;<br>BIA’s interpretation of §1153(h)(3) in Wang, and accordingly granted summary judgment to the Government. See&para;<br>Zhang v. Napolitano, 663 F. Supp. 2d 913, 919 (CD Cal.&para;<br>2009); Costelo v. Chertoff, No. SA08–00688, 2009 WL&para;<br>4030516 (CD Cal., Nov. 10, 2009). After consolidating the&para;<br>two cases on appeal, a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed:&para;<br>Like the lower courts, it found §1153(h)(3) ambiguous and&para;<br>acceded to the BIA’s construction. 656 F. 3d 954, 965–966&para;<br>(2011).

Indeed, “judicial deference to the&para;<br>Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context,” where decisions about a complex statutory scheme often implicate foreign relations.

Under Chevron, the&para;<br>statute’s plain meaning controls, whatever the Board&para;<br>might have to say. See 467 U. S., at 842–843. But if the&para;<br>law does not speak clearly to the question at issue, a court&para;<br>must defer to the Board’s reasonable interpretation, rather than substitute its own reading. Id., at 844.&para;<br>And §1153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the&para;<br>issue here—or more precisely put, it addresses that issue&para;<br>in divergent ways. We might call the provision Janusfaced. Its first half looks in one direction, toward the&para;<br>sweeping relief the respondents propose, which would&para;<br>reach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference&para;<br>petition. But as the BIA recognized, and we will further&para;<br>explain, the section’s second half looks another way, toward a remedy that can apply to only a subset of those&para;<br>beneficiaries—and one not including the respondents’&para;<br>offspring. The two faces of the statute do not easily cohere&para;<br>with each other: Read either most naturally, and the other&para;<br>appears to mean not what it says. That internal tension&para;<br>makes possible alternative reasonable constructions,&para;<br>bringing into correspondence in one way or another the&para;<br>section’s different parts. And when that is so, Chevron&para;<br>dictates that a court defer to the agency’s choice—here, to&para;<br>the Board’s expert judgment about which interpretation&para;<br>fits best with, and makes most sense of, the statutory&para;<br>scheme.&para;<br>Begin by reading the statute from the top—the part&para;<br>favoring the respondents.&para;<br>Section 1153(h)(3)’s first&para;<br>clause—“If the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes of&para;<br>subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)”—states a condition that&para;<br>every aged-out beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies. That is because all those beneficiaries have had their&para;<br>ages “determined under paragraph (1)” (and have come up&para;<br>wanting): Recall that the age formula of §1153(h)(1) applies to each alien child who originally qualified (under&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>“subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)”) as the principal beneficiary&para;<br>of an F2A petition or the derivative beneficiary of any&para;<br>family preference petition. On its own, then, §1153(h)(3)’s&para;<br>opening clause encompasses the respondents’ sons and&para;<br>daughters, along with every other once-young beneficiary&para;<br>of a family preference petition now on the wrong side of&para;<br>21. If the next phrase said something like “the alien shall&para;<br>be treated as though still a minor” (much as the CSPA did&para;<br>to ensure U. S. citizens’ children, qualifying as “immediate&para;<br>relatives,” would stay forever young, see supra, at 7–8), all&para;<br>those aged-out beneficiaries would prevail in this case.&para;<br>But read on, because §1153(h)(3)’s second clause instead&para;<br>prescribes a remedy containing its own limitation on the&para;<br>eligible class of recipients. “[T]he alien’s petition,” that&para;<br>part provides, “shall automatically be converted to the&para;<br>appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date.” That statement directs immigration&para;<br>officials to take the initial petition benefitting an alien&para;<br>child, and now that he has turned 21, “convert[ ]” that&para;<br>same petition from a category for children to an “appropriate category” for adults (while letting him keep the old&para;<br>priority date). The “conversion,” in other words, is merely&para;<br>from one category to another; it does not entail any change&para;<br>in the petition, including its sponsor, let alone any new&para;<br>filing. And more, that category shift is to be “automatic”—&para;<br>that is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays. See, e.g., Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary 140 (2d ed. 2001) (defining “automatic”&para;<br>as “having the capability of starting, operating, moving,&para;<br>etc., independently”); The American Heritage Dictionary&para;<br>122 (4th ed. 2000) (“[a]cting or operating in a manner&para;<br>essentially independent of external influence”). The operation described is, then, a mechanical cut-and-paste job—&para;<br>moving a petition, without any substantive alteration,&para;<br>from one (no-longer-appropriate, child-based) category to&para;<br>another (now-appropriate, adult) compartment. And so&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the aliens who may benefit from §1153(h)(3)’s back half&para;<br>are only those for whom that procedure is possible. The&para;<br>clause offers relief not to every aged-out beneficiary, but&para;<br>just to those covered by petitions that can roll over, seamlessly and promptly, into a category for adult relatives.&para;<br>That understanding of §1153(h)(3)’s “automatic conversion” language matches the exclusive way immigration&para;<br>law used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA. For&para;<br>many years before then (as today), a regulation entitled&para;<br>“Automatic conversion of preference classification” instructed immigration officials to change the preference&para;<br>category of a petition’s principal beneficiary when either&para;<br>his or his sponsor’s status changed in specified ways. See&para;<br>8 CFR §§204.2(i)(1)–(3) (2002). For example, the regulation provided that when a U. S. citizen’s child aged out, his&para;<br>“immediate relative” petition converted to an F1 petition,&para;<br>with his original priority date left intact. See §204.2(i)(2).&para;<br>Similarly, when a U. S. citizen’s adult son married, his&para;<br>original petition migrated from F1 to F3, see §204.2(i)&para;<br>(1)(i); when, conversely, such a person divorced, his petition converted from F3 to F1, see §204.2(i)(1)(iii); and&para;<br>when a minor child’s LPR parent became a citizen, his&para;<br>F2A petition became an “immediate relative” petition, see&para;<br>§204.2(i)(3)—all again with their original priority dates.&para;<br>Most notable here, what all of those authorized changes&para;<br>had in common was that they could occur without any&para;<br>change in the petitioner’s identity, or otherwise in the&para;<br>petition’s content. In each circumstance, the “automatic&para;<br>conversion” entailed nothing more than picking up the&para;<br>petition from one category and dropping it into another for&para;<br>which the alien now qualified.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The dissent responds to this fact only with a pair of non-sequiturs.&para;<br>Post, at 18–19 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). First, the dissent cites a&para;<br>statutory provision that does not use the word “conversion” at all, so&para;<br>can hardly attest to its meaning. See 8 U. S. C. §1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III).&para;<br>And next, the dissent cites a regulation that post-dated the CSPA by&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress used the word “conversion” (even without the&para;<br>modifier “automatic”) in the identical way in two other&para;<br>sections of the CSPA. See Law v. Siegel, 571 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 7) (2014) (“[W]ords repeated in different parts&para;<br>of the same statute generally have the same meaning”).&para;<br>Section 2 refers to occasions on which, by virtue of the&para;<br>above-described regulation, a petition “converted” from&para;<br>F2A to the “immediate relative” category because of the&para;<br>sponsor parent’s naturalization, or from the F3 to the&para;<br>F1 box because of the beneficiary’s divorce. 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1151(f )(2), (3). Then, in §6, Congress authorized an&para;<br>additional conversion of the same nature: It directed that&para;<br>when an LPR parent-sponsor naturalizes, the petition he&para;<br>has filed for his adult son or daughter “shall be converted,”&para;<br>unless the beneficiary objects, from the F2B to the F1&para;<br>compartment—again with the original priority date unchanged. 8 U. S. C. §§1154(k)(1)–(3). (That opt-out mechanism itself underscores the otherwise mechanical nature&para;<br>of the conversion.) Once again, in those cases, all that is&para;<br>involved is a recategorization—moving the same petition,&para;<br>filed by the same petitioner, from one preference classification to another, so as to reflect a change in either the&para;<br>alien’s or his sponsor’s status. In the rest of the CSPA, as&para;<br>in the prior immigration regulation, that is what “conversion” means.&para;<br>And if the term meant more than that in §1153(h)(3), it&para;<br>would undermine the family preference system’s core&para;<br>——————&para;<br>years, and thus is equally irrelevant to what Congress intended. See 71&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 35732, 35749 (2006) (adding 8 CFR §204.2(i)(1)(iv)). Moreover, both provisions relate to a sui generis circumstance in which a&para;<br>person can self-petition for a visa because her U. S. citizen or LPR&para;<br>relative either died or engaged in domestic abuse. In that situation, the&para;<br>alien’s eligibility rests throughout on her connection to the deceased or&para;<br>abusive relative; no new party must ever come in, as one has to in a&para;<br>case like Wang, to salvage a no-longer-effective petition. See infra, at&para;<br>18 (addressing the problems that the substitution of a new petitioner&para;<br>raises).&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v.

Consider the alternative addressed in Wang—if&para;<br>“automatic conversion” were also to encompass the substitution of a new petitioner for the old one, to make sure the&para;<br>aged-out alien’s petition fits into a new preference category.&para;<br>In a case like Wang, recall, the original sponsor does&para;<br>not have a legally recognized relationship with the agedout derivative beneficiary (they are aunt and niece); accordingly, the derivative’s father—the old principal beneficiary—must be swapped in as the petitioner to enable his&para;<br>daughter to immigrate. But what if, at that point, the&para;<br>father is in no position to sponsor his daughter? Suppose&para;<br>he decided in the end not to immigrate, or failed to pass&para;<br>border inspection, or died in the meanwhile. Or suppose&para;<br>he entered the country, but cannot sponsor a relative’s&para;<br>visa because he lacks adequate proof of parentage or&para;<br>committed a disqualifying crime.

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>deemed to have either aged out or not: It is “the date on&para;<br>which an immigrant visa number became available for the&para;<br>alien’s parent.” See §§1153(h)(1)(A)–(B). Because that&para;<br>statutory aging out is the one and only thing that triggers&para;<br>automatic conversion for eligible aliens, the date of conversion is best viewed as the same. That reading, moreover, comports with the “automatic conversion” regulation&para;<br>on which Congress drew in enacting the CSPA, see supra,&para;<br>at 16–17: The rule authorizes conversions “upon” or “as of&para;<br>the date” of the relevant change in the alien’s status (including turning 21))—regardless when USCIS may receive notice of the change. 8 CFR §204.2(i); but cf. post, at&para;<br>14 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (wrongly stating that&para;<br>under that rule conversion occurs upon the agency’s receipt of proof of the change). But on that date, no new&para;<br>petitioner will be ready to step into the old one’s shoes if&para;<br>such a substitution is needed to fit an aged-out beneficiary&para;<br>into a different category. The beneficiary’s parent, on the&para;<br>day a “visa number became available,” cannot yet be an&para;<br>LPR or citizen; by definition, she has just become eligible&para;<br>to apply for a visa, and faces a wait of at least several&para;<br>months before she can sponsor an alien herself. Nor,&para;<br>except in a trivial number of cases, is any hitherto unidentified person likely to have a legally recognized relationship to the alien. So if an aged-out beneficiary has lost his&para;<br>qualifying connection to the original petitioner, no conversion to an “appropriate category” can take place at the&para;<br>requisite time. As long as immigration law demands some&para;<br>valid sponsor, §1153(h)(3) cannot give such an alien the&para;<br>designated relief.&para;<br>On the above account—in which conversion entails a&para;<br>simple reslotting of an original petition into a nowappropriate category—§1153(h)(3)’s back half provides a&para;<br>remedy to two groups of aged-out beneficiaries. First, any&para;<br>child who was the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition&para;<br>(filed by an LPR parent on his behalf) can take advantage&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>of that clause after turning 21. He is, upon aging out, the&para;<br>adult son of the same LPR who sponsored him as a child;&para;<br>his petition can therefore be moved seamlessly—without&para;<br>the slightest alteration or delay—into the F2B category.&para;<br>Second, any child who was the derivative beneficiary of an&para;<br>F2A petition (filed by an LPR on his spouse’s behalf) can&para;<br>similarly claim relief, provided that under the statute, he&para;<br>is not just the spouse’s but also the petitioner’s child.11&para;<br>Such an alien is identically situated to the aged-out principal beneficiary of an F2A petition; indeed, for the price of&para;<br>another filing fee, he could just as easily have been named&para;<br>a principal himself. He too is now the adult son of the&para;<br>original LPR petitioner, and his petition can also be instantly relabeled an F2B petition, without any need to&para;<br>substitute a new sponsor or make other revisions. In each&para;<br>case, the alien had a qualifying relationship before he was&para;<br>21 and retains it afterward; all that must be changed is&para;<br>the label affixed to his petition.12&para;<br>In contrast, as the Board held in Wang, the aged-out&para;<br>derivative beneficiaries of the other family preference&para;<br>categories—like the sons and daughters of the respondents here—cannot qualify for “automatic conversion.”&para;<br>Recall that the respondents themselves were principal&para;<br>beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions; their children, when&para;<br>under 21, counted as derivatives, but lacked any qualifying preference relationship of their own. The F3 derivatives were the petitioners’ grandsons and granddaughters;&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Given the statute’s broad definition of “child,” the only F2A derivative beneficiaries who fall outside that proviso are stepchildren who&para;<br>were over the age of 18 when the petitioner married the spousal beneficiary. See §1101(b)(1)(B). The Government represents that thousands&para;<br>of children are designated as F2A derivatives every year. See Reply&para;<br>Brief 18, n. 13.&para;<br>12 It is, therefore, impossible to understand the dissent’s statement&para;<br>that conversion of such a petition to an appropriate category requires&para;<br>“ ‘substantive alteration’ to [the] petition.” See post, at 19, n. 8 (opinion&para;<br>of SOTOMAYOR, J.).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the F4 derivatives their nephews and nieces; and none of&para;<br>those are relationships Congress has recognized as warranting a family preference. See 8 U. S. C. §§1153(a)(3)–&para;<br>(4). Now that the respondents’ children have turned 21,&para;<br>and they can no longer ride on their parents’ coattails,&para;<br>that lack of independent eligibility makes a difference.&para;<br>For them, unlike for the F2A beneficiaries, it is impossible&para;<br>simply to slide the original petitions from a (no-longerappropriate) child category to a (now-appropriate) adult&para;<br>one. To fit into a new category, those aged-out derivatives,&para;<br>like Wang’s daughter, must have new sponsors—and for&para;<br>all the reasons already stated, that need means they&para;<br>cannot benefit from “automatic conversion.”&para;<br>All that said, we hold only that §1153(h)(3) permits—not&para;<br>that it requires—the Board’s decision to so distinguish&para;<br>among aged-out beneficiaries. That is because, as we&para;<br>explained earlier, the two halves of §1153(h)(3) face in&para;<br>different directions. See supra, at 14. Section 1153(h)(3)’s&para;<br>first part—its conditional phrase—encompasses every&para;<br>aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition, and&para;<br>thus points toward broad-based relief. But as just shown,&para;<br>§1153(h)(3)’s second part—its remedial prescription—&para;<br>applies only to a narrower class of beneficiaries: those&para;<br>aliens who naturally qualify for (and so can be “automatically converted” to) a new preference classification when&para;<br>they age out. Were there an interpretation that gave each&para;<br>clause full effect, the Board would have been required to&para;<br>adopt it. But the ambiguity those ill-fitting clauses create&para;<br>instead left the Board with a choice—essentially of how to&para;<br>reconcile the statute’s different commands. The Board,&para;<br>recognizing the need to make that call, opted to abide by&para;<br>the inherent limits of §1153(h)(3)’s remedial clause, rather&para;<br>than go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of&para;<br>the section’s initial condition. On the Board’s reasoned&para;<br>view, the only beneficiaries entitled to statutory relief are&para;<br>those capable of obtaining the remedy designated. When&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>an agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require us to defer. See&para;<br>National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,&para;<br>551 U. S. 644, 666 (2007) (When a statutory scheme contains “a fundamental ambiguity” arising from “the differing mandates” of two provisions, “it is appropriate to look&para;<br>to the implementing agency’s expert interpretation” to&para;<br>determine which “must give way”).&para;<br>III&para;<br>The respondents urge us to overturn the Board’s judgment for three independent reasons. First, and principally,&para;<br>they take issue with the Board’s—and now our—view&para;<br>of the limits associated with “automatic conversion”: They&para;<br>argue that every aged-out beneficiary’s petition can “automatically be converted” to an “appropriate category,”&para;<br>and that the two halves of §1153(h)(3) are thus reconcilable. Second, the respondents contend that even if “automatic conversion” does not extend so far, §1153(h)(3)&para;<br>separately entitles each such beneficiary to the benefit of&para;<br>his original petition’s priority date. And third, they claim&para;<br>that the Board’s way of resolving whatever ambiguity&para;<br>inheres in §1153(h)(3) is arbitrary and capricious. The&para;<br>dissenting opinion reiterates the first two arguments,&para;<br>though with slight variation and in opposite order, while&para;<br>forgoing the third.&para;<br>See post, at 9–19 (opinion of&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J.) (hereinafter the dissent). We find none of&para;<br>the contentions persuasive.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The respondents (and the dissent) initially aver that&para;<br>every aged-out beneficiary (including their own sons and&para;<br>daughters) can “automatically be converted” to an “appropriate” immigration category, if only immigration officials&para;<br>try hard enough. The Government, in the respondents’&para;<br>view, can accomplish that feat by substituting new spon-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>sors for old ones, and by “managing the timing” of every&para;<br>conversion to ensure such a new petitioner exists on the&para;<br>relevant date. Brief for Respondents 33. And because, the&para;<br>respondents say, it is thus possible to align the two halves&para;<br>of §1153(h)(3)—even if through multiple administrative&para;<br>maneuvers—immigration officials are under an obligation&para;<br>to do so. We disagree, for reasons that should sound familiar: Several are the same as those we have just given&para;<br>for upholding the Board’s interpretation. But still, we&para;<br>walk through the respondents’ argument step-by-step, to&para;<br>show how far it departs from any ordinary understanding&para;<br>of “automatic conversion.”&para;<br>The first (and necessary) premise of that argument does&para;<br>not augur well for the remainder: It is the view that the&para;<br>“automatic conversion” procedure permits a change in the&para;<br>petitioner’s identity. According to the respondents, the&para;<br>aged-out beneficiaries’ parents, upon becoming LPRs, can&para;<br>be subbed in for the original sponsors (i.e., the beneficiaries’ grandparents, aunts, and uncles), and the petitions&para;<br>then converted to the F2B category. But as we have&para;<br>shown, the “automatic conversion” language—as most&para;<br>naturally read and as long used throughout immigration&para;<br>law—contemplates merely moving a petition into a new&para;<br>and valid category, not changing its most essential feature. See supra, at 15–17. That alone defeats the respondents’ position.&para;<br>And a further problem follows—this one concerning the&para;<br>date of automatic conversion. The respondents need that&para;<br>date to come at a time when the derivative beneficiaries’&para;<br>parents (the substitute petitioners) are already living in&para;<br>the United States as LPRs; otherwise, the petitions could&para;<br>not qualify for the F2B box. In an attempt to make that&para;<br>possible, the respondents propose that conversion be&para;<br>viewed as taking place when “the derivative beneficiary’s&para;<br>visa . . . application is adjudicated.” Brief for Respondents&para;<br>29. But as we have (again) demonstrated, the statute is&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>best read as establishing a different date: that “on which&para;<br>an immigrant visa number became available for the alien’s&para;<br>parent”—when, by definition, the parent is not yet an&para;<br>LPR. §1153(h)(1); see supra, at 18–19. That is the moment when a derivative ages out, which is the single&para;<br>change conversion reflects. By contrast, the respondents’&para;<br>suggested date has no connection to that metamorphosis;&para;<br>the date of adjudication is merely when an immigration&para;<br>official later discovers that a child has turned 21. And&para;<br>that date is itself fortuitous, reflecting no more than when&para;<br>an immigration officer got around to reviewing a visa&para;<br>application: The possibility of conversion would thus&para;<br>depend on bureaucratic vagaries attending the visa process. So the respondents’ mistaken view of the timing of&para;<br>conversion is another off-ramp from their argument.13&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Still, the respondents’ view of the timing of conversion is better&para;<br>than the dissent’s. As an initial matter, the dissent’s objection to&para;<br>assessing conversion as of the date a visa becomes available hinges on&para;<br>an imaginary difficulty. That approach, the dissent complains, cannot&para;<br>be right because that date always “occurs before the point at which the&para;<br>child is determined to have aged-out.” Post, at 15. Well, yes. The date&para;<br>a visa becomes available is, under the statute, the date an alien ages&para;<br>out (or not); and that status change of course occurs before an immigration official, reviewing a visa application, finds that it has done so. But&para;<br>what of it? When an official determines that an alien was no longer a&para;<br>child on the date a visa became available, he also assesses whether&para;<br>automatic conversion was available to the alien as of that prior date. In&para;<br>other words, here as elsewhere in immigration law, conversion occurs&para;<br>(or not) upon the date of the relevant status change—and no other. See&para;<br>supra, at 19. And once that is understood, the supposed difficulties the&para;<br>dissent throws up all melt away. At the time of the status change, F2A&para;<br>petitions can be converted without further contingencies, decisions, or&para;<br>delays, whereas no other petitions can. But cf. post, at 16, 17, n. 7&para;<br>(countering, irrelevantly, that after an F2A petition is automatically&para;<br>converted, additional steps remain in the immigration process). And&para;<br>immigration officials later reviewing visa applications know that fact,&para;<br>and can treat the different classes of aged-out beneficiaries accordingly.&para;<br>Further, the dissent compounds its error by suggesting a baseless&para;<br>alternative date: “the moment when USCIS receives proof,” no matter&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Yet there is more—because even after substituting a&para;<br>new petitioner and delaying the conversion date in a way&para;<br>the statute does not contemplate, the respondents must&para;<br>propose yet further fixes to make “automatic” conversion&para;<br>work for their sons and daughters. The respondents’ next&para;<br>problem is that even on the conversion date they propose,&para;<br>most of them (and other derivatives’ parents) were not yet&para;<br>LPRs, and so could not possibly be sponsors. In the ordinary course, principal and derivative beneficiaries living&para;<br>abroad apply for their visas at the same time and go to the&para;<br>consulate together for back-to-back interviews. See supra,&para;<br>at 6. And even if the parent is approved first, that alone&para;<br>does not make her an LPR; she still must come to this&para;<br>country, demonstrate her continued eligibility, and pass&para;<br>an inspection. See ibid. Thus, the respondents must&para;<br>recommend changes to the visa process to get the timing&para;<br>to work—essentially, administrative juggling to hold off&para;<br>the derivative beneficiary’s visa adjudication until his&para;<br>parent has become an LPR. In particular, they suggest&para;<br>that the consular official defer the derivative’s interview,&para;<br>or that the official nominally “reject the application” and&para;<br>then instruct the derivative to “reapply after the principal&para;<br>beneficiary immigrates.” Brief for Respondents 30. But&para;<br>the need for that choreography (which, in any event, few if&para;<br>any of the respondents conformed to) renders the conversion process only less “automatic,” because now it requires&para;<br>special intervention, purposeful delay, and deviation from&para;<br>——————&para;<br>how far in the future, that a new petitioner stands ready and willing to&para;<br>sponsor an aged-out beneficiary. Post, at 15. Not even the respondents&para;<br>propose such a date, and for good reason. It has no grounding in the&para;<br>CSPA or in any regulatory practice, and it bears no connection to the&para;<br>timing of the status change (aging out) that triggers conversion (or&para;<br>even, as the respondents’ date does, to the later determination of that&para;<br>change). The only thing appearing to support the dissent’s date is a&para;<br>single-minded resolve, statutory text and administrative practice&para;<br>notwithstanding, to grant relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>standard administrative practice. Conversion has become&para;<br>not a machine that would go of itself, but a process painstakingly managed.&para;<br>And after all this fancy footwork, the respondents’&para;<br>scheme still cannot succeed, because however long a visa&para;<br>adjudication is postponed, a derivative’s parent may never&para;<br>become able to sponsor a relative’s visa—and immigration&para;<br>officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has&para;<br>done so. We have noted before the potential impediments&para;<br>to serving as a petitioner—including that a parent may&para;<br>not immigrate, may not qualify as a sponsor, or may not&para;<br>be able to provide the requisite financial support. See&para;<br>supra, at 17–18. The respondents offer no way to deal&para;<br>with those many contingencies. Require the parent to&para;<br>submit a new petition? But the entire point of automatic&para;<br>conversion (as the respondents themselves agree) is to&para;<br>obviate the need for such a document. See Brief for Respondents 30, 42. Investigate the parent’s eligibility in&para;<br>some other way? But even were that possible (which we&para;<br>doubt) such an inquiry would not square with the essential idea of an automatic process. Disregard the possibility&para;<br>that no legal sponsor exists? But then visas would go,&para;<br>inevitably and not infrequently, to ineligible aliens. And&para;<br>so the workarounds have well and truly run out on the&para;<br>respondents’ argument.14&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 Nor does the dissent offer any serious aid to the respondents. The&para;<br>dissent initially acknowledges that automatic conversion cannot involve&para;<br>“additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.” Post, at 13. But no&para;<br>worries, the dissent continues: “[O]nce [an alien’s parent] provides&para;<br>confirmation of her eligibility to sponsor” the aged-out alien, the original petition “can automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no&para;<br>additional decision or contingency” or (presumably) delay. Post, at 14.&para;<br>Think about that: Once every decision, contingency, and delay we have&para;<br>just described is over (and a parent has at long last turned out to be a&para;<br>viable sponsor), the dissent assures us that no further decisions,&para;<br>contingencies, and delays remain. Or, put differently, there are no&para;<br>contingencies after all the contingencies have been resolved; no deci-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>That leaves us with the same statutory inconsistency&para;<br>with which we began. Having followed each step of the&para;<br>respondents’ resourceful (if Rube Goldbergish) argument,&para;<br>we still see no way to apply the concept of automatic conversion to the respondents’ children and others like them.&para;<br>And that means we continue to face a statute whose&para;<br>halves do not correspond to each other—giving rise to an&para;<br>ambiguity that calls for Chevron deference.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The respondents, however, have another idea for reconciling §1153(h)(3)’s front and back parts (and this back-up&para;<br>claim becomes the dissent’s principal argument). Recall&para;<br>that the section’s remedial clause instructs that “the&para;<br>alien’s petition shall automatically be converted to the&para;<br>appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original&para;<br>priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.”&para;<br>The respondents (and the dissent) ask us to read the&para;<br>italicized language as conferring a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion. On that view, aged-out&para;<br>derivatives, even though ineligible for conversion, could&para;<br>“retain the[ir] original priority date[s]” if their parents file&para;<br>a new petition (as the respondents in fact did here “as a&para;<br>protective matter,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 55). And then, everyone encompassed in §1153(h)(3)’s first clause would get at&para;<br>least some form of relief (even if not both forms) from the&para;<br>section’s second. For this argument, the respondents&para;<br>principally rely on the word “and”: “Where the word ‘and’&para;<br>connects two” phrases as in §1153(h)(3)’s back half, the&para;<br>respondents contend, those terms “operate independently.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>sions after all the decisions have been made; and no delay after all the&para;<br>delay has transpired. And as if that argument were not awkward&para;<br>enough, consider that it would make automatic conversion turn on the&para;<br>filing of a new document that shows the parent’s eligibility to sponsor&para;<br>her aged-out son or daughter—the very thing, as all parties agree, that&para;<br>conversion is supposed to render unnecessary. See supra, at 18, 26.&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 39; see post, at 9.&para;<br>But the conjunction “and” does not necessarily disjoin&para;<br>two phrases in the way the respondents say. In some&para;<br>sentences, no doubt, the respondents have a point. They&para;<br>use as their primary example: “[I]f the boat takes on water, then you shall operate the bilge pump and you shall&para;<br>distribute life jackets.” Brief for Respondents 39; see also&para;<br>post, at 10 (offering further examples). We agree that “you&para;<br>shall distribute life jackets” functions in that sentence as&para;<br>an independent command. But we can come up with&para;<br>many paired dictates in which the second is conditional on&para;<br>the first. “If the price is reasonable, buy two tickets and&para;<br>save a receipt.” “If you have time this summer, read this&para;<br>book and give me a report.” Or, shades of this case: “If&para;<br>your cell-phone contract expires, buy a new phone and&para;<br>keep the old number.”15 In each case, the second command functions only once the first is accomplished.&para;<br>Whether “and” works in that way or in the respondents’&para;<br>depends, like many questions of usage, on the context.&para;<br>See, e.g., Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent appears to think that something helpful to its view&para;<br>follows from repeating the word “shall” and changing the subject of the&para;<br>commands. See post, at 9–10. But that is not so, as some further&para;<br>examples show. “If you advance to the next round, my assistant shall&para;<br>schedule an interview and you shall come in to answer questions.” “If&para;<br>the plane is low on fuel, the tanks shall be refilled and the pilot shall fly&para;<br>the route as scheduled.” In these sentences, as in our prior ones, the&para;<br>second command is conditional on the first; all that differs is that these&para;<br>sentences are (much like statutes) more formal and stilted. And the&para;<br>dissent’s citation of United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489&para;<br>U. S. 235 (1989), adds nothing to its argument. There, we construed&para;<br>the following provision: “[T]here shall be allowed to the holder of [a&para;<br>secured] claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs,&para;<br>or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim&para;<br>arose.” Id., at 241. We held that the phrase “provided for under the&para;<br>agreement” qualifies the words “any reasonable fees, costs, or charges,”&para;<br>but not the words “interest on such claim.” Id., at 241–242. What&para;<br>relevance that interpretation bears to this case eludes us.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

S. ___, ___ (2012).&para;<br>Here, we think, context compels the Board’s view that&para;<br>the instructions work in tandem. The first phrase instructs immigration officials to convert a petition (when an&para;<br>“appropriate category” exists); the next clarifies that such&para;<br>a converted petition will retain the original priority date,&para;<br>rather than receive a new one corresponding to the date of&para;<br>conversion. That reading comports with the way retention&para;<br>figures in other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting “conversions”; there too, retention of a priority&para;<br>date is conditional on a conversion occurring. See 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §§1154(k)(1)–(3); 8 CFR §204.2(i); supra, at 16.&para;<br>The respondents wish to unhook the “retention” phrase&para;<br>from that mooring, and use it to explain what will attend a&para;<br>different event—that is, the filing of a new petition. But&para;<br>that is to make “retention” conditional on something the&para;<br>statute nowhere mentions—a highly improbable thing for&para;<br>Congress to have done. (If, once again, a teacher says to&para;<br>“read this book and give me a report,” no one would think&para;<br>he wants a report on some unidentified subject.) And&para;<br>indeed, the respondents’ and dissent’s own examples prove&para;<br>this point: In not a single one of their proffered sentences&para;<br>is the second command contingent on the occurrence of&para;<br>some additional, unstated event, as it would have to be&para;<br>under the respondents’ construction of §1153(h)(3); rather,&para;<br>each such command (e.g., “distribute life jackets”) flows&para;<br>directly from the stated condition (e.g., “if the boat takes&para;<br>on water”). So by far the more natural understanding of&para;<br>§1153(h)(3)’s text is that retention follows conversion, and&para;<br>nothing else.&para;<br>The respondents’ contrary view would also engender&para;<br>unusual results, introducing uncertainty into the immigration system’s operation and thus interfering with&para;<br>statutory goals.

And the possibility of such leap-frogging from many&para;<br>years past would impede USCIS’s publication of accurate&para;<br>waiting times. As far as we know, immigration law nowhere else allows an alien to keep in his pocket a priority&para;<br>date untethered to any existing valid petition.

Dec., at 36.16&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 The dissent claims that USCIS “administered priority date retention in exactly this manner” before the CSPA’s enactment, post, at 10,&para;<br>but that confident assertion is just not so—or at least not in any way&para;<br>that assists the respondents. The dissent principally relies on 8 CFR&para;<br>§204.2(a)(4), which prior to the CSPA’s enactment permitted an agedout F2A derivative beneficiary to retain his old priority date “if [a]&para;<br>subsequent petition is filed by the same petitioner” as filed the original.&para;<br>Far from authorizing an open-ended, free-floating entitlement, that&para;<br>now-superseded regulation allowed an alien to keep his priority date&para;<br>only if he (unlike the respondents’ offspring) had a qualifying relationship with the initial petitioner—that is, only if he fell within the group&para;<br>that the BIA in Wang thought entitled to relief. See 25 I. &amp; N. Dec., at&para;<br>34–35. And the other provisions the dissent cites (which, unlike&para;<br>§204.2(a)(4), continue to operate) similarly fail to support the dissent’s&para;<br>position, because they enable an alien to retain a priority date only if&para;<br>attached to an existing valid petition. See 8 U. S. C. §1154(k)(3) (permitting an alien to retain a priority date associated with an existing F2B petition); 8 CFR §204.5(e) (permitting an alien to retain a&para;<br>priority date associated with an existing employment-based petition); §204.12(f)(1) (permitting an alien to retain a priority date&para;<br>associated with an existing employment-based petition for immigrating&para;<br>physicians).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

In their view, the Board has offered&para;<br>no valid reason, consistent with “the purposes and concerns of the immigration laws,” to treat their own sons and&para;<br>daughters less favorably than aliens who were principal&para;<br>and derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 47. Indeed, the respondents suggest that the&para;<br>BIA, “for its own unfathomable reasons, disapproves of&para;<br>Congress’s decision to allow any aged-out” aliens to get&para;<br>relief, and has thus “limited [§1153(h)(3)] to as few derivative beneficiaries as possible.” Id., at 55.&para;<br>We cannot agree. At the least, the Board’s interpretation has administrative simplicity to recommend it. Under that view, immigration authorities need only perform&para;<br>the kind of straightforward (i.e., “automatic”) conversion&para;<br>they have done for decades—moving a petition from one&para;<br>box to another to reflect a given status change like aging&para;<br>out. See Wang, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 36. The respondents,&para;<br>as we have shown, would transform conversion into a&para;<br>managed, multi-stage process, requiring immigration and&para;<br>consular officials around the world to sequence and delay&para;<br>every aged-out alien’s visa adjudication until they are able&para;<br>to confirm that one of his parents had become a qualifying&para;<br>and willing F2B petitioner. And according to the Government’s (incomplete) statistics, that would have to happen&para;<br>in, at a minimum, tens of thousands of cases every year.&para;<br>See Reply Brief 18, n. 13.&para;<br>Still more important, the Board offered a cogent argument, reflecting statutory purposes, for distinguishing&para;<br>between aged-out beneficiaries of F2A petitions and the&para;<br>respondents’ sons and daughters. See Wang, 35 I. &amp; N.&para;<br>Dec., at 38. As earlier explained, the F2A beneficiaries&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>Opinion of KAGAN, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>have all had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for the&para;<br>entire period they have waited in line—i.e., since their&para;<br>original priority dates. See supra, at 19–20. That means&para;<br>that when immigration authorities convert their petitions,&para;<br>they will enter the F2B line at the same place as others&para;<br>who have had a comparable relationship for an equal time.&para;<br>The conversion thus fits with the immigration law’s basic&para;<br>first-come-first-served rule. See 8 U. S. C. §1153(e); supra,&para;<br>at 4. By contrast, the derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4&para;<br>petitions, like the respondents’ sons and daughters, lacked&para;<br>any qualifying relationship with a citizen or LPR during&para;<br>the period they waited in line. See supra, at 20–21. They&para;<br>were, instead, the grandchildren, nieces, or nephews of&para;<br>citizens, and those relationships did not independently&para;<br>entitle them to visas. If such aliens received relief under&para;<br>§1153(h)(3), they would jump over thousands of others in&para;<br>the F2B line who had a qualifying relationship with an&para;<br>LPR for a far longer time. That displacement would, the&para;<br>Board reasonably found, scramble the priority order Congress prescribed.&para;<br>The argument to the contrary assumes that the respondents’ sons and daughters should “receive credit” for&para;<br>all the time the respondents themselves stood in line.&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 50. But first, the time the respondents spent waiting for a visa may diverge substantially&para;<br>from the time their children did. Suppose, for example,&para;<br>that one of the respondents had stood in the F4 queue for&para;<br>15 years, and with just 4 years to go, married someone&para;<br>with a 17-year-old son. Under the respondents’ reading,&para;<br>that derivative beneficiary, after aging out, would get the&para;<br>full benefit of his new parent’s wait, and so displace many&para;<br>thousands of aliens who (unlike him) had stood in an&para;<br>immigration queue for nearly two decades. And second,&para;<br>even when the derivative qualified as such for all the time&para;<br>his parent stood in line, his status throughout that period&para;<br>hinged on his being that parent’s minor child. If his par-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

But if the parent had died while waiting for a visa,&para;<br>or had been found ineligible, or had decided not to immigrate after all, the derivative would have gotten nothing&para;<br>for the time spent in line. See supra, at 5–6. Similarly,&para;<br>the Board could reasonably conclude, he should not receive&para;<br>credit for his parent’s wait when he has become old&para;<br>enough to live independently. In the unavoidably zerosum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the&para;<br>Board could decide that he belongs behind any alien who&para;<br>has had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>This is the kind of case Chevron was built for.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s response to the campus housing example proves my point by acknowledging that who gets relief under a statute depends entirely on the meaning of the statute’s operative provision, not on the reach of the&para;<br>introductory clause. See post, at 21. The Court would not reject a&para;<br>reasonable interpretation of the term “cost of off-campus housing,” as&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent would, simply because the IRS could have&para;<br>interpreted the term to cover more students who fall within the prefatory clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v.

But automatic conversion is not possible for every beneficiary in every preference category, as&para;<br>the plurality convincingly demonstrates. Ante, at 15–19.&para;<br>Automatic conversion requires, at minimum, that the&para;<br>beneficiary have his own sponsor, who demonstrates that&para;<br>he is eligible to act as a sponsor, and who commits to&para;<br>providing financial support for the beneficiary. Ante, at&para;<br>18. Some aged-out children will not meet those prerequisites, and they cannot benefit from automatic conversion&para;<br>even under respondents’ interpretation of the statute.4&para;<br>Beyond those requirements, however, Congress did not&para;<br>speak clearly to which petitions can “automatically be&para;<br>converted.” §1153(h)(3). Whatever other interpretations&para;<br>of that provision might be possible, it was reasonable, for&para;<br>the reasons explained by the plurality, for the Board to&para;<br>interpret section 1153(h)(3) to provide relief only to a child&para;<br>who was a principal or derivative beneficiary of an F2A&para;<br>petition. That interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established&para;<br>meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and&para;<br>with the structure of the family-based immigration system.

If there is, the&para;<br>agency was obligated by the clear text of 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1153(h)(3) to convert the petitions and leave the children&para;<br>with their original priority dates. Any such conversion&para;<br>would be “automatic,” because the agency’s obligation to&para;<br>convert the petitions follows inexorably, and without need&para;<br>for any additional action on the part of either respondents&para;<br>or their children, from the fact that the children’s ages&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>have been calculated to be 21 or older.1 If there is not an&para;<br>appropriate category, then the agency was not required to&para;<br>convert the petitions.&para;<br>By the time respondents became legal permanent residents and filed new petitions for their children (if not&para;<br>sooner), there existed an appropriate category to which the&para;<br>original petitions could be converted. That is because at&para;<br>that point the children all qualified for F2B preference&para;<br>status, as unmarried, adult children of legal permanent&para;<br>residents. Accordingly, the agency should have converted&para;<br>respondents’ children’s petitions and allowed them to&para;<br>retain their original priority dates.2&para;<br>Section 1153(h)(3) is brief and cryptic. It may well&para;<br>contain a great deal of ambiguity, which the Board of&para;<br>Immigration Appeals in its expertise is free to resolve, so&para;<br>long as its resolution is a “permissible construction of the&para;<br>statute.” Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). But the&para;<br>statute is clear on at least one point: “If the age of an alien&para;<br>is determined under [§1153(h)(1)] to be 21 years of age or&para;<br>older . . . , the alien’s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall&para;<br>retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the&para;<br>original petition” (emphasis added).

The initial clause of 8&para;<br>U. S.

Because all five categories of aged-out&para;<br>children satisfy this condition, all are entitled to relief.&para;<br>Notwithstanding this textual command, the Board of&para;<br>Immigration Appeals (BIA) ruled that four of the five&para;<br>categories of aged-out children to whom §1153(h)(3) unambiguously promises priority date retention, are, in fact,&para;<br>entitled to no relief at all. See Matter of Wang, 25 I. &amp; N.&para;<br>Dec. 28, 38–39 (2009). The Court defers to that interpretation today.

The&para;<br>Court nevertheless holds that the BIA was free to ignore&para;<br>this unambiguous text on the ground that §1153(h)(3) also&para;<br>offers aged-out derivative beneficiaries a type of relief—&para;<br>automatic conversion—that it thinks can apply only to one&para;<br>of the five categories. The Court thus perceives a conflict&para;<br>in the statute that, in its view, permits the BIA to override&para;<br>§1153(h)(3)’s initial eligibility clause.&para;<br>In reaching this conclusion, the Court fails to follow a&para;<br>cardinal rule of statutory interpretation: When deciding&para;<br>whether Congress has “specifically addressed the question&para;<br>at issue,” thereby leaving no room for an agency to fill a&para;<br>statutory gap, courts must “interpret the statute ‘as a . . .&para;<br>coherent regulatory scheme’ and ‘fit, if possible, all parts&para;<br>into [a] harmonious whole.’ ” FDA v.

Brief for Respondents 52.&para;<br>The question in this case is which aged-out beneficiaries&para;<br>of family-preference petitions are eligible for priority date&para;<br>retention: the aged-out beneficiaries of petitions in all five&para;<br>family-preference categories (which would include respondents’ children, who were derivative beneficiaries of&para;<br>F3 and F4 petitions for adult children and adult siblings of&para;<br>U. S. citizens, respectively), or the aged-out beneficiaries&para;<br>of only F2A petitions for spouses and children of LPRs (the&para;<br>interpretation offered by the BIA)?&para;<br>Congress answered that question in §1153(h)(3)’s eligibility clause, which specifies that relief is to be conferred&para;<br>on any immigrant who has been “determined under [the&para;<br>formula specified in] paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or&para;<br>older” for the purpose of §1153(d). As the plurality concedes, this clause “states a condition that every aged-out&para;<br>beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies”—that is, it&para;<br>makes eligible for relief aged-out children within each of&para;<br>the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories. Ante, at 14.&para;<br>Congress made this clear in two mutually reinforcing ways. First, by referring to the formula set forth in&para;<br>“paragraph (1),” the statute incorporates that paragraph’s&para;<br>cross-reference to §1153(h)(2). Section 1153(h)(2) in turn&para;<br>defines the set of covered petitions to include, “with respect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary&para;<br>under [§1153(d)], a petition filed . . . for classification&para;<br>of the alien’s parent under [§1153(a)].” And §1153(a)&para;<br>encompasses all five family-preference categories. See&para;<br>§§1153(a)(1)–(4). Second, §1153(h)(3) promises relief to&para;<br>those who are found to be 21 “for the purpos[e] of . . .&para;<br>[§1153](d),” the provision governing derivative beneficiaries. And that provision also unambiguously covers all five&para;<br>family-preference categories. See §1153(d) (a minor child&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v.

The plurality infers that limitation from two premises. First, it contends that no agedout child may retain her priority date unless her petition&para;<br>is also eligible for automatic conversion. And second, it&para;<br>asserts that only aged-out F2A beneficiaries may receive&para;<br>automatic conversion. As a result, the plurality concludes,&para;<br>it was reasonable for the BIA to exclude aged-out children&para;<br>in the four other categories from receiving both automatic&para;<br>conversion and priority date retention, thereby rendering&para;<br>§1153(h)(3)’s eligibility clause defunct.&para;<br>The plurality’s conclusion is wrong because its premises&para;<br>are wrong. For one, §1153(h)(3) is naturally read to confer&para;<br>priority date retention as an independent form of relief to&para;<br>all aged-out children, regardless of whether automatic&para;<br>conversion is separately available. And even if that were&para;<br>wrong, the plurality’s supposition that only F2A beneficiaries can receive automatic conversion is incorrect on its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Because either of these interpretations would&para;<br>treat §1153(h)(3) as a coherent whole, the BIA’s construction was impermissible.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The most obvious flaw in the plurality’s analysis is its&para;<br>presumption that §1153(h)(3) permits an aged-out child to&para;<br>retain her original priority date only if her petition can&para;<br>be automatically converted. That is incorrect for many&para;<br>reasons.&para;<br>When an immigrant is determined to have aged out of&para;<br>derivative beneficiary status, §1153(h)(3) prescribes two&para;<br>forms of relief: “[T]he alien’s petition shall automatically&para;<br>be converted to the appropriate category and the alien&para;<br>shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt&para;<br>of the original petition.” We have held that when a statute&para;<br>provides two forms of relief in this manner, joined by the&para;<br>conjunction “and,” the two remedies are “distinct.” United&para;<br>States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241–&para;<br>242 (1989). That understanding makes particular sense&para;<br>here, where Congress used the mandatory word “shall”&para;<br>twice, once before each form of relief. See Lexecon Inc. v.&para;<br>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 35&para;<br>(1998) (“[T]he mandatory [term] ‘shall’ . . . normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion”).&para;<br>Moreover, the two “shall” commands operate on different&para;<br>subjects, further reinforcing that they prescribe distinct&para;<br>remedies: An aged-out “alien’s petition shall automatically&para;<br>be converted,” but it is “the alien” herself who, in all&para;<br>events, “shall retain” her original priority date.&para;<br>§1153(h)(3) (emphasis added).&para;<br>The plurality responds with a series of examples in&para;<br>which the word “and” is used to join two commands, one of&para;<br>which is—as the plurality asserts here—dependent on&para;<br>another. Ante, at 28, and n. 15. But as the plurality&para;<br>recognizes, ante, at 28, that is hardly the only way the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>word can be used. For example: “If today’s baseball game&para;<br>is rained out, your ticket shall automatically be converted&para;<br>to a ticket for next Saturday’s game, and you shall retain&para;<br>your free souvenir from today’s game.” Or: “If you provide&para;<br>the DMV with proof of your new address, your voter registration shall automatically be converted to the correct&para;<br>polling location, and you shall receive in the mail an updated driver’s license.” It is plain in both of these examples that the two commands are distinct—the fan in the&para;<br>first example can keep her free souvenir even if she cannot&para;<br>attend next Saturday’s game; the new resident will receive&para;<br>an updated driver’s license even if she is ineligible to vote.&para;<br>What the plurality does not explain is why we should forgo&para;<br>the same understanding of §1153(h)(3)’s relief clause when&para;<br>that would treat the statute as a coherent whole (and&para;<br>when the plurality’s alternative interpretation would&para;<br>render the statute a walking self-contradiction within the&para;<br>span of a few words).&para;<br>With the text unavailing, the plurality turns to a policy&para;<br>argument. The plurality worries that if automatic conversion and priority date retention are independent benefits,&para;<br>aged-out beneficiaries will be able to “hold on to a priority&para;<br>date for years . . . while waiting for a relative to file a new&para;<br>petition,” which might hamper U. S. Citizenship and&para;<br>Immigration Services (USCIS) operations. Ante, at 29–30.&para;<br>But the plurality’s fears of administrative inconvenience&para;<br>are belied by the fact that USCIS has administered priority date retention in exactly this manner for years, with no&para;<br>apparent problems. Well before §1153(h)(3) was enacted,&para;<br>a regulation provided aged-out F2A derivative beneficiaries the ability to retain their priority dates without also&para;<br>providing automatic conversion. See 8 CFR §204.2(a)(4)&para;<br>(permitting priority date retention after a “separate petition” is filed); 57 Fed. Reg. 41053, 41059 (1992) (adopting&para;<br>this provision). Indeed, the USCIS continues to instruct&para;<br>field officers that a “separate petition” must be filed in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The notion that it is somehow impossible for an&para;<br>immigrant to retain her priority date contingent upon the&para;<br>filing of a separate petition is therefore contradicted by&para;<br>years of agency experience.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>plurality does not dispute that USCIS has administered priority&para;<br>date retention as a form of relief independent from automatic conversion for years. Ante, at 30, n. 16. It nonetheless argues that the same&para;<br>approach is impermissible here for the counterintuitive reason that a&para;<br>pre-existing regulation used express language limiting priority date&para;<br>retention to derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions alone. See ante, at&para;<br>30, n. 16 (noting that 8 CFR §204.2(a)(4) permitted an aged-out beneficiary to retain her priority date “ ‘if the subsequent petition is filed by&para;<br>the same petitioner’ ”). Congress included no such language to limit the&para;<br>scope of priority date retention in 8 U. S. C. §1153(h)(3), however,&para;<br>which just reinforces what the eligibility clause already makes clear:&para;<br>Priority date retention is independently available for aged-out derivative beneficiaries of all family-preference petitions, not just F2A&para;<br>petitions.&para;<br>The plurality also fails to account for the numerous other contexts in&para;<br>which USCIS has administered priority date retention as a benefit&para;<br>distinct from automatic conversion. See, e.g., §1154(k)(3) (providing&para;<br>priority date retention to unmarried adult children of LPRs whose&para;<br>parents become naturalized citizens “[r]egardless of whether a petition&para;<br>is converted”); 8 CFR §204.5(e) (“A petition approved on behalf of an&para;<br>alien under [the employment-based immigration provisions of §1153(b)]&para;<br>accords the alien the priority date of the approved petition for any&para;<br>subsequently filed [employment] petition”); §204.12(f)(1) (a “physician&para;<br>beneficiary” who finds a “new employer [who] desir[es] to petition&para;<br>[USCIS] on the physician’s behalf” must submit a new petition, but&para;<br>“will retain the priority date from the initial” petition). Finally, the&para;<br>plurality suggests that priority date retention can operate independently&para;<br>of automatic conversion only if the date to be retained is attached to&para;<br>a valid petition. Ante, at 30, and n. 16. But that cannot be squared with&para;<br>USCIS’s longstanding practice of allowing F2A beneficiaries to retain&para;<br>the priority dates from their no-longer valid petitions upon the filing of&para;<br>a new petition.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v.

Ante, at 28. Yet fatally absent from the plurality’s discussion of context is any mention of the first&para;<br>clause of the very same provision, which, as the plurality&para;<br>admits, unambiguously confers relief upon all five categories of aged-out children. That clause is dispositive, because—assuming that F2A beneficiaries alone can receive&para;<br>automatic conversion—a reading that treats automatic&para;<br>conversion and priority date retention as independent&para;<br>benefits is the only one that would “produc[e] a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.”&para;<br>United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest&para;<br>Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988); see also Home&para;<br>Builders, 551 U.

See Burrage v.&para;<br>United States, 571 U.

The ordinary&para;<br>meaning of “convert” is “to change (something) into a&para;<br>different form.” Id., at 444. Here, the statute specifies the&para;<br>form into which an aged-out child’s petition shall be&para;<br>changed: another petition in the “appropriate category.”&para;<br>§1153(h)(3). Tying the terms together, then, “automatic&para;<br>conversion” means changing an old petition into a new&para;<br>petition in an appropriate category upon the occurrence&para;<br>of some predicate event, without a further decision or&para;<br>contingency.&para;<br>All aged-out beneficiaries can have their petitions automatically converted under this definition. Perhaps most&para;<br>sensibly, all five categories of petitions may be converted&para;<br>to an appropriate category, without any further decision or&para;<br>contingency, upon a logical predicate event: when USCIS&para;<br>receives confirmation that an appropriate category exists.&para;<br>To see how this would work, recall the case of Norma Uy,&para;<br>and her daughter, Ruth. Norma was the principal beneficiary of an F4 petition filed by her U.

Thus, once Norma provides confirmation&para;<br>of that eligibility to sponsor Ruth (i.e., that she is an LPR,&para;<br>that Ruth is her daughter, and that she has not committed&para;<br>disqualifying criminal conduct, see ante, at 4), Ruth’s&para;<br>original F4 petition can automatically be converted to an&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>F2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency.5&para;<br>Indeed, this is how USCIS already applies automatic&para;<br>conversion in other contexts. For example, when an LPR&para;<br>has filed an F2A petition on behalf of a spouse or child,&para;<br>and the LPR subsequently becomes a U. S. citizen, a provision entitled “[a]utomatic conversion of preference classification,” 8 CFR §204.2(i), permits the F2A petition to be&para;<br>automatically converted to an “immediate relative” petition, §204.2(i)(3). See ante, at 16. Significantly, the predicate event that triggers this conversion is the agency’s&para;<br>receipt of proof that the petition’s sponsor has become a&para;<br>U. S. citizen—proof, in other words, that there is an appropriate category into which the petition can be converted.6&para;<br>Section 1153(h)(3)’s automatic conversion remedy can&para;<br>sensibly be administered in the same way.&para;<br>The plurality’s contrary conclusion that automatic&para;<br>conversion is impossible for all but one category of familypreference petitions hinges on three basic misunderstand——————&para;<br>5 Of&para;<br>&para;<br>course, just like any other beneficiary of a family visa petition,&para;<br>one whose petition has been automatically converted must still satisfy&para;<br>the requirements for actually obtaining a visa. See ante, at 5. For&para;<br>example, all visa applicants must attach an “affidavit of support” from&para;<br>their sponsors. 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(4)(C)(ii). As is true for any other&para;<br>beneficiary, nothing stops a sponsor from declining to swear their&para;<br>support for the beneficiary of an automatically converted petition after&para;<br>a visa has become available. Converting petitions upon proof of an&para;<br>appropriate category therefore produces no uncertainties or contingencies that do not already exist for all family visa applicants to begin&para;<br>with.&para;<br>6 See Dept. of State, If You Were an LPR and Are Now a U.

The regulation cited by the plurality, 8 CFR&para;<br>§204.2(i), is not to the contrary; it merely establishes that when an&para;<br>automatic conversion occurs, it shall be treated as “[e]ffective upon the&para;<br>date of naturalization,” §204.2(i)(3). As the State Department’s instructions make clear, the conversion itself takes place after the new citizen&para;<br>“send[s] proof of [her] U.

First, the plurality contends that automatic conversion is triggered not by confirmation of the existence of an&para;<br>appropriate category, but rather by a different predicate&para;<br>event: the moment when “ ‘an immigrant visa number&para;<br>bec[omes] available for the alien’s parent.’ ” Ante, at 19.&para;<br>This is a curious argument, not least because nothing in&para;<br>§1153(h)(3) suggests it. That provision simply makes&para;<br>automatic conversion available “[i]f the age of an alien is&para;<br>determined” to be “be 21 years of age or older” for purposes of §1153(d). Section 1153(h)(3) thus states the&para;<br>condition that an immigrant must satisfy to be eligible for&para;<br>automatic conversion, but it nowhere commands when the&para;<br>conversion should occur. There is no reason why conversion cannot occur at the logical point just described: the&para;<br>moment when USCIS receives proof that an appropriate&para;<br>category exists.&para;<br>The plurality acknowledges that §1153(h)(3) “does not&para;<br>explicitly identify th[e] point in time” at which a “petition&para;<br>is to be ‘converted.’ ” Ante, at 18. It nevertheless suggests&para;<br>that the date when a conversion occurs “is best viewed” as&para;<br>the date when a visa became available for the aged-out&para;<br>child’s parent. Ante, at 19. But Congress could not have&para;<br>intended conversion to occur at that point for a glaring&para;<br>reason: The date on which a visa becomes available for an&para;<br>aged-out child’s parent occurs before the point at which&para;<br>the child is determined to have aged-out under §1153(d)—&para;<br>the very requirement §1153(h)(3) prescribes for the agedout child to be eligible for automatic conversion in the first&para;<br>place. As the plurality explains, ante, at 5–6, such age&para;<br>determinations occur when an immigration official reviews the child’s derivative visa application, which invariably happens after a visa became available for the child’s&para;<br>parent as the principal beneficiary. At best, then, the&para;<br>plurality’s interpretation requires USCIS to convert petitions at a time when it does not know which petitions are&para;<br>eligible for conversion; at worst, it requires the automatic&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>conversion of petitions benefiting immigrants who will&para;<br>never even qualify for such relief (i.e., aged-out immigrants who, for any number of reasons, never file a visa&para;<br>application and so are never determined by officials to be&para;<br>older than 21).&para;<br>Faced with this fact, the plurality falls back to the position that automatic conversion must merely be viewed as&para;<br>having occurred “as of th[e] . . . date” when a parent’s visa&para;<br>becomes available, although the actual “assess[ment]” of&para;<br>the conversion will necessarily occur at some future point&para;<br>in time. Ante, at 24, n. 13. That approach, however,&para;<br>introduces precisely the kind of “additional decisions,&para;<br>contingencies, and delays” that the plurality regards as&para;<br>inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of “automatic,”&para;<br>ante, at 15. For even under the plurality’s view, automatic&para;<br>conversion cannot actually be “assesse[d]” until and unless&para;<br>the aged-out child decides to apply for a visa and officials&para;<br>assessing the child’s application deem her to have aged out&para;<br>(events which may themselves be contingent on the child’s&para;<br>parent first filing her own successful visa application, see&para;<br>ante, at 6). The far simpler approach is for conversion to&para;<br>occur automatically upon the most logical moment suggested by the statute: the moment when USCIS confirms&para;<br>that an “appropriate category” exists, §1153(h)(3). Indeed,&para;<br>the plurality fails to explain why this cannot be the proper&para;<br>predicate; it simply dismisses such an approach as supported “only” by “a single-minded resolve . . . to grant&para;<br>relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.” Ante, at 25,&para;<br>n. 13. But that criticism is revealing: The “single-minded&para;<br>resolve” the plurality maligns is Congress’ own, for it is&para;<br>Congress that expressly provided, in the eligibility clause,&para;<br>for aged-out beneficiaries in all five categories to be granted&para;<br>relief.&para;<br>The plurality’s second argument is a corollary of its&para;<br>first. If automatic conversion must occur when a visa first&para;<br>becomes available for a parent, the plurality frets, that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>will mean an aged-out child will have her petition automatically converted before immigration officials can ascertain whether her parent is even qualified to sponsor her.&para;<br>See ante, at 17–18. True enough, but that only confirms&para;<br>that it makes no sense to force USCIS to convert petitions&para;<br>so prematurely. The plurality’s fears can all be averted by&para;<br>having automatic conversion occur, as with petitions&para;<br>sponsored by LPRs who later become U. S. citizens, supra,&para;<br>at 13–15, when USCIS receives confirmation that conversion is appropriate.7&para;<br>The plurality’s final argument is that something about&para;<br>the term “conversion” precludes relief for all but the agedout derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. The plurality&para;<br>accepts that “conversion” will always require changing&para;<br>some aspects of a petition, including its preference category&para;<br>(e.g., from F2A to F2B) and the identity of its principal&para;<br>beneficiary (e.g., from an aged-out child’s parent to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The plurality is unsatisfied with this approach to automatic conversion on the theory that, in order to eliminate all additional “decisions,&para;<br>contingencies, or delays” in the process, this solution postpones the&para;<br>moment of “conversion” until the necessary contingencies are satisfied.&para;<br>Yet the plurality’s approach does the same thing, because even on its&para;<br>account, some “decisions, contingencies, or delays” must occur before&para;<br>conversion can actually be assessed by immigration officials (i.e., a&para;<br>parent’s visa must become available, the child must apply for a visa,&para;<br>and immigration officials must deem her to have aged out, see supra, at&para;<br>16). So the only question is whether the “conversion” should be considered to occur after all “decisions, contingencies, or delays” are in the&para;<br>past such that there is an appropriate category for conversion, or after&para;<br>only some. The former understanding would allow the unambiguous&para;<br>language of the eligibility clause to be carried into effect; the latter&para;<br>would preclude relief for four categories of derivative beneficiaries. In&para;<br>support of its restrictive interpretation, the plurality offers only the&para;<br>argument that converting a petition upon proof of an appropriate&para;<br>category would require the “filing of a new document. . . that shows the&para;<br>parent’s eligibility to sponsor her aged-out [child].” Ante, at 26, n. 14.&para;<br>The fact that a statute may require an agency to process a form is not a&para;<br>reason to disregard a coherent reading of a statute in favor of a selfcontradictory one.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>child). But the plurality asserts that a related kind of&para;<br>change is entirely off the table: a change to the identity of&para;<br>the petition’s sponsor. Ante, at 15. If a converted petition&para;<br>requires a different sponsor than the original petition, the&para;<br>plurality suggests, then it cannot be “converted” at all.&para;<br>The plurality points to nothing in the plain meaning of&para;<br>“conversion” that supports this distinction. It instead&para;<br>argues that a “conversion” cannot entail a change to the&para;<br>identity of a petition’s sponsor because that is “the exclusive way immigration law used the term when Congress&para;<br>enacted the CSPA.” Ante, at 16. But immigration law has&para;<br>long allowed petitions to be converted from one category to&para;<br>another in contexts where doing so requires changing the&para;<br>sponsor’s identity. In 2006, for example, the Secretary of&para;<br>Homeland Security promulgated a regulatory provision&para;<br>entitled “automatic conversion of preference classification,” 8 CFR §204.2(i)(1)(iv), which allows the automatic&para;<br>conversion of a petition filed by a U. S. citizen on behalf of&para;<br>her spouse to a widower petition if the citizen dies before&para;<br>the petition is approved. That conversion requires changing the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself.&para;<br>The fact that the agency used the word “conversion” to&para;<br>refer to a process in which the petition’s sponsor was&para;<br>changed, just a few years after 8 U. S. C. §1153(h)(3) was&para;<br>enacted, strongly suggests that the term did not have the&para;<br>exclusive meaning that the plurality suggests. Similarly,&para;<br>§1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III), a provision enacted two years before&para;<br>§1153(h)(3), see Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522, provides that a petition filed by a battered spouse on behalf of her child “shall&para;<br>be considered” a self-petition filed by the child herself if&para;<br>the child ages out—a conversion that obviously requires&para;<br>changing the identity of the sponsor from the battered&para;<br>spouse to the aged-out child. And §1153(h)(4) confirms&para;<br>that such “self-petitioners” are entitled to §1153(h)(3)’s&para;<br>automatic conversion remedy. The plurality never ex-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>plains how it can be mandatory to “convert” the identity of&para;<br>the sponsors in these contexts yet impermissible to “convert” the sponsors of the petitions at issue here—an understanding that is especially implausible in light of Congress’ command that such petitions “shall automatically be&para;<br>converted to the appropriate category.” §1153(h)(3).8&para;<br>III&para;<br>The concurrence reaches the same result as the plurality does, but for a different reason. It begins by recognizing&para;<br>that §1153(h)(3)’s eligibility clause “states a condition”&para;<br>that is satisfied by aged-out “beneficiaries from any preference category.” Ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment). The concurrence thus acknowledges that the&para;<br>eligibility clause encompasses aged-out beneficiaries of&para;<br>family-preference petitions in the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and&para;<br>F4 categories.&para;<br>The concurrence nonetheless concludes that the BIA&para;<br>was free to exclude F1, F2B, F3, and F4 beneficiaries from&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Moreover, had Congress actually intended to permit relief only&para;<br>where a new petition has the same sponsor as the original petition, it&para;<br>had a ready model in the language of a pre-existing regulation. See 8&para;<br>CFR §204.2(a)(4) (conferring priority date retention on a derivative&para;<br>beneficiary only “if the subsequent petition is filed by the same petitioner”). If it had wanted to limit §1153(h)(3) to just the beneficiaries&para;<br>preferred by the BIA, “Congress could easily have said so.” Kucana v.&para;<br>Holder, 558 U. S. 233, 248 (2010).&para;<br>The plurality’s argument that a “conversion” cannot entail a change&para;<br>to a petition’s sponsor ultimately boils down to this: A “conversion”&para;<br>cannot include “any substantive alteration” to a petition, ante, at 15,&para;<br>except when it can. For example, a “conversion” can (indeed, must)&para;<br>entail changing a petition’s family-preference category and changing&para;<br>the petition’s principal beneficiary (from the aged-out child’s parent to&para;<br>the child herself). And the plurality concedes that in other contexts,&para;<br>conversion must entail changing the identity of a petition’s sponsor&para;<br>from the beneficiary’s qualifying relative to the beneficiary himself.&para;<br>Ante, at 16–17, n. 10. The plurality does not explain why the word&para;<br>“conversion” can encompass all of these other substantive alterations,&para;<br>but not a change to the identity of a petition’s sponsor in just this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the clear scope of the eligibility clause because of a perceived ambiguity as to which beneficiaries can receive&para;<br>“automatic conversion.” See ante, at 4 (“Congress did not&para;<br>speak clearly to which petitions can ‘automatically be&para;<br>converted’ ”). In other words, the concurrence concludes&para;<br>that it was reasonable for the agency to ignore the clear&para;<br>text of the eligibility clause because the phrase “automatic&para;<br>conversion” might be read in a manner that would benefit&para;<br>F2A beneficiaries alone.&para;<br>This is an unusual way to interpret a statute. The&para;<br>concurrence identifies no case in which we have deferred&para;<br>to an agency’s decision to use ambiguity in one portion of a&para;<br>statute as a license to ignore another statutory provision&para;<br>that is perfectly clear. To the contrary, “[a] provision that&para;<br>may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the&para;<br>remainder of the statutory scheme . . . because only one of&para;<br>the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect&para;<br>that is compatible with the rest of the law.” United Sav.&para;<br>Assn. of Tex., 484 U. S., at 371.&para;<br>The concurrence justifies its conclusion only by treating&para;<br>the eligibility clause as a nullity. The concurrence is quite&para;<br>candid about its approach, arguing that §1153(h)(3)’s relief&para;<br>clause is its “only operative provision” and that the eligibility clause does not “grant anything to anyone.” Ante, at&para;<br>3. Yet “[i]t is our duty ‘to give effect, if possible, to every&para;<br>clause and word of a statute.’ ” United States v. Menasche,&para;<br>348 U. S. 528, 538–539 (1955). And there is an easy way&para;<br>to give meaning to the eligibility clause: The clause identifies who is entitled to the benefits specified in the ensuing&para;<br>relief clause.&para;<br>The concurrence relies ultimately on an irrelevant&para;<br>hypothetical: “If a student is determined to be enrolled at&para;<br>an accredited university, the student’s cost of off-campus&para;<br>housing shall be deductible on her tax return.” Ante, at 3.&para;<br>In this example, the concurrence points out, it is “apparent. . . that an enrolled student who lives on campus is not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>entitled to the deduction, even though the student falls&para;<br>within the conditional first clause.” Ibid. That is correct,&para;<br>but it says nothing about this case. For in the hypothetical, it is plain that the promised relief (a tax deduction for&para;<br>off-campus housing) cannot apply to the persons at issue&para;<br>(students who live on campus). Here, however, the relief&para;<br>promised in §1153(h)(3) (priority date retention and automatic conversion) can be given to persons specified in&para;<br>the initial eligibility clause (aged-out children in all five&para;<br>family-preference categories). See supra, at 9–19. And&para;<br>once one recognizes that aged-out children in each category unambiguously covered by the eligibility clause can&para;<br>receive relief, the BIA’s view that no children in four of&para;<br>those categories can ever receive any relief cannot be&para;<br>reasonable.9&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Congress faced a difficult choice when it enacted&para;<br>§1153(h)(3). Given the “zero-sum world of allocating a&para;<br>limited number of visas,” ante, at 33, Congress could have&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 More&para;<br>&para;<br>fundamentally, the concurrence’s hypothetical is irrelevant&para;<br>because it altogether ignores a critical feature of the statute before us:&para;<br>§1153(h)(2)’s express enumeration of the covered petitions to include&para;<br>petitions filed within the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 preference categories. See supra, at 5–6. A proper analogy would therefore be a provision that says the following: “If a student is determined to be enrolled&para;<br>at an accredited junior college, community college, or 4-year college, the&para;<br>student’s room and board shall be tax-deductible and the student shall&para;<br>receive financial aid.” Is there any permissible reading of this provision&para;<br>under which, although expressly covered in the eligibility clause, all&para;<br>junior and community college students are categorically forbidden to&para;<br>receive both the tax deduction and financial aid? Of course not. And&para;<br>that would be true even if the term “room and board” were ambiguous&para;<br>and thus open to an interpretation under which only 4-year students&para;<br>could receive the tax deduction. Likewise here, where F1, F2B, F3, and&para;<br>F4 derivative beneficiaries may not be categorically excluded from relief&para;<br>because they are indisputably covered by §1153(h)(3)’s eligibility clause&para;<br>and able to receive the relief described in the relief clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SCIALABBA v.

Whatever one might&para;<br>think of the policy arguments on each side, however, this&para;<br>much is clear: Congress made a choice.

Here, there are&para;<br>straightforward interpretations of §1153(h)(3) that allow it&para;<br>to function as a coherent whole.
