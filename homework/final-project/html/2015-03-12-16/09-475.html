Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. ET AL. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–475.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 27, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>The Plant Protection Act (PPA) provides that the Secretary of the De&para;<br>partment of Agriculture may issue regulations “to prevent the intro&para;<br>duction of plant pests into the United States or the dissemination of&para;<br>plant pests within the United States.” 7 U. S. C. §7711(a). Pursuant&para;<br>to that grant of authority, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection&para;<br>Service (APHIS) promulgated regulations that presume genetically&para;<br>engineered plants to be “plant pests”—and thus “regulated articles”&para;<br>under the PPA—until APHIS determines otherwise. However, any&para;<br>person may petition APHIS for a determination that a regulated arti&para;<br>cle does not present a plant pest risk and therefore should not be sub&para;<br>ject to the applicable regulations. APHIS may grant such a petition&para;<br>in whole or in part.&para;<br>In determining whether to grant nonregulated status to a geneti&para;<br>cally engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply with the Na&para;<br>tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires fed&para;<br>eral agencies “to the fullest extent possible” to prepare a detailed&para;<br>environmental impact statement (EIS) for “every . . . major Federal&para;<br>actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environ&para;<br>ment.” 42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C). The agency need not complete an&para;<br>EIS if it finds, based on a shorter statement known as an environ&para;<br>mental assessment (EA), that the proposed action will not have a&para;<br>significant environmental impact.&para;<br>This case involves a challenge to APHIS’s decision to approve the&para;<br>unconditional deregulation of Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a vari&para;<br>ety of alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to tolerate the her&para;<br>bicide Roundup. Petitioners are the owner and the licensee of the in&para;<br>tellectual property rights to RRA. In response to petitioners’&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>deregulation request, APHIS prepared a draft EA and solicited public&para;<br>comments on its proposed course of action. Based on its EA and the&para;<br>comments submitted, the agency determined that the introduction of&para;<br>RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environ&para;<br>ment. Accordingly, APHIS decided to deregulate RRA uncondition&para;<br>ally and without preparing an EIS. Respondents, conventional al&para;<br>falfa growers and environmental groups, filed this action challenging&para;<br>that decision on the ground that it violated NEPA and other federal&para;<br>laws. The District Court held, inter alia, that APHIS violated NEPA&para;<br>when it deregulated RRA without first completing a detailed EIS. To&para;<br>remedy that violation, the court vacated the agency’s decision com&para;<br>pletely deregulating RRA; enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA,&para;<br>in whole or in part, pending completion of the EIS; and entered a na&para;<br>tionwide permanent injunction prohibiting almost all future planting&para;<br>of RRA during the pendency of the EIS process. Petitioners and the&para;<br>Government appealed, challenging the scope of the relief granted but&para;<br>not disputing that APHIS’s deregulation decision violated NEPA.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, among other things, that the&para;<br>District Court had not abused its discretion in rejecting APHIS’s pro&para;<br>posed mitigation measures in favor of a broader injunction.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Respondents have standing to seek injunctive relief, and peti&para;<br>tioners have standing to seek this Court’s review of the Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit’s judgment affirming the entry of such relief. Pp. 7–14.&para;<br>(a) Petitioners have constitutional standing to seek review here.&para;<br>Article III standing requires an injury that is (i) concrete, particular&para;<br>ized, and actual or imminent, (ii) fairly traceable to the challenged&para;<br>action, and (iii) redressable by a favorable ruling. See Horne v. Flo&para;<br>res, 557 U. S. ___, ___. Petitioners satisfy all three criteria. Petition&para;<br>ers are injured by their inability to sell or license RRA to prospective&para;<br>customers until APHIS completes the EIS. Because that injury is&para;<br>caused by the very remedial order that petitioners challenge on ap&para;<br>peal, it would be redressed by a favorable ruling from this Court. Re&para;<br>spondents nevertheless contend that petitioners lack standing be&para;<br>cause their complained-of injury is independently caused by a part of&para;<br>the District Court’s order that petitioners failed to challenge, the va&para;<br>catur of APHIS’s deregulation decision. That argument fails for two&para;<br>independent reasons. First, one of the main disputes between the&para;<br>parties throughout this litigation has been whether the District&para;<br>Court should have adopted APHIS’s proposed judgment, which would&para;<br>have replaced the vacated deregulation decision with an order ex&para;<br>pressly authorizing the continued sale and planting of RRA. Accord&para;<br>ingly, if the District Court had adopted APHIS’s proposed judgment,&para;<br>there would still be authority for the continued sale of RRA notwith&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>standing the District Court’s vacatur, because there would, in effect,&para;<br>be a new deregulation decision. Second, petitioners in any case have&para;<br>standing to challenge the part of the District Court’s order enjoining&para;<br>a partial deregulation. Respondents focus their argument on the part&para;<br>of the judgment that enjoins planting, but the judgment also states&para;<br>that before granting the deregulation petition, even in part, the&para;<br>agency must prepare an EIS. That part of the judgment inflicts an&para;<br>injury not also caused by the vacatur. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>(b) Respondents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive&para;<br>relief from the complete deregulation order at issue here. The Court&para;<br>disagrees with petitioners’ argument that respondents have failed to&para;<br>show that any of them is likely to suffer a constitutionally cognizable&para;<br>injury absent injunctive relief. The District Court found that respon&para;<br>dent farmers had established a reasonable probability that their con&para;<br>ventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered&para;<br>Roundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated. A sub&para;<br>stantial risk of such gene flow injures respondents in several ways&para;<br>that are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the&para;<br>constitutional standing analysis. Moreover, those harms are readily&para;<br>attributable to APHIS’s deregulation decision, which gives rise to a&para;<br>significant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered alfalfa va&para;<br>rieties. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting the planting or deregula&para;<br>tion of all or some genetically engineered alfalfa would redress re&para;<br>spondents’ injuries by eliminating or minimizing the risk of gene flow&para;<br>to their crops. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>2. The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from&para;<br>effecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of&para;<br>RRA pending the agency’s completion of its detailed environmental&para;<br>review. Pp. 14–22.&para;<br>(a) Because petitioners and the Government do not argue other&para;<br>wise, the Court assumes without deciding that the District Court&para;<br>acted lawfully in vacating the agency’s decision to completely deregu&para;<br>late RRA. The Court therefore addresses only the injunction prohib&para;<br>iting APHIS from deregulating RRA pending completion of the EIS,&para;<br>and the nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all RRA planting&para;<br>during the pendency of the EIS process. P. 14.&para;<br>(b) Before a court may grant a permanent injunction, the plain&para;<br>tiff must satisfy a four-factor test, demonstrating: “(1) that it has suf&para;<br>fered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such&para;<br>as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury;&para;<br>(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff&para;<br>and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the pub&para;<br>lic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay&para;<br>Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391. This test fully ap&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>plies in NEPA cases. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Coun&para;<br>cil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___. Thus, the existence of a NEPA violation&para;<br>does not create a presumption that injunctive relief is available and&para;<br>should be granted absent unusual circumstances. Pp. 15–16.&para;<br>(c) None of the four factors supports the District Court’s order en&para;<br>joining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during the pendency&para;<br>of the EIS process. Most importantly, respondents cannot show that&para;<br>they will suffer irreparable injury if APHIS is allowed to proceed with&para;<br>any partial deregulation, for at least two reasons. First, if and when&para;<br>APHIS pursues a partial deregulation that arguably runs afoul of&para;<br>NEPA, respondents may file a new suit challenging such action and&para;<br>seeking appropriate preliminary relief. Accordingly, a permanent in&para;<br>junction is not now needed to guard against any present or imminent&para;<br>risk of likely irreparable harm. Second, a partial deregulation need&para;<br>not cause respondents any injury at all; if its scope is sufficiently lim&para;<br>ited, the risk of gene flow could be virtually nonexistent. Indeed, the&para;<br>broad injunction entered below essentially pre-empts the very proce&para;<br>dure by which APHIS could determine, independently of the pending&para;<br>EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregulation, that&para;<br>a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of envi&para;<br>ronmental harm. Pp. 16–23.&para;<br>(d) The District Court also erred in entering the nationwide in&para;<br>junction against planting RRA, for two independent reasons. First,&para;<br>because it was inappropriate for the District Court to foreclose even&para;<br>the possibility of a partial and temporary deregulation, it follows that&para;<br>it was inappropriate to enjoin planting in accordance with such a de&para;<br>regulation decision. Second, an injunction is a drastic and extraordi&para;<br>nary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. See,&para;<br>e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312. If, as respon&para;<br>dents now concede, a less drastic remedy (such as partial or complete&para;<br>vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision) was sufficient to redress&para;<br>their injury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of&para;<br>an injunction was warranted. Pp. 23–24.&para;<br>(e) Given the District Court’s errors, this Court need not address&para;<br>whether injunctive relief of some kind was available to respondents&para;<br>on the record below.

The District&para;<br>Court held that APHIS violated the National Environ­&para;<br>mental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §4321 et seq., by issuing its deregulation deci­&para;<br>sion without first completing a detailed assessment of&para;<br>the environmental consequences of its proposed course of&para;<br>action. To remedy that violation, the District Court&para;<br>vacated the agency’s decision completely deregulating&para;<br>the alfalfa variety in question; ordered APHIS not to act&para;<br>on the deregulation petition in whole or in part until it&para;<br>had completed a detailed environmental review; and&para;<br>enjoined almost all future planting of the genetically&para;<br>engineered alfalfa pending the completion of that review.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s entry&para;<br>of permanent injunctive relief. The main issue now in&para;<br>dispute concerns the breadth of that relief. For the&para;<br>reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for&para;<br>further proceedings.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Plant Protection Act (PPA), 114 Stat. 438, 7 U. S. C.&para;<br>§7701 et seq., provides that the Secretary of the Depart­&para;<br>ment of Agriculture (USDA) may issue regulations “to&para;<br>prevent the introduction of plant pests into the United&para;<br>States or the dissemination of plant pests within the&para;<br>United States.” §7711(a). The Secretary has delegated&para;<br>that authority to APHIS, a division of the USDA. 7 CFR&para;<br>§§2.22(a), 2.80(a)(36) (2010). Acting pursuant to that&para;<br>delegation, APHIS has promulgated regulations governing&para;<br>“the introduction of organisms and products altered or&para;<br>produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests&para;<br>or are believed to be plant pests.” See §340.0(a)(2) and&para;<br>n. 1. Under those regulations, certain genetically engi­&para;<br>neered plants are presumed to be “plant pests”—and thus&para;<br>“regulated articles” under the PPA—until APHIS deter­&para;<br>mines otherwise. See ibid.; §§340.1, 340.2, 340.6; see also&para;<br>App. 183. However, any person may petition APHIS for a&para;<br>determination that a regulated article does not present a&para;<br>plant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the&para;<br>applicable regulations. 7 U. S. C. §7711(c)(2); 7 CFR&para;<br>§340.6. APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in&para;<br>part. §340.6(d)(3).&para;<br>In deciding whether to grant nonregulated status to a&para;<br>genetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply&para;<br>with NEPA, which requires federal agencies “to the fullest&para;<br>extent possible” to prepare an environmental impact&para;<br>statement (EIS) for “every recommendation or report on&para;<br>proposals for legislation and other major Federal actio[n]&para;<br>significantly affecting the quality of the human environ­&para;<br>ment.”&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C).&para;<br>The statutory text&para;<br>“speaks solely in terms of proposed actions; it does not&para;<br>require an agency to consider the possible environmental&para;<br>impacts of less imminent actions when preparing the&para;<br>impact statement on proposed actions.” Kleppe v.

Even if a particular agency&para;<br>proposal requires an EIS, applicable regulations allow the&para;<br>agency to take at least some action in furtherance of that&para;<br>proposal while the EIS is being prepared. See §1506.1(a)&para;<br>(“no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which&para;<br>would: (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or (2)&para;<br>Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives”); §1506.1(c)&para;<br>(“While work on a required program environmental impact&para;<br>statement is in progress and the action is not covered by&para;<br>an existing program statement, agencies shall not under­&para;<br>take in the interim any major Federal action covered by&para;<br>the program which may significantly affect the quality of&para;<br>the human environment unless such action” satisfies&para;<br>certain requirements).&para;<br>B&para;<br>This case involves Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a kind&para;<br>of alfalfa crop that has been genetically engineered to be&para;<br>tolerant of glyphosate, the active ingredient of the herbi­&para;<br>cide Roundup. Petitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto)&para;<br>owns the intellectual property rights to RRA. Monsanto&para;<br>licenses those rights to co-petitioner Forage Genetics&para;<br>International (FGI), which is the exclusive developer of&para;<br>RRA seed.&para;<br>APHIS initially classified RRA as a regulated article,&para;<br>but in 2004 petitioners sought nonregulated status for two&para;<br>strains of RRA. In response, APHIS prepared a draft EA&para;<br>assessing the likely environmental impact of the requested&para;<br>deregulation. It then published a notice in the Federal&para;<br>Register advising the public of the deregulation petition&para;<br>and soliciting public comments on its draft EA. After&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>considering the hundreds of public comments that it re­&para;<br>ceived, APHIS issued a Finding of No Significant Impact&para;<br>and decided to deregulate RRA unconditionally and with­&para;<br>out preparing an EIS. Prior to this decision, APHIS had&para;<br>authorized almost 300 field trials of RRA conducted over a&para;<br>period of eight years. App. 348.&para;<br>Approximately eight months after APHIS granted RRA&para;<br>nonregulated status, respondents (two conventional alfalfa&para;<br>seed farms and environmental groups concerned with food&para;<br>safety) filed this action against the Secretary of Agricul­&para;<br>ture and certain other officials in Federal District Court,&para;<br>challenging APHIS’s decision to completely deregulate&para;<br>RRA. Their complaint alleged violations of NEPA, the&para;<br>Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 884, 16&para;<br>U. S. C. §1531 et seq., and the PPA. Respondents did not&para;<br>seek preliminary injunctive relief pending resolution of&para;<br>those claims. Hence, RRA enjoyed nonregulated status for&para;<br>approximately two years. During that period, more than&para;<br>3,000 farmers in 48 States planted an estimated 220,000&para;<br>acres of RRA. App. 350.&para;<br>In resolving respondents’ NEPA claim, the District&para;<br>Court accepted APHIS’s determination that RRA does not&para;<br>have any harmful health effects on humans or livestock.&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; accord, id., at 45a. Neverthe­&para;<br>less, the District Court held that APHIS violated NEPA by&para;<br>deregulating RRA without first preparing an EIS. In&para;<br>particular, the court found that APHIS’s EA failed to&para;<br>answer substantial questions concerning two broad conse­&para;<br>quences of its proposed action: first, the extent to which&para;<br>complete deregulation would lead to the transmission of&para;<br>the gene conferring glyphosate tolerance from RRA to&para;<br>organic and conventional alfalfa; and, second, the extent to&para;<br>which the introduction of RRA would contribute to the&para;<br>development of Roundup-resistant weeds. Id., at 52a. In&para;<br>light of its determination that the deregulation decision&para;<br>ran afoul of NEPA, the District Court dismissed without&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The court then asked the parties to submit pro­&para;<br>posed judgments embodying their preferred means of&para;<br>remedying the NEPA violation. APHIS’s proposed judg­&para;<br>ment would have ordered the agency to prepare an EIS,&para;<br>vacated the agency’s deregulation decision, and replaced&para;<br>that decision with the terms of the judgment itself. Id., at&para;<br>184a (proposed judgment providing that “[the federal]&para;<br>defendants’ [June 14,] 2005 Determination of Nonregu­&para;<br>lated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered for Toler­&para;<br>ance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby vacated and&para;<br>replaced by the terms of this judgment” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>The terms of the proposed judgment, in turn, would have&para;<br>permitted the continued planting of RRA pending comple­&para;<br>tion of the EIS, subject to six restrictions. Those restric­&para;<br>tions included, among other things, mandatory isolation&para;<br>distances between RRA and non-genetically-engineered&para;<br>alfalfa fields in order to mitigate the risk of gene flow;&para;<br>mandatory harvesting conditions; a requirement that&para;<br>planting and harvesting equipment that had been in&para;<br>contact with RRA be cleaned prior to any use with conven­&para;<br>tional or organic alfalfa; identification and handling re­&para;<br>quirements for RRA seed; and a requirement that all RRA&para;<br>seed producers and hay growers be under contract with&para;<br>either Monsanto or FGI and that their contracts require&para;<br>compliance with the other limitations set out in the pro­&para;<br>posed judgment.&para;<br>The District Court rejected APHIS’s proposed judgment.&para;<br>In its preliminary injunction, the District Court prohibited&para;<br>almost all future planting of RRA pending APHIS’s com­&para;<br>pletion of the required EIS.

Based on its review of the record, the panel first&para;<br>concluded that the District Court had “recognized that an&para;<br>injunction does not ‘automatically issue’ when a NEPA&para;<br>violation is found” and had instead based its issuance of&para;<br>injunctive relief on the four-factor test traditionally used&para;<br>for that purpose. Id., at 1137. The panel held that the&para;<br>District Court had not committed clear error in making&para;<br>any of the subsidiary factual findings on which its assess­&para;<br>ment of the four relevant factors was based. And the&para;<br>panel rejected the claim that the District Court had not&para;<br>given sufficient deference to APHIS’s expertise concerning&para;<br>the likely effects of allowing continued planting of RRA on&para;<br>a limited basis. In the panel’s view, APHIS’s proposed&para;<br>interim measures would have perpetuated a system that&para;<br>had been found by the District Court to have caused envi­&para;<br>ronmental harm in the past. Id., at 1139. Hence, the&para;<br>panel concluded that the District Court had not abused its&para;<br>discretion “in choosing to reject APHIS’s proposed mitiga­&para;<br>tion measures in favor of a broader injunction to prevent&para;<br>more irreparable harm from occurring.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dents contend, was to restore RRA to the status of a regu­&para;<br>lated article; and, subject to certain exceptions not appli­&para;<br>cable here, federal regulations ban the growth and sale of&para;<br>regulated articles. Because petitioners did not specifically&para;<br>challenge the District Court’s vacatur, respondents reason,&para;<br>they lack standing to challenge a part of the District&para;<br>Court’s order (i.e., the injunction) that does not cause&para;<br>petitioners any injury not also caused by the vacatur. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 19–20.&para;<br>Respondents’ argument fails for two independent rea­&para;<br>sons. First, although petitioners did not challenge the&para;<br>vacatur directly, they adequately preserved their objection&para;<br>that the vacated deregulation decision should have been&para;<br>replaced by APHIS’s proposed injunction. Throughout the&para;<br>remedial phase of this litigation, one of the main disputes&para;<br>between the parties has been whether the District Court&para;<br>was required to adopt APHIS’s proposed judgment. See,&para;<br>e.g., Intervenor-Appellants’ Opening Brief in No. 07–16458&para;<br>etc. (CA9), p. 59 (urging the Court of Appeals to “vacate&para;<br>the district court’s judgment and remand this case to the&para;<br>district court with instructions to enter APHIS’s proposed&para;<br>relief”); Opening Brief of Federal Defendants-Appellants&para;<br>in No. 16458 etc. (CA9), pp. 21, 46 (“The blanket injunc­&para;<br>tion should be narrowed in accordance with APHIS’s&para;<br>proposal”); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 25–27, 53–54. That&para;<br>judgment would have replaced the vacated deregulation&para;<br>decision with an order expressly allowing continued plant­&para;<br>ing of RRA subject to certain limited conditions. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 184a (proposed judgment providing that&para;<br>“[the federal] defendants’ 14 June 2005 Determination of&para;<br>Nonregulated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered&para;<br>for Tolerance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby va­&para;<br>cated and replaced by the terms of this judgment” (empha­&para;<br>sis added)). Accordingly, if the District Court had adopted&para;<br>the agency’s suggested remedy, there would still be au­&para;<br>thority for the continued planting of RRA, because there&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would, in effect, be a new deregulation decision.1&para;<br>Second, petitioners in any case have standing to chal­&para;<br>lenge the part of the District Court’s order enjoining par­&para;<br>tial deregulation. Respondents focus their standing ar­&para;<br>gument on the part of the judgment enjoining the planting&para;<br>of RRA, but the judgment also states that “[b]efore grant­&para;<br>ing Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even in part, the&para;<br>federal defendants shall prepare an environmental impact&para;<br>statement.” Id., at 108a (emphasis added); see also id., at&para;<br>79a (“The Court will enter a final judgment . . . ordering&para;<br>the government to prepare an EIS before it makes a deci­&para;<br>sion on Monsanto’s deregulation petition”). As respon­&para;<br>dents concede, that part of the judgment goes beyond the&para;<br>vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 37, 46.&para;<br>At oral argument, respondents contended that the re­&para;<br>triction on APHIS’s ability to effect a partial deregulation&para;<br>of RRA does not cause petitioners “an actual or an immi­&para;<br>nent harm.” Id., at 39–40. In order for a partial deregula­&para;<br>tion to occur, respondents argued, the case would have to&para;<br>be remanded to the agency, and APHIS would have to&para;<br>prepare an EA “that may or may not come out in favor of a&para;<br>partial deregulation.” Id., at 39. Because petitioners&para;<br>cannot prove that those two events would happen, respon­&para;<br>dents contended, the asserted harm caused by the District&para;<br>Court’s partial deregulation ban is too speculative to&para;<br>satisfy the actual or imminent injury requirement.&para;<br>We reject this argument. If the injunction were lifted,&para;<br>we do not see why the District Court would have to re­&para;<br>mand the matter to the agency in order for APHIS to&para;<br>effect a partial deregulation. And even if a remand were&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 We&para;<br>&para;<br>need not decide whether the District Court had the authority to&para;<br>replace the vacated agency order with an injunction of its own making.&para;<br>The question whether petitioners are entitled to the relief that they&para;<br>seek goes to the merits, not to standing.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>required, we perceive no basis on which the District Court&para;<br>could decline to remand the matter to the agency so that it&para;<br>could determine whether to pursue a partial deregulation&para;<br>during the pendency of the EIS process.&para;<br>Nor is any doubt as to whether APHIS would issue a&para;<br>new EA in favor of a partial deregulation sufficient to&para;<br>defeat petitioners’ standing. It is undisputed that peti­&para;<br>tioners have submitted a deregulation petition and that a&para;<br>partial deregulation of the kind embodied in the agency’s&para;<br>proposed judgment would afford petitioners much of the&para;<br>relief that they seek; it is also undisputed that, absent the&para;<br>District Court’s order, APHIS could attempt to effect such&para;<br>a partial deregulation pending its completion of the EIS.&para;<br>See id., at 7–8, 25–27, 38. For purposes of resolving the&para;<br>particular standing question before us, we need not decide&para;<br>whether or to what extent a party challenging an injunc­&para;<br>tion that bars an agency from granting certain relief must&para;<br>show that the agency would be likely to afford such relief&para;<br>if it were free to do so. In this case, as is clear from&para;<br>APHIS’s proposed judgment and from its briefing&para;<br>throughout the remedial phase of this litigation, the&para;<br>agency takes the view that a partial deregulation reflect­&para;<br>ing its proposed limitations is in the public interest. Thus,&para;<br>there is more than a strong likelihood that APHIS would&para;<br>partially deregulate RRA were it not for the District&para;<br>Court’s injunction. The District Court’s elimination of&para;<br>that likelihood is plainly sufficient to establish a constitu­&para;<br>tionally cognizable injury. Moreover, as respondents&para;<br>essentially conceded at oral argument, that injury would&para;<br>be redressed by a favorable decision here, since “vacating&para;<br>the current injunction . . . will allow [petitioners] to go&para;<br>back to the agency, [to] seek a partial deregulation,” even&para;<br>if the District Court’s vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation&para;<br>decision is left intact. Id., at 38. We therefore hold that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>petitioners have standing to seek this Court’s review.2&para;<br>B&para;<br>We next consider petitioners’ contention that respon­&para;<br>dents lack standing to seek injunctive relief. See Daim&para;<br>lerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (“[A]&para;<br>plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each&para;<br>form of relief sought” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Petitioners argue that respondents have failed to show&para;<br>that any of the named respondents is likely to suffer a&para;<br>constitutionally cognizable injury absent injunctive relief.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioners 40. We disagree.&para;<br>Respondents include conventional alfalfa farmers.&para;<br>Emphasizing “the undisputed concentration of alfalfa seed&para;<br>farms,” the District Court found that those farmers had&para;<br>“established a ‘reasonable probability’ that their organic&para;<br>and conventional alfalfa crops will be infected with the&para;<br>engineered gene” if RRA is completely deregulated. App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 50a.3 A substantial risk of gene flow&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 We do not rest “the primary basis for our jurisdiction on the premise&para;<br>that the District Court enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating&para;<br>RRA in any sense.” See post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Even if the&para;<br>District Court’s order prohibiting a partial deregulation applies only to&para;<br>“the particular partial deregulation order proposed to the court by&para;<br>APHIS,” see post, at 8, petitioners would still have standing to chal­&para;<br>lenge that aspect of the order.&para;<br>3At least one of the respondents in this case specifically alleges that&para;<br>he owns an alfalfa farm in a prominent seed-growing region and faces a&para;<br>significant risk of contamination from RRA. See Record, Doc. 62, pp. 1–&para;<br>2; id., ¶10, at 3–4 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of Plan­&para;<br>tiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment) (“Since alfalfa is pollinated by&para;<br>honey, bumble and leafcutter bees, the genetic contamination of the&para;<br>Roundup Ready seed will rapidly spread through the seed growing&para;<br>regions. Bees have a range of at least two to ten miles, and the alfalfa&para;<br>seed farms are much more concentrated”). Other declarations in the&para;<br>record provide further support for the District Court’s conclusion that&para;<br>the deregulation of RRA poses a significant risk of contamination to&para;<br>respondents’ crops. See, e.g., id., Doc. 53, ¶9, at 2 (Declaration of Jim&para;<br>Munsch) (alleging risk of “significant contamination . . . due to the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>injures respondents in several ways. For example, re­&para;<br>spondents represent that, in order to continue marketing&para;<br>their product to consumers who wish to buy non­&para;<br>genetically-engineered alfalfa, respondents would have to&para;<br>conduct testing to find out whether and to what extent&para;<br>their crops have been contaminated. See, e.g., Record,&para;<br>Doc. 62, p. 5 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of&para;<br>Plantiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment) (hereinafter&para;<br>Geertson Declaration) (“Due to the high potential for&para;<br>contamination, I will need to test my crops for the pres­&para;<br>ence of genetically engineered alfalfa seed. This testing&para;<br>will be a new cost to my seed business and we will have to&para;<br>raise our seed prices to cover these costs, making our&para;<br>prices less competitive”); id., Doc. 57, p. 4 (Declaration of&para;<br>Patrick Trask in Support of Plantiff’s Motion for Summary&para;<br>Judgment) (“To ensure that my seeds are pure, I will need&para;<br>to test my crops and obtain certification that my seeds are&para;<br>free of genetically engineered alfalfa”); see also Record,&para;<br>Doc. 55, p. 2 (“There is zero tolerance for contaminated&para;<br>seed in the organic market”). Respondents also allege that&para;<br>the risk of gene flow will cause them to take certain meas­&para;<br>ures to minimize the likelihood of potential contamination&para;<br>and to ensure an adequate supply of non-genetically­&para;<br>engineered alfalfa. See, e.g., Geertson Declaration 3 (not­&para;<br>ing the “increased cost of alfalfa breeding due to potential&para;<br>for genetic contamination”); id., at 6 (“Due to the threat of&para;<br>contamination, I have begun contracting with growers&para;<br>outside of the United States to ensure that I can supply&para;<br>genetically pure, conventional alfalfa seed. Finding new&para;<br>growers has already resulted in increased administrative&para;<br>——————&para;<br>compact geographic area of the prime alfalfa seed producing areas and&para;<br>the fact that pollen is distributed by bees that have large natural range&para;<br>of activity”); App. ¶8, p. 401 (Declaration of Marc Asumendi) (“Roundup&para;<br>alfalfa seed fields are currently being planted in all the major alfalfa&para;<br>seed production areas with little regard to contamination to non-GMO&para;<br>seed production fields”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>costs at my seed business”).&para;<br>Such harms, which respondents will suffer even if their&para;<br>crops are not actually infected with the Roundup ready&para;<br>gene, are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact&para;<br>prong of the constitutional standing analysis. Those&para;<br>harms are readily attributable to APHIS’s deregulation&para;<br>decision, which, as the District Court found, gives rise to a&para;<br>significant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered&para;<br>varieties of alfalfa. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting&para;<br>the growth and sale of all or some genetically engineered&para;<br>alfalfa would remedy respondents’ injuries by eliminating&para;<br>or minimizing the risk of gene flow to conventional and&para;<br>organic alfalfa crops. We therefore conclude that respon­&para;<br>dents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief&para;<br>from the complete deregulation order at issue here.&para;<br>Petitioners appear to suggest that respondents fail to&para;<br>satisfy the “zone of interests” test we have previously&para;<br>articulated as a prudential standing requirement in cases&para;<br>challenging agency compliance with particular statutes.&para;<br>See Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (arguing that protection&para;<br>against the risk of commercial harm “is not an interest&para;<br>that NEPA was enacted to address”); Bennett v. Spear, 520&para;<br>U. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). That argument is unpersua­&para;<br>sive because, as the District Court found, respondents’&para;<br>injury has an environmental as well as an economic com­&para;<br>ponent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. In its ruling on the&para;<br>merits of respondents’ NEPA claim, the District Court&para;<br>held that the risk that the RRA gene conferring gly­&para;<br>phosate resistance will infect conventional and organic&para;<br>alfalfa is a significant environmental effect within the&para;<br>meaning of NEPA. Petitioners did not appeal that part of&para;<br>the court’s ruling, and we have no occasion to revisit it&para;<br>here. Respondents now seek injunctive relief in order to&para;<br>avert the risk of gene flow to their crops—the very same&para;<br>effect that the District Court determined to be a signifi­&para;<br>cant environmental concern for purposes of NEPA. The&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mere fact that respondents also seek to avoid certain&para;<br>economic harms that are tied to the risk of gene flow does&para;<br>not strip them of prudential standing.&para;<br>In short, respondents have standing to seek injunctive&para;<br>relief, and petitioners have standing to seek this Court’s&para;<br>review of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment affirming the entry&para;<br>of such relief. We therefore proceed to the merits of the&para;<br>case.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court sought to remedy APHIS’s NEPA&para;<br>violation in three ways: First, it vacated the agency’s&para;<br>decision completely deregulating RRA; second, it enjoined&para;<br>APHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pend­&para;<br>ing completion of the mandated EIS; and third, it entered&para;<br>a nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all future&para;<br>planting of RRA. Id., at 108a–110a. Because petitioners&para;<br>and the Government do not argue otherwise, we assume&para;<br>without deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in&para;<br>vacating the deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7&para;<br>(“[T]he district court could have vacated the order in its&para;<br>entirety and sent it back to the agency”); accord, id., at 15–&para;<br>16. We therefore address only the latter two aspects of the&para;<br>District Court’s judgment. Before doing so, however, we&para;<br>provide a brief overview of the standard governing the&para;<br>entry of injunctive relief.&para;<br>B&para;<br>“[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must&para;<br>satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such&para;<br>relief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suf­&para;<br>fered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at&para;<br>law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to com­&para;<br>pensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of&para;<br>hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest&para;<br>would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay&para;<br>Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391 (2006).&para;<br>The traditional four-factor test applies when a plaintiff&para;<br>seeks a permanent injunction to remedy a NEPA violation.&para;<br>See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21–23).&para;<br>Petitioners argue that the lower courts in this case&para;<br>proceeded on the erroneous assumption that an injunction&para;<br>is generally the appropriate remedy for a NEPA violation.&para;<br>In particular, petitioners note that the District Court cited&para;<br>pre-Winter Ninth Circuit precedent for the proposition&para;<br>that, in “ ‘the run of the mill NEPA case,’ ” an injunction&para;<br>delaying the contemplated government project is proper&para;<br>“ ‘until the NEPA violation is cured.’ ” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 65a (quoting Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307&para;<br>F. 3d 815, 833 (CA9 2002)); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>55a (quoting same language in preliminary injunction&para;<br>order). In addition, petitioners observe, the District Court&para;<br>and the Court of Appeals in this case both stated that, “in&para;<br>unusual circumstances, an injunction may be withheld, or,&para;<br>more likely, limited in scope” in NEPA cases. Id., at 66a&para;<br>(quoting National Parks &amp; Conservation Assn. v. Babbitt,&para;<br>241 F. 3d 722, 737, n. 18 (CA9 2001) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)); 570 F. 3d, at 1137.&para;<br>Insofar as the statements quoted above are intended to&para;<br>guide the determination whether to grant injunctive relief,&para;<br>they invert the proper mode of analysis. An injunction&para;<br>should issue only if the traditional four-factor test is satis­&para;<br>fied. See Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21–24). In&para;<br>contrast, the statements quoted above appear to presume&para;<br>that an injunction is the proper remedy for a NEPA viola­&para;<br>tion except in unusual circumstances. No such thumb on&para;<br>the scales is warranted. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals, could any such error be cured by a&para;<br>court’s perfunctory recognition that “an injunction does&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not automatically issue” in NEPA cases. See 570 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1137 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough&para;<br>for a court considering a request for injunctive relief to ask&para;<br>whether there is a good reason why an injunction should&para;<br>not issue; rather, a court must determine that an injunc­&para;<br>tion should issue under the traditional four-factor test set&para;<br>out above.&para;<br>Notwithstanding the lower courts’ apparent reliance on&para;<br>the incorrect standard set out in the pre-Winter Circuit&para;<br>precedents quoted above, respondents argue that the&para;<br>lower courts in fact applied the traditional four-factor test.&para;<br>In their view, the statements that injunctive relief is&para;<br>proper in the “run-of-the-mill” NEPA case, and that such&para;<br>injunctions are granted except in “unusual circumstances,”&para;<br>are descriptive rather than prescriptive. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 28, n. 14. We need not decide whether re­&para;<br>spondents’ characterization of the lower court opinions in&para;<br>this case is sound. Even if it is, the injunctive relief&para;<br>granted here cannot stand.&para;<br>C&para;<br>We first consider whether the District Court erred in&para;<br>enjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during&para;<br>the pendency of the EIS process.4&para;<br>The relevant part of the District Court’s judgment states&para;<br>that, “[b]efore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Petitioners&para;<br>&para;<br>focus their challenge on the part of the District Court’s&para;<br>order prohibiting the planting of RRA. As we explain below, however,&para;<br>the broad injunction against planting cannot be valid if the injunction&para;<br>against partial deregulation is improper. See infra, at 23; see also App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 64a (District Court order recognizing that APHIS’s&para;<br>proposed remedy “seek[s], in effect, a partial deregulation that permits&para;<br>the continued expansion of the Roundup Ready alfalfa market subject&para;<br>to certain conditions” (emphasis added)). The validity of the injunction&para;<br>prohibiting partial deregulation is therefore properly before us. Like&para;<br>the District Court, we use the term “partial deregulation” to refer to&para;<br>any limited or conditional deregulation. See id., at 64a, 69a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>even in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an&para;<br>environmental impact statement.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>108a (emphasis added); see also id., at 79a (“The Court&para;<br>will enter a final judgment . . . ordering the government to&para;<br>prepare an EIS before it makes a decision on Monsanto’s&para;<br>deregulation petition”). The plain text of the order prohib­&para;<br>its any partial deregulation, not just the particular partial&para;<br>deregulation embodied in APHIS’s proposed judgment.&para;<br>We think it is quite clear that the District Court meant&para;<br>just what it said. The related injunction against planting&para;<br>states that “no [RRA] . . . may be planted” “[u]ntil the&para;<br>federal defendants prepare the EIS and decide the deregu­&para;<br>lation petition.” Id., at 108a (emphasis added). That&para;<br>injunction, which appears in the very same judgment and&para;<br>directly follows the injunction against granting Mon­&para;<br>santo’s petition “even in part,” does not carve out an ex­&para;<br>ception for planting subsequently authorized by a valid&para;<br>partial deregulation decision.&para;<br>In our view, none of the traditional four factors govern­&para;<br>ing the entry of permanent injunctive relief supports the&para;<br>District Court’s injunction prohibiting partial deregula­&para;<br>tion. To see why that is so, it is helpful to understand how&para;<br>the injunction prohibiting a partial deregulation fits into&para;<br>the broader dispute between the parties.&para;<br>Respondents in this case brought suit under the APA to&para;<br>challenge a particular agency order: APHIS’s decision to&para;<br>completely deregulate RRA. The District Court held that&para;<br>the order in question was procedurally defective, and&para;<br>APHIS decided not to appeal that determination. At that&para;<br>point, it was for the agency to decide whether and to what&para;<br>extent it would pursue a partial deregulation. If the&para;<br>agency found, on the basis of a new EA, that a limited and&para;<br>temporary deregulation satisfied applicable statutory and&para;<br>regulatory requirements, it could proceed with such a&para;<br>deregulation even if it had not yet finished the onerous&para;<br>EIS required for complete deregulation. If and when the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>agency were to issue a partial deregulation order, any&para;<br>party aggrieved by that order could bring a separate suit&para;<br>under the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the&para;<br>particular deregulation attempted. See 5 U. S. C. §702.&para;<br>In this case, APHIS apparently sought to “streamline”&para;<br>the proceedings by asking the District Court to craft a&para;<br>remedy that, in effect, would have partially deregulated&para;<br>RRA until such time as the agency had finalized the EIS&para;<br>needed for a complete deregulation. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>16, 23–24; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. To justify that dispo­&para;<br>sition, APHIS and petitioners submitted voluminous&para;<br>documentary submissions in which they purported to show&para;<br>that the risk of gene flow would be insignificant if the&para;<br>District Court allowed limited planting and harvesting&para;<br>subject to APHIS’s proposed conditions. Respondents, in&para;<br>turn, submitted considerable evidence of their own that&para;<br>seemed to cut the other way. This put the District Court&para;<br>in an unenviable position. “The parties’ experts disagreed&para;<br>over virtually every factual issue relating to possible&para;<br>environmental harm, including the likelihood of genetic&para;<br>contamination and why some contamination had already&para;<br>occurred.” 570 F. 3d, at 1135.&para;<br>The District Court may well have acted within its dis­&para;<br>cretion in refusing to craft a judicial remedy that would&para;<br>have authorized the continued planting and harvesting of&para;<br>RRA while the EIS is being prepared. It does not follow,&para;<br>however, that the District Court was within its rights in&para;<br>enjoining APHIS from allowing such planting and harvest­&para;<br>ing pursuant to the authority vested in the agency by law.&para;<br>When the District Court entered its permanent injunction,&para;<br>APHIS had not yet exercised its authority to partially&para;<br>deregulate RRA. Until APHIS actually seeks to effect a&para;<br>partial deregulation, any judicial review of such a decision&para;<br>is premature.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 NEPA&para;<br>&para;<br>provides that an EIS must be “include[d] in every recommen­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Even if the District&para;<br>Court was not required to adopt that judgment, there was&para;<br>no need to stop the agency from effecting a partial deregu­&para;<br>lation in accordance with the procedures established by&para;<br>law. Moreover, the terms of the District Court’s injunction&para;<br>do not just enjoin the particular partial deregulation&para;<br>embodied in APHIS’s proposed judgment. Instead, the&para;<br>District Court barred the agency from pursuing any de­&para;<br>regulation—no matter how limited the geographic area in&para;<br>which planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the&para;<br>isolation distances mandated between RRA fields and&para;<br>fields for growing non-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how&para;<br>stringent the regulations governing harvesting and distri­&para;<br>bution, how robust the enforcement mechanisms available&para;<br>——————&para;<br>dation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal&para;<br>actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”&para;<br>42 U.

S. 390, 406 (1976) (“A court has no authority to depart&para;<br>from the statutory language and . . . determine a point during the&para;<br>germination process of a potential proposal at which an impact state­&para;<br>ment should be prepared” (first emphasis added)). When a particular&para;<br>agency proposal exists and requires the preparation of an EIS, NEPA&para;<br>regulations allow the agency to take at least some action pertaining to&para;<br>that proposal during the pendency of the EIS process. See 40 CFR&para;<br>§§1506.1(a), (c) (2009). We do not express any view on the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s contention that a limited deregulation of the kind embodied in&para;<br>its proposed judgment would not require the prior preparation of an&para;<br>EIS. See Brief for Federal Respondents 21–22 (citing §1506.1(a)); Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 20 (“what we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing&para;<br>continued planting subject to various protective measures, was funda­&para;<br>mentally different from the action on which the EIS was being pre­&para;<br>pared”). Because APHIS has not yet invoked the procedures necessary&para;<br>to attempt a limited deregulation, any judicial consideration of such&para;<br>issues is not warranted at this time.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v.

See id., at 1136. On the&para;<br>one hand, the District Court rejected APHIS’s proposal&para;<br>(supported by petitioners) to allow continued planting and&para;<br>harvesting of RRA subject to the agency’s proposed limita­&para;<br>tions. On the other hand, the District Court did not bar&para;<br>continued planting of RRA as a regulated article under&para;<br>permit from APHIS, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, and it&para;<br>expressly allowed farmers to harvest and sell RRA planted&para;<br>before March 30, 2007, id., at 76a–79a. If the District&para;<br>Court was right to conclude that any partial deregulation,&para;<br>no matter how limited, required the preparation of an EIS,&para;<br>it is hard to see why the limited planting and harvesting&para;<br>that the District Court allowed did not also require the&para;<br>preparation of an EIS. Conversely, if the District Court&para;<br>was right to conclude that the limited planting and har­&para;<br>vesting it allowed did not require the preparation of an&para;<br>EIS, then an appropriately limited partial deregulation&para;<br>should likewise have been possible.&para;<br>Based on the analysis set forth above, it is clear that the&para;<br>order enjoining any deregulation whatsoever does not&para;<br>satisfy the traditional four-factor test for granting perma­&para;<br>nent injunctive relief. Most importantly, respondents&para;<br>cannot show that they will suffer irreparable injury if&para;<br>APHIS is allowed to proceed with any partial deregula­&para;<br>tion, for at least two independent reasons.&para;<br>First, if and when APHIS pursues a partial deregulation&para;<br>that arguably runs afoul of NEPA, respondents may file a&para;<br>new suit challenging such action and seeking appropriate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>preliminary relief. See 5 U. S. C. §§702, 705. Accordingly,&para;<br>a permanent injunction is not now needed to guard&para;<br>against any present or imminent risk of likely irreparable&para;<br>harm.&para;<br>Second, a partial deregulation need not cause respon­&para;<br>dents any injury at all, much less irreparable injury; if the&para;<br>scope of the partial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the&para;<br>risk of gene flow to their crops could be virtually nonexis­&para;<br>tent. For example, suppose that APHIS deregulates RRA&para;<br>only in a remote part of the country in which respondents&para;<br>neither grow nor intend to grow non-genetically­&para;<br>engineered alfalfa, and in which no conventional alfalfa&para;<br>farms are currently located. Suppose further that APHIS&para;<br>issues an accompanying administrative order mandating&para;<br>isolation distances so great as to eliminate any apprecia­&para;<br>ble risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional farmers&para;<br>who might someday choose to plant in the surrounding&para;<br>area. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition 9, n. 6 (quoting study&para;<br>concluding “ ‘that in order for there to be zero tolerance of&para;<br>any gene flow between a [RRA] seed field and a conven­&para;<br>tional seed field, those fields would have to have a five­&para;<br>mile isolation distance between them’ ”); see also Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 15–16 (representation from the Solicitor General&para;<br>that APHIS may impose conditions on the deregulation of&para;<br>RRA via issuance of an administrative order). Finally,&para;<br>suppose that APHIS concludes in a new EA that its lim­&para;<br>ited deregulation would not pose a significant risk of gene&para;<br>flow or harmful weed development, and that the agency&para;<br>adopts a plan to police vigorously compliance with its&para;<br>administrative order in the limited geographic area in&para;<br>question. It is hard to see how respondents could show&para;<br>that such a limited deregulation would cause them likely&para;<br>irreparable injury. (Respondents in this case do not repre­&para;<br>sent a class, so they could not seek to enjoin such an order&para;<br>on the ground that it might cause harm to other parties.)&para;<br>In any case, the District Court’s order prohibiting any&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>partial deregulation improperly relieves respondents of&para;<br>their burden to make the requisite evidentiary showing.6&para;<br>Of course, APHIS might ultimately choose not to par­&para;<br>tially deregulate RRA during the pendency of the EIS, or&para;<br>else to pursue the kind of partial deregulation embodied in&para;<br>its proposed judgment rather than the very limited de­&para;<br>regulation envisioned in the above hypothetical. Until&para;<br>such time as the agency decides whether and how to exer­&para;<br>cise its regulatory authority, however, the courts have no&para;<br>cause to intervene. Indeed, the broad injunction entered&para;<br>here essentially pre-empts the very procedure by which&para;<br>the agency could determine, independently of the pending&para;<br>EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregu­&para;<br>lation, that a limited deregulation would not pose any&para;<br>appreciable risk of environmental harm. See 40 CFR&para;<br>§§1501.4, 1508.9(a) (2009).&para;<br>In sum, we do not know whether and to what extent&para;<br>APHIS would seek to effect a limited deregulation during&para;<br>the pendency of the EIS process if it were free to do so; we&para;<br>do know that the vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision&para;<br>means that virtually no RRA can be grown or sold until&para;<br>such time as a new deregulation decision is in place, and&para;<br>we also know that any party aggrieved by a hypothetical&para;<br>future deregulation decision will have ample opportunity&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The District Court itself appears to have recognized that its broad&para;<br>injunction may not have been necessary to avert any injury to respon­&para;<br>dents. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a (“It does complicate it to try to&para;<br>fine-tune a particular remedy.

In light of these&para;<br>particular circumstances, we hold that the District Court&para;<br>did not properly exercise its discretion in enjoining a&para;<br>partial deregulation of any kind pending APHIS’s prepa­&para;<br>ration of an EIS. It follows that the Court of Appeals&para;<br>erred in affirming that aspect of the District Court’s&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>D&para;<br>We now turn to petitioners’ claim that the District Court&para;<br>erred in entering a nationwide injunction against planting&para;<br>RRA. Petitioners argue that the District Court did not&para;<br>apply the right test for determining whether to enter&para;<br>permanent injunctive relief; that, even if the District&para;<br>Court identified the operative legal standard, it erred as a&para;<br>matter of law in applying that standard to the facts of this&para;<br>case; and that the District Court was required to grant&para;<br>petitioners an evidentiary hearing to resolve contested&para;<br>issues of fact germane to the remedial dispute between the&para;<br>parties. We agree that the District Court’s injunction&para;<br>against planting went too far, but we come to that conclu­&para;<br>sion for two independent reasons.&para;<br>First, the impropriety of the District Court’s broad&para;<br>injunction against planting flows from the impropriety of&para;<br>its injunction against partial deregulation. If APHIS may&para;<br>partially deregulate RRA before preparing a full-blown&para;<br>EIS—a question that we need not and do not decide here—&para;<br>farmers should be able to grow and sell RRA in accordance&para;<br>with that agency determination. Because it was inappro­&para;<br>priate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibil­&para;<br>ity of a partial and temporary deregulation, it necessarily&para;<br>follows that it was likewise inappropriate to enjoin any&para;<br>and all parties from acting in accordance with the terms of&para;<br>such a deregulation decision.&para;<br>Second, respondents have represented to this Court that&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the District Court’s injunction against planting does not&para;<br>have any meaningful practical effect independent of its&para;<br>vacatur. See Brief for Respondents 24; see also Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 37 (“[T]he mistake that was made [by the District&para;<br>Court] was in not appreciating . . . that the vacatur did&para;<br>have [the] effect” of independently prohibiting the growth&para;<br>and sale of almost all RRA). An injunction is a drastic and&para;<br>extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a&para;<br>matter of course. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,&para;<br>456 U. S. 305, 311–312 (1982). If a less drastic remedy&para;<br>(such as partial or complete vacatur of APHIS’s deregula­&para;<br>tion decision) was sufficient to redress respondents’ injury,&para;<br>no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an&para;<br>injunction was warranted.

After years of experimentation, Monsanto and&para;<br>co-petitioner Forage Genetics International (FGI) geneti&para;<br>cally engineered a mutation in the alfalfa genome that&para;<br>makes the plant immune to Roundup. Monsanto and&para;<br>FGI’s new product, RRA, is “the first crop that has been&para;<br>engineered to resist a[n] herbicide” and that can transmit&para;<br>the genetically engineered gene to other plants. See App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 45a.&para;<br>In 2004, in the midst of a deregulatory trend in the&para;<br>agricultural sector, petitioners asked APHIS to deregulate&para;<br>RRA, thereby allowing it to be sold and planted nation&para;<br>wide. App. 101a. Rather than conducting a detailed&para;<br>analysis and preparing an “environmental impact state&para;<br>ment” (EIS), as required by the National Environmental&para;<br>Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for every “major Federal ac&para;<br>tio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human&para;<br>environment,” 42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C), APHIS merely&para;<br>conducted an abbreviated “environmental assessment”&para;<br>(EA). During the 6-month period in which APHIS allowed&para;<br>public comment on its EA, the agency received 663 com&para;<br>ments, 520 of which opposed deregulation. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 29a. Farmers and scientists opined that RRA could&para;<br>contaminate alfalfa that has not been genetically modified,&para;<br>destroying the American export market for alfalfa and,&para;<br>potentially, contaminating other plants and breeding a&para;<br>new type of pesticide-resistant weed. Id., at 29a–30a.&para;<br>Despite substantial evidence that RRA genes could&para;<br>transfer to other plants, APHIS issued a Finding of No&para;<br>Significant Impact and agreed to deregulate RRA “uncon&para;<br>ditionally,” ante, at 4. With no EIS to wait for and no&para;<br>regulation blocking its path, petitioners began selling&para;<br>RRA. Farmers and environmental groups swiftly brought&para;<br>this lawsuit to challenge APHIS’s decision to deregulate,&para;<br>raising claims under NEPA and other statutes.&para;<br>The District Court carefully reviewed a long record and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

A review of APHIS’s internal&para;<br>documents showed that individuals within the agency&para;<br>warned that contamination might occur. APHIS rested its&para;<br>decision to deregulate on its assertion that contamination&para;<br>risk is “not significant because it is the organic and con&para;<br>ventional farmers’ responsibility” to protect themselves&para;<br>and the environment. Ibid. Yet the agency drew this&para;<br>conclusion without having investigated whether such&para;<br>farmers “can, in fact, protect their crops from contamina&para;<br>tion.” Ibid. The District Court likewise found that&para;<br>APHIS’s reasons for disregarding the risk of pesticide&para;<br>resistant weeds were speculative and “not convincing.”&para;<br>Id., at 46a. The agency had merely explained that if&para;<br>weeds acquire roundup resistance, farmers can use “ ‘[a]l&para;<br>ternative herbicides.’ ” Ibid. In light of the “acknowl&para;<br>edged” risk of RRA gene transmission and the potential&para;<br>“impact on the development of Roundup resistant weeds,”&para;<br>the court concluded that there was a significant possibility&para;<br>of serious environmental harm, and granted summary&para;<br>judgment for the plaintiffs. Id., at 54a; see also id., at 45a.&para;<br>At this point, the question of remedy arose. The parties&para;<br>submitted proposed final judgments, and several corpora&para;<br>tions with an interest in RRA, including Monsanto, sought&para;<br>permission to intervene. The District Court granted their&para;<br>motion and agreed “to give them the opportunity to pre&para;<br>sent evidence to assist the court in fashioning the appro&para;<br>priate scope of whatever relief is granted.” Id., at 54a&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>While the District Court considered the proposed judg&para;<br>ments, it issued a preliminary injunction. Ordinarily, the&para;<br>court explained, the remedy for failure to conduct an EIS&para;<br>is to vacate the permit that was unlawfully given—the&para;<br>result of which, in this case, would be to prohibit any use&para;<br>of RRA. See id., at 55a; see also id., at 65a. But this case&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>presented a special difficulty: Following APHIS’s unlawful&para;<br>deregulation order, some farmers had begun planting&para;<br>genetically modified RRA. Id., at 55a. In its preliminary&para;<br>injunction, the District Court ordered that no new RRA&para;<br>could be planted until APHIS completed the EIS or the&para;<br>court determined that some other relief was appropriate.&para;<br>But, so as to protect these farmers, the court declined to&para;<br>prohibit them from “harvesting, using, or selling” any&para;<br>crops they had already planted. Id., at 56a. And “to&para;<br>minimize the harm to those growers who intend to immi&para;<br>nently plant Roundup Ready alfalfa,” the court permitted&para;<br>“[t]hose growers who intend to plant [RRA] in the next&para;<br>three weeks and have already purchased the seed” to go&para;<br>ahead and plant. Id., at 58a (emphasis deleted). Essen&para;<br>tially, the court grandfathered in those farmers who had&para;<br>relied, in good faith, on APHIS’s actions.&para;<br>Before determining the scope of its final judgment, the&para;<br>District Court invited the parties and intervenors to sub&para;<br>mit “whatever additional evidence” they “wish[ed] to&para;<br>provide,” and it scheduled additional oral argument. Id.,&para;<br>at 58a–59a. The parties submitted “competing proposals&para;<br>for permanent injunctive relief.” Id., at 60a. The plain&para;<br>tiffs requested that no one—not even the grandfathered-in&para;<br>farmers—be allowed to plant, grow, or harvest RRA until&para;<br>the full EIS had been prepared. Id., at 64a. APHIS and&para;<br>the intervenors instead sought a remedy that would “fa&para;<br>cilitat[e] the continued and dramatic growth” of RRA: a&para;<br>“partial deregulation” order that would permit planting&para;<br>subject to certain conditions, such as specified minimum&para;<br>distances between RRA and conventional alfalfa and&para;<br>special cleaning requirements for equipment used on the&para;<br>genetically modified crop. See id., at 60a–64a.&para;<br>The court adopted a compromise. First, it declined to&para;<br>adopt the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. APHIS itself had&para;<br>acknowledged that “gene transmission could and had&para;<br>occurred,” and that RRA “could result in the development&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of Roundup-resistant weeds.” Id., at 61a–62a. In light of&para;<br>the substantial record evidence of these risks, the court&para;<br>would not agree to a nationwide planting scheme “without&para;<br>the benefit of the development of all the relevant data,” as&para;<br>well as public comment about whether contamination&para;<br>could be controlled. Id., at 68a. The “partial deregulation”&para;<br>proposed by petitioners, the court noted, was really “de&para;<br>regulation with certain conditions,” id., at 69a—which, for&para;<br>the same reasons given in the court’s earlier order, re&para;<br>quires an EIS, ibid. The court pointed out numerous&para;<br>problems with the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. Neither&para;<br>APHIS nor Monsanto had provided “evidence that sug&para;<br>gests whether, and to what extent, the proposed interim&para;<br>conditions” would actually “be followed,” and comparable&para;<br>conditions had failed to prevent contamination in certain&para;<br>limited settings. Id., at 69a–70a. APHIS, moreover,&para;<br>conceded that “it does not have the resources to inspect”&para;<br>the RRA that had already been planted, and so could not&para;<br>possibly be expected “to adequately monitor the more than&para;<br>one million acres of [RRA] intervenors estimate [would] be&para;<br>planted” under their proposal. Ibid. That was especially&para;<br>problematic because any plan to limit contamination&para;<br>depended on rules about harvesting, and farmers were&para;<br>unlikely to follow those rules. Id., at 71a. “APHIS ha[d]&para;<br>still not made any inquiry” into numerous factual concerns&para;<br>raised by the court in its summary judgment order issued&para;<br>several months earlier. Id., at 70a.&para;<br>Next, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed remedy&para;<br>of “enjoin[ing] the harvesting and sale of already planted”&para;<br>RRA. Id., at 76a. Although any planting or harvesting of&para;<br>RRA poses a contamination risk, the court reasoned that&para;<br>the equities were different for those farmers who had&para;<br>already invested time and money planting RRA in good&para;<br>faith reliance on APHIS’s deregulation order. And small&para;<br>amounts of harvesting could be more easily monitored.&para;<br>Rather than force the farmers to tear up their crops, the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>court imposed a variety of conditions on the crops’ han&para;<br>dling and distribution. Id., at 77a.&para;<br>As to all other RRA, however, the court sided with the&para;<br>plaintiffs and enjoined planting during the pendency of&para;<br>the EIS. Balancing the equities, the court explained that&para;<br>the risk of harm was great. “[C]ontamination cannot be&para;<br>undone; it will destroy the crops of those farmers who do&para;<br>not sell genetically modified alfalfa.” Id., at 71a. And&para;<br>because those crops “cannot be replanted for two to four&para;<br>years,” that loss will be even greater. Ibid. On the other&para;<br>side of the balance, the court recognized that some farmers&para;<br>may wish to switch to genetically modified alfalfa immedi&para;<br>ately, and some companies like Monsanto want to start&para;<br>selling it to them just as fast. But, the court noted, RRA is&para;<br>a small percentage of those companies’ overall business;&para;<br>unsold seed can be stored; and the companies “ ‘have [no]&para;<br>cause to claim surprise’ ” as to any loss of anticipated&para;<br>revenue, as they “were aware of plaintiffs’ lawsuit” and&para;<br>“nonetheless chose to market” RRA. Id., at 72a.&para;<br>Thus, the District Court stated that it would “vacat[e]&para;<br>the June 2005 deregulation decision”; “enjoi[n] the plant&para;<br>ing of [RRA] in the United States after March 30, 2007,”&para;<br>the date of the decision, “pending the government’s com&para;<br>pletion of the EIS and decision on the deregulation peti&para;<br>tion”; and impose “conditions on the handling and identifi&para;<br>cation of already-planted [RRA].” Id., at 79a. On the&para;<br>same day, the court issued its judgment. In relevant part,&para;<br>the judgment states:&para;<br>“The federal defendants’ June 14, 2005 Determination&para;<br>of Nonregulated Status for [RRA] is VACATED. Be&para;<br>fore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even&para;<br>in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an [EIS].&para;<br>Until the federal defendants prepare the EIS and de&para;<br>cide the deregulation petition, no [RRA] may be&para;<br>planted. . . .

The Court today rests&para;<br>not only the bulk of its analysis but also the primary basis&para;<br>for our jurisdiction on the premise that the District Court&para;<br>enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating RRA in any&para;<br>sense. See ante, at 9–11, 16–23.1 That is a permissible,&para;<br>but not necessarily correct, reading of the District Court’s&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>So far as I can tell, until petitioners’ reply brief, neither&para;<br>petitioners nor the Government submitted to us that the&para;<br>District Court had exceeded its authority in this manner.&para;<br>And, indeed, the Government had not raised this issue in&para;<br>any court at all.

It was clear to the court that APHIS had only&para;<br>limited capacity to monitor planted RRA, and some RRA&para;<br>had already been planted. The marginal threat posed by&para;<br>additional planting was therefore significant.

Under these circum&para;<br>stances, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude&para;<br>that the most equitable solution was to allocate the lim&para;<br>ited amount of potentially safe RRA to the farmers who&para;<br>had already planted that crop.11&para;<br>The Court suggests that the injunction was nonetheless&para;<br>too sweeping because “a partial deregulation need not&para;<br>cause respondents any injury at all . . . if the scope of the&para;<br>partial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the risk of gene&para;<br>flow to their crops could be virtually nonexistent.” Ante, at&para;<br>21. The Court appears to reach this conclusion by citing&para;<br>one particular study (in a voluminous record), rather than&para;<br>any findings of fact.12 Even assuming that this study is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 As explained previously, I do not see the court’s broad injunction as&para;<br>“inconsistent,” ante, at 20, with its decision that farmers who had&para;<br>already planted RRA could harvest their crop. The equities are differ&para;<br>ent for farmers who relied on the agency than for companies like&para;<br>Monstanto that developed an organism knowing it might be regulated;&para;<br>and APHIS could monitor only a limited amount of RRA.&para;<br>12 The Court also hypothesizes a set of growing conditions that would&para;<br>isolate RRA from the plaintiffs in this case, even if not from other&para;<br>farmers. See ante, at 21–22. As already explained, these hypotheticals&para;<br>are rather unrealistic. See n. 8, supra. And, given that the plaintiffs&para;<br>include environmental organizations as well as farmer and consumer&para;<br>associations, it is hard to see how APHIS could so carefully isolate and&para;<br>protect their interests. In any event, because APHIS concedes that it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>correct, the Court ignores the District Court’s findings&para;<br>that gene flow is likely and that APHIS has little ability to&para;<br>monitor any conditions imposed on a partial deregulation.&para;<br>Limits on planting or harvesting may operate fine in a&para;<br>laboratory setting, but the District Court concluded that&para;<br>many limits will not be followed and cannot be enforced in&para;<br>the real world.13&para;<br>Against that background, it was perfectly reasonable to&para;<br>wait for an EIS. APHIS and petitioners argued to the&para;<br>District Court that partial deregulation could be safely&para;<br>implemented, they submitted evidence intended to show&para;<br>that planting restrictions would prevent the spread of the&para;<br>newly engineered gene, and they contested “virtually&para;<br>every factual issue relating to possible environmental&para;<br>harm.” Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130,&para;<br>1135 (CA9 2009). But lacking “the benefit of the develop&para;<br>ment of all the relevant data,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a,&para;<br>the District Court did not find APHIS’s and petitioners’&para;<br>assertions to be convincing. I cannot say that I would&para;<br>have found otherwise.

GEERTSON SEED FARMS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>complete study, presented in an EIS, showed that&para;<br>the known problem of gene flow could, in reality, be&para;<br>prevented.14&para;<br>The District Court’s decision that more study was&para;<br>needed to assess whether limits on deregulation could&para;<br>prevent environmental damage is further reinforced by&para;<br>the statutory context in which the issue arose. A court’s&para;<br>equitable discretion must be guided by “recognized, de&para;<br>fined public policy.” Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U. S.&para;<br>228, 235 (1943); see also Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S.&para;<br>321, 331 (1944) (explaining that when a court evaluates an&para;<br>agency’s decision against the background of a federal&para;<br>statute, the court’s discretion “must be exercised in light of&para;<br>the large objectives of the Act”). Congress recognized in&para;<br>NEPA that complex environmental cases often require&para;<br>exceptionally sophisticated scientific determinations, and&para;<br>that agency decisions should not be made on the basis of&para;<br>“incomplete information.” Marsh v. Oregon Natural Re&para;<br>sources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989). Congress also&para;<br>recognized that agencies cannot fully weigh the conse&para;<br>quences of these decisions without obtaining public com&para;<br>ments through an EIS. See Robertson v. Methow Valley&para;<br>Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989).15 While a&para;<br>court may not presume that a NEPA violation requires an&para;<br>injunction, it may take into account the principles embod&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 I suspect that if APHIS and petitioners had come back to the court&para;<br>with more convincing evidence prior to completing an EIS, and moved&para;<br>to modify the court’s order, the court would have done so. Indeed, the&para;<br>District Court showed a willingness to recalibrate its order when it&para;<br>amended its judgment just a few months after the judgment’s issuance&para;<br>in light of APHIS’s submission that certain requirements were imprac&para;<br>tical. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–114a.&para;<br>15 Accordingly, while “NEPA itself does not mandate particular re&para;<br>sults,” it does mandate a particular process and embodies the principle&para;<br>that federal agencies should “carefully conside[r] detailed information”&para;<br>before incurring potential environmental harm.

This District Court had before it&para;<br>strong evidence that gene transmission was likely to occur&para;<br>and that limits on growing could not be enforced. It also&para;<br>had a large amount of highly detailed evidence about&para;<br>whether growing restrictions, even if enforced, can prevent&para;<br>transmission. That evidence called into question the&para;<br>agency’s own claims regarding the risks posed by partial&para;<br>deregulation. In enjoining partial deregulation until it&para;<br>had the benefit of an EIS to help parse the evidence, the&para;<br>court acted with exactly the sort of caution that Congress&para;<br>endorsed in NEPA.&para;<br>Finally, it bears mention that the District Court’s ex&para;<br>perience with the case may have given it grounds for&para;<br>skepticism about the representations made by APHIS and&para;<br>petitioners. Sometimes “one judicial actor is better posi&para;<br>tioned than another to decide the issue in question.”&para;<br>Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985). A “district&para;<br>court may have insights not conveyed by the record.”&para;<br>Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 560 (1988). In this&para;<br>case, the agency had attempted to deregulate RRA without&para;<br>an EIS in spite of ample evidence of potential environ&para;<br>mental harms. And when the court made clear that the&para;<br>agency had violated NEPA, the agency responded by&para;<br>seeking to “ ‘streamline’ ” the process, ante, at 18, submit&para;<br>ting a deregulation proposal with Monsanto that suffered&para;<br>from some of the same legal and empirical holes as its&para;<br>initial plan to deregulate. Against that background, the&para;<br>court may have felt it especially prudent to wait for an EIS&para;<br>before concluding that APHIS could manage RRA’s threat&para;<br>to the environment.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The District Court in this case was put in an “unenvi&para;<br>able position.” Ibid.

Confronted with those disconcert&para;<br>ing submissions, with APHIS’s unlawful deregulation&para;<br>decision, with a group of farmers who had staked their&para;<br>livelihoods on APHIS’s decision, and with a federal statute&para;<br>that prizes informed decisionmaking on matters that&para;<br>seriously affect the environment, the court did the best it&para;<br>could. In my view, the District Court was well within its&para;<br>discretion to order the remedy that the Court now re&para;<br>verses. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
