S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>PATRICK GLEBE, SUPERINTENDENT, STAFFORD&para;<br>&para;<br>CREEK CORRECTIONS CENTER v.&para;<br>&para;<br>JOSHUA JAMES FROST &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 14–95 Decided November 17, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Over 11 days in April 2003, respondent Joshua Frost&para;<br>helped two associates commit a series of armed robberies&para;<br>in the State of Washington. In the main, Frost drove his&para;<br>confederates to and from their crimes. On one occasion, he&para;<br>also entered the house being robbed. On another, he&para;<br>performed surveillance in anticipation of the robbery.&para;<br>Washington charged Frost with robbery and related&para;<br>offenses. Taking the witness stand, Frost admitted to his&para;<br>involvement, but claimed he acted under duress. As closing arguments drew near, however, Frost’s lawyer expressed the desire to contend both (1) that the State failed&para;<br>to meet its burden of proving that Frost was an accomplice&para;<br>to the crimes and (2) that Frost acted under duress. The&para;<br>trial judge insisted that the defense choose between these&para;<br>alternative arguments, explaining that state law prohibited a defendant from simultaneously contesting the elements of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense&para;<br>of duress. So Frost’s lawyer limited his summation to&para;<br>duress. The jury convicted Frost of six counts of robbery,&para;<br>one count of attempted robbery, one count of burglary, and&para;<br>two counts of assault.&para;<br>The Washington Supreme Court sustained Frost’s conviction. It rejected the trial court’s view that state law&para;<br>prohibited Frost from simultaneously contesting criminal&para;<br>liability and arguing duress. State v. Frost, 160 Wash. 2d&para;<br>765, 773–776, 161 P. 3d 361, 366–368 (2007) (en banc). By&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GLEBE v. FROST&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>preventing the defense from presenting both theories&para;<br>during summation, it said, the trial court violated the&para;<br>National Constitution’s Due Process and Assistance of&para;<br>Counsel Clauses. Id., at 777–779, 161 P. 3d, at 368–369.&para;<br>But the State Supreme Court continued, this improper&para;<br>restriction of closing argument qualified as a trial error (a&para;<br>mistake reviewable for harmlessness) rather than a structural error (a mistake that requires automatic reversal).&para;<br>Id., at 779–782, 161 P. 3d, at 369–370. Because the jury&para;<br>heard three taped confessions and Frost’s admission of&para;<br>guilt on the witness stand, and because it received proper&para;<br>instructions on the State’s burden of proof, the State&para;<br>Supreme Court held that any error was harmless beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt. Id., at 782–783, 161 P. 3d, at 370–371.&para;<br>Frost filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254. The District Court dismissed the petition,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and a panel of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals affirmed, Frost v. Van Boening, 692 F. 3d 924&para;<br>(CA9 2012). But the Court of Appeals en banc reversed&para;<br>and instructed the District Court to grant relief. 757 F. 3d&para;<br>910 (2014).&para;<br>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty&para;<br>Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the Court of Appeals had power to&para;<br>grant Frost habeas corpus only if the Washington Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an&para;<br>unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal&para;<br>law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United&para;<br>States,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination&para;<br>of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State&para;<br>court proceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). Here, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit held that the Washington Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by failing&para;<br>to classify the trial court’s restriction of closing argument&para;<br>as structural error.&para;<br>That decision cannot stand. Assuming for argument’s&para;<br>sake that the trial court violated the Constitution, it was&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>not clearly established that its mistake ranked as structural error. Most constitutional mistakes call for reversal&para;<br>only if the government cannot demonstrate harmlessness.&para;<br>Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 8 (1999). Only the&para;<br>rare type of error—in general, one that “ ‘infect[s] the&para;<br>entire trial process’ ” and “ ‘necessarily render[s] [it] fundamentally unfair’ ”—requires automatic reversal. Ibid.&para;<br>None of our cases clearly requires placing improper restriction of closing argument in this narrow category.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit claimed that the Washington Supreme Court contradicted Herring v. New York, 422 U. S.&para;<br>853 (1975). Herring held that complete denial of summation violates the Assistance of Counsel Clause. According&para;<br>to the Ninth Circuit, Herring further held that this denial&para;<br>amounts to structural error. We need not opine on the&para;<br>accuracy of that interpretation. For even assuming that&para;<br>Herring established that complete denial of summation&para;<br>amounts to structural error, it did not clearly establish&para;<br>that the restriction of summation also amounts to structural error. A court could reasonably conclude, after all,&para;<br>that prohibiting all argument differs from prohibiting&para;<br>argument in the alternative. That is all the more true&para;<br>because our structural-error cases “ha[ve] not been characterized by [an] ‘in for a penny, in for a pound’ approach.”&para;<br>Neder, supra, at 17, n. 2.&para;<br>Attempting to bridge the gap between Herring and this&para;<br>case, the Ninth Circuit cited two Circuit precedents—&para;<br>United States v. Miguel, 338 F. 3d 995 (CA9 2003), and&para;<br>Conde v. Henry, 198 F. 3d 734 (CA9 2000)—for the proposition that “preventing a defendant from arguing a legitimate defense theory constitutes structural error.” 757&para;<br>F. 3d, at 916. As we have repeatedly emphasized, however, circuit precedent does not constitute “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”&para;<br>§2254(d)(1); see, e.g., Lopez v. Smith, 574 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 6). The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GLEBE v. FROST&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>acknowledged this rule, but tried to get past it by claiming&para;<br>that circuit precedent could “ ‘help . . . determine what law&para;<br>is “clearly established.” ’ ” 757 F. 3d, at 916, n. 1. But&para;<br>neither Miguel nor Conde arose under AEDPA, so neither&para;<br>purports to reflect the law clearly established by this&para;<br>Court’s holdings. The Ninth Circuit thus had no justification for relying on those decisions. See Parker v. Matthews, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13).&para;<br>The second rationale for the Court of Appeals’ decision&para;<br>is no more sound than the first. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that, by allowing the prosecution to argue that it&para;<br>had proved the elements of the crimes, but “prohibit[ing]”&para;<br>the defense from responding that it had not, the trial court&para;<br>in effect “forc[ed] defense counsel to concede his client’s&para;<br>guilt.” 757 F. 3d, at 917. By extracting this “conce[ssion],”&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit continued, the trial court “relieved the&para;<br>State of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt,” “shifted the burden of proof to Frost,” and even&para;<br>“directed [a] verdict on guilt”—all “unquestionably structural [errors].” Id., at 917–918.&para;<br>No. The trial court, to begin, did not prohibit the defense from arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the&para;<br>elements of the crime. It instead precluded the defense&para;<br>from simultaneously contesting reasonable doubt and&para;<br>claiming duress. Reasonable minds could disagree whether&para;<br>requiring the defense to choose between alternative theories amounts to requiring the defense to concede guilt.&para;<br>Still more could they disagree whether it amounts to&para;<br>eliminating the prosecution’s burden of proof, shifting the&para;<br>burden to the defendant, or directing a verdict. In addition, even if the trial court’s ruling somehow “forced” the&para;<br>defense “at least tacitly [to] admit the elements of the&para;<br>crimes,” id., at 913, the Ninth Circuit still would have no&para;<br>basis for ruling as it did. It goes much too far to suggest&para;<br>that our cases clearly establish that this supposed extraction of a “taci[t] admi[ssion]” is structural error, when they&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>classify the introduction of a coerced confession only as&para;<br>trial error, Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310&para;<br>(1991).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Frost argued below that, even if it was reasonable for&para;<br>the State Supreme Court to treat improper restriction of&para;<br>summation as trial error, it was unreasonable for it to find&para;<br>harmlessness on the facts of this case. The Court of Appeals did not address this argument when sitting en banc,&para;<br>and it is not before us today.&para;<br>We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
