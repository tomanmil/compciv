Berne’s 164 member states agree&para;<br>to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.&para;<br>Of central importance in this case, Article 18 of Berne requires countries to protect the works of other member states unless the works’&para;<br>copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is&para;<br>claimed or the country of origin. A different system of transnational&para;<br>copyright protection long prevailed in this country. Throughout most&para;<br>of the 20th century, the only foreign authors eligible for Copyright&para;<br>Act protection were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights&para;<br>to American authors and whose works were printed in the United&para;<br>States. Despite Article 18, when the United States joined Berne in&para;<br>1989, it did not protect any foreign works lodged in the U. S. public&para;<br>domain, many of them works never protected here. In 1994, however, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property&para;<br>Rights mandated implementation of Berne’s first 21 articles, on pain&para;<br>of enforcement by the World Trade Organization.&para;<br>In response, Congress applied the term of protection available to&para;<br>U. S. works to preexisting works from Berne member countries. Section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) grants copyright protection to works protected in their country of origin, but&para;<br>lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The&para;<br>United States did not protect works from the country of origin at the&para;<br>time of publication; the United States did not protect sound recordings fixed before 1972; or the author had not complied with certain&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>U. S. statutory formalities. Works encompassed by §514 are granted&para;<br>the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States maintained copyright relations with the author’s country or removed formalities incompatible with Berne. As a consequence of the barriers&para;<br>to U. S. copyright protection prior to §514’s enactment, foreign works&para;<br>“restored” to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country. To cushion the impact of their placement in&para;<br>protected status, §514 provides ameliorating accommodations for&para;<br>parties who had exploited affected works before the URAA was&para;<br>enacted.&para;<br>Petitioners are orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and&para;<br>others who formerly enjoyed free access to works §514 removed from&para;<br>the public domain. They maintain that Congress, in passing §514,&para;<br>exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and transgressed&para;<br>First Amendment limitations. The District Court granted the Attorney General’s motion for summary judgment. Affirming in part, the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit agreed that Congress had not offended the Copyright&para;<br>Clause, but concluded that §514 required further First Amendment&para;<br>inspection in light of Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186. On remand,&para;<br>the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners on the&para;<br>First Amendment claim, holding that §514’s constriction of the public&para;<br>domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests. The&para;<br>Tenth Circuit reversed, ruling that §514 was narrowly tailored to fit&para;<br>the important government aim of protecting U. S. copyright holders’&para;<br>interests abroad.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Section 514 does not exceed Congress’ authority under the Copyright Clause. Pp. 13–23.&para;<br>(a) The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application&para;<br>of copyright protection to works in the public domain. Eldred is&para;<br>largely dispositive of petitioners’ claim that the Clause’s confinement&para;<br>of a copyright’s lifespan to a “limited Tim[e]” prevents the removal of&para;<br>works from the public domain. In Eldred, the Court upheld the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extended, by 20 years, the&para;<br>terms of existing copyrights. The text of the Copyright Clause, the&para;<br>Court observed, contains no “command that a time prescription, once&para;<br>set, becomes forever ‘fixed’ or ‘inalterable,’ ” and the Court declined to&para;<br>infer any such command. 537 U. S., at 199. The construction petitioners tender here is similarly infirm. The terms afforded works restored by §514 are no less “limited” than those the CTEA lengthened.&para;<br>Nor had the “limited Tim[e]” already passed for the works at issue&para;<br>here—many of them works formerly denied any U. S. copyright protection—for a period of exclusivity must begin before it may end. Petitioners also urge that the Government’s position would allow Con-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>gress to legislate perpetual copyright terms by instituting successive&para;<br>“limited” terms as prior terms expire. But as in Eldred, such hypothetical misbehavior is far afield from this case. In aligning the&para;<br>United States with other nations bound by Berne, Congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a perpetual&para;<br>copyright regime. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(b) Historical practice corroborates the Court’s reading of the Copyright Clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected&para;<br>works. In the Copyright Act of 1790, the First Congress protected&para;<br>works that had been freely reproducible under State copyright laws.&para;<br>Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the&para;<br>Copyright Clause to preclude protection for existing works. Several&para;<br>private bills restored the copyrights and patents of works and inventions previously in the public domain. Congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting copyrights and patents to works&para;<br>and inventions that had lost protection. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>(c) Petitioners also argue that §514 fails to “promote the Progress of&para;<br>Science” as contemplated by the initial words of the Copyright&para;<br>Clause. Specifically, they claim that because §514 affects only works&para;<br>already created, it cannot meet the Clause’s objective. The creation&para;<br>of new works, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote&para;<br>“Science,” i.e., knowledge and learning. In Eldred, this Court rejected&para;<br>a nearly identical argument, concluding that the Clause does not demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to&para;<br>induce new works. Rather the Clause “empowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body’s&para;<br>judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.” 537 U. S., at 222.&para;<br>Nothing in the text or history of the Copyright Clause, moreover, confines the “Progress of Science” exclusively to “incentives for creation.”&para;<br>Historical evidence, congressional practice, and this Court’s decisions, in fact, suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing&para;<br>works is an appropriate means to promote science. Pp. 20–22.&para;<br>(d) Considered against this backdrop, §514 falls comfortably within&para;<br>Congress’ Copyright Clause authority. Congress had reason to believe that a well-functioning international copyright system would&para;<br>encourage the dissemination of existing and future works. And testimony informed Congress that full compliance with Berne would expand the foreign markets available to U. S. authors and invigorate&para;<br>protection against piracy of U. S. works abroad, thus benefitting copyright-intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment&para;<br>in the creative process. This Court has no warrant to reject Congress’&para;<br>rational judgment that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve&para;<br>the objectives of the Copyright Clause. Pp. 22–23.&para;<br>2. The First Amendment does not inhibit the restoration author-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ized by §514. Pp. 23–32.&para;<br>(a) The pathmarking Eldred decision is again instructive. There,&para;<br>the Court held that the CTEA’s enlargement of a copyright’s duration&para;<br>did not offend the First Amendment’s freedom of expression guarantee. Recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent&para;<br>and intended effect of every grant of copyright, the Court observed&para;<br>that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit&para;<br>on the manner in which expressive works may be used, but also as an&para;<br>“engine of free expression.” 537 U. S., at 219. The “traditional contours” of copyright protection, i.e., the “idea/expression dichotomy”&para;<br>and the “fair use” defense, moreover, serve as “built-in First Amendment accommodations.” Ibid. Given the speech-protective purposes&para;<br>and safeguards embraced by copyright law, there was no call for the&para;<br>heightened review sought in Eldred. The Court reaches the same&para;<br>conclusion here. Section 514 leaves undisturbed the idea/expression&para;<br>distinction and the fair use defense. Moreover, Congress adopted&para;<br>measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime. Pp. 23–26.&para;<br>(b) Petitioners claim that First Amendment interests of a higher&para;<br>order are at stake because they—unlike their Eldred counterparts—&para;<br>enjoyed “vested rights” in works that had already entered the public&para;<br>domain. Their contentions depend on an argument already considered and rejected, namely, that the Constitution renders the public&para;<br>domain largely untouchable by Congress. Nothing in the historical&para;<br>record, subsequent congressional practice, or this Court’s jurisprudence warrants exceptional First Amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain. Congress has&para;<br>several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of&para;<br>works as well as works previously in the public domain. Section 514,&para;<br>moreover, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.&para;<br>The question is whether would-be users of certain foreign works must&para;<br>pay for their desired use of the author’s expression, or else limit their&para;<br>exploitation to “fair use” of those works. By fully implementing&para;<br>Berne, Congress ensured that these works, like domestic and most&para;<br>other foreign works, would be governed by the same legal regime.&para;<br>Section 514 simply placed foreign works in the position they would&para;<br>have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when&para;<br>those works were created and first published.

Latecomer to the international&para;<br>copyright regime launched by Berne, the United States&para;<br>joined the Convention in 1989. To perfect U.

S. works.&para;<br>Congress did so in §514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which grants copyright protection to&para;<br>preexisting works of Berne member countries, protected in&para;<br>their country of origin, but lacking protection in the United&para;<br>States for any of three reasons: The United States did&para;<br>not protect works from the country of origin at the time of&para;<br>publication; the United States did not protect sound recordings fixed before 1972; or the author had failed to comply&para;<br>with U.

Foreign authors, however, gain no credit for the&para;<br>protection they lacked in years prior to §514’s enactment.&para;<br>They therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than&para;<br>do their U.

They maintain that the Constitution’s Copyright and Patent Clause,&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 8, and First Amendment both decree the&para;<br>invalidity of §514.

The most notable required an author to register&para;<br>her work, renew that registration, and affix to published copies notice&para;<br>of copyrighted status. The formalities drew criticism as a trap for the&para;<br>unwary. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer §7.01[A], p. 7–8; Doyle, Cary, McCannon,&para;<br>&amp; Ringer, Notice of Copyright, Study No. 7, p. 46 (1957), reprinted in&para;<br>1 Studies on Copyright 229, 272 (1963).&para;<br>In 1976, Congress eliminated the registration renewal requirement&para;<br>for future works.

The Copyright Act retains, however, incentives for authors to register their works and provide notice of the works’&para;<br>copyrighted status. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §405(b) (precluding actual and&para;<br>statutory damages against “innocent infringers” of a work that lacked&para;<br>notice of copyrighted status); §411(a) (requiring registration of U. S.&para;<br>“work[s],” but not foreign works, before an owner may sue for infringement). The revisions successively made accord with Berne Convention&para;<br>Article 5(2), which proscribes application of copyright formalities to&para;<br>foreign authors. Berne, however, affords domestic authors no escape&para;<br>from domestic formalities.

In rejecting petitioners’ Copyright Clause argument, the court stated that&para;<br>Congress “has historically demonstrated little compunction about removing copyrightable materials from the&para;<br>public domain.” Id., at *14. The court next declined to&para;<br>part from “the settled rule that private censorship via&para;<br>copyright enforcement does not implicate First Amendment concerns.” Id., at *17.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed in&para;<br>part.

The&para;<br>public domain, it agreed, was not a “threshold that Congress” was powerless to “traverse in both directions.” Id.,&para;<br>at 1187 (internal quotations marks omitted). But §514, as&para;<br>the Court of Appeals read our decision in Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186 (2003), required further First Amendment inspection, 501 F. 3d, at 1187. The measure “ ‘altered the traditional contours of copyright protection,’ ” the&para;<br>court said—specifically, the “bedrock principle” that once&para;<br>works enter the public domain, they do not leave. Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting Eldred, 537 U. S., at 221).

Deferring to Congress’&para;<br>predictive judgments in matters relating to foreign affairs,&para;<br>the appellate court held that §514 survived First Amendment scrutiny. Specifically, the court determined that the&para;<br>law was narrowly tailored to fit the important government&para;<br>aim of protecting U.

The Constitution states that “Congress shall have&para;<br>Power . . . [t]o promote the Progress of Science . . . by&para;<br>securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive&para;<br>Right to their . . . Writings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Petitioners&para;<br>find in this grant of authority an impenetrable barrier to&para;<br>the extension of copyright protection to authors whose&para;<br>writings, for whatever reason, are in the public domain.&para;<br>We see no such barrier in the text of the Copyright Clause,&para;<br>historical practice, or our precedents.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain. Symposium, Congressional Power and Limitations&para;<br>Inherent in the Copyright Clause, 30 Colum. J. L. &amp; Arts&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>259, 266 (2007). Petitioners’ contrary argument relies&para;<br>primarily on the Constitution’s confinement of a copyright’s lifespan to a “limited Tim[e].” “Removing works&para;<br>from the public domain,” they contend, “violates the ‘limited [t]imes’ restriction by turning a fixed and predictable&para;<br>period into one that can be reset or resurrected at any&para;<br>time, even after it expires.” Brief for Petitioners 22.&para;<br>Our decision in Eldred is largely dispositive of petitioners’ limited-time argument. There we addressed the&para;<br>question whether Congress violated the Copyright Clause&para;<br>when it extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copyrights. 537 U. S., at 192–193 (upholding Copyright Term&para;<br>Extension Act (CTEA)). Ruling that Congress acted within constitutional bounds, we declined to infer from the text&para;<br>of the Copyright Clause “the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever ‘fixed’ or ‘inalterable.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 199. “The word ‘limited,’ ” we observed, “does not&para;<br>convey a meaning so constricted.” Ibid. Rather, the term&para;<br>is best understood to mean “confine[d] within certain&para;<br>bounds,” “restrain[ed],” or “circumscribed.” Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). The construction petitioners&para;<br>tender closely resembles the definition rejected in Eldred&para;<br>and is similarly infirm.&para;<br>The terms afforded works restored by §514 are no less&para;<br>“limited” than those the CTEA lengthened. In light of&para;<br>Eldred, petitioners do not here contend that the term&para;<br>Congress has granted U. S. authors—their lifetimes, plus&para;<br>70 years—is unlimited. See 17 U. S. C. §302(a). Nor do&para;<br>petitioners explain why terms of the same duration, as&para;<br>applied to foreign works, are not equally “circumscribed”&para;<br>and “confined.” See Eldred, 537 U. S., at 199. Indeed, as&para;<br>earlier noted, see supra, at 2, 10, the copyrights of restored&para;<br>foreign works typically last for fewer years than those of&para;<br>their domestic counterparts.&para;<br>The difference, petitioners say, is that the limited time&para;<br>had already passed for works in the public domain. What&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was that limited term for foreign works once excluded&para;<br>from U. S. copyright protection? Exactly “zero,” petitioners respond. Brief for Petitioners 22 (works in question&para;<br>“received a specific term of protection . . . sometimes expressly set to zero”; “at the end of that period,” they “entered the public domain”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (by “refusing&para;<br>to provide any protection for a work,” Congress “set[s] the&para;<br>term at zero,” and thereby “tell[s] us when the end has&para;<br>come”). We find scant sense in this argument, for surely a&para;<br>“limited time” of exclusivity must begin before it may&para;<br>end.16&para;<br>Carried to its logical conclusion, petitioners persist, the&para;<br>Government’s position would allow Congress to institute a&para;<br>second “limited” term after the first expires, a third after&para;<br>that, and so on. Thus, as long as Congress legislated in&para;<br>installments, perpetual copyright terms would be achievable. As in Eldred, the hypothetical legislative misbehavior&para;<br>petitioners posit is far afield from the case before us. See&para;<br>537 U. S., at 198–200, 209–210. In aligning the United&para;<br>States with other nations bound by the Berne Convention,&para;<br>and thereby according equitable treatment to once disfavored foreign authors, Congress can hardly be charged&para;<br>with a design to move stealthily toward a regime of perpetual copyrights.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Historical practice corroborates our reading of the Copyright Clause to permit full U. S. compliance with Berne.&para;<br>Undoubtedly, federal copyright legislation generally has&para;<br>not affected works in the public domain.

HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>guishes their suit from Eldred’s. In adopting the CTEA,&para;<br>petitioners note, Congress acted in accord with “an unbroken congressional practice” of granting pre-expiration&para;<br>term extensions, 537 U. S., at 200. No comparable practice, they maintain, supports §514.&para;<br>On occasion, however, Congress has seen fit to protect&para;<br>works once freely available. Notably, the Copyright Act of&para;<br>1790 granted protection to many works previously in the&para;<br>public domain. Act of May 31, 1790 (1790 Act), §1, 1 Stat.&para;<br>124 (covering “any map, chart, book, or books already&para;<br>printed within these United States”). Before the Act&para;<br>launched a uniform national system, three States provided&para;<br>no statutory copyright protection at all.17 Of those that&para;<br>did afford some protection, seven failed to protect maps;18&para;<br>eight did not cover previously published books;19 and all&para;<br>ten denied protection to works that failed to comply with&para;<br>formalities.20 The First Congress, it thus appears, did not&para;<br>view the public domain as inviolate. As we have recognized, the “construction placed upon the Constitution by&para;<br>[the drafters of] the first [copyright] act of 1790 and the&para;<br>act of 1802 . . . men who were contemporary with [the&para;<br>Constitution’s] formation, many of whom were members of&para;<br>the convention which framed it, is of itself entitled to very&para;<br>great weight.” Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v.

The limited rights they retain under&para;<br>copyright law’s “built-in safeguards” are, in their view, no&para;<br>substitute for the unlimited use they enjoyed before §514’s&para;<br>enactment.

Brief for Petitioners 42–43.&para;<br>However spun, these contentions depend on an argument we considered and rejected above, namely, that the&para;<br>Constitution renders the public domain largely untouchable by Congress. Petitioners here attempt to achieve&para;<br>under the banner of the First Amendment what they could&para;<br>not win under the Copyright Clause: On their view of the&para;<br>Copyright Clause, the public domain is inviolable; as they&para;<br>read the First Amendment, the public domain is policed&para;<br>through heightened judicial scrutiny of Congress’ means&para;<br>and ends.

However attractive this brightline rule might be, it is not a rule rooted in the constitutional text or&para;<br>history. Nor can it fairly be gleaned from our case law.

The dictum in Graham v.&para;<br>John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.

Cohn, 420 U. S.&para;<br>469, 495–497 (1975).

HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>might sound exactly backwards: Rights typically vest at&para;<br>the outset of copyright protection, in an author or&para;<br>rightholder. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §201(a) (“Copyright in a&para;<br>work protected . . . vests initially in the author . . . .”).&para;<br>Once the term of protection ends, the works do not revest&para;<br>in any rightholder. Instead, the works simply lapse into&para;<br>the public domain. See, e.g., Berne, Art. 18(1), 828&para;<br>U. N. T. S., at 251 (“This Convention shall apply to all&para;<br>works which . . . have not yet fallen into the public domain . . . .”). Anyone has free access to the public domain,&para;<br>but no one, after the copyright term has expired, acquires&para;<br>ownership rights in the once-protected works.&para;<br>Congress recurrently adjusts copyright law to protect&para;<br>categories of works once outside the law’s compass. For&para;<br>example, Congress broke new ground when it extended&para;<br>copyright protection to foreign works in 1891, Act of Mar.&para;<br>3, §13, 26 Stat. 1110; to dramatic works in 1856, Act of&para;<br>Aug. 18, 11 Stat. 138; to photographs and photographic&para;<br>negatives in 1865, Act of Mar. 3, §1, 13 Stat. 540; to motion pictures in 1912, Act of Aug. 24, 37 Stat. 488; to fixed&para;<br>sound recordings in 1972, Act of Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat.&para;<br>391; and to architectural works in 1990, Architectural&para;<br>Works Copyright Protection Act, 104 Stat. 5133. And on&para;<br>several occasions, as recounted above, Congress protected&para;<br>works previously in the public domain, hence freely usable&para;<br>by the public. See supra, at 15–19. If Congress could&para;<br>grant protection to these works without hazarding heightened First Amendment scrutiny, then what free speech&para;<br>principle disarms it from protecting works prematurely&para;<br>cast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the&para;<br>Berne Convention? 33&para;<br>——————&para;<br>33 It was the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause—not the First&para;<br>Amendment—that Congress apparently perceived to be a potential&para;<br>check on its authority to protect works then freely available to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners protest that fair use and&para;<br>the idea/expression dichotomy “are plainly inadequate to&para;<br>protect the speech and expression rights that Section 514&para;<br>took from petitioners, or . . . the public”—that is, “the&para;<br>unrestricted right to perform, copy, teach and distribute&para;<br>the entire work, for any reason.” Brief for Petitioners 46–&para;<br>47. “Playing a few bars of a Shostakovich symphony,”&para;<br>petitioners observe, “is no substitute for performing the&para;<br>entire work.” Id., at 47.34&para;<br>But Congress has not put petitioners in this bind. The&para;<br>question here, as in Eldred, is whether would-be users&para;<br>must pay for their desired use of the author’s expression,&para;<br>or else limit their exploitation to “fair use” of that work.&para;<br>Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf could once be performed&para;<br>free of charge; after §514 the right to perform it must be&para;<br>obtained in the marketplace.

HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cost. By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that&para;<br>most works, whether foreign or domestic, would be governed by the same legal regime. The phenomenon to&para;<br>which Congress responded is not new: Distortions of the&para;<br>same order occurred with greater frequency—and to the&para;<br>detriment of both foreign and domestic authors—when,&para;<br>before 1891, foreign works were excluded entirely from&para;<br>U. S. copyright protection. See Kampelman, The United&para;<br>States and International Copyright, 41 Am. J. Int’l L. 406,&para;<br>413 (1947) (“American readers were less inclined to read&para;<br>the novels of Cooper or Hawthorne for a dollar when they&para;<br>could buy a novel of Scott or Dickens for a quarter.”).&para;<br>Section 514 continued the trend toward a harmonized&para;<br>copyright regime by placing foreign works in the position&para;<br>they would have occupied if the current regime had been&para;<br>in effect when those works were created and first published. Authors once deprived of protection are spared the&para;<br>continuing effects of that initial deprivation; §514 gives&para;<br>them nothing more than the benefit of their labors during&para;<br>whatever time remains before the normal copyright term&para;<br>expires.35&para;<br>Unlike petitioners, the dissent makes much of the socalled “orphan works” problem. See post, at 11–14, 23–24.&para;<br>We readily acknowledge the difficulties would-be users of&para;<br>copyrightable materials may face in identifying or locating&para;<br>copyright owners. See generally U. S. Copyright Office,&para;<br>Report on Orphan Works 21–40 (2006). But as the dissent&para;<br>concedes, see post, at 13, this difficulty is hardly peculiar&para;<br>to works restored under §514.

Most of the works affected by §514 got there after a term&para;<br>of zero or a term cut short by failure to observe U. S. formalities. See&para;<br>supra, at 9.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Despite&para;<br>“longstanding efforts,” see Authors Guild, 770 F.

S. C., 1985, c. C–42, §77 (authorizing Copyright Board to license use of orphan works&para;<br>by persons unable, after making reasonable efforts, to&para;<br>locate the copyright owner). Heretofore, no one has suggested that the orphan-works issue should be addressed&para;<br>through our implementation of Berne, rather than&para;<br>through overarching legislation of the sort proposed in&para;<br>Congress and cited by the dissent.

The Constitution’s words, “exclusive Right,”&para;<br>“limited Times,” “Progress of Science,” viewed through the&para;<br>lens of history underscore the legal significance of what&para;<br>the Court in Eldred referred to as the “economic philoso­&para;<br>phy behind the Copyright Clause.” 537 U. S., at 212, n. 18&para;<br>(brackets omitted). That philosophy understands copy­&para;<br>right’s grants of limited monopoly privileges to authors as&para;<br>private benefits that are conferred for a public reason—to&para;<br>elicit new creation.&para;<br>Yet, as the Founders recognized, monopoly is a two­&para;<br>edged sword. On the one hand, it can encourage produc­&para;<br>tion of new works. In the absence of copyright protection,&para;<br>anyone might freely copy the products of an author’s&para;<br>creative labor, appropriating the benefits without incur­&para;<br>ring the nonrepeatable costs of creation, thereby deterring&para;<br>authors from exerting themselves in the first place. On&para;<br>the other hand, copyright tends to restrict the dissemina­&para;<br>tion (and use) of works once produced either because the&para;<br>absence of competition translates directly into higher&para;<br>consumer prices or because the need to secure copying&para;<br>permission sometimes imposes administrative costs that&para;<br>make it difficult for potential users of a copyrighted work&para;<br>to find its owner and strike a bargain.

That&para;<br>statute sought in part to control, and to limit, preexisting&para;<br>monopolies that had emerged in the book trade as a result&para;<br>of the Crown’s having previously granted special privileg­&para;<br>es to royal favorites. The Crown, for example, had char­&para;<br>tered the Stationers’ Company, permitting it to regulate&para;<br>and to censor works on the government’s behalf. The&para;<br>Stationers had thereby acquired control over the disposi­&para;<br>tion of copies of published works, from which emerged&para;<br>the Stationers’ copyright—a right conferred on company&para;<br>members, not authors, that was deemed to exist in perpe­&para;<br>tuity.

Thomas Jefferson, for&para;<br>example, initially expressed great uncertainty as to&para;<br>whether the Constitution should authorize the grant of&para;<br>copyrights and patents at all, writing that “the benefit&para;<br>even of limited monopolies is too doubtful” to warrant&para;<br>anything other than their “suppression.” Letter from&para;<br>Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13&para;<br>Papers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 443 (J.

But&para;<br>he argued that “in certain cases” such as copyright, mo­&para;<br>nopolies should “be granted” (“with caution, and guarded&para;<br>with strictness agst abuse”) to serve as “compensation&para;<br>for a benefit actually gained to the community . . . which&para;<br>the owner might otherwise withhold from public use.” Mo­&para;<br>nopolies.

Jefferson eventually came to&para;<br>agree with Madison, supporting a limited conferral of&para;<br>monopoly rights but only “as an encouragement to men to&para;<br>pursue ideas which may produce utility.” Letter from&para;<br>Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813), in 6&para;<br>Papers of Thomas Jefferson, at 379, 383 (J. Looney ed.&para;<br>2009) (emphasis added).&para;<br>This utilitarian view of copyrights and patents, em­&para;<br>braced by Jefferson and Madison, stands in contrast to the&para;<br>“natural rights” view underlying much of continental&para;<br>European copyright law—a view that the English&para;<br>booksellers promoted in an effort to limit their losses&para;<br>following the enactment of the Statute of Anne and that in&para;<br>part motivated the enactment of some of the colonial&para;<br>statutes. Patterson 158–179, 183–192. Premised on the&para;<br>idea that an author or inventor has an inherent right to&para;<br>the fruits of his labor, it mythically stems from a legend­&para;<br>ary 6th-century statement of King Diarmed “ ‘to every cow&para;<br>her calf, and accordingly to every book its copy.’ ” A.&para;<br>Birrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copy­&para;<br>right in Books 42 (1899). That view, though perhaps&para;<br>reflected in the Court’s opinion, ante, at 30, runs contrary&para;<br>to the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of&para;<br>our own Constitution’s Copyright Clause. See S. Rick­&para;<br>etson, The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary&para;<br>and Artistic Works: 1886–1986, pp. 5–6 (1987) (The first&para;<br>French copyright laws “placed authors’ rights on a more&para;<br>elevated basis than the Act of Anne had done,” on the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v.

Stewart, International Copyright&para;<br>and Neighbouring Rights 6–7 (2d ed. 1989) (describing the&para;<br>European system of droit d’auteur).&para;<br>This utilitarian understanding of the Copyright Clause&para;<br>has long been reflected in the Court’s case law. In Mazer,&para;<br>for example, the Court refers to copyright as embodying&para;<br>the view that “encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare&para;<br>through the talents of authors and inventors.” 347 U. S.,&para;<br>at 219 (emphasis added). In Twentieth Century Music&para;<br>Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151 (1975), the Court says that&para;<br>underlying copyright is the understanding that “[c]reative&para;<br>work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad&para;<br>public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.”&para;<br>Id., at 156 (emphasis added). And in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), the&para;<br>Court, speaking of both copyrights and patents, points out&para;<br>that the “monopoly privileges that Congress may author­&para;<br>ize are . . . [not] primarily designed to provide a special&para;<br>private benefit. Rather, the limited grant is a means by&para;<br>which an important public purpose may be achieved. It is&para;<br>intended to motivate the creative activity of authors . . . by&para;<br>the provision of a special reward.” Id., at 429 (emphasis&para;<br>added); see also, e.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas&para;<br>City, 383 U. S. 1, 6 (1966) (The “constitutional command&para;<br>. . . ‘[to] promote the Progress [of Science]’ . . . is the standard expressed in the Constitution and it may not be ig­&para;<br>nored”); Fox Film Corp. v.

Thus, for example, an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>1892 House Report states:&para;<br>“The object to be attained and the reason for the con­&para;<br>stitutional grant of power are imbedded in the grant&para;<br>itself. They are ‘to promote the progress of science&para;<br>and the useful arts.’ . . . [The Clause says] nothing . . .&para;<br>about any desire or purpose to secure to the author or&para;<br>inventor his ‘natural right to his property.’ ” H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 1494, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2.&para;<br>Similarly, the congressional authors of the landmark 1909&para;<br>Copyright Act wrote:&para;<br>“The Constitution . . . provides that Congress shall&para;<br>have the power to grant [copyrights] . . . [n]ot primari­&para;<br>ly for the benefit of the author, . . . but because the&para;<br>policy is believed to be for the benefit of the great body&para;<br>of people, in that it will stimulate writing and invention, to give some bonus to authors and inventors.”&para;<br>H. R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).&para;<br>And they went on to say:&para;<br>“Congress must consider . . . two questions: First, how&para;<br>much will the legislation stimulate the producer and&para;<br>so benefit the public; and, second, how much will the&para;<br>monopoly granted be detrimental to the public? The&para;<br>granting of such exclusive rights, under the proper&para;<br>terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the pub­&para;<br>lic that outweighs the evils of the temporary monop­&para;<br>oly.” Ibid.&para;<br>The upshot is that text, history, and precedent demon­&para;<br>strate that the Copyright Clause places great value on the&para;<br>power of copyright to elicit new production. Congress in&para;<br>particular cases may determine that copyright’s ability to&para;<br>do so outweighs any concomitant high prices, administra­&para;<br>tive costs, and restrictions on dissemination. And when it&para;<br>does so, we must respect its judgment. See Eldred, 537&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S., at 222. But does the Clause empower Congress to&para;<br>enact a statute that withdraws works from the public&para;<br>domain, brings about higher prices and costs, and in doing&para;<br>so seriously restricts dissemination, particularly to those&para;<br>who need it for scholarly, educational, or cultural purposes—all without providing any additional incentive for&para;<br>the production of new material? That is the question&para;<br>before us. And, as I have said, I believe the answer is no.&para;<br>Congress in this statute has exceeded what are, under any&para;<br>plausible reading of the Copyright Clause, its permissible&para;<br>limits.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Act before us says that it “restores” American copy­&para;<br>right to a set of works, which, for the most part, did not&para;<br>previously enjoy American copyright protection. These&para;<br>works had fallen into America’s public domain, but as of&para;<br>the “restoration” date, they had not yet fallen into the pub­&para;<br>lic domain of the foreign country where they originated.&para;<br>The statute covers works originating almost anywhere&para;<br>outside the United States. See 17 U. S. C. §104A(h)(3)&para;<br>(setting out eligibility criteria); U. S. Copyright Office,&para;<br>Circular No. 38A: International Copyright Relations of the&para;<br>United States (2010). The relevant set of works consists&para;<br>primarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain,&para;<br>or at some point lost, American copyright protection be­&para;<br>cause (1) the author failed to comply with applicable&para;<br>American copyright formalities (such as notice or renew­&para;<br>al), or (2) the nation in which they were first published&para;<br>then lacked copyright relations with the United States, or&para;<br>(3) they are sound recordings fixed before February 15,&para;<br>1972. §104A(h)(6)(C). A work must also satisfy other&para;<br>technical requirements: It must have had a rightholder&para;<br>who was a national or resident of an eligible country on&para;<br>the day it was created; and it cannot have been published&para;<br>in the United States within 30 days of its first publication.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§104A(h)(6)(D). The Act grants these works a copyright&para;<br>that expires at the time it would have expired had the&para;<br>author obtained a full American copyright term starting&para;<br>from the date on which the work was first published (in&para;<br>the foreign country). §104A(a)(1)(B).&para;<br>The Act mainly applies to works first published abroad&para;<br>between 1923 and 1989. It does not apply significantly to&para;<br>earlier works because any work published before 1921&para;<br>would have fallen into the public domain before 1977 had&para;<br>it received a full American copyright term, while works&para;<br>published between 1921 and 1923 obtained a “restored”&para;<br>copyright that expired before the 1998 Sonny Bono Copy­&para;<br>right Term Extension Act, and so could have lasted two&para;<br>years at most. See Tit. I, §101, 90 Stat. 2574 (extending&para;<br>the copyright term of works still under copyright in 1977&para;<br>to 75 years); 17 U. S. C. §304(b) (extending the copyright&para;<br>term of works still under copyright in 1998 to 95 years). It&para;<br>has less impact on more recent works because in 1989&para;<br>the United States became a Berne member, abolished the&para;<br>copyright notice requirement, and thenceforth provided&para;<br>prospective copyright protection throughout the Berne&para;<br>Union. See R. Schechter &amp; J.

C. §§401–406).&para;<br>Despite these temporal limitations, the Act covers vast&para;<br>numbers of works. The first category includes works&para;<br>published in countries that had copyright relations with&para;<br>the United States during this time period, such as most of&para;<br>Western Europe and Latin America, Australia, and Japan,&para;<br>see Circular No. 38A, supra, at 2–10, whose authors did&para;<br>not satisfy American copyright formalities, perhaps be­&para;<br>cause the author, who may not have sought an American&para;<br>copyright, published the book abroad without proper&para;<br>American notice, or perhaps because the author obtained a&para;<br>valid American copyright but failed to renew it.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v.

And, as the&para;<br>Court recognizes, an orchestra that once could perform&para;<br>“Peter and the Wolf . . . free of charge” will now have to&para;<br>buy the “right to perform it . . . in the marketplace.” Ante,&para;<br>at 29. But for the case of certain “derivative” works,&para;<br>§104A(d)(3), the “restored copyright” holder, like other&para;<br>copyright holders, can charge what the market will bear.&para;<br>If a school orchestra or other nonprofit organization can­&para;<br>not afford the new charges, so be it. They will have to do&para;<br>without—aggravating the already serious problem of&para;<br>cultural education in the United States.

Congress has tried to ease the administrative&para;<br>burden of contacting copyright holders and negotiating&para;<br>prices for those whom the statute calls “reliance part[ies],”&para;<br>namely those who previously had used such works when&para;<br>they were freely available in the public domain.&para;<br>§104A(h)(4). But Congress has done nothing to ease the&para;<br>administrative burden of securing permission from copy­&para;<br>right owners that is placed upon those who want to use a&para;<br>work that they did not previously use, and this is a partic­&para;<br>ular problem when it comes to “orphan works”—older and&para;<br>more obscure works with minimal commercial value that&para;<br>have copyright owners who are difficult or impossible to&para;<br>track down. Unusually high administrative costs threaten&para;<br>to limit severely the distribution and use of those works—&para;<br>works which, despite their characteristic lack of economic&para;<br>value, can prove culturally invaluable.&para;<br>There are millions of such works.

They will tempt some potential&para;<br>users to “steal” or “pirate” works rather than do without.&para;<br>And piracy often begets piracy, breeding the destructive&para;<br>habit of taking copyrighted works without paying for&para;<br>them, even where payment is possible. Such habits&para;<br>ignore the critical role copyright plays in the creation&para;<br>of new works, while reflecting a false belief that new&para;<br>creation appears by magic without thought or hope of&para;<br>compensation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>I recognize that ordinary copyright protection also&para;<br>comes accompanied with dissemination-restricting royalty&para;<br>charges and administrative costs. But here the re­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>strictions work special harm. For one thing, the foreign&para;<br>location of restored works means higher than ordinary&para;<br>administrative costs. For another, the statute’s technical&para;<br>requirements make it very difficult to establish whether a&para;<br>work has had its copyright restored by the statute. Gard,&para;<br>In the Trenches with §104A: An Evaluation of the Parties’&para;<br>Arguments in Golan v. Holder as It Heads to the Supreme&para;<br>Court, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 199, 216–220 (2011)&para;<br>(describing difficulties encountered in compiling the in­&para;<br>formation necessary to create an online tool to determine&para;<br>whether the statute applies in any given case).&para;<br>Worst of all, “restored copyright” protection removes&para;<br>material from the public domain. In doing so, it reverses&para;<br>the payment expectations of those who used, or intended&para;<br>to use, works that they thought belonged to them. Were&para;<br>Congress to act similarly with respect to well-established&para;<br>property rights, the problem would be obvious. This stat­&para;<br>ute analogously restricts, and thereby diminishes, Ameri­&para;<br>cans’ preexisting freedom to use formerly public domain&para;<br>material in their expressive activities.&para;<br>Thus, while the majority correctly observes that the&para;<br>dissemination-restricting harms of copyright normally&para;<br>present problems appropriate for legislation to resolve,&para;<br>ante, at 31–32, the question is whether the Copyright&para;<br>Clause permits Congress seriously to exacerbate such a&para;<br>problem by taking works out of the public domain without&para;<br>a countervailing benefit. This question is appropriate for&para;<br>judicial resolution. Indeed, unlike Eldred where the Court&para;<br>had to decide a complicated line-drawing question—when&para;<br>is a copyright term too long?—here an easily administra­&para;<br>ble standard is available—a standard that would require&para;<br>works that have already fallen into the public domain to&para;<br>stay there.&para;<br>The several, just mentioned features of the present&para;<br>statute are important, for they distinguish it from other&para;<br>copyright laws. By removing material from the public&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>domain, the statute, in literal terms, “abridges” a preexist­&para;<br>ing freedom to speak. In practical terms, members of the&para;<br>public might well have decided what to say, as well as&para;<br>when and how to say it, in part by reviewing with a view&para;<br>to repeating, expression that they reasonably believed&para;<br>was, or would be, freely available. Given these speech&para;<br>implications, it is not surprising that Congress has long&para;<br>sought to protect public domain material when revising&para;<br>the copyright laws. See infra, at 19 (listing instances).&para;<br>And this Court has assumed the particular importance of&para;<br>public domain material in roughly analogous circumstanc­&para;<br>es. See Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 (“Congress may not au­&para;<br>thorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove&para;<br>existent knowledge from the public domain”); Kewanee Oil&para;<br>Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 484 (1974) (trade secret&para;<br>protection is not incompatible with “policy that matter&para;<br>once in the public domain must remain in the public do­&para;<br>main”); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,&para;<br>496 (1975) (First Amendment prohibits sanctioning press&para;<br>for publishing material disclosed in public court docu­&para;<br>ments); see also Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox&para;<br>Film Corp., 539 U. S. 23, 33 (2003) (“The right to copy . . .&para;<br>once a copyright has expired . . . passes to the public”&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Moreover, whereas forward-looking copyright laws tend&para;<br>to benefit those whose identities are not yet known (the&para;<br>writer who has not yet written a book, the musician who&para;<br>has not yet composed a song), when a copyright law is&para;<br>primarily backward looking the risk is greater that Con­&para;<br>gress is trying to help known beneficiaries at the expense&para;<br>of badly organized unknown users who find it difficult to&para;<br>argue and present their case to Congress. In Eldred, I&para;<br>thought this problem was severe. See generally 537 U. S.,&para;<br>at 243–266 (dissenting opinion). And in light of the fact&para;<br>that Congress, with one minor exception, heard testimony&para;<br>only from the representatives of existing copyright hold­&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ers, who hoped that passage of the statute would enable&para;<br>them to benefit from reciprocal treatment of American&para;<br>authors abroad, infra, at 21, I cannot say that even here&para;<br>the problem, while much diminished, was nonexistent.&para;<br>I agree with the majority that, in doing so, this statute&para;<br>does not discriminate among speakers based on their&para;<br>viewpoints or subject matter. Ante, at 27. But such con­&para;<br>siderations do not exhaust potential First Amendment&para;<br>problems. Cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2011) (slip op., at 8) (finding First Amendment prob­&para;<br>lem in statute that prohibits drug manufacturers from&para;<br>using publicly available prescriber-identifying information&para;<br>in their marketing efforts in part because it “disfavor[ed]&para;<br>specific speakers”); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.&para;<br>FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 659 (1994) (“Regulations that discrim­&para;<br>inate among media, or among different speakers within a&para;<br>single medium, often present serious First Amendment&para;<br>concerns”).&para;<br>Taken together, these speech-related harms (e.g., re­&para;<br>stricting use of previously available material; reversing&para;<br>payment expectations; rewarding rent-seekers at the&para;<br>public’s expense) at least show the presence of a First&para;<br>Amendment interest. And that is enough. For present&para;<br>purposes, I need not decide whether the harms to that&para;<br>interest show a violation of the First Amendment. I need&para;<br>only point to the importance of interpreting the Constitu­&para;<br>tion as a single document—a document that we should not&para;<br>read as setting the Copyright Clause and the First&para;<br>Amendment at cross-purposes. Nor need I advocate the&para;<br>application here of strict or specially heightened review. I&para;<br>need only find that the First Amendment interest is im­&para;<br>portant enough to require courts to scrutinize with some&para;<br>care the reasons claimed to justify the Act in order to&para;<br>determine whether they constitute reasonable copyright­&para;<br>related justifications for the serious harms, including&para;<br>speech-related harms, which the Act seems likely to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>impose.&para;<br>C&para;<br>1&para;<br>This statute does not serve copyright’s traditional public&para;<br>ends, namely the creation of monetary awards that “moti­&para;<br>vate the creative activity of authors,” Sony, 464 U. S.,&para;<br>at 429, “encourag[e] individual effort,” Mazer, 347 U. S.,&para;<br>at 219, and thereby “serve the cause of promoting broad&para;<br>public availability of literature, music, and the other arts,”&para;<br>Twentieth Century Music, 422 U. S., at 156. The statute&para;<br>grants its “restored copyright[s]” only to works already&para;<br>produced. It provides no monetary incentive to produce&para;<br>anything new. Unlike other American copyright statutes&para;<br>from the time of the Founders onwards, including the&para;<br>statute at issue in Eldred, it lacks any significant copy­&para;<br>right-related quid pro quo.&para;<br>The majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by refer­&para;<br>ring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests&para;<br>that Congress may provide new or increased protection&para;<br>both to newly created and to previously created, works.&para;<br>Ante, at 16, 18; Act of May 31, 1790, §1, 1 Stat. 124 (con­&para;<br>ferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as&para;<br>old); Act of July 3, 1832, §3, 4 Stat. 559 (authorizing new&para;<br>patents for past and future inventors who inadvertently&para;<br>failed to comply with applicable statutory formalities);&para;<br>McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 How. 202 (1843) (applying an act&para;<br>deeming a past or future inventor’s patent valid despite it&para;<br>being briefly used by, for example, the inventor’s employ­&para;<br>er). I do not dispute that copyright power. Insofar as such&para;<br>a statute does the former, i.e., extends protection to newly&para;<br>created material, it embodies copyright’s traditional justi­&para;<br>fication—eliciting new production. And I do not doubt&para;<br>that Congress may then also include existing works within&para;<br>the scope of, say, increased protection for equitable and&para;<br>administrative reasons. See Eldred, 537 U. S. at 204,&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>214–215 (describing equitable reasons for applying newly&para;<br>extended copyright terms to future and existing copyrights&para;<br>alike). The statute before us, however, does not directly&para;<br>elicit any new production. Compare id., at 204–208; (ma­&para;<br>jority opinion) (noting that statute’s extended term would&para;<br>apply to newly created material, and finding that the&para;<br>determination of the likelihood of its eliciting new produc­&para;<br>tion in practice was a matter for Congress to determine),&para;<br>with id., at 243–267 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (expressing&para;<br>the view that there is little likelihood, in practice, that the&para;<br>statute would elicit new material). See also Walterscheid&para;<br>219 (the 1790 Congress likely thought it was substituting&para;<br>federal protection for preexisting state common-law pro­&para;<br>tections); Maher, Copyright Term, Retrospective Exten­&para;<br>sion, and the Copyright Law of 1790 in Historical Context,&para;<br>49 J. Copyright Soc. USA 1021, 1023–1024, and n. 8&para;<br>(2002) (numerical estimate suggesting that 1790 Act&para;<br>removed only a small number of books from public&para;<br>domain).&para;<br>The other statutes to which the majority refers are&para;<br>private bills, statutes retroactively granting protection in&para;<br>wartime, or the like. Ante, at 16–19; Act of Feb. 19, 1849,&para;<br>ch. 57, 9 Stat. 763 (Levi Corson); Act of June 23, 1874, ch.&para;<br>534, 18 Stat., pt. 3, p. 618 (Tod Helmuth); Act of Feb. 17,&para;<br>1898, ch. 29, 30 Stat. 1396 (Judson Jones); Act of Dec. 18,&para;<br>1919, ch. 11, 41 Stat. 368; Act of Sept. 25, 1941, ch. 421, 55&para;<br>Stat. 732; see also Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch 199 (1815)&para;<br>(upholding a private bill restoring patent protection to a&para;<br>flour mill). But special circumstances, like wars, hurri­&para;<br>canes, earthquakes, and other disasters, prevent the&para;<br>realization in practice of a reasonable expectation of secur­&para;<br>ing or maintaining a preexisting right. Private bills are&para;<br>designed to provide special exceptions for comparable&para;<br>equitable reasons. See also Act of Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 215,&para;<br>27 Stat. 743 (similar, as far as I can tell). To find in these&para;<br>laws an important analogy to the present law, which for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the most part covers works that the author did not expect&para;<br>to protect in America (and often did not particularly want&para;<br>to protect), seems somewhat farfetched.&para;<br>In fact, Congressional practice shows the contrary. It&para;<br>consists of a virtually unbroken string of legislation pre­&para;<br>venting the withdrawal of works from the public domain.&para;<br>See, e.g., Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988,&para;<br>§12, 102 Stat. 2860 (the Act “does not provide copyright&para;<br>protection for any work that is in the public domain in the&para;<br>United States”); Copyright Act of 1976, Tit. I, §101, 90&para;<br>Stat. 2573 (declining to extend copyright protection to any&para;<br>work that is in the public domain prior to the Act taking&para;<br>effect); Copyright Act of 1909, §7, 35 Stat. 1077 (“[N]o&para;<br>copyright shall subsist in the original text of any work&para;<br>which is in the public domain, or in any work which was&para;<br>published in this country or any foreign country prior to&para;<br>the going into effect of this Act and has not been already&para;<br>copyrighted in the United States”); Act to Amend the&para;<br>Several Acts Respecting Copy Rights §16, 4 Stat. 439 (the&para;<br>Act “shall not extend to any copyright heretofore secured,&para;<br>the term of which has already expired”); see also H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 1742, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1962) (expressing&para;<br>concern that because “it is not possible to revive expired&para;<br>terms of copyright, it seems to the committee to be desira­&para;<br>ble to suspend further expiration of copyright for a period&para;<br>long enough to enable the working out of remaining obsta­&para;<br>cles to the overall revision of the copyright law”).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The majority makes several other arguments. First, it&para;<br>argues that the Clause does not require the “creation of at&para;<br>least one new work,” ante, at 20, but may instead “promote&para;<br>the Progress of Science” in other ways. And it specifically&para;<br>mentions the “dissemination of existing and future works”&para;<br>as determinative here. Ante, at 20–23, and n. 25. The&para;<br>industry experts to whom the majority refers argue that&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>copyright protection of already existing works can help,&para;<br>say, music publishers or film distributers raise prices,&para;<br>produce extra profits and consequently lead them to pub­&para;<br>lish or distribute works they might otherwise have ig­&para;<br>nored. But ordinarily a copyright—since it is a monopoly&para;<br>on copying—restricts dissemination of a work once pro­&para;<br>duced compared to a competitive market. And simply&para;<br>making the industry richer does not mean that the indus­&para;<br>try, when it makes an ordinary forward-looking economic&para;<br>calculus, will distribute works not previously distributed.&para;<br>The industry experts might mean that temporary extra&para;<br>profits will lead them to invest in the development of a&para;<br>market, say, by advertising. But this kind of argument,&para;<br>which can be made by distributers of all sorts of goods,&para;<br>ranging from kiwi fruit to Swedish furniture, has little&para;<br>if anything to do with the nonrepeatable costs of initial&para;<br>creation, which is the special concern of copyright protec­&para;<br>tion. See supra, at 2–3.&para;<br>Moreover, the argument proves too much. It is the kind&para;<br>of argument that the Stationers’ Company might well&para;<br>have made and which the British Parliament rejected. Cf.&para;<br>Patterson 154–155 (describing failed booksellers’ bill&para;<br>seeking protection from foreign competition through an&para;<br>extension of the copyright term). It is the kind of argu­&para;<br>ment that could justify a legislature’s withdrawing from&para;<br>the public domain the works, say, of Hawthorne or of Swift&para;<br>or for that matter the King James Bible in order to en­&para;<br>courage further publication of those works; and, it could&para;<br>even more easily justify similar action in the case of lesser&para;<br>known early works, perhaps those of the Venerable Bede.&para;<br>The Court has not, to my knowledge, previously accepted&para;<br>such a rationale—a rationale well removed from the spe­&para;<br>cial economic circumstances that surround the nonrepeat­&para;<br>able costs of the initial creation of a “Writing.” Supra, at&para;<br>2. And I fear that doing so would read the Copyright&para;<br>Clause as if it were a blank check made out in favor of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>those who are not themselves creators.&para;<br>It is not surprising that the copyright holders’ repre­&para;<br>sentatives who appeared before Congress did not empha­&para;<br>size this argument. (With one minor exception only those&para;<br>representatives appeared, see generally Joint Hearing; the&para;<br>Copyright Office did not testify, id., at 239.) Rather, they&para;<br>focused on the Berne Convention itself. By that time,&para;<br>Congress had already protected all new works of Berne&para;<br>members. But it had not provided additional protection to&para;<br>preexisting foreign works that were then in the American&para;<br>public domain. Industry witnesses testified that with­&para;<br>drawing such works from the American public domain&para;<br>would permit foreign copyright owners to charge American&para;<br>consumers more for their products; and that, as a result,&para;<br>the United States would be able to persuade foreign coun­&para;<br>tries to allow American holders of preexisting copyrights&para;<br>to charge foreign customers more money for their prod­&para;<br>ucts. See id., at 241 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive&para;<br>Director and General Counsel, International Intellectual&para;<br>Property Alliance) (“[F]ailure to [comply with Article 18]&para;<br>will . . . undermine the ability of the United States to press&para;<br>other countries to implement the same sort of protection in&para;<br>their implementing legislation currently pending in many&para;<br>legislatures around the globe”); id., at 253 (statement of&para;<br>Matt Gerson, Vice President for Congressional Affairs,&para;<br>Motion Picture Assn. of America) (similar). See also id., at&para;<br>85 (statement of Xavier Becerra, House Judiciary Commit­&para;<br>tee member) (“[R]etroactivity . . . is probably the best way&para;<br>to ensure that some of our older American works, any­&para;<br>thing from Motown, to ‘Star Trek,’ to ‘The Hardy Boys’ get&para;<br>the protection in some of these emerging foreign markets.&para;<br>It is important to ensure that countries no longer use our&para;<br>U. S. law as an excuse for not extending retroactive copy­&para;<br>right protections to some of our own works”). But see&para;<br>id., at 272–279 (statement of Larry Urbanski, Chairman&para;<br>of the Fairness in Copyright Coalition and President of&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v. HOLDER&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Moviecraft Inc.) (testifying against restoration on grounds&para;<br>similar to those set out, supra, at 10–13).&para;<br>This argument, whatever its intrinsic merits, is an ar­&para;<br>gument that directly concerns a private benefit: how to&para;<br>obtain more money from the sales of existing products. It&para;<br>is not an argument about a public benefit, such as how to&para;<br>promote or to protect the creative process.&para;<br>Third, the majority points out that the statute “gives&para;<br>[authors] nothing more than the benefit of their labors&para;<br>during whatever time remains before the normal copyright&para;<br>term expires.” Ante, at 30. But insofar as it suggests that&para;<br>copyright should in general help authors obtain greater&para;<br>monetary rewards than needed to elicit new works, it rests&para;<br>upon primarily European, but not American, copyright&para;<br>concepts. See supra, at 5–6.&para;<br>Fourth, the majority argues that this statutory provi­&para;<br>sion is necessary to fulfill our Berne Convention obliga­&para;<br>tions. Ante, at 4–8. The Treaty, in Article 18, says that&para;<br>the “Convention shall apply to all works which, at the&para;<br>moment of its coming into force [i.e., 1989 in the case of&para;<br>the United States] have not yet fallen into the public&para;<br>domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the&para;<br>term of protection.” Berne Convention for the Protection&para;<br>of Literary and Artistic Works, Art. 18(1), Sept. 9, 1886, as&para;<br>revised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, 828 U. N. T. S. 221,&para;<br>251. The majority and Government say that this means&para;<br>we must protect the foreign works at issue here. And&para;<br>since the Berne Convention, taken as a whole, provides&para;<br>incentives for the creation of new works, I am willing to&para;<br>speculate, for argument’s sake, that the statute might&para;<br>indirectly encourage production of new works by making&para;<br>the United States’ place in the international copyright&para;<br>regime more secure.&para;<br>Still, I cannot find this argument sufficient to save the&para;<br>statute. For one thing, this is a dilemma of the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s own making. The United States obtained the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>benefits of Berne for many years despite its failure to&para;<br>enact a statute implementing Article 18. But in 1994, the&para;<br>United States and other nations signed the Agreement on&para;<br>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,&para;<br>which enabled signatories to use World Trade Organiza­&para;<br>tion dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about&para;<br>other members’ Berne Convention violations. And at that&para;<br>time the Government, although it successfully secured&para;<br>reservations protecting other special features of American&para;<br>copyright law, made no effort to secure a reservation&para;<br>permitting the United States to keep some or all restored&para;<br>works in the American public domain. Indeed, it made no&para;<br>effort to do so despite the fact that Article 18 explicitly&para;<br>authorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the Arti­&para;<br>cle’s retroactivity principle. See Art. 18(3), ibid. (“The&para;<br>application of [the retroactivity] principle shall be subject&para;<br>to any provisions contained in special conventions to that&para;<br>effect existing or to be concluded between countries of the&para;<br>Union” (emphasis added)); Gervais, Golan v. Holder: A&para;<br>Look at the Constraints Imposed by the Berne Conven­&para;<br>tion, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 147, 151–152 (2011); Gard,&para;<br>64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc, at 206.&para;<br>For another thing, the Convention does not require&para;<br>Congress to enact a statute that causes so much damage&para;<br>to public domain material. Article 18(3) also states that&para;<br>“the respective countries shall determine, each in so far as&para;<br>it is concerned, the conditions of application of this principle.” 18 U. N. T. S., at 251 (emphasis added). Congress&para;<br>could have alleviated many of the costs that the statute&para;<br>imposes by, for example, creating forms of compulsory&para;<br>licensing, requiring “restored copyright” holders to provide&para;<br>necessary administrative information as a condition of&para;<br>protection, or insisting upon “reasonable royalties.” Cf.&para;<br>S. 2913, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (legislation that&para;<br>would have limited judicial remedies against users of&para;<br>orphan works); H. R. 5889, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008)&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>GOLAN v.

Rather, it is to argue that the other branches of&para;<br>Government should have tried to follow the Convention&para;<br>and in particular its provisions offering compliance flexi­&para;<br>bility. The fact that the statute has significant First&para;<br>Amendment costs is relevant in this respect, for that&para;<br>Amendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less&para;<br>restrictive, alternative possibilities. Doing so here, reveals&para;<br>that neither Congress nor the Executive took advantage of&para;<br>less-restrictive methods of compliance that the Convention&para;<br>itself provides. And that fact means that the Convention&para;<br>cannot provide the statute with a constitutionally suffi­&para;<br>cient justification that is otherwise lacking.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The fact that, by withdrawing material from the public&para;<br>domain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow&para;<br>of information is sufficient, when combined with the other&para;<br>features of the statute that I have discussed, to convince&para;<br>me that the Copyright Clause, interpreted in the light of&para;<br>the First Amendment, does not authorize Congress to&para;<br>enact this statute.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent from the Court’s contrary&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
