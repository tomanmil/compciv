MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–820.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 11, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>When one parent abducts a child and flees to another country, the other&para;<br>parent may file a petition in that country for the return of the child&para;<br>pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention or Convention). If the&para;<br>parent files a petition within one year of the child’s removal, a court&para;<br>“shall order the return of the child forthwith.” But when the petition&para;<br>is filed after the 1-year period expires, the court “shall . . . order the&para;<br>return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now&para;<br>settled in its new environment.”&para;<br>Respondent Montoya Alvarez and petitioner Lozano resided with&para;<br>their daughter in London until November 2008, when Montoya Alvarez left with the child for a women’s shelter. In July 2009, Montoya&para;<br>Alvarez and the child left the United Kingdom and ultimately settled&para;<br>in New York. Lozano did not locate Montoya Alvarez and the child&para;<br>until November 2010, more than 16 months after Montoya Alvarez&para;<br>and the child had left the United Kingdom. At that point, Lozano&para;<br>filed a Petition for Return of Child pursuant to the Hague Convention&para;<br>in the Southern District of New York. Finding that the petition was&para;<br>filed more than one year after removal, the court denied the petition&para;<br>on the basis that the child was now settled in New York. It also held&para;<br>that the 1-year period could not be extended by equitable tolling. The&para;<br>Second Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Article 12’s 1-year period is not subject to equitable tolling.&para;<br>Pp. 7–16.&para;<br>(a) The doctrine of equitable tolling, as applied to federal statutes&para;<br>of limitations, extends an otherwise discrete limitations period set by&para;<br>Congress. Thus, whether tolling is available is fundamentally a&para;<br>question of statutory intent. Because Congress “legislate[s] against a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>background of common-law adjudicatory principles,” Astoria Fed.&para;<br>Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108, including equitable tolling, see Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397, equitable&para;<br>tolling is presumed to apply if the period in question is a statute of&para;<br>limitations and if tolling is consistent with the statute, Young v.&para;<br>United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) In assessing whether equitable tolling applies to treaties, which&para;<br>are “ ‘compact[s] between independent nations,’ ” Medellín v. Texas,&para;<br>552 U. S. 491, 505, this Court’s “duty [i]s to ascertain the intent of&para;<br>the parties” by looking to the document’s text and context, United&para;<br>States v. Choctaw Nation, 179 U. S. 494, 535. The parties to the&para;<br>Hague Convention did not intend equitable tolling to apply to Article&para;<br>12’s 1-year period. Pp. 8–16.&para;<br>(1) There is no general presumption that equitable tolling applies&para;<br>to treaties. Though part of the established backdrop of American&para;<br>law, equitable tolling has no proper role in the interpretation of treaties unless that principle is shared by the parties to the “agreement&para;<br>among sovereign powers,” Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516&para;<br>U. S. 217, 226. Lozano has identified no such shared principle among&para;<br>the Convention signatories, and the courts of several signatories have&para;<br>explicitly rejected equitable tolling of the Convention. Thus, the&para;<br>American presumption does not apply to this multilateral treaty.&para;<br>The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§11601–11610, which Congress enacted to implement the Convention, neither addresses the availability of equitable tolling nor purports to alter the Convention, and therefore does not affect this conclusion. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(2) Even if the Convention were subject to a presumption that&para;<br>statutes of limitations may be tolled, Article 12’s 1-year period is not&para;<br>a statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations embody a “policy of&para;<br>repose, designed to protect defendants,” Burnett v. New York Central&para;<br>R. Co., 380 U. S. 424, 428, and foster the “elimination of stale claims,&para;<br>and certainty about a plaintiff’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities,” Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555.&para;<br>Here, the remedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent—&para;<br>return of the child—continues to be available after one year, thus&para;<br>preserving the possibility of relief for that parent and preventing repose for the abducting parent. The period’s expiration also does not&para;<br>establish certainty about the parties’ respective rights. Instead, it&para;<br>opens the door to consideration of a third party’s interests, i.e., the&para;<br>child’s interest in settlement. Because that is not the sort of interest&para;<br>addressed by a statute of limitations, the 1-year period should not be&para;<br>treated as a statute of limitations. Young, supra, at 47, distinguished. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(3) Without a presumption of equitable tolling, the Convention&para;<br>does not support extending the 1-year period during concealment.&para;<br>Article 12 explicitly provides for the period to commence on “the date&para;<br>of the wrongful removal or retention” and makes no provision for an&para;<br>extension. Because the drafters did not choose to delay the period’s&para;<br>commencement until discovery of the child’s location—the obvious alternative to the date of wrongful removal—the natural implication is&para;<br>that they did not intend to commence the period on that later date.&para;<br>Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nonetheless consistent with&para;<br>the Convention’s goal of deterring child abductions, but the Convention does not pursue that goal at any cost, having recognized that the&para;<br>return remedy may be overcome by, e.g., the child’s interest in settlement. And the abducting parent does not necessarily profit by&para;<br>running out the clock, since both American courts and other Convention signatories have considered concealment as a factor in determining whether a child is settled. Equitable tolling is therefore neither&para;<br>required by the Convention nor the only available means to advance&para;<br>its objectives. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(4) Lozano contends that there is room for United States courts&para;<br>to apply equitable tolling because the Convention recognizes that&para;<br>other sources of law may permit signatory states to return abducted&para;<br>children even when return is not available or required by the Convention. But this contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling,&para;<br>which may be applied to the Hague Convention only if the treaty&para;<br>drafters so intended. For the foregoing reason, they did not. Pp. 15–&para;<br>16.&para;<br>697 F. 3d 41, affirmed.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The question in this case&para;<br>is whether that 1-year period is subject to equitable tolling&para;<br>when the abducting parent conceals the child’s location&para;<br>from the other parent. We hold that equitable tolling is&para;<br>not available.&para;<br>I&para;<br>To address “the problem of international child abduc­&para;<br>tions during domestic disputes,” Abbott v. Abbott, 560&para;<br>U. S. 1, 8 (2010), in 1980 the Hague Conference on Private&para;<br>International Law adopted the Convention on the Civil&para;<br>Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Conven­&para;<br>tion or Convention), T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc.&para;<br>No. 99–11 (Treaty Doc.). The Convention states two pri­&para;<br>mary objectives: “to secure the prompt return of children&para;<br>wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting&para;<br>State,” and “to ensure that rights of custody and of access&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>under the law of one Contracting State are effectively&para;<br>respected in the other Contracting States.” Art. 1, id.,&para;<br>at 7.&para;<br>To those ends, the Convention’s “central operating&para;<br>feature” is the return of the child. Abbott, 560 U. S., at 9.&para;<br>That remedy, in effect, lays venue for the ultimate custody&para;<br>determination in the child’s country of habitual residence&para;<br>rather than the country to which the child is abducted.&para;<br>See id., at 20 (“The Convention is based on the principle&para;<br>that the best interests of the child are well served when de­&para;<br>cisions regarding custody rights are made in the country&para;<br>of habitual residence”).&para;<br>The return remedy is not absolute. Article 13 excuses&para;<br>return where, for example, the left-behind parent was not&para;<br>“actually exercising” custody rights when the abducting&para;<br>parent removed the child, or where there is a “grave risk”&para;<br>that return would “place the child in an intolerable situa­&para;<br>tion.” Hague Convention, Arts. 13(a)–(b), Treaty Doc., at&para;<br>10. A state may also refuse to return the child if doing&para;<br>so would contravene “fundamental principles . . . relating&para;<br>to the protection of human rights and fundamental free­&para;<br>doms.” Art. 20, id., at 11.&para;<br>This case concerns another exception to the return&para;<br>remedy. Article 12 of the Convention states the general&para;<br>rule that when a court receives a petition for return within&para;<br>one year after the child’s wrongful removal, the court&para;<br>“shall order the return of the child forthwith.” Id., at 9.&para;<br>Article 12 further provides that the court,&para;<br>“where the proceedings have been commenced after&para;<br>the expiration of the period of one year [from the date&para;<br>of the wrongful removal], shall also order the return of&para;<br>the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is&para;<br>now settled in its new environment.” Ibid.&para;<br>Thus, at least in some cases, failure to file a petition&para;<br>for return within one year renders the return remedy&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unavailable.&para;<br>The United States ratified the Hague Convention in&para;<br>1988, and Congress implemented the Convention that&para;<br>same year through the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA). 102 Stat. 437, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§11601–11610. That statute instructs courts to “decide&para;<br>the case in accordance with the Convention.” §11603(d).&para;<br>Echoing the Convention, ICARA further provides that&para;<br>“[c]hildren who are wrongfully removed . . . are to be&para;<br>promptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set&para;<br>forth in the Convention applies.” §11601(a)(4). Finally,&para;<br>ICARA requires the abducting parent to establish by a&para;<br>preponderance of the evidence that Article 12’s exception&para;<br>to return applies. §11603(e)(2)(B).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Diana Lucia Montoya Alvarez and Manuel Jose Lozano&para;<br>are the parents of the girl at the center of this dispute.1&para;<br>Montoya Alvarez and Lozano met and began dating in&para;<br>London in early 2004. Montoya Alvarez gave birth to a&para;<br>daughter in October 2005.&para;<br>Montoya Alvarez and Lozano describe their relationship&para;<br>in starkly different terms. Lozano stated that they were&para;<br>“ ‘very happy together,’ ” albeit with “normal couple prob­&para;<br>lems.” In re Lozano, 809 F. Supp. 2d 197, 204 (SDNY&para;<br>2011). Montoya Alvarez described a pattern of physical&para;<br>and emotional abuse that included multiple incidents of&para;<br>rape and battery. The District Court found insufficient&para;<br>evidence to make specific findings about domestic violence&para;<br>but determined that Lozano’s claim that he never mis­&para;<br>treated Montoya Alvarez was “not credible.” Id., at 206.&para;<br>The parties also differ as to the child’s well-being during&para;<br>the first three years of her life. Lozano stated that he and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Except where otherwise noted, the facts are taken from the District&para;<br>Court’s findings. Like the courts below, we refer to Montoya Alvarez&para;<br>and Lozano’s daughter as “the child” to protect her identity.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the child had a very good relationship, and that the child&para;<br>was generally happy. Montoya Alvarez believed other­&para;<br>wise. In October 2008, Montoya Alvarez reported to the&para;<br>child’s doctor that she refused to speak at the nursery she&para;<br>attended, cried often, and wet the bed. Montoya Alvarez&para;<br>also stated that the child refused to speak when Lozano&para;<br>was present. The child’s nursery manager wrote that the&para;<br>girl was “ ‘very withdrawn,’ ” and noted that the home&para;<br>“ ‘environment obviously had a negative effect’ ” on her.&para;<br>Id., at 207. The District Court found insufficient evidence&para;<br>that Lozano had physically abused the child, but did con­&para;<br>clude that the child had seen and heard her parents argu­&para;<br>ing at home.&para;<br>In November 2008, when the child was just over three&para;<br>years old, Montoya Alvarez went to New York to visit her&para;<br>sister Maria. During that time, the child remained in&para;<br>London with Lozano and his visiting mother. When Mon­&para;<br>toya Alvarez returned on November 18, she became acutely&para;<br>concerned about the child’s fearful behavior around Lo­&para;<br>zano. The next day, Montoya Alvarez left with the child&para;<br>and never returned.&para;<br>Montoya Alvarez and the child lived at a women’s shel­&para;<br>ter for the next seven months. After Montoya Alvarez was&para;<br>unable to find suitable long-term accommodations in the&para;<br>United Kingdom, she and the child left for France on July&para;<br>3, 2009, and then for the United States, arriving five days&para;<br>later. Since their arrival, Montoya Alvarez and the child&para;<br>have lived with Montoya Alvarez’ sister Maria and her&para;<br>family in New York.&para;<br>When they arrived in New York, Montoya Alvarez and&para;<br>the child began seeing a therapist at a family medical&para;<br>clinic. The therapist testified that, at first, the child was&para;<br>withdrawn and would wet herself. The therapist diag­&para;<br>nosed her with posttraumatic stress disorder. Within six&para;<br>months, however, the therapist described her as “ ‘a com­&para;<br>pletely different child,’ ” who had stopped wetting herself,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was excited to play with friends, and was able to speak&para;<br>freely about her emotions. Id., at 212. When Montoya&para;<br>Alvarez and the child returned to the therapist after Lo­&para;<br>zano filed a petition for the child’s return, the therapist&para;<br>noted that the child was doing well but did not wish to see&para;<br>her father.&para;<br>In the meantime, Lozano attempted to find Montoya&para;<br>Alvarez and the child. Shortly after Montoya Alvarez left&para;<br>in November 2008, he called her sister Gloria in London,&para;<br>but eventually received legal advice not to speak with&para;<br>Montoya Alvarez’ family. A mediation service also sent&para;<br>several letters to Montoya Alvarez on Lozano’s behalf&para;<br>without receiving a response. In July 2009, Lozano filed&para;<br>an application for a court order in the United Kingdom “ ‘to&para;<br>ensure that he obtains regular contact with his [child] and&para;<br>plays an active role in [her] life.’ ” Id., at 210. He also&para;<br>sought court orders to compel Montoya Alvarez’ sisters&para;<br>and legal counsel, the child’s doctor and nursery, and&para;<br>various government offices in London to disclose the&para;<br>child’s whereabouts.&para;<br>On March 15, 2010, after determining that the child was&para;<br>not in the United Kingdom (and suspecting that the child&para;<br>was in New York), Lozano filed a form with the Hague&para;<br>Convention Central Authority for England and Wales&para;<br>seeking to have the child returned.2 The United States&para;<br>Central Authority—the Office of Children’s Issues in the&para;<br>Department of State, see 22 CFR §94.2 (2013)—received&para;<br>the application on March 23, 2010. After the Office of&para;<br>Children’s Issues confirmed that Montoya Alvarez had&para;<br>entered the United States, Lozano located Montoya Alva­&para;<br>rez’ address in New York. On November 10, 2010, more&para;<br>than 16 months after Montoya Alvarez and the child left&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Article 6 of the Hague Convention requires each Contracting State&para;<br>to “designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are&para;<br>imposed by the Convention upon such authorities.” Treaty Doc., at 8.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the United Kingdom, Lozano filed a Petition for Return of&para;<br>Child pursuant to the Hague Convention and ICARA, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §11603, in the United States District Court for the&para;<br>Southern District of New York.&para;<br>After a 2-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court&para;<br>denied Lozano’s petition. 809 F. Supp. 2d 197. The Dis­&para;<br>trict Court concluded that Lozano had stated a prima facie&para;<br>case of wrongful removal under the Hague Convention.&para;<br>Id., at 219–220. Prior to her removal, the child was a&para;<br>habitual resident of the United Kingdom, see Hague Con­&para;<br>vention, Art. 4, and Lozano had custody rights that he&para;<br>was actually exercising at the time of removal, see Arts.&para;<br>3(a)–(b).&para;<br>Because the petition was filed more than one year after&para;<br>the child’s wrongful removal, however, the District Court&para;<br>denied the petition on the basis that the child was now&para;<br>settled in New York. Id., at 230, 234. “Viewing the total­&para;<br>ity of the circumstances,” the court found sufficient indicia&para;<br>of “stability in her family, educational, social, and most&para;<br>importantly, home life,” id., at 233, to conclude that the&para;<br>child was settled in her current environment and that&para;<br>repatriation would be “extremely disruptive,” id., at 234.&para;<br>Lozano argued that the child should be returned forthwith&para;<br>because the 1-year period in Article 12 should be equitably&para;<br>tolled during the period that Montoya Alvarez concealed&para;<br>the child. The court rejected that argument, holding that&para;<br>the 1-year period could not be extended by equitable toll­&para;<br>ing.3 Id., at 228–229.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>District Court held in the alternative that even if equitable&para;<br>tolling could apply, it would not be warranted in this case because&para;<br>Lozano had contact information for Montoya Alvarez’ sister Maria in&para;<br>New York. Lozano’s solicitors did not attempt to contact Maria to&para;<br>determine if Montoya Alvarez and the child were there. 809 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d, at 229–230.&para;<br>Consistent with Second Circuit precedent, see Blondin v. Dubois, 238&para;<br>F. 3d 153, 164 (2001), the District Court also considered “whether to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the 1-year per­&para;<br>iod in Article 12 is not subject to equitable tolling. Accord­&para;<br>ing to the court, unlike a statute of limitations that would&para;<br>prohibit the filing of a return petition after one year, the&para;<br>1-year period in Article 12 merely permits courts, after that&para;<br>period has run, to consider the interests of the child in&para;<br>settlement. Id., at 52. The Second Circuit concluded that&para;<br>allowing equitable tolling to delay consideration of the&para;<br>child’s interests would undermine the purpose of the&para;<br>Hague Convention. Id., at 54.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide whether Article 12’s&para;<br>1-year period is subject to equitable tolling. 570 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2013). Compare 697 F. 3d, at 50–55 (equitable tolling not&para;<br>available); and Yaman v. Yaman, 730 F. 3d 1, 12–16 (CA1&para;<br>2013) (same), with Duarte v. Bardales, 526 F. 3d 563, 568–&para;<br>570 (CA9 2008) (equitable tolling available); and Furnes v.&para;<br>Reeves, 362 F. 3d 702, 723–724 (CA11 2004) (same). We&para;<br>hold that equitable tolling is not available, and therefore&para;<br>affirm.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although this case concerns the application of equitable&para;<br>tolling to a treaty, we begin with a more familiar context:&para;<br>equitable tolling of federal statutes of limitations. As a&para;<br>general matter, equitable tolling pauses the running of, or&para;<br>“tolls,” a statute of limitations when a litigant has pursued&para;<br>his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance&para;<br>prevents him from bringing a timely action. See, e.g., Pace&para;<br>v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005). Because the&para;<br>doctrine effectively extends an otherwise discrete limita­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>exercise its discretion and repatriate the child even though she is now&para;<br>settled in New York.” 809 F. Supp. 2d, at 234. The court declined to&para;<br>exercise that discretion because the “strong evidence that the child is&para;<br>quite settled in New York” outweighed Lozano’s “fairly diligent” search&para;<br>efforts and Montoya Alvarez’ conduct. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions period set by Congress, whether equitable tolling is&para;<br>available is fundamentally a question of statutory intent.&para;<br>See, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498&para;<br>U. S. 89, 95 (1990); Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S.&para;<br>467, 479–480 (1986); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484, 501&para;<br>(1967).&para;<br>As applied to federal statutes of limitations, the inquiry&para;<br>begins with the understanding that Congress “legislate[s]&para;<br>against a background of common-law adjudicatory princi­&para;<br>ples.” Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501&para;<br>U. S. 104, 108 (1991). Equitable tolling, a long-established&para;<br>feature of American jurisprudence derived from “the old&para;<br>chancery rule,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397&para;<br>(1946), is just such a principle. See Young v. United&para;<br>States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50 (2002) (“Congress must be&para;<br>presumed to draft limitations periods in light of this back­&para;<br>ground principle”); Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 349–350&para;<br>(1875). We therefore presume that equitable tolling ap­&para;<br>plies if the period in question is a statute of limitations&para;<br>and if tolling is consistent with the statute. Young, supra,&para;<br>at 49–50 (“It is hornbook law that limitations periods are&para;<br>‘customarily subject to “equitable tolling,” ’ unless tolling&para;<br>would be ‘inconsistent with the text of the relevant stat­&para;<br>ute’ ” (citation omitted)).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Hague Convention, of course, is a treaty, not a&para;<br>federal statute.

S. 494,&para;<br>535 (1900); see also BG Group plc v. Republic of Argen­&para;<br>tina, post, at 10.&para;<br>We conclude that the parties to the Hague Convention&para;<br>did not intend equitable tolling to apply to the 1-year&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Even if the Convention were&para;<br>subject to a presumption that statutes of limitations may&para;<br>be tolled, the 1-year period in Article 12 is not a statute of&para;<br>limitations. And absent a presumption in favor of equita­&para;<br>ble tolling, nothing in the Convention warrants tolling the&para;<br>1-year period.&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, there is no general presumption that equitable&para;<br>tolling applies to treaties. Congress is presumed to incor­&para;<br>porate equitable tolling into federal statutes of limitations&para;<br>because equitable tolling is part of the established back­&para;<br>drop of American law. Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 560&para;<br>(2000) (“[F]ederal statutes of limitations are generally&para;<br>subject to equitable principles of tolling”). It does not&para;<br>follow, however, that we can export such background&para;<br>principles of United States law to contexts outside their&para;<br>jurisprudential home.&para;<br>It is particularly inappropriate to deploy this back­&para;<br>ground principle of American law automatically when&para;<br>interpreting a treaty. “A treaty is in its nature a contract&para;<br>between . . . nations, not a legislative act.” Foster v.&para;<br>Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829) (Marshall, C. J., for the&para;<br>Court); see also 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 506&para;<br>(J. Elliot 2d ed. 1863) (James Wilson) (“[I]n their nature&para;<br>treaties originate differently from laws. They are made by&para;<br>equal parties, and each side has half of the bargain to&para;<br>make . . . ”). That distinction has been reflected in the way&para;<br>we interpret treaties. It is our “responsibility to read the&para;<br>treaty in a manner ‘consistent with the shared expecta­&para;<br>tions of the contracting parties.’ ” Olympic Airways v.&para;<br>Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 650 (2004) (quoting Air France v.&para;<br>Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 399 (1985); emphasis added). Even if&para;<br>a background principle is relevant to the interpretation of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal statutes, it has no proper role in the interpretation&para;<br>of treaties unless that principle is shared by the parties to&para;<br>“an agreement among sovereign powers,” Zicherman v.&para;<br>Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996).&para;<br>Lozano has not identified a background principle of&para;<br>equitable tolling that is shared by the signatories to the&para;<br>Hague Convention. To the contrary, Lozano concedes that&para;<br>in the context of the Convention, “foreign courts have&para;<br>failed to adopt equitable tolling . . . because they lac[k] the&para;<br>presumption that we [have].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20.&para;<br>While no signatory state’s court of last resort has resolved&para;<br>the question, intermediate courts of appeals in several&para;<br>states have rejected equitable tolling. See Cannon v.&para;<br>Cannon, [2004] EWCA (Civ) 1330, [2005] 1 W. L. R. 32,&para;<br>¶51 (Eng.), (rejecting the “tolling rule” as “too crude an&para;<br>approach” for the Convention); Kubera v.

In fact, Congress&para;<br>explicitly recognized “the need for uniform international&para;<br>interpretation of the Convention.” §11601(b)(3)(B).

See Hallstrom v.&para;<br>Tillamook County, 493 U. S. 20, 27 (1989) (no equitable&para;<br>tolling of a 60-day presuit notice requirement that does&para;<br>not operate as a statute of limitations).

And they foster the “elimination of&para;<br>stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff ’s opportunity&para;<br>for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella,&para;<br>supra, at 555.&para;<br>In Young, 535 U.

MONTOYA ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the “three-year lookback period” for tax liabilities in bank­&para;<br>ruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Code favors tax&para;<br>claims less than three years old in two respects: Such&para;<br>claims cannot be discharged, and they have priority over&para;<br>certain others in bankruptcy proceedings. See 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§507(a)(8)(A)(i), 523(a)(1)(A). If the Internal Revenue&para;<br>Service “sleeps on its rights” by failing to prosecute those&para;<br>claims within three years, however, then those mecha­&para;<br>nisms for enforcing claims against bankrupt taxpayers are&para;<br>eliminated. Young, 535 U. S., at 47. We concluded that&para;<br>the lookback period “serves the same ‘basic policies [fur­&para;<br>thered by] all limitations provisions,’ ” ibid. (quoting Ro­&para;<br>tella, 528 U. S., at 555), i.e., certainty and repose. We&para;<br>accordingly held that it was a limitations period&para;<br>presumptively subject to equitable tolling. 535 U. S.,&para;<br>at 47.&para;<br>Unlike the 3-year lookback period in Young, expiration&para;<br>of the 1-year period in Article 12 does not eliminate the&para;<br>remedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent—&para;<br>namely, the return of the child. Before one year has&para;<br>elapsed, Article 12 provides that the court “shall order the&para;<br>return of the child forthwith.” Treaty Doc., at 9. But even&para;<br>after that period has expired, the court “shall also order&para;<br>the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the&para;<br>child is now settled.” Ibid. The continued availability of&para;<br>the return remedy after one year preserves the possibility&para;<br>of relief for the left-behind parent and prevents repose&para;<br>for the abducting parent.5 Rather than establishing any&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 In&para;<br>&para;<br>the State Department’s view, the Hague Convention confers equi­&para;<br>table discretion on courts to order the return of a child even if the court&para;<br>determines that the child is “settled” within the meaning of Article 12.&para;<br>See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19–25. If accurate, that&para;<br>interpretation would reinforce that Article 12 is not meant to provide&para;<br>repose to the abducting parent, and it would underscore that the 1-year&para;<br>period is not a statute of limitations.

Because that is not the sort of interest ad­&para;<br>dressed by a statute of limitations, we decline to treat the&para;<br>1-year period as a statute of limitations.6&para;<br>C&para;<br>Without a presumption of equitable tolling, the Conven­&para;<br>tion does not support extending the 1-year period during&para;<br>concealment. Article 12 explicitly provides that the 1-year&para;<br>period commences on “the date of the wrongful removal or&para;<br>retention,” and makes no provision for an extension of that&para;<br>period. Id., at 9. Further, the practical effect of the tolling&para;<br>that Lozano requests would be to delay the commence­&para;<br>ment of the 1-year period until the left-behind parent&para;<br>discovers the child’s location. Commencing the 1-year&para;<br>period upon discovery is the obvious alternative to the&para;<br>commencement date the drafters actually adopted because&para;<br>the subject of the Hague Convention, child abduction, is&para;<br>naturally associated with the sort of concealment that&para;<br>might justify equitable tolling under other circumstances.&para;<br>See 697 F. 3d, at 51, n. 8 (“It would have been a simple&para;<br>——————&para;<br>return notwithstanding the child’s subsequent settlement. In the Court&para;<br>of Appeals, Lozano failed to challenge the District Court’s decision not&para;<br>to exercise its discretion to order the return of the settled child, see n. 3,&para;<br>supra, and that issue is beyond the scope of the question presented&para;<br>before this Court.&para;<br>6 Lozano argues that the United States delegation referred to the&para;<br>1-year period as a “statute of limitations” at various points during and&para;<br>after the drafting process. Brief for Petitioner 27–28. Because the&para;<br>determination whether the 1-year period is a statute of limitations&para;<br>depends on its functional characteristics, it is not significant that the&para;<br>delegation used that label. In any event, we doubt that the remarks of&para;<br>a single delegation are sufficient under these circumstances to establish&para;<br>the “ ‘shared expectations of the contracting parties.’ ” Olympic Airways&para;<br>v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 651 (2004) (quoting Air France v. Saks, 470&para;<br>U. S. 392, 399 (1985)).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v.

Given that the drafters did not adopt that&para;<br>alternative, the natural implication is that they did not&para;<br>intend the 1-year period to commence on that later date.&para;<br>Cf. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 10–11). We cannot revisit that&para;<br>choice.&para;<br>Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nevertheless&para;<br>consistent with the purpose of the Hague Convention&para;<br>because it is necessary to deter child abductions. In his&para;<br>view, “absent equitable tolling, concealment ‘probably will’&para;<br>result in non-return,” which will in turn encourage abduc­&para;<br>tion. Reply Brief 14–15; see also Duarte, 526 F. 3d, at 570.&para;<br>We agree, of course, that the Convention reflects a&para;<br>design to discourage child abduction. But the Convention&para;<br>does not pursue that goal at any cost. The child’s interest&para;<br>in choosing to remain, Art. 13, or in avoiding physical or&para;<br>psychological harm, Art. 13(b), may overcome the return&para;<br>remedy. The same is true of the child’s interest in settle­&para;<br>ment. See supra, at 2; see also In re M, [2008] 1 A.

Equitable tolling is&para;<br>therefore neither required by the Convention nor the only&para;<br>available means to advance its objectives.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Finally, Lozano contends that the Hague Convention&para;<br>leaves room for United States courts to apply their own&para;<br>“common law doctrine of equitable tolling” to the 1-year&para;<br>period in Article 12 without regard to whether the drafters&para;<br>of the Convention intended equitable tolling to apply.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 25. Specifically, Lozano contends that&para;<br>the Convention recognizes additional sources of law that&para;<br>permit signatory states to return abducted children even&para;<br>when return is not available or required pursuant to the&para;<br>Convention. Article 34 of the Convention provides that&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v.

In Lozano’s view,&para;<br>equitable tolling principles constitute “other law” that&para;<br>should apply here.&para;<br>That contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling&para;<br>as this Court has applied it. We do not apply equitable&para;<br>tolling as a matter of some independent authority to re­&para;<br>consider the fairness of legislative judgments balancing&para;<br>the needs for relief and repose. See supra, at 7–8. To the&para;<br>contrary, we may apply equitable tolling to the Hague&para;<br>Convention only if we determine that the treaty drafters&para;<br>so intended. See Choctaw Nation, 179 U. S., at 535. For&para;<br>the foregoing reasons, we conclude that they did not.&para;<br>V&para;<br>The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the 1-year&para;<br>period in Article 12 of the Hague Convention is not subject&para;<br>to equitable tolling.

This is why Article&para;<br>12 requires return “forthwith” if the petition for return&para;<br>is brought within a year of abduction, unless one of the&para;<br>narrow exceptions set forth in Article 13 or 20 applies.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOZANO v.

But, as the Convention recognizes, at&para;<br>some point the child will become accustomed to the new&para;<br>environment, making Article 12’s conclusive presumption&para;<br>inappropriate. Thus, if the petition for return is brought&para;<br>after a year has elapsed, the court must determine whether&para;<br>the child has become “settled” in the new country; and if&para;<br>this has occurred, the court need not order return. Ibid.&para;<br>As the majority recognizes, this provision of the Conven­&para;<br>tion “opens the door to consideration of . . . the child’s&para;<br>interest in settlement.” Ante, at 13.&para;<br>But opening the door to consideration of the child’s&para;<br>attachment to the new country does not mean closing the&para;<br>door to evaluating all other interests of the child and&para;<br>the non-abducting parent. The fact that, after one year,&para;<br>a child’s need for stability requires a court to take into&para;<br>account the child’s attachment to the new country does not&para;<br>mean that such attachment becomes the only factor worth&para;<br>considering when evaluating a petition for return.&para;<br>Nothing in Article 12 prohibits courts from taking other&para;<br>factors into account. To the contrary, the Convention&para;<br>explicitly permits them to do so. Article 18 provides that&para;<br>“[t]he provisions of this Chapter [including Article 12] do&para;<br>not limit the power of a judicial or administrative author­&para;<br>ity to order the return of the child at any time.” Hague&para;<br>Convention, Treaty Doc., at 11. A court thus has power to&para;<br>order the child’s return in the exercise of its sound discre­&para;<br>tion even where Article 12’s obligation to order such re­&para;<br>turn no longer applies.&para;<br>This provision makes eminent sense. Even after a year&para;<br>has elapsed and the child has become settled in the new&para;<br>environment, a variety of factors may outweigh the child’s&para;<br>interest in remaining in the new country, such as the&para;<br>child’s interest in returning to his or her original country&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Article 18 expressly states&para;<br>as much. See ibid. (Article 12 “do[es] not limit the power&para;<br>of a judicial or administrative authority to order the re­&para;<br>turn of the child”). Even without Article 18’s express&para;<br>language, it would be clear that Article 12 merely tells a&para;<br>court when it must order return, without telling it when it&para;<br>may do so. Article 12 states that, after the 1-year period&para;<br>has elapsed, a court “shall . . . order the return of the&para;<br>child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now&para;<br>settled in its new environment.” Id., at 9. The final clause&para;<br>indicates when the obligation imposed earlier in the sen­&para;<br>tence terminates; it does not substitute for that obligation&para;<br>a prohibition on ordering return. When a mother tells her&para;<br>child, “Come straight home from school, unless one of your&para;<br>friends invites you to a movie,” the mother has not prohib­&para;<br>ited her child from coming home immediately after school&para;<br>even if a friend proposes a film. Cf. Department of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives, 525 U. S.&para;<br>316, 339 (1999) (explaining that the meaning of a similar&para;<br>sentence structure in 13 U. S.

Abbott, 560 U. S. 1, 20 (2010). Such a prohibi­&para;<br>tion would run counter to other provisions of the Conven­&para;<br>tion. For instance, Article 13(b) gives a court discretion to&para;<br>return or decline to return a child who has not become&para;<br>settled if “there is a grave risk that . . . return would&para;<br>expose the child to physical or psychological harm or&para;<br>otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.”&para;<br>Hague Convention, Treaty Doc., at 10. If a court has&para;<br>discretion to order return even where such return poses “a&para;<br>grave risk” of harm or threatens to place the child in an&para;<br>“intolerable situation,” surely it has discretion to order&para;<br>return when faced with the lesser risk attendant on re­&para;<br>moving a child from the child’s present environment (espe­&para;<br>cially given that the child will generally be returning to a&para;<br>known environment: her country of habitual residence).&para;<br>The State Department has adopted the view that the&para;<br>Convention empowers a court, in its equitable discretion,&para;<br>to return a child who has become settled. In the analysis&para;<br>that it provided to the Senate in connection with the rati­&para;<br>fication process, the Department made clear that, even&para;<br>when a year has elapsed and the child has become settled,&para;<br>a court may still consider such factors as “evidence . . .&para;<br>concerning the child’s contacts with and ties to his or her&para;<br>State of habitual residence,” “[t]he reason for the passage&para;<br>of time,” and any concealment by the abducting parent in&para;<br>determining whether to order return. Hague International&para;<br>Child Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analysis&para;<br>(State Legal Analysis), 51 Fed.

As this&para;<br>Court has previously explained (in the context of the&para;<br>Convention, in fact), the State Department’s interpreta­&para;<br>tion of treaties “ ‘is entitled to great weight.’ ” Abbott,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The United King­&para;<br>dom’s House of Lords (at the time that nation’s highest&para;<br>court) has held that “a settled child might nevertheless be&para;<br>returned” by a court in the exercise of its discretion—&para;<br>a conclusion driven in part by acknowledgment of the in­&para;<br>equity of rewarding concealment.

Likewise, the Supreme Court of Ireland has&para;<br>concluded that courts have equitable discretion to order&para;<br>return of a child who has become settled. See P. v. B. (No.&para;<br>2), [1999] 4 I. R. 185. I am unaware of any high courts of&para;<br>states signatory that have concluded to the contrary.&para;<br>Given the foregoing, it is perhaps unsurprising that the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals to have considered the question have&para;<br>found that a court possesses equitable discretion to order&para;<br>return of a child despite the child’s having become settled&para;<br>in the new country. See Yaman v. Yaman, 730 F. 3d 1, 21&para;<br>(CA1 2013); Blondin v. Dubois, 238 F. 3d 153, 164 (CA2&para;<br>2001). And other Courts of Appeals have found more&para;<br>generally that none of the Convention’s exceptions prohibit&para;<br>return. See, e.g., Asvesta v. Petroutsas, 580 F. 3d 1000,&para;<br>1004 (CA9 2009); Miller v. Miller, 240 F. 3d 392, 402 (CA4&para;<br>2001).&para;<br>Equitable discretion to order return of a settled child is&para;<br>particularly important in light of the fact that the Conven­&para;<br>tion, as the Court correctly holds today, does not provide&para;<br>for equitable tolling of Article 12’s 1-year period. Peti­&para;<br>tioner predicts dire consequences from the Court’s holding.&para;<br>He argues that, as a result of our decision, the United&para;<br>States will become an abduction haven, with parents&para;<br>concealing their children here until Article 12’s 1-year&para;<br>period has run and then claiming their children have&para;<br>become settled and hence ineligible for return.

See, e.g.,&para;<br>State Legal Analysis, 51 Fed.

Given the courts’ discretion to order&para;<br>return in response to concealment, I do not believe the&para;<br>Court’s decision today risks incentivizing parents to flee&para;<br>with their children to this country and conceal them.&para;<br>Equitable discretion is also a far better tool than equita­&para;<br>ble tolling with which to address the dangers of conceal­&para;<br>ment. Equitable tolling would require return every time&para;<br>the abducting parent conceals the child and thereby pre­&para;<br>vents the non-abducting parent from filing a return peti­&para;<br>tion within a year, regardless of how settled in the new&para;<br>country the child has become. Thus, on petitioner’s view,&para;<br>a court would be bound to return a 14-year-old child who&para;<br>was brought to the United States shortly after birth and&para;<br>had been concealed here ever since. By contrast, when a&para;<br>court exercises its equitable discretion, it may consider&para;<br>other factors in addition to concealment. While conceal­&para;<br>ment is a significant factor and should weigh heavily in a&para;<br>court’s analysis, in appropriate cases it can be overcome by&para;<br>circumstances such as the extended length of the child’s&para;<br>residence in this country, any strong ties the child has&para;<br>formed here, and the child’s attenuated connections to his&para;<br>or her former country.&para;<br>In short, I believe the power of a court, in the exercise of&para;<br>its sound discretion, to return even a settled child pre­&para;<br>vents the inapplicability of equitable tolling to Article 12’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.
