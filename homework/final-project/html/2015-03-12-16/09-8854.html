STEPHEN UPTON, &para;<br>&para;<br>WARDEN &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF GEORGIA&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–8854. Decided June 29, 2010 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>According to an expert who testified during state post&para;<br>conviction relief, petitioner Demarcus A. Sears performs at&para;<br>or below the bottom first percentile in several measures of&para;<br>cognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this&para;<br>abnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain&para;<br>damage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and&para;<br>alcohol abuse in his teens. But because—in the words of&para;<br>the state trial court—his counsel conducted a penalty&para;<br>phase investigation that was “on its face . . . constitution&para;<br>ally inadequate,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence&para;<br>relating to Sears’ cognitive impairments and childhood&para;<br>difficulties was not brought to light at the time he was&para;<br>sentenced to death.&para;<br>After finding constitutionally deficient attorney per&para;<br>formance under the framework we set forth in Strickland&para;<br>v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the state postconvic&para;<br>tion court found itself unable to assess whether counsel’s&para;<br>inadequate investigation might have prejudiced Sears.&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B–30B. Because Sears’ counsel&para;<br>did present some mitigation evidence during Sears’ pen&para;<br>alty phase—but not the significant mitigation evidence a&para;<br>constitutionally adequate investigation would have uncov&para;<br>ered—the state court determined it could not speculate as&para;<br>to what the effect of additional evidence would have been.&para;<br>Id., at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction&para;<br>relief. Id., at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of&para;<br>Georgia summarily denied review of his claims. Id., at 1A.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>For the reasons that follow, it is plain from the face of&para;<br>the state court’s opinion that it failed to apply the correct&para;<br>prejudice inquiry we have established for evaluating&para;<br>Sears’ Sixth Amendment claim. We therefore grant the&para;<br>petition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and&para;<br>remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this&para;<br>opinion.1&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1993, a Georgia jury convicted Sears of armed rob&para;<br>bery and kidnaping with bodily injury (which also resulted&para;<br>in death), a capital crime under state law. See Ga. Code&para;<br>Ann. §16–5–40(d)(4) (2006).2 During the penalty phase of&para;<br>Sears’ capital trial, his counsel presented evidence describ&para;<br>ing his childhood as stable, loving, and essentially without&para;<br>incident. Seven witnesses offered testimony along the&para;<br>following lines: Sears came from a middle-class back&para;<br>ground; his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives;&para;<br>and a death sentence, the jury was told, would devastate&para;<br>the family. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7. Counsel’s mitigation&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Although this is a state-court decision, it resolved a federal issue on&para;<br>exclusively federal-law grounds. We therefore have jurisdiction. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1257; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)&para;<br>(reviewing state postconviction decision raising Sixth Amendment&para;<br>question).&para;<br>2 Sears was sentenced to death for the Kentucky murder of a woman&para;<br>whom he and an accomplice kidnaped in Georgia. Under Georgia law,&para;<br>a jury may “impose a death sentence for the offense of kidnapping with&para;<br>bodily injury on the ground that the offense of kidnapping with bodily&para;<br>injury was committed while the offender was engaged in the commis&para;<br>sion of the capital felon[y] of murder . . . .” Potts v. State, 261 Ga. 716,&para;<br>720, 410 S. E. 2d 89, 93 (1991). So long as “the murder . . . [is] suffi&para;<br>ciently a part of the same criminal transaction,” it may count as a&para;<br>“statutory aggravating circumstanc[e] of the offense of kidnapping with&para;<br>bodily injury.” Ibid., 410 S. E. 2d, at 94. Sears has raised a categorical&para;<br>Eighth Amendment challenge to the constitutionality of his death&para;<br>sentence for a kidnaping offense, which we decline to reach. And any&para;<br>jurisdictional or constitutional issue with respect to Georgia’s ability to&para;<br>execute Sears for a murder occurring in Kentucky is not before us.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>theory, it seems, was calculated to portray the adverse&para;<br>impact of Sears’ execution on his family and loved ones.&para;<br>20 Record 5181. But the strategy backfired. The prosecu&para;<br>tor ultimately used the evidence of Sears’ purportedly&para;<br>stable and advantaged upbringing against him during the&para;<br>State’s closing argument. With Sears, the prosecutor told&para;<br>the jury, “[w]e don’t have a deprived child from an inner&para;<br>city; a person who[m] society has turned its back on at an&para;<br>early age. But, yet, we have a person, privileged in every&para;<br>way, who has rejected every opportunity that was afforded&para;<br>him.” Pet. for Cert. 7 (quoting trial transcript; internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The mitigation evidence that emerged during the state&para;<br>postconviction evidentiary hearing, however, demon&para;<br>strates that Sears was far from “privileged in every way.”&para;<br>Sears’ home life, while filled with material comfort, was&para;<br>anything but tranquil: His parents had a physically abu&para;<br>sive relationship, Exh. 26, 6 Record 1676 (Affidavit of&para;<br>Demetrius A. Sears), and divorced when Sears was young,&para;<br>Exh. 22, id., at 1654 (Affidavit of Virginia Sears Graves);&para;<br>he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent&para;<br>male cousin, Exh. 26, id., at 1681–1682; his mother’s&para;<br>“favorite word for referring to her sons was ‘little mother&para;<br>fuckers,’ ” Exh. 3, 2 Record 265 (Affidavit of Richard G.&para;<br>Dudley, Jr., MD); and his father was “verbally abusive,”&para;<br>Exh. 37, 6 Record 1746–1747 (Affidavit of Carol BecciYoungs),3 and disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 In the particular instance recounted in this affidavit, Sears’ art&para;<br>teacher stated that his father “berate[d] [him] in front of” the school&para;<br>principal and her during a parent-teacher conference. Exh. 37, 6 Record&para;<br>1746. The event was significant: “I’ll never forget the way he bullied&para;<br>him,” the art teacher explained, “Mr. Sears was so verbally abusive and&para;<br>made such a scene, that it made everyone in the room uncomfortable.”&para;<br>Ibid. The art teacher had “never been in a conference where a parent&para;<br>severely criticized a child in the presence of his teachers and meant it,&para;<br>as Mr. Sears did.” Id., at 1747.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v.

Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial&para;<br>behavior problems from a very young age. For example,&para;<br>Sears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 Record 500–&para;<br>501, and was referred to a local health center for evalua&para;<br>tion at age nine, Exh. 7, id., at 503, 504, 508. By the time&para;<br>Sears reached high school, he was “described as severely&para;<br>learning disabled and as severely behaviorally handi&para;<br>capped.” Exh. A to Exh. 1, 2 Record 174–176 (Affidavit of&para;<br>Tony L. Strickland, M. S., Ph. D.).&para;<br>Environmental factors aside, and more significantly,&para;<br>evidence produced during the state postconviction relief&para;<br>process also revealed that Sears suffered “significant&para;<br>frontal lobe abnormalities.” Exh. 1, id., at 147. Two dif&para;<br>ferent psychological experts testified that Sears had sub&para;<br>stantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning—i.e.,&para;<br>“problems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,”&para;<br>ibid.—as a result of several serious head injuries he suf&para;<br>fered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1&para;<br>Record 37–40 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); id., at 95–96&para;<br>(Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his&para;<br>brain damage, his scores on at least two standardized&para;<br>assessment tests placed him at or below the first percen&para;<br>tile in several categories of cognitive function, “making&para;<br>him among the most impaired individuals in the popula&para;<br>tion in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses&para;<br>and conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.” Exh. 1, 2&para;<br>Record 148; see also 1 Record 37. The assessment also&para;<br>revealed that Sears’ “ability to organize his choices, assign&para;<br>them relative weight and select among them in a deliber&para;<br>ate way is grossly impaired.” Exh. 1, 2 Record 149. From&para;<br>an etiological standpoint, one expert explained that Sears’&para;<br>“history is replete with multiple head trauma, substance&para;<br>abuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected” to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at 150; see also&para;<br>1 Record 44.&para;<br>Whatever concern the dissent has about some of the&para;<br>sources relied upon by Sears’ experts—informal personal&para;<br>accounts, see post, at 5–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.)—it does&para;<br>not undermine the well-credentialed expert’s assessment,4&para;<br>based on between 12 and 16 hours of interviews, testing,&para;<br>and observations, see 1 Record 32, that Sears suffers from&para;<br>substantial cognitive impairment. Sears performed dis&para;<br>mally on several of the forensic tests administered to him&para;<br>to assess his frontal lobe functioning. On the Stroop Word&para;<br>Interference Test, which measures response inhibition, id.,&para;<br>at 36–37, 99.6% of those individuals in his cohort (which&para;<br>accounts for age, education, and background) performed&para;<br>better than he did. Ibid. On the Trail-Making B test,&para;<br>which also measures frontal lobe functioning, id., at 37–&para;<br>38, Sears performed at the first (and lowest) percentile.&para;<br>Id., at 38. Based on these results, the expert’s first-hand&para;<br>observations, and an extensive review of Sears’ personal&para;<br>history, the expert’s opinion was unequivocal: There is&para;<br>“clear and compelling evidence” that Sears has “pro&para;<br>nounced frontal lobe pathology.”5 Id., at 68.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Dr. Strickland, a psychologist, is the director of a mild head injury&para;<br>clinic and the Sports Concussion Institute at Centinella Freeman&para;<br>Medical Center in Los Angeles. 1 Record 30. He is an associate profes&para;<br>sor of psychiatry in residence at the University of California at Los&para;<br>Angeles and directs a memory disorder and cerebral palsy clinic for&para;<br>that university’s department of neuroscience. Id., at 30–31. The State&para;<br>had no objection to his being tendered as an expert in neuropsychology.&para;<br>Id., at 31.&para;<br>5 During a colloquy with the court, Dr. Strickland further explained:&para;<br>“THE COURT: But by taking some history of head injuries, coupled&para;<br>with the results of the tests that you’ve given, you can comfortably&para;<br>conclude that the results of the tests that you’ve given were a conse&para;<br>quence of frontal lobe head injuries?&para;<br>“THE WITNESS: Absolutely. And, moreover, Your Honor, the&para;<br>patient has a lesion on the front of his head, which is something I can&para;<br>observe.” Id., at 78.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Further, the fact that Sears’ brother is a convicted drug&para;<br>dealer and user, and introduced Sears to a life of crime, 6&para;<br>Record 1683–1686, actually would have been consistent&para;<br>with a mitigation theory portraying Sears as an individual&para;<br>with diminished judgment and reasoning skills, who may&para;<br>have desired to follow in the footsteps of an older brother&para;<br>who had shut him out of his life. Post, at 6. And the fact&para;<br>that some of such evidence may have been “hearsay” does&para;<br>not necessarily undermine its value—or its admissibility—&para;<br>for penalty phase purposes.6 Post, at 5, n. 3.&para;<br>Finally, the fact that along with this new mitigation&para;<br>evidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsur&para;<br>prising, post, at 7, given that counsel’s initial mitigation&para;<br>investigation was constitutionally inadequate. Competent&para;<br>counsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse&para;<br>evidence into a positive—perhaps in support of a cognitive&para;<br>deficiency mitigation theory. In particular, evidence of&para;<br>Sears’ grandiose self-conception and evidence of his magi&para;<br>cal thinking, ibid., were features, in another well&para;<br>credentialed expert’s view,7 of a “profound personality&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Like&para;<br>&para;<br>Georgia’s “necessity exception” to its hearsay rules, see Ga.&para;<br>Code Ann. §24–3–1(b) (2006), we have also recognized that reliable&para;<br>hearsay evidence that is relevant to a capital defendant’s mitigation&para;<br>defense should not be excluded by rote application of a state hearsay&para;<br>rule. See Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (“Re&para;<br>gardless of whether the proffered testimony comes within Georgia’s&para;<br>hearsay rule, under the facts of this case its exclusion constituted a&para;<br>violation of the Due Process Clause . . . . The excluded testimony was&para;<br>highly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial”);&para;<br>see also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302 (1973) (“In these&para;<br>circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascer&para;<br>tainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied&para;<br>mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice”). We take no view on&para;<br>whether the evidence at issue would satisfy the considerations we set&para;<br>forth in Green, or would be otherwise admissible under Georgia law.&para;<br>7 Dr. Dudley, a psychiatrist, completed his internship and residency&para;<br>at Northwestern University Medical Center, and has been board&para;<br>certified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neu&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

This evidence might not have&para;<br>made Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well&para;<br>have helped the jury understand Sears, and his horren&para;<br>dous acts—especially in light of his purportedly stable&para;<br>upbringing.&para;<br>Because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation&para;<br>investigation, none of this evidence was known to Sears’&para;<br>trial counsel. It emerged only during state postconviction&para;<br>relief.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Unsurprisingly, the state postconviction trial court&para;<br>concluded that Sears had demonstrated his counsel’s&para;<br>penalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient.&para;<br>See Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688 (explaining that first&para;<br>inquiry when evaluating Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness&para;<br>claim is whether counsel’s representation “fell below an&para;<br>objective standard of reasonableness”). In its view, the&para;<br>cursory nature of counsel’s investigation into mitigation&para;<br>evidence—“limited to one day or less, talking to witnesses&para;<br>selected by [Sears’] mother”—was “on its face . . . constitu&para;<br>tionally inadequate.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B.&para;<br>What is surprising, however, is the court’s analysis&para;<br>regarding whether counsel’s facially inadequate mitigation&para;<br>investigation prejudiced Sears. See Strickland, supra, at&para;<br>694. Although the court appears to have stated the proper&para;<br>prejudice standard,8 it did not correctly conceptualize how&para;<br>that standard applies to the circumstances of this case.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>rology for more than 35 years. 1 Record 91–92. The State also had no&para;<br>objection to his being tendered as an expert in psychiatry. Id., at 93.&para;<br>8 The court asked whether “there is a reasonable likelihood that the&para;<br>outcome of his trial would have been different if his counsel had done&para;<br>more investigation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B–30B; see Strickland,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 694 (“The defendant must show that there is a reasonable&para;<br>probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of&para;<br>the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a&para;<br>probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome”).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Because Sears’ counsel did present some mitigation evi&para;<br>dence during his penalty phase, the court concluded that&para;<br>“[t]his case cannot be fairly compared with those where&para;<br>little or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a&para;<br>reasonable prediction of outcome can be made.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 30B. The court explained that “it is impossi&para;<br>ble to know what effect [a different mitigation theory]&para;<br>would have had on [the jury].” Ibid. “Because counsel put&para;<br>forth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,” the&para;<br>court reasoned, “[Sears] . . . failed to meet his burden of&para;<br>proving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the&para;<br>outcome at trial would have been different if a different&para;<br>mitigation theory had been advanced.”9 Ibid.&para;<br>There are two errors in the state court’s analysis of&para;<br>Sears’ Sixth Amendment claim. First, the court curtailed&para;<br>a more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue&para;<br>reliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel’s miti&para;<br>gation theory. The court’s determination that counsel had&para;<br>conducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investi&para;<br>gation, should have, at the very least, called into question&para;<br>the reasonableness of this theory. Cf. Wiggins v. Smith,&para;<br>539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (explaining that “counsel’s fail&para;<br>ure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evi&para;<br>dence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical&para;<br>decision . . . because counsel had not ‘fulfill[ed] their obli&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Channeling powers of telepathy, JUSTICE SCALIA asserts that what&para;<br>the trial court actually decided in this case is that “Sears’ trial counsel&para;<br>presented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi&para;<br>cient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult—so&para;<br>difficult that Sears could not make the requisite showing.” Post, at 4.&para;<br>Such a highly favorable reading of the trial court’s analysis would be&para;<br>far more convincing had the trial court engaged with the evidence as&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA does. But it offered no such analysis in its opinion;&para;<br>indeed, it appears the court did not even conduct any real analysis,&para;<br>explaining that it was “impossible to know what effect” the evidence&para;<br>might have had on the jury.

Taylor, 529 U. S.&para;<br>362, 396 (2000); alteration in original)). And, more to the&para;<br>point, that a theory might be reasonable, in the abstract,&para;<br>does not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel’s&para;<br>failure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation&para;<br>before arriving at this particular theory prejudiced Sears.&para;<br>The “reasonableness” of counsel’s theory was, at this stage&para;<br>in the inquiry, beside the point: Sears might be prejudiced&para;<br>by his counsel’s failures, whether his haphazard choice&para;<br>was reasonable or not.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA chides the Court for concluding that the&para;<br>trial court assumed, rather than found, that counsel’s&para;<br>mitigation theory was a reasonable one. Post, at 2. But&para;<br>our point is that any finding with respect to the reason&para;<br>ableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized—in this&para;<br>case, family impact—is in tension with the trial court’s&para;<br>unambiguous finding that counsel’s investigation was&para;<br>itself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional.&para;<br>This point is plain in Williams: We rejected any suggestion&para;<br>that a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial&para;<br>strategy—in that case, petitioner’s voluntary confession—&para;<br>was “justified by a tactical decision” when “counsel did not&para;<br>fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation&para;<br>of the defendant’s background.” 529 U. S., at 396. A&para;<br>“tactical decision” is a precursor to concluding that coun&para;<br>sel has developed a “reasonable” mitigation theory in a&para;<br>particular case.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Moreover,&para;<br>&para;<br>the reasonableness of the theory is not relevant when&para;<br>evaluating the impact of evidence that would have been available and&para;<br>likely introduced, had counsel completed a constitutionally adequate&para;<br>investigation before settling on a particular mitigation theory. This&para;<br>point was also plain in Williams: “Whether or not . . . omissions [in the&para;<br>investigation] were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected the outcome&para;<br>of sentencing,” they may nevertheless demonstrate deficiency. 529&para;<br>U. S., at 396. The one inquiry, deficient mitigation investigation, is&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to&para;<br>apply the proper prejudice inquiry. We have never limited&para;<br>the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which&para;<br>there was only “little or no mitigation evidence” presented,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases&para;<br>involving such circumstances,11 and we have explained&para;<br>that there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evi&para;<br>dence “would barely have altered the sentencing profile&para;<br>presented” to the decisionmaker, Strickland, supra, at&para;<br>700. But we also have found deficiency and prejudice in&para;<br>other cases in which counsel presented what could be&para;<br>described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory&para;<br>during the penalty phase. E.g., Williams, supra, at 398&para;<br>(remorse and cooperation with police); Rompilla v. Beard,&para;<br>545 U. S. 374, 378 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most&para;<br>recently in Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(per curiam) (slip op., at 3), where counsel at trial had&para;<br>attempted to blame his client’s bad acts on his drunken&para;<br>ness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation&para;<br>evidence relating to his client’s heroic military service and&para;<br>substantial mental health difficulties that came to light&para;<br>only during postconviction relief, id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>11–12). Not only did we find prejudice in Porter, but—&para;<br>bound by deference owed under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)—&para;<br>we also concluded the state court had unreasonably ap&para;<br>plied Strickland’s prejudice prong when it analyzed Por&para;<br>ter’s claim. Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).&para;<br>We certainly have never held that counsel’s effort to&para;<br>present some mitigation evidence should foreclose an&para;<br>inquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation inves&para;<br>tigation might have prejudiced the defendant. To the&para;<br>contrary, we have consistently explained that the Strick&para;<br>——————&para;<br>distinct from the second, whether there was prejudice as a result.&para;<br>11See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 515–516 (2003); Strick&para;<br>land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 700 (1984).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 397–398. A&para;<br>	 nd, in Porter, we recently explained:&para;<br>“To assess [the] probability [of a different outcome&para;<br>under Strickland], we consider the totality of the&para;<br>available mitigation evidence—both that adduced at&para;<br>trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceed&para;<br>ing—and reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggrava&para;<br>tion.” 558 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 11) (internal quo&para;<br>tation marks omitted; third alteration in original).&para;<br>That same standard applies—and will necessarily require&para;<br>a court to “speculate” as to the effect of the new evidence—&para;<br>regardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence&para;<br>was presented during the initial penalty phase. Indeed, it&para;<br>is exactly this kind of probing inquiry that JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>now undertakes, post, at 4–8, and that the trial court&para;<br>failed to do. In all circumstances, this is the proper preju&para;<br>dice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective repre&para;<br>sentation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation&para;<br>investigation.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Whether it did so implicitly is far from apparent, notwithstanding&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion to the contrary. See post, at 3–4. The trial&para;<br>court stated that the record was “largely silent” on “what [evidence]&para;<br>would have been shown if [additional mitigating evidence] had been&para;<br>sought.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 28B.

See Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>11); Williams, supra, at 397–398; Strickland, supra, at&para;<br>694.

Decided June 29, 2010 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,&para;<br>dissenting.&para;<br>The Court concludes, ante, at 7–12, that the Superior&para;<br>Court of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in&para;<br>applying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of&para;<br>counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.&para;<br>668 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the&para;<br>Court today remands for the state court to do what it has&para;<br>already done: find no reasonable likelihood that the miti&para;<br>gation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have&para;<br>persuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sen&para;<br>tence for this brutal rape-murder.&para;<br>The state habeas court responsibly executed the first&para;<br>step in the Strickland analysis, finding that the investiga&para;<br>tion of mitigation evidence by Sears’ trial counsel was&para;<br>deficient performance. The issue here is the second step:&para;<br>whether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the&para;<br>Court acknowledges, ante, at 7, the state habeas court&para;<br>correctly stated the prejudice standard under Strickland:&para;<br>The defendant has the burden to establish “a reasonable&para;<br>probability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance,&para;<br>the result of the proceeding would have been different.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 24B–25B (citing 466 U. S., at 688,&para;<br>694). “When applied to the sentencing phase of death&para;<br>penalty trials,” that means “a reasonable probability that,&para;<br>absent [counsel’s] errors, the sentencer would have con&para;<br>cluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating&para;<br>circumstances did not warrant death.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cert. 25B–26B.&para;<br>The Court today concludes that there were two errors in&para;<br>the application of that proper standard. First, it reasons&para;<br>that the court erroneously “curtailed a more probing&para;<br>prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the&para;<br>assumed reasonableness of counsel’s mitigation theory” at&para;<br>trial. Ante, at 8. That argument is flawed on several&para;<br>levels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not as&para;<br>sume trial counsel’s mitigation theory was reasonable; it&para;<br>found that it was. It said: “[A]lthough counsel failed to&para;<br>investigate thoroughly, they did develop a reasonable&para;<br>mitigation theory with evidence to support it.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen&para;<br>potential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of&para;<br>Sears’ father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his&para;<br>family, see 7 Record 2025, 2051–2052; 8 id., at 2129,&para;<br>2291–2344, Sears’ trial counsel developed a mitigation&para;<br>theory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid&para;<br>middle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely&para;<br>out of character; that he cooperated with police; and that&para;<br>sentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and&para;<br>friends, see id., at 2124–2125; 19 id., at 4861–4862, 4916–&para;<br>4917, 4954–4955; 20 id., at 5181. To support that ap&para;<br>proach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including&para;<br>Sears’ mother, four family friends, and his high school&para;<br>guidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7 (citing trial&para;<br>transcript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state ha&para;<br>beas court did not declare that this mitigation theory&para;<br>“might be reasonable, in the abstract,” as the Court puts&para;<br>it, ante, at 8. Rather, it concluded that counsel “put forth&para;<br>a reasonable theory with supporting evidence.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 30B.&para;<br>The Court’s argument is also flawed because the habeas&para;<br>court’s reasonableness finding did not cause it to “curtai[l]”&para;<br>its prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could&para;<br>“obviate the need to analyze” whether pursuing a different&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>mitigation theory would have made a difference. Ante, at&para;<br>9. The reasonableness finding merely meant that the&para;<br>prejudice determination had to be made by asking, not&para;<br>whether the jury’s mind would probably have been&para;<br>changed by hearing Sears’ new mitigation theory instead&para;<br>of hearing no mitigation theory at all; but rather whether&para;<br>it would probably have been changed by substituting&para;<br>Sears’ new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation&para;<br>theory that was presented and rejected.1 After hearing all&para;<br>the witnesses and other evidence Sears presented before&para;<br>it, the state court concluded that “it is just not possible to&para;<br>know what effect a different mitigation theory would have&para;<br>had.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added).2&para;<br>The second, “and more fundamenta[l],” legal error the&para;<br>Court alleges, ante, at 10–11, is really encased within the&para;<br>first. The Court claims that the state habeas court “lim&para;<br>ited the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in&para;<br>which there was only ‘little or no mitigation evidence’&para;<br>presented.” Id., at 10 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B).&para;<br>The court erred, we are told, by determining that “pre&para;<br>sent[ation of] some mitigation evidence should foreclose an&para;<br>inquiry into whether” Sears was prejudiced. Ibid. That is&para;<br>not a fair reading of the opinion. The state court did not&para;<br>hold that a defendant could never suffer prejudice when&para;<br>ever his counsel provided any mitigation evidence.&para;<br>Rather, it stated that “[t]his case cannot be fairly com&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court contends, ante, at 9, that there was a “tension” between&para;<br>the state court’s conclusion that the investigation was deficient and its&para;<br>conclusion that the mitigation theory presented to the jury was reason&para;<br>able. This terribly misreads the state court’s opinion. It did not say (as&para;<br>the Court’s point assumes) that counsel’s using the mitigation theory&para;<br>they did was reasonable; it said that the theory itself was reasonable,&para;<br>making it hard to say whether a different theory would have persuaded&para;<br>the jury. This presents no conceivable “tension.”&para;<br>2 On the fair reading we owe the state court, its opinion provides no&para;<br>basis for inferring that it failed to “engag[e] with the evidence” and “did&para;<br>not even conduct any real analysis.” Ante, at 8, n. 8.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>pared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is&para;<br>presented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome&para;<br>can be made.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis&para;<br>added). That is absolutely correct. This case is not like&para;<br>the prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it&para;<br>could readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory&para;<br>would have made a much deeper impression on the jury&para;<br>than the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any&para;<br>theory) offered at trial. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12); Rompilla v.&para;<br>Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,&para;<br>539 U. S. 510, 515, 537 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529&para;<br>U. S. 362, 369 (2000). Sears’ trial counsel presented a&para;<br>reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi&para;<br>cient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more&para;<br>difficult—so difficult that Sears could not make the requi&para;<br>site showing. Clearly referring to the evidence in this&para;<br>particular case, the court said:&para;<br>“Although here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior&para;<br>appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having&para;<br>reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not&para;<br>possible to know what effect a different mitigation&para;<br>theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible&para;<br>to know what effect it would have had on other ju&para;<br>rors.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.&para;<br>Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to&para;<br>its Strickland conclusion, the only basis for reversing the&para;<br>judgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion&para;<br>itself: that Sears had not established that his new mitiga&para;<br>tion theory would probably have caused the jury to impose&para;<br>a life sentence instead of death.&para;<br>The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclu&para;<br>sion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into&para;<br>the 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the&para;<br>evidence supporting Sears’ new mitigation theory—an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The&para;<br>reader might think the state habeas court’s conclusion&para;<br>highly questionable from the Court’s account, which re&para;<br>cites as solid all the evidence supporting Sears’ new miti&para;<br>gation theory, see ante, at 3–7. It is far from solid. Some&para;<br>is likely inadmissible as unreliable hearsay under Georgia&para;<br>law, see Gissendaner v. State, 272 Ga. 704, 714, 532 S.

No juror would have been&para;<br>impressed by such a character witness.&para;<br>Some of the evidence is incredible, such as the psychia&para;<br>trist’s assertion that Sears had “substantial deficits in&para;<br>mental cognition and reasoning . . . as a result of serious&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court’s reliance on Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979)&para;<br>(per curiam), ante, at 6, n. 6, to suggest that this unreliable hearsay&para;<br>would be admissible for sentencing purposes is entirely misplaced. In&para;<br>Green, we held it violated constitutional due process to exclude testi&para;<br>mony regarding a co-conspirator’s confession that he alone committed&para;<br>the capital murder with which the defendant was charged. Our holding&para;<br>depended on “th[e] unique circumstances” of the case: the testimony to&para;<br>be used at sentencing was “highly relevant” and “substantial[ly]”&para;<br>reliable as a statement against penal interest made to a close friend; it&para;<br>was corroborated by “ample” evidence and was used by the State to&para;<br>obtain a conviction in a separate trial against the co-conspirator. 442&para;<br>U. S., at 97. Here there are no such circumstances. The testimony is&para;<br>uncorroborated second-hand reporting from self-interested witnesses&para;<br>that is unreliable and therefore likely inadmissible.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v.

The seri&para;<br>ous head injuries consisted of Sears’ hitting his head at a&para;<br>roller-skating rink sometime early in elementary school,&para;<br>1 Record 76; 2 id., at 225, running into an end table as a&para;<br>child, 6 id., at 1651, and getting hit with a golf club some&para;<br>time later in elementary school, 1 id., at 79; 2 id., at 225.4&para;<br>(The last of these major injuries might not have been&para;<br>introduced anyway, since that would have provided the&para;<br>prosecution an opportunity to refute both the extent of the&para;<br>injury and the mercy-worthiness of Sears, by introducing&para;<br>into evidence Sears’ boast that when he was 11 or 12 he&para;<br>“beat the s*** out of” someone after he was hit on the head&para;<br>with a golf club, 8 id., at 2195.) Likewise incredible was&para;<br>the assertion that Demetrius “introduced Sears to a life of&para;<br>crime,” ante, at 6. According to testimony on which the&para;<br>Court relies, Demetrius would “never let [Sears] hang&para;<br>around” with him and his drug-dealing friends. 6 Record&para;<br>1685–1686.&para;<br>A jury also would have discredited the psychiatric tes&para;<br>timony of Dr. Strickland that “[f]rom an etiological stand&para;<br>point . . .

There is no corroborating evidence for this event: no&para;<br>medical records, 1 id., at 77, no other apparent scars, 2 id., at 245; 6 id.,&para;<br>at 1651, and, tellingly, no family or friends to confirm what surely&para;<br>would have been memorable had it happened.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

And then there are the unfa&para;<br>vorable parts of Dr. Dudley’s testimony: Sears is a “narcis&para;<br>sis[t],” id., at 135, with a “grandiose” opinion of himself,&para;<br>id., at 98–99; 2 id., at 246. Dr. Dudley’s affidavit portrays&para;<br>Sears as arrogant and self-centered, id., at 246, 247, and&para;<br>notes what he termed Sears’ “fantastical” boasting of his&para;<br>first sexual experience with a woman at the age of six and&para;<br>his other “innumerable sexual experiences,” 1 id., at 98–&para;<br>99, 100; 2 id., at 246–247. It is hard to see how it could be&para;<br>thought probable that Sears’ so-called “magical thinking,”&para;<br>1 id., at 84, would have helped his plea for leniency, see&para;<br>ante, at 6–7. It seems to me more likely the jury would&para;<br>conclude that Sears’ “profoun[d] personality disorder,”&para;<br>1 Record 104, made him exactly the kind of person who&para;<br>would commit heinous crimes in the future.&para;<br>And some of the evidence the Court recounts is so ut&para;<br>terly unlikely to affect a jury’s determination that this&para;<br>brutal murder deserved death that its recitation is just&para;<br>plain hilarious. For example, the claim that Sears’ father&para;<br>“was ‘verbally abusive,’ ” ante, at 3, resting on nothing&para;<br>more than an art teacher’s recollection that Sears’ father&para;<br>“severely criticized” him—“and meant it”!—at a conference&para;<br>with the principal concerning his son’s poor academic&para;<br>performance, 6 Record 1747; the claim that his father&para;<br>“disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style&para;<br>drills,” ante, at 3–4, which consisted of positively VonSteubenesque acts such as dousing the kid with cold water&para;<br>when he refused to get up for school, and making him run&para;<br>extra laps after sports practices, 6 Record 1622; and the&para;<br>claim that his mother’s “ ‘favorite word’ ”—actually three&para;<br>words—to refer to her sons was scatological, ante, at 3&para;<br>(quoting 2 Record 265).&para;<br>While the Court takes pain to describe all the elements&para;<br>of Sears’ new mitigation theory, down to the silliest, it&para;<br>does not trouble to describe the brutal circumstances of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SEARS v. UPTON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the crime—which are at least just as relevant to assessing&para;<br>whether the different mitigation theory would probably&para;<br>have altered the sentence. But the jury heard all about&para;<br>them. See Sears v. State, 268 Ga. 759, 759–760, 493 S. E.&para;<br>2d 180, 182 (1997). They heard Sears’ confession that he&para;<br>kidnaped, raped, and murdered Gloria Wilbur, a 59-year&para;<br>old wife and mother. Sears, carrying a briefcase contain&para;<br>ing various instruments of mayhem—brass knuckles,&para;<br>knives, and handcuffs—and his accomplice, Phillip Wil&para;<br>liams, were surveying a supermarket parking lot on a&para;<br>Sunday evening in October 1990, looking for a car to steal&para;<br>to drive back home to Ohio from Georgia. As the victim&para;<br>was putting her groceries in the trunk of her car, Sears&para;<br>approached, punched her in the face with his brass knuck&para;<br>les, shoved her into the car, and drove to pick up Williams.&para;<br>Sears then handcuffed her and pulled her into the back&para;<br>seat as Williams drove. After they passed into Tennessee,&para;<br>Sears raped her. Later in the evening, after they had&para;<br>crossed into Kentucky, Sears told Williams to stop the car.&para;<br>Sears forced her, still handcuffed, into the woods by the&para;<br>side of the highway as she begged for her life. After&para;<br>throwing her on the ground, he stabbed her in the neck.&para;<br>In his confession he showed no regret or remorse for his&para;<br>heinous crimes.5&para;<br>I do not know how anyone could disagree with the ha&para;<br>beas court’s conclusion that it is impossible to say that&para;<br>substituting the “deprived-childhood-cum-brain-damage”&para;<br>defense for the “good-middle-class-kid-who-made-a&para;<br>mistake” defense would probably have produced a differ&para;<br>ent verdict. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The jury also heard from several corrections officers who testified&para;<br>that while Sears was incarcerated awaiting trial and sentencing, he&para;<br>racked up dozens of disciplinary infractions, including assaults on other&para;<br>inmates. “ ‘Predatory,’ ” “ ‘[i]ncorrigible,’ ” and incapable of reform was&para;<br>how they described him. 10 id., at 2951–2957; 19 id., at 4868.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
