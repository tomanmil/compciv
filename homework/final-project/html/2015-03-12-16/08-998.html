LANNING&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE TENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–998.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 22, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Debtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code&para;<br>must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors&para;<br>out of their future income. If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured&para;<br>creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless&para;<br>it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or “provides&para;<br>that all of the debtor’s projected disposable income to be received”&para;<br>over the plan’s duration “will be applied to make payments” in accor&para;<br>dance with plan terms. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1). Before enactment of&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of&para;<br>2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined “disposable income.”&para;<br>Though it did not define “projected disposable income,” most bank&para;<br>ruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying&para;<br>monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then de&para;<br>termining the “disposable” portion of the result. In exceptional cases,&para;<br>those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s&para;<br>income or expenses. BAPCPA defines “disposable income” as “cur&para;<br>rent monthly income received by the debtor” less “amounts reasona&para;<br>bly necessary to be expended” for, e.g., the debtor’s maintenance and&para;<br>support. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i). “Current monthly income,” in turn, is cal&para;<br>culated by averaging the debtor’s monthly income during a 6-month&para;<br>look-back period preceding the petition’s filing. See §101(10A)(A)(i).&para;<br>If a debtor’s income is below the median for his or her State,&para;<br>“amounts reasonably necessary” include the full amount needed for&para;<br>“maintenance or support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtor’s in&para;<br>come exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are&para;<br>included, see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).&para;<br>A one-time buyout from respondent’s former employer caused her&para;<br>current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v. LANNING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>petition to exceed her State’s median income. However, based on the&para;<br>income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her&para;<br>expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03. She&para;<br>thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month&para;<br>for 36 months. Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confir&para;<br>mation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less&para;<br>than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because&para;<br>she had not committed all of her “projected disposable income” to re&para;<br>paying creditors. Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach&para;<br>was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that&para;<br>using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60&para;<br>months. Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month&para;<br>period, concluding that “projected” requires courts to consider the&para;<br>debtor’s actual income. The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate&para;<br>Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court cal&para;<br>culating “projected disposable income” should begin with the “pre&para;<br>sumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is cor&para;<br>rect, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial&para;<br>change in the debtor’s circumstances.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor’s projected dispos&para;<br>able income, the court may account for changes in the debtor’s income&para;<br>or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confir&para;<br>mation. Pp. 6–18.&para;<br>(a) Respondent has the better interpretation of “projected dispos&para;<br>able income.” First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by&para;<br>the ordinary meaning of “projected.” See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winter&para;<br>boer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. In ordinary usage future occurrences are&para;<br>not “projected” based on the assumption that the past will necessarily&para;<br>repeat itself. While a projection takes past events into account, ad&para;<br>justments are often made based on other factors that may affect the&para;<br>outcome. Second, “projected” appears in many federal statutes, yet&para;<br>Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication. See, e.g., 7&para;<br>U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B). By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows,&para;<br>Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambigu&para;<br>ous—commonly using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1325(b)(3). Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule&para;<br>was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current monthly income by&para;<br>the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in&para;<br>determining projected disposable income, but would also have discre&para;<br>tion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor’s&para;<br>income. This is significant, since the Court “will not read the Bank&para;<br>ruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indica&para;<br>tion that Congress intended such a departure,” Travelers Casualty &amp;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443, 454,&para;<br>and Congress did not amend the term “projected disposable income”&para;<br>in 2005. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(b) The mechanical approach also clashes with §1325’s terms.&para;<br>First, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable income “to be&para;<br>received in the applicable commitment period” strongly favors the&para;<br>forward-looking approach. Because respondent would have far less&para;<br>than $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, pe&para;<br>titioner’s projection does not accurately reflect disposable income “to&para;<br>be received.” In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effec&para;<br>tively reads that phrase out of the statute. Second, §1325(b)(1)’s di&para;<br>rection to courts to determine projected disposable income “as of the&para;<br>effective date of the plan,”— i.e., the confirmation date—is more con&para;<br>sistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information&para;<br>about a debtor’s financial situation. Had Congress intended for pro&para;<br>jected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable&para;<br>income, it could have specified the plan’s filing date as the effective&para;<br>date. Third, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s requirement that projected disposable&para;<br>income “will be applied to make payments” is rendered a hollow&para;<br>command if, as of the plan’s effective date, the debtor lacks the&para;<br>means to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts. Pp. 11–&para;<br>12.&para;<br>(c) The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unper&para;<br>suasive. The claim that the Code’s detailed and precise “disposable&para;<br>income” definition would have no purpose without the mechanical&para;<br>approach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula&para;<br>plays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a dis&para;<br>posable income calculation. The Tenth Circuit’s rebuttable “pre&para;<br>sumption” analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of “projected.”&para;<br>This Court rejects petitioner’s argument that only the mechanical&para;<br>approach is consistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “pro&para;<br>jected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section&para;<br>1325(b)(2)).” And the Court declines to infer from the fact that&para;<br>§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707—which allows courts to consider “spe&para;<br>cial circumstances,” but only with respect to calculating expenses—&para;<br>that Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that&para;<br>courts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain&para;<br>changes. Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>(d) Petitioner’s proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the&para;<br>harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debt&para;<br>ors—a debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraor&para;<br>dinary income outside the 6-month period; a debtor with unusually&para;<br>high income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a&para;<br>schedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v.

Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must&para;<br>liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,&para;<br>see §§704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to&para;<br>keep their property, but they must agree to a court­&para;<br>approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their&para;<br>future income, see §§1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a).

LANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court&para;<br>should calculate a debtor’s “projected disposable income.”&para;<br>Some lower courts have taken what the parties term the&para;<br>“mechanical approach,” while most have adopted what has&para;<br>been called the “forward-looking approach.” We hold that&para;<br>the “forward-looking approach” is correct.&para;<br>I&para;<br>As previously noted, §1325 provides that if a trustee or&para;<br>an unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor’s&para;<br>plan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless&para;<br>it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or&para;<br>“provides that all of the debtor’s projected disposable&para;<br>income to be received” over the duration of the plan “will&para;<br>be applied to make payments” in accordance with the&para;<br>terms of the plan. 11 U.

Before the enactment of the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of&para;<br>2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)&para;<br>loosely defined “disposable income” as “income which is&para;<br>received by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces­&para;<br>sary to be expended” for the “maintenance or support of&para;<br>the debtor,” for qualifying charitable contributions, or for&para;<br>business expenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A), (B).&para;<br>The Code did not define the term “projected disposable&para;<br>income,” and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a&para;<br>mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable&para;<br>income.

LANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she&para;<br>filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October&para;<br>2006. In the six months before her filing, she received a&para;<br>one-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay­&para;<br>ment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to&para;<br>$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,&para;<br>107. As a result of these payments, respondent’s current&para;<br>monthly income, as averaged from April through October&para;<br>2006, was $5,343.70—a figure that exceeds the median&para;<br>income for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re­&para;<br>spondent’s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to&para;<br>§707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a&para;<br>monthly “disposable income” of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched­&para;<br>ule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per&para;<br>month—which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see&para;<br>also id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly&para;<br>expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex­&para;<br>penses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule&para;<br>J figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly&para;<br>disposable income of $149.03.&para;<br>Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to&para;<br>pay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti­&para;<br>tioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma­&para;<br>tion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed&para;<br>to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against&para;<br>her, see §1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner’s view,&para;<br>respondent was not committing all of her “projected dis­&para;<br>posable income” to the repayment of creditors, see&para;<br>§1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to&para;<br>calculate projected disposable income was simply to mul­&para;<br>tiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the&para;<br>number of months in the commitment period.

Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 3–4.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent’s proposed&para;<br>monthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan&para;<br>period. No. 06–41037 etc., 2007 WL 1451999, *8 (Bkrtcy.&para;<br>Ct. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view&para;<br>that the word “projected” in §1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts&para;<br>“to consider at confirmation the debtor’s actual income as&para;<br>it was reported on Schedule I.” Id., at *5 (emphasis&para;<br>added). This conclusion was warranted by the text of&para;<br>§1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was&para;<br>necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank­&para;<br>ruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi­&para;<br>nances in the six months before filing. Ibid.&para;<br>Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy&para;<br>Appellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).&para;<br>The Panel noted that, although Congress redefined “dis­&para;<br>posable income” in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre­&para;<br>existing term “projected disposable income.” Id., at 24.&para;<br>Thus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe&para;<br>that Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice&para;<br>under which bankruptcy courts determined projected&para;<br>disposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but&para;<br>considered other evidence when there was reason to be­&para;<br>lieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor’s actual&para;<br>ability to pay. Ibid.&para;<br>The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270&para;<br>(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu­&para;<br>lating “projected disposable income,” should begin with the&para;<br>“presumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v.

S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of&para;<br>§1325’s reference to “projected disposable income.” Peti­&para;<br>tioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that&para;<br>“projected disposable income” means past average monthly&para;<br>disposable income multiplied by the number of months in&para;<br>a debtor’s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward­&para;<br>looking approach, agrees that the method outlined by&para;<br>petitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she&para;<br>argues that in exceptional cases, where significant&para;<br>changes in a debtor’s financial circumstances are known or&para;<br>virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to&para;<br>make an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the&para;<br>stronger argument.&para;<br>First, respondent’s argument is supported by the ordi­&para;<br>nary meaning of the term “projected.” “When terms used&para;<br>in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary&para;<br>meaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,&para;<br>187 (1995). Here, the term “projected” is not defined, and&para;<br>in ordinary usage future occurrences are not “projected”&para;<br>based on the assumption that the past will necessarily&para;<br>repeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com­&para;<br>pany’s future sales or the future cash flow from a license&para;<br>take into account anticipated events that may change past&para;<br>trends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights,&para;<br>Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to&para;<br>“projected sales” in light of falling demand); Innovair&para;<br>Aviation, Ltd. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504–&para;<br>506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>past sales are “not necessarily the number of sales” that&para;<br>will be made in the future). On the night of an election,&para;<br>experts do not “project” the percentage of the votes that a&para;<br>candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi­&para;<br>date will get the same percentage as he or she won in the&para;<br>first few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not&para;<br>project that a team’s winning percentage at the end of a&para;<br>new season will be the same as the team’s winning per­&para;<br>centage last year or the team’s winning percentage at the&para;<br>end of the first month of competition. While a projection&para;<br>takes past events into account, adjustments are often&para;<br>made based on other factors that may affect the final&para;<br>outcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.&para;<br>App. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting “multiplied,” which&para;<br>“requires only mathematical acumen,” with “projected,”&para;<br>which requires “mathematic acumen adjusted by delibera­&para;<br>tion and discretion”).&para;<br>Second, the word “projected” appears in many federal&para;<br>statutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple&para;<br>multiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment&para;<br>Act of 1938 defined “projected national yield,” “projected&para;<br>county yield,” and “projected farm yield” as entailing&para;<br>historical averages “adjusted for abnormal weather condi­&para;<br>tions,” “trends in yields,” and “any significant changes in&para;<br>production practices.” 7 U.

The&para;<br>mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of&para;<br>the statute when a debtor’s current disposable income is&para;<br>substantially higher than the income that the debtor&para;<br>predictably will receive during the plan period.

Had Congress intended for&para;<br>projected disposable income to be nothing more than a&para;<br>multiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea­&para;<br>son why Congress would not have required courts to de­&para;<br>termine that value as of the filing date of the plan.

In the very next section of the Code, for&para;<br>example, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence&para;<br>payments “not later than 30 days after the date of the&para;<br>filing of the plan.” §1326(a)(1) (emphasis added).

This argument overlooks the&para;<br>important role that the statutory formula for calculating&para;<br>“disposable income” plays under the forward-looking&para;<br>approach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a&para;<br>court taking the forward-looking approach should begin by&para;<br>calculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing&para;<br>more is required.

See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.&para;<br>Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is&para;<br>consistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “projected&para;<br>disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section&para;<br>1325(b)(2)).”&para;<br>This cross-reference, petitioner argues,&para;<br>shows that Congress intended for the term “projected&para;<br>disposable income” to incorporate, presumably in all con­&para;<br>texts, the defined term “disposable income.” It is evident&para;<br>that §1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term “disposable income,” see §1325(b)(2), but that fact offers&para;<br>no insight into the meaning of the word “projected”&para;<br>in §§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see&para;<br>how that word acquires a specialized meaning as a&para;<br>result of this cross-reference—particularly where both&para;<br>§§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis­&para;<br>posable income “to be received” during the relevant period.&para;<br>See supra, at 11.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 For the same reason, the phrase “[f]or purposes of this subsection”&para;<br>in §1325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking&para;<br>approach.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v. LANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner also notes that §707 allows courts to take&para;<br>“special circumstances” into consideration, but that&para;<br>§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707 only with respect to calcu­&para;<br>lating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314–315&para;<br>(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a “special&para;<br>circumstances” exception should not be inferred with&para;<br>respect to the debtor’s income. We decline to infer from&para;<br>§1325’s incorporation of §707 that Congress intended to&para;<br>eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ­&para;<br>ously exercised when projecting disposable income to&para;<br>account for known or virtually certain changes. Accord,&para;<br>In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.&para;<br>NJ 2008).&para;<br>D&para;<br>In cases in which a debtor’s disposable income during&para;<br>the 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower&para;<br>or higher than the debtor’s disposable income during the&para;<br>plan period, the mechanical approach would produce&para;<br>senseless results that we do not think Congress intended.&para;<br>In cases in which the debtor’s disposable income is higher&para;<br>during the plan period, the mechanical approach would&para;<br>deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily&para;<br>make. And where, as in the present case, the debtor’s&para;<br>disposable income during the plan period is substantially&para;<br>lower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection&para;<br>of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter’s main&para;<br>eligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is&para;<br>an “individual whose income is sufficiently stable and&para;<br>regular” to allow her “to make payments under a plan,”&para;<br>§101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in&para;<br>§109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she&para;<br>could not file a confirmable plan.

We see little merit in&para;<br>this convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of&para;<br>the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would&para;<br>improperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as&para;<br>we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence&para;<br>to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is&para;<br>not needed.

The&para;<br>availability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who&para;<br>have above-median incomes is limited. In respondent’s&para;<br>case, a presumption of abuse would attach under&para;<br>§707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, “multiplied&para;<br>by 60,” exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and&para;<br>(II). See also §707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a&para;<br>petition filed by a debtor “whose debts are primarily con­&para;<br>sumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would&para;<br>be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter”); App. 86–88&para;<br>(“Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor under §342(b) of&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Code”) (“If your income is greater than the&para;<br>median income for your state of residence and family size,&para;<br>in some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion&para;<br>requesting that the court dismiss your case under §707(b)&para;<br>of the Code”). Nevertheless, petitioner argues, respondent&para;<br>might have been able to overcome this presumption by&para;<br>claiming that her case involves “special circumstances”&para;<br>within the meaning of §707(b)(2)(B)(i).

Cf. §1129(a)(15)(B) (referring to&para;<br>“the projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined&para;<br>in section 1325(b)(2))”).

One who is asked to predict future results, but&para;<br>is armed with no other information than prior perform&para;<br>ance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the&para;<br>mark.

S. C. §1364(c)(2), or “any . . . relevant information,” 25&para;<br>U. S. C. §2009(c)(1). But it included no such prescription&para;<br>here, and instead identified the data a court should con&para;<br>sider. Perhaps Congress concluded that other information&para;<br>a bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too&para;<br>easily manipulated.

In all&para;<br>events, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the&para;<br>projection method Congress chose has any bearing on&para;<br>what the statute means.&para;<br>The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts&para;<br>to multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it&para;<br>would have used the word “multiplied,” as it has done&para;<br>elsewhere—indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see,&para;<br>e.g., 11 U.

While&para;<br>under my reading a court must determine the income half&para;<br>of the “projected disposable income” equation by multiply&para;<br>ing a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the&para;<br>expenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike&para;<br>the debtor’s current monthly income, none of the three&para;<br>types of expenses—payments for the support of the debtor&para;<br>and his dependents, charitable contributions, and ex&para;<br>penses to keep an existing business above water—is ex&para;<br>plicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for&para;<br>debtors with incomes below the state median). The first of&para;<br>those cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based&para;<br>on the same 6-month period from which current monthly&para;<br>income is derived,3 and the texts of the other two are&para;<br>consistent with determining expenses based on expecta&para;<br>tions.

The&para;<br>statute thus requires the court to predict the difference&para;<br>between two figures, each of which depends on the dura&para;<br>tion of the commitment period, and one of which also turns&para;<br>partly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this,&para;<br>it seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process&para;<br>as projection, not merely multiplication.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Court’s remaining arguments about the statute’s&para;<br>meaning are easily dispatched. A “mechanical” reading of&para;<br>projected disposable income, it contends, renders superflu&para;<br>ous the phrase “to be received in the applicable commit&para;<br>ment period” in §1325(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 11. Not at all.&para;<br>That phrase defines the period for which a debtor’s dis&para;<br>posable income must be calculated (i.e., the period over&para;<br>which the projection extends), and thus the amount the&para;<br>debtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.&para;<br>Similarly insubstantial is the Court’s claim regarding&para;<br>the requirement that the plan provide that the debtor’s&para;<br>projected disposable income “will be applied to make&para;<br>payments”&para;<br>toward&para;<br>unsecured&para;<br>creditors’&para;<br>claims,&para;<br>§1325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no&para;<br>sense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount&para;<br>equal to his projected disposable income. Ante, at 12. But&para;<br>it makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is&para;<br>entitled to confirmation in the first place; and that as&para;<br>sumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay&para;<br>at least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to&para;<br>confirmation. The “will be applied” proviso does not re&para;<br>quire a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds&para;<br>Chapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.&para;<br>The Court also argues that §1325(b)(1)’s directive to&para;<br>determine projected disposable income “as of the effective&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v. LANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>date of the plan” makes no sense if mere multiplication of&para;<br>existing numbers is required. Ante, at 11–12. As I have&para;<br>explained, however, “projected disposable income” may in&para;<br>some cases require more than multiplication (as to ex&para;<br>penses), and the estimations involved may vary from the&para;<br>date of the plan’s filing until the date it takes effect.&para;<br>Moreover, the provision also applies to the alternative&para;<br>avenue to confirmation in §1325(b)(1)(A), which requires&para;<br>that “the value of the property to be distributed under the&para;<br>plan” to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the credi&para;<br>tor’s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date&para;<br>requirement makes perfect sense.&para;<br>Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice&para;<br>prior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer&para;<br>Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns&para;<br>with the atextual approach the Court adopts today. Ante,&para;<br>at 8–10. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of&para;<br>the relevant provisions was completely consistent with&para;<br>that approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA “did not&para;<br>amend the term ‘projected disposable income,’ ” ante, at 10.&para;<br>But it did amend the definition of that term. Before 2005,&para;<br>§1325(b)(2) defined “disposable income” simply as “income&para;<br>which is received by the debtor and which is not reasona&para;<br>bly necessary to be expended” on the same basic types of&para;<br>expenses excluded by the current statute. §1325(b)(2)&para;<br>(2000 ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a&para;<br>court to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6&para;<br>month period. But in BAPCPA—the same Act in which&para;<br>Congress defined “current monthly income” in&para;<br>§101(10A)(A)—Congress redefined “disposable income” in&para;<br>§1325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking defini&para;<br>tion. See Pub. L. 109–8, §102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32–34.&para;<br>Given these significant changes, the fact that the Court’s&para;<br>approach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only&para;<br>does not recommend it, see e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of&para;<br>Public Welfare v.

Even if it were&para;<br>true that a “mechanical” reading resulted in undesirable&para;<br>outcomes, that would make no difference. Lewis v. Chi&para;<br>cago, 560 U.

For even&para;<br>assuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know&para;<br>which results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoid&para;<br>ing) apart from the only congressional expression of its&para;<br>thoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrele&para;<br>vant to what the statute means.&para;<br>In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as&para;<br>inevitable nor as “senseless” as the Court portrays. The&para;<br>Court’s first concern is that if actual or anticipated&para;<br>changes in the debtor’s earnings are ignored, then a debtor&para;<br>whose income increases after the critical 6-month window&para;<br>will not be required to pay all he can afford. Ante, at 14.&para;<br>But as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22–23,&para;<br>Chapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the re&para;<br>quest of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan “[a]t any&para;<br>time after confirmation” to “increase . . . the amount of&para;<br>payments” on a class of claims or “reduce the time for such&para;<br>payments.” §1329(a)(1)–(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers&para;<br>no explanation of why modification would not be available&para;<br>in such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.&para;<br>The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor&para;<br>whose income suddenly declines after the 6-month window&para;<br>or who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during&para;<br>that window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief be&para;<br>cause he will be unable to devote his “disposable income”&para;<br>(which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unse&para;<br>cured creditors going forward.

Cf. §1329(b)(1)&para;<br>(requiring that modifications meet requirements of&para;<br>§§1322(a)–(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not §1325(b)).&para;<br>Moreover, even apart from the availability of modifica&para;<br>tion it requires little imagination to see why Congress&para;<br>might want to withhold relief from debtors whose situa&para;<br>tions have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the&para;<br>end of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire&para;<br>straits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by&para;<br>an influx of unusually high income. Bankruptcy protec&para;<br>tion is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably&para;<br>conclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet&para;<br>need a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they&para;<br>will recover. And perhaps the debtor who has received a&para;<br>one-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.&para;<br>How long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is&para;<br>inherently a policy choice.

Freeman, 794&para;<br>F. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)—involved a debtor’s delaying his petition&para;<br>until his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment&para;<br>plan.&para;<br>5 The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this ex&para;<br>ception, ante, at 16, and n. 6, since §521(i)(3) provides that a bank&para;<br>ruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made after the&para;<br>deadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of&para;<br>more than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to&para;<br>assume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether:&para;<br>A debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance “unless the&para;<br>court orders otherwise,” §521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).&para;<br>And&para;<br>§101(10A)(A)(ii)’s provision of a method for calculating current monthly&para;<br>income “if the debtor does not file the schedule of current income&para;<br>required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)” makes little sense unless a court&para;<br>can excuse the failure to do so, since an unexcused failure to do so&para;<br>would be a basis for dismissing the case, see §521(i). Allowing courts to&para;<br>excuse such schedules does not render superfluous §521(i)(3)’s authori&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v. LANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>● A debtor who learns after filing that he will be unable&para;<br>to repay his full projected disposable income might also be&para;<br>able to dismiss his case and refile it later. §1307(b). The&para;<br>Court worries that this alternative also might be deemed&para;<br>abusive, again with no pertinent authority for the specula&para;<br>tion.6 Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this&para;<br>“circumvents the statutory limits on a court’s ability to&para;<br>shift the look-back period.” Ante, at 16–17. That belief is&para;<br>mistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statu&para;<br>tory limitations on adjusting the look-back period, and&para;<br>because, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income&para;<br>formula’s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time&para;<br>of determining that figure, it would not undermine the&para;<br>limitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to&para;<br>allow the debtor to dismiss and refile.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>zation for limited extensions, since that applies to extensions sought up&para;<br>to 45 days after the filing deadline, whereas §521(a)(1)(B) seems to&para;<br>apply only before the deadline.&para;<br>6 The sole authority the Court supplies—a single Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>decision predating BAPCPA—provides no support. See In re Glenn,&para;<br>288 B. R. 516, 519–521 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002). Although ac&para;<br>knowledging that “[m]ultiple filings by a debtor are not, in and of&para;<br>themselves, improper,” the court did note that “whether this is the first&para;<br>or subsequent filin[g]” by the debtor is one among the “totality of the&para;<br>circumstances” to be considered in a good-faith analysis. Id., at 520&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). The debtor in the case at hand had&para;<br>filed three previous Chapter 13 petitions, “each on the eve of a sched&para;<br>uled foreclosure,” and according to the court “never had any intention of&para;<br>following through with any of the Chapter 13 cases,” but had used the&para;<br>bankruptcy process “to hold [his creditor] hostage, while remaining in&para;<br>his residence without paying for it.” Id., at 520–521.&para;<br>7 The Court also notes that the Code precludes a debtor who has had&para;<br>a case pending in the last 180 days from refiling if his prior case was&para;<br>dismissed because he willfully failed to obey the court’s orders or to&para;<br>appear before the court, §109(g)(1), or if he voluntarily dismissed the&para;<br>prior suit “following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic&para;<br>stay” under §362, §109(g)(2). Ante, at 17, n. 7. But the Court does not&para;<br>explain why these barriers have any bearing on whether refiling for&para;<br>bankruptcy would be abusive when the barriers do not apply.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>● A debtor unable to pursue any of these avenues to&para;<br>Chapter 13 might still seek relief under Chapter 7. The&para;<br>Court declares this cold comfort, noting that some debt&para;<br>ors—including Lanning—will have incomes too high to&para;<br>qualify for Chapter 7. Ante, at 17–18. Some such debtors,&para;<br>however, may be able to show “special circumstances,”&para;<br>§707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside&para;<br>from noting the absence of authority on the issue, the&para;<br>Court’s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the&para;<br>special-circumstances exception is available only if the&para;<br>debtor has “no reasonable alternative,” §707(b)(2)(B)(i),&para;<br>which will not be true after today given the Court’s hold&para;<br>ing that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a&para;<br>debtor’s income. As for those who cannot establish special&para;<br>circumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause&para;<br>for concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such&para;<br>debtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and&para;<br>that they are not suitable candidates for repaying their&para;<br>debts (at least in part) under Chapter 13’s protective&para;<br>umbrella. We have neither reason nor warrant to second&para;<br>guess either determination.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Underlying the Court’s interpretation is an understand&para;<br>able urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields&para;<br>results that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending&para;<br>that reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit&para;<br>together. But taking liberties with text in light of outcome&para;<br>makes sense only if we assume that we know better than&para;<br>Congress which outcomes are mistaken. And by refusing&para;<br>to hold that Congress meant what it said, but see Con&para;<br>necticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254&para;<br>(1992), we deprive it of the ability to say what it means in&para;<br>the future.&para;<br>It may be that no interpretation of&para;<br>§1325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying. But it is in the hard&para;<br>cases, even more than the easy ones, that we should faith&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HAMILTON v. LANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>fully apply our settled interpretive principles, and trust&para;<br>that Congress will correct the law if what it previously&para;<br>prescribed is wrong.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
