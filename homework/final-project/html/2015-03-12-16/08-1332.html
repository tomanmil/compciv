QUON &para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1332. Argued April 19, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010&para;<br>Petitioner Ontario (hereinafter City) acquired alphanumeric pagers&para;<br>able to send and receive text messages. Its contract with its service&para;<br>provider, Arch Wireless, provided for a monthly limit on the number&para;<br>of characters each pager could send or receive, and specified that us&para;<br>age exceeding that number would result in an additional fee. The&para;<br>City issued the pagers to respondent Quon and other officers in its&para;<br>police department (OPD), also a petitioner here. When Quon and&para;<br>others exceeded their monthly character limits for several months&para;<br>running, petitioner Scharf, OPD’s chief, sought to determine whether&para;<br>the existing limit was too low, i.e., whether the officers had to pay&para;<br>fees for sending work-related messages or, conversely, whether the&para;<br>overages were for personal messages. After Arch Wireless provided&para;<br>transcripts of Quon’s and another employee’s August and September&para;<br>2002 text messages, it was discovered that many of Quon’s messages&para;<br>were not work related, and some were sexually explicit. Scharf re&para;<br>ferred the matter to OPD’s internal affairs division. The investigat&para;<br>ing officer used Quon’s work schedule to redact from his transcript&para;<br>any messages he sent while off duty, but the transcript showed that&para;<br>few of his on-duty messages related to police business. Quon was dis&para;<br>ciplined for violating OPD rules.&para;<br>He and the other respondents—each of whom had exchanged text&para;<br>messages with Quon during August and September—filed this suit,&para;<br>alleging, inter alia, that petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights and the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtain&para;<br>ing and reviewing the transcript of Quon’s pager messages, and that&para;<br>Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.&para;<br>The District Court denied respondents summary judgment on the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>constitutional claims, relying on the plurality opinion in O’Connor v.&para;<br>Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, to determine that Quon had a reasonable ex&para;<br>pectation of privacy in the content of his messages. Whether the au&para;<br>dit was nonetheless reasonable, the court concluded, turned on&para;<br>whether Scharf used it for the improper purpose of determining if&para;<br>Quon was using his pager to waste time, or for the legitimate purpose&para;<br>of determining the efficacy of existing character limits to ensure that&para;<br>officers were not paying hidden work-related costs. After the jury&para;<br>concluded that Scharf’s intent was legitimate, the court granted peti&para;<br>tioners summary judgment on the ground they did not violate the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Although it agreed&para;<br>that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text mes&para;<br>sages, the appeals court concluded that the search was not reason&para;<br>able even though it was conducted on a legitimate, work-related ra&para;<br>tionale. The opinion pointed to a host of means less intrusive than&para;<br>the audit that Scharf could have used. The court further concluded&para;<br>that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City the tran&para;<br>script.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Because the search of Quon’s text messages was reasonable, peti&para;<br>tioners did not violate respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights, and&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise. Pp. 7–17.&para;<br>(a) The Amendment guarantees a person’s privacy, dignity, and se&para;<br>curity against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without re&para;<br>gard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or per&para;<br>forming another function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’&para;<br>Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613–614. It applies as well when the govern&para;<br>ment acts in its capacity as an employer. Treasury Employees v. Von&para;<br>Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665. The Members of the O’Connor Court dis&para;<br>agreed on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment&para;<br>claims against government employers. A four-Justice plurality con&para;<br>cluded that the correct analysis has two steps. First, because “some&para;<br>[government] offices may be so open . . . that no expectation of pri&para;<br>vacy is reasonable,” a court must consider “[t]he operational realities&para;<br>of the workplace” to determine if an employee’s constitutional rights&para;<br>are implicated. 480 U. S., at 718. Second, where an employee has a&para;<br>legitimate privacy expectation, an employer’s intrusion on that ex&para;<br>pectation “for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for&para;<br>investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the&para;<br>standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.” Id., at 725–&para;<br>726. JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, would have dis&para;<br>pensed with the “operational realities” inquiry and concluded “that&para;<br>the offices of government employees . . . are [generally] covered by&para;<br>Fourth Amendment protections,” id., at 731, but he would also have&para;<br>held “that government searches to retrieve work-related materials or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to investigate violations of workplace rules—searches of the sort that&para;<br>are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer con&para;<br>text—do not violate the . . . Amendment,” id., at 732. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of pri&para;<br>vacy in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both&para;<br>O’Connor approaches, the plurality’s and JUSTICE SCALIA’s. Pp. 9–17.&para;<br>(1) The Court does not resolve the parties’ disagreement over&para;<br>Quon’s privacy expectation. Prudence counsels caution before the&para;<br>facts in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that de&para;<br>fine the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees&para;<br>using employer-provided communication devices. Rapid changes in&para;<br>the dynamics of communication and information transmission are&para;<br>evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as&para;<br>proper behavior. At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms,&para;<br>and the law’s treatment of them, will evolve. Because it is therefore&para;<br>preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court as&para;<br>sumes, arguendo, that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expecta&para;<br>tion; (2) petitioners’ review of the transcript constituted a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment search; and (3) the principles applicable to a government&para;<br>employer’s search of an employee’s physical office apply as well in the&para;<br>electronic sphere. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>(2) Petitioners’ warrantless review of Quon’s pager transcript was&para;<br>reasonable under the O’Connor plurality’s approach because it was&para;<br>motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was&para;<br>not excessive in scope. See 480 U. S., at 726. There were “reasonable&para;<br>grounds for [finding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related&para;<br>purpose,” ibid., in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to deter&para;<br>mine whether the City’s contractual character limit was sufficient to&para;<br>meet the City’s needs. It was also “reasonably related to the objec&para;<br>tives of the search,” ibid., because both the City and OPD had a le&para;<br>gitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to&para;<br>pay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the&para;<br>other hand, that the City was not paying for extensive personal&para;<br>communications. Reviewing the transcripts was an efficient and ex&para;<br>pedient way to determine whether either of these factors caused&para;<br>Quon’s overages. And the review was also not “excessively intrusive.”&para;<br>Ibid. Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number&para;<br>of times, OPD requested transcripts for only August and September&para;<br>2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character&para;<br>limits’ efficaciousness, and all the messages that Quon sent while off&para;<br>duty were redacted. And from OPD’s perspective, the fact that Quon&para;<br>likely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that&para;<br>the review would intrude on highly private details of Quon’s life.&para;<br>Similarly, because the City had a legitimate reason for the search&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the&para;<br>search would be “regarded as reasonable and normal in the private&para;<br>employer context” and thereby satisfy the approach of JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA’s concurrence, id., at 732. Conversely, the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>“least intrusive” means approach was inconsistent with controlling&para;<br>precedents. See, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S.&para;<br>646, 663. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(c) Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expecta&para;<br>tion of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.&para;<br>They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it&para;<br>was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argu&para;<br>ment that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be&para;<br>unreasonable as to them. Given this litigating position and the&para;<br>Court’s conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these&para;<br>other respondents cannot prevail.

JEFF QUON ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 17, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>This case involves the assertion by a government em­&para;<br>ployer of the right, in circumstances to be described, to&para;<br>read text messages sent and received on a pager the em­&para;<br>ployer owned and issued to an employee. The employee&para;<br>contends that the privacy of the messages is protected by&para;<br>the ban on “unreasonable searches and seizures” found in&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution,&para;<br>made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause&para;<br>of the Fourteenth Amendment.&para;<br>Mapp v. Ohio, 367&para;<br>U. S. 643 (1961). Though the case touches issues of farreaching significance, the Court concludes it can be re­&para;<br>solved by settled principles determining when a search is&para;<br>reasonable.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>The City of Ontario (City) is a political subdivision of the&para;<br>State of California. The case arose out of incidents in 2001&para;<br>and 2002 when respondent Jeff Quon was employed by the&para;<br>Ontario Police Department (OPD). He was a police ser­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>geant and member of OPD’s Special Weapons and Tactics&para;<br>(SWAT) Team. The City, OPD, and OPD’s Chief, Lloyd&para;<br>Scharf, are petitioners here. As will be discussed, two&para;<br>respondents share the last name Quon. In this opinion&para;<br>“Quon” refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly&para;<br>revolve around him.&para;<br>In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric&para;<br>pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages.&para;<br>Arch Wireless Operating Company provided wireless&para;<br>service for the pagers. Under the City’s service contract&para;<br>with Arch Wireless, each pager was allotted a limited&para;<br>number of characters sent or received each month. Usage&para;<br>in excess of that amount would result in an additional fee.&para;<br>The City issued pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team&para;<br>members in order to help the SWAT Team mobilize and&para;<br>respond to emergency situations.&para;<br>Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a&para;<br>“Computer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy” (Computer&para;<br>Policy) that applied to all employees. Among other provi­&para;<br>sions, it specified that the City “reserves the right to moni­&para;<br>tor and log all network activity including e-mail and&para;<br>Internet use, with or without notice. Users should have no&para;<br>expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these&para;<br>resources.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. In March 2000,&para;<br>Quon signed a statement acknowledging that he had read&para;<br>and understood the Computer Policy.&para;<br>The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text&para;<br>messaging. Text messages share similarities with e-mails,&para;<br>but the two differ in an important way. In this case, for&para;<br>instance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmit­&para;<br>ted through the City’s own data servers, but a text mes­&para;<br>sage sent on one of the City’s pagers was transmitted&para;<br>using wireless radio frequencies from an individual pager&para;<br>to a receiving station owned by Arch Wireless. It was&para;<br>routed through Arch Wireless’ computer network, where it&para;<br>remained until the recipient’s pager or cellular telephone&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was ready to receive the message, at which point Arch&para;<br>Wireless transmitted the message from the transmitting&para;<br>station nearest to the recipient. After delivery, Arch&para;<br>Wireless retained a copy on its computer servers. The&para;<br>message did not pass through computers owned by the&para;<br>City.&para;<br>Although the Computer Policy did not cover text mes­&para;<br>sages by its explicit terms, the City made clear to employ­&para;<br>ees, including Quon, that the City would treat text mes­&para;<br>sages the same way as it treated e-mails. At an April 18,&para;<br>2002, staff meeting at which Quon was present, Lieuten­&para;<br>ant Steven Duke, the OPD officer responsible for the City’s&para;<br>contract with Arch Wireless, told officers that messages&para;<br>sent on the pagers “are considered e-mail messages. This&para;<br>means that [text] messages would fall under the City’s&para;<br>policy as public information and [would be] eligible for&para;<br>auditing.” App. 30. Duke’s comments were put in writing&para;<br>in a memorandum sent on April 29, 2002, by Chief Scharf&para;<br>to Quon and other City personnel.&para;<br>Within the first or second billing cycle after the pagers&para;<br>were distributed, Quon exceeded his monthly text message&para;<br>character allotment. Duke told Quon about the overage,&para;<br>and reminded him that messages sent on the pagers were&para;<br>“considered e-mail and could be audited.” Id., at 40. Duke&para;<br>said, however, that “it was not his intent to audit [an]&para;<br>employee’s text messages to see if the overage [was] due to&para;<br>work related transmissions.” Ibid. Duke suggested that&para;<br>Quon could reimburse the City for the overage fee rather&para;<br>than have Duke audit the messages. Quon wrote a check&para;<br>to the City for the overage. Duke offered the same ar­&para;<br>rangement to other employees who incurred overage fees.&para;<br>Over the next few months, Quon exceeded his character&para;<br>limit three or four times. Each time he reimbursed the&para;<br>City. Quon and another officer again incurred overage&para;<br>fees for their pager usage in August 2002. At a meeting in&para;<br>October, Duke told Scharf that he had become “ ‘tired of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>being a bill collector.’ ” Id., at 91. Scharf decided to de­&para;<br>termine whether the existing character limit was too&para;<br>low—that is, whether officers such as Quon were having to&para;<br>pay fees for sending work-related messages—or if the&para;<br>overages were for personal messages. Scharf told Duke to&para;<br>request transcripts of text messages sent in August and&para;<br>September by Quon and the other employee who had&para;<br>exceeded the character allowance.&para;<br>At Duke’s request, an administrative assistant em­&para;<br>ployed by OPD contacted Arch Wireless. After verifying&para;<br>that the City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch&para;<br>Wireless provided the desired transcripts. Duke reviewed&para;<br>the transcripts and discovered that many of the messages&para;<br>sent and received on Quon’s pager were not work related,&para;<br>and some were sexually explicit. Duke reported his find­&para;<br>ings to Scharf, who, along with Quon’s immediate supervi­&para;<br>sor, reviewed the transcripts himself. After his review,&para;<br>Scharf referred the matter to OPD’s internal affairs divi­&para;<br>sion for an investigation into whether Quon was violating&para;<br>OPD rules by pursuing personal matters while on duty.&para;<br>The officer in charge of the internal affairs review was&para;<br>Sergeant Patrick McMahon. Before conducting a review,&para;<br>McMahon used Quon’s work schedule to redact the tran­&para;<br>scripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent&para;<br>while off duty. He then reviewed the content of the mes­&para;<br>sages Quon sent during work hours. McMahon’s report&para;<br>noted that Quon sent or received 456 messages during&para;<br>work hours in the month of August 2002, of which no more&para;<br>than 57 were work related; he sent as many as 80 mes­&para;<br>sages during a single day at work; and on an average&para;<br>workday, Quon sent or received 28 messages, of which&para;<br>only 3 were related to police business. The report con­&para;<br>cluded that Quon had violated OPD rules. Quon was&para;<br>allegedly disciplined.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

C. §2701 et seq., popularly known as the&para;<br>Stored Communications Act (SCA); and California law,&para;<br>Quon filed suit against petitioners in the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Central District of California. Arch&para;<br>Wireless and an individual not relevant here were also&para;<br>named as defendants. Quon was joined in his suit by&para;<br>another plaintiff who is not a party before this Court and&para;<br>by the other respondents, each of whom exchanged text&para;<br>messages with Quon during August and September 2002:&para;<br>Jerilyn Quon, Jeff Quon’s then-wife, from whom he was&para;<br>separated; April Florio, an OPD employee with whom Jeff&para;<br>Quon was romantically involved; and Steve Trujillo, an­&para;<br>other member of the OPD SWAT Team. Among the alle­&para;<br>gations in the complaint was that petitioners violated&para;<br>respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights and the SCA by&para;<br>obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon’s&para;<br>pager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the&para;<br>SCA by turning over the transcript to the City.&para;<br>The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.&para;<br>The District Court granted Arch Wireless’ motion for&para;<br>summary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petition­&para;<br>ers’ motion for summary judgment on the Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment claims. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 445&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 1116 (CD Cal. 2006). Relying on the plural­&para;<br>ity opinion in O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 711&para;<br>(1987), the District Court determined that Quon had a&para;<br>reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his text&para;<br>messages. Whether the audit of the text messages was&para;<br>nonetheless reasonable, the District Court concluded,&para;<br>turned on Chief Scharf’s intent: “[I]f the purpose for the&para;<br>audit was to determine if Quon was using his pager to&para;<br>‘play games’ and ‘waste time,’ then the audit was not&para;<br>constitutionally reasonable”; but if the audit’s purpose&para;<br>“was to determine the efficacy of the existing character&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work­&para;<br>related costs, . . . no constitutional violation occurred.”&para;<br>445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1146.&para;<br>The District Court held a jury trial to determine the&para;<br>purpose of the audit. The jury concluded that Scharf&para;<br>ordered the audit to determine the efficacy of the charac­&para;<br>ter limits. The District Court accordingly held that peti­&para;<br>tioners did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It entered&para;<br>judgment in their favor.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­&para;<br>cuit reversed in part. 529 F. 3d 892 (2008). The panel&para;<br>agreed with the District Court that Jeff Quon had a rea­&para;<br>sonable expectation of privacy in his text messages but&para;<br>disagreed with the District Court about whether the&para;<br>search was reasonable. Even though the search was&para;<br>conducted for “a legitimate work-related rationale,” the&para;<br>Court of Appeals concluded, it “was not reasonable in&para;<br>scope.” Id., at 908. The panel disagreed with the District&para;<br>Court’s observation that “there were no less-intrusive&para;<br>means” that Chief Scharf could have used “to verify the&para;<br>efficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding&para;<br>on [respondents’] Fourth Amendment rights.” Id., at 908–&para;<br>909. The opinion pointed to a “host of simple ways” that&para;<br>the chief could have used instead of the audit, such as&para;<br>warning Quon at the beginning of the month that his&para;<br>future messages would be audited, or asking Quon himself&para;<br>to redact the transcript of his messages. Id., at 909. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals further concluded that Arch Wireless had&para;<br>violated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the&para;<br>City.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing en&para;<br>banc. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 554 F. 3d 769&para;<br>(2009). Judge Ikuta, joined by six other Circuit Judges,&para;<br>dissented. Id., at 774–779.

Quon, 558 U.

Camara v. Municipal Court of City and&para;<br>County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 530 (1967). “The&para;<br>Amendment guarantees the privacy, dignity, and security&para;<br>of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by&para;<br>officers of the Government,” without regard to whether the&para;<br>government actor is investigating crime or performing&para;<br>another function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’&para;<br>Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613–614 (1989). The Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment applies as well when the Government acts in its&para;<br>capacity as an employer. Treasury Employees v. Von&para;<br>Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665 (1989).&para;<br>The Court discussed this principle in O’Connor. There a&para;<br>physician employed by a state hospital alleged that hospi­&para;<br>tal officials investigating workplace misconduct had vio­&para;<br>lated his Fourth Amendment rights by searching his office&para;<br>and seizing personal items from his desk and filing cabi­&para;<br>net. All Members of the Court agreed with the general&para;<br>principle that “[i]ndividuals do not lose Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment rights merely because they work for the government&para;<br>instead of a private employer.” 480 U. S., at 717 (plurality&para;<br>opinion); see also id., at 731 (SCALIA, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment); id., at 737 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). A major­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v.

(quoting same).&para;<br>The O’Connor Court did disagree on the proper analyti­&para;<br>cal framework for Fourth Amendment claims against&para;<br>government employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded&para;<br>that the correct analysis has two steps. First, because&para;<br>“some government offices may be so open to fellow em­&para;<br>ployees or the public that no expectation of privacy is&para;<br>reasonable,” id., at 718, a court must consider “[t]he opera­&para;<br>tional realities of the workplace” in order to determine&para;<br>whether an employee’s Fourth Amendment rights are&para;<br>implicated, id., at 717. On this view, “the question&para;<br>whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of&para;<br>privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.” Id., at&para;<br>718. Next, where an employee has a legitimate privacy&para;<br>expectation, an employer’s intrusion on that expectation&para;<br>“for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as&para;<br>for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be&para;<br>judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the&para;<br>circumstances.” Id., at 725–726.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, outlined a&para;<br>different approach. His opinion would have dispensed&para;<br>with an inquiry into “operational realities” and would&para;<br>conclude “that the offices of government employees . . . are&para;<br>covered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general&para;<br>matter.” Id., at 731. But he would also have held “that&para;<br>government searches to retrieve work-related materials or&para;<br>to investigate violations of workplace rules—searches of&para;<br>the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the&para;<br>private-employer context—do not violate the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.” Id., at 732.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Later, in the Von Raab decision, the Court explained&para;<br>that “operational realities” could diminish an employee’s&para;<br>privacy expectations, and that this diminution could be&para;<br>taken into consideration when assessing the reasonable­&para;<br>ness of a workplace search. 489 U. S., at 671. In the two&para;<br>decades since O’Connor, however, the threshold test for&para;<br>determining the scope of an employee’s Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment rights has not been clarified further. Here, though&para;<br>they disagree on whether Quon had a reasonable expecta­&para;<br>tion of privacy, both petitioners and respondents start&para;<br>from the premise that the O’Connor plurality controls.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioners 22–28; Brief for Respondents 25–&para;<br>32. It is not necessary to resolve whether that premise is&para;<br>correct. The case can be decided by determining that the&para;<br>search was reasonable even assuming Quon had a reason­&para;<br>able expectation of privacy.&para;<br>The two O’Connor ap­&para;<br>proaches—the plurality’s and JUSTICE SCALIA’s—therefore&para;<br>lead to the same result here.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is&para;<br>instructive to note the parties’ disagreement over whether&para;<br>Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The record&para;<br>does establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that&para;<br>pager messages were not considered private. The City’s&para;<br>Computer Policy stated that “[u]sers should have no ex­&para;<br>pectation of privacy or confidentiality when using” City&para;<br>computers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. Chief Scharf’s&para;<br>memo and Duke’s statements made clear that this official&para;<br>policy extended to text messaging. The disagreement, at&para;<br>least as respondents see the case, is over whether Duke’s&para;<br>later statements overrode the official policy. Respondents&para;<br>contend that because Duke told Quon that an audit would&para;<br>be unnecessary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon rea­&para;<br>sonably could expect that the contents of his messages&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would remain private.&para;<br>At this point, were we to assume that inquiry into “op­&para;<br>erational realities” were called for, compare O’Connor, 480&para;<br>U. S., at 717 (plurality opinion), with id., at 730–731&para;<br>(opinion of SCALIA, J.); see also id., at 737–738 (Blackmun,&para;<br>J., dissenting), it would be necessary to ask whether&para;<br>Duke’s statements could be taken as announcing a change&para;<br>in OPD policy, and if so, whether he had, in fact or ap­&para;<br>pearance, the authority to make such a change and to&para;<br>guarantee the privacy of text messaging. It would also be&para;<br>necessary to consider whether a review of messages sent&para;<br>on police pagers, particularly those sent while officers are&para;<br>on duty, might be justified for other reasons, including&para;<br>performance evaluations, litigation concerning the lawful­&para;<br>ness of police actions, and perhaps compliance with state&para;<br>open records laws. See Brief for Petitioners 35–40 (citing&para;<br>Cal. Public Records Act, Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §6250 et seq.&para;<br>(West 2008)). These matters would all bear on the legiti­&para;<br>macy of an employee’s privacy expectation.&para;<br>The Court must proceed with care when considering the&para;<br>whole concept of privacy expectations in communications&para;<br>made on electronic equipment owned by a government&para;<br>employer. The judiciary risks error by elaborating too&para;<br>fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging&para;<br>technology before its role in society has become clear. See,&para;<br>e.g., Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928),&para;<br>overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 353&para;<br>(1967). In Katz, the Court relied on its own knowledge&para;<br>and experience to conclude that there is a reasonable&para;<br>expectation of privacy in a telephone booth. See id., at&para;<br>360–361 (Harlan, J., concurring). It is not so clear that&para;<br>courts at present are on so sure a ground. Prudence coun­&para;<br>sels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to&para;<br>establish far-reaching premises that define the existence,&para;<br>and extent, of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees&para;<br>when using employer-provided communication devices.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and&para;<br>information transmission are evident not just in the tech­&para;<br>nology itself but in what society accepts as proper behav­&para;<br>ior. As one amici brief notes, many employers expect or at&para;<br>least tolerate personal use of such equipment by employ­&para;<br>ees because it often increases worker efficiency. See Brief&para;<br>for Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. 16–20. Another&para;<br>amicus points out that the law is beginning to respond to&para;<br>these developments, as some States have recently passed&para;<br>statutes requiring employers to notify employees when&para;<br>monitoring their electronic communications. See Brief for&para;<br>New York Intellectual Property Law Association 22 (citing&para;<br>Del. Code Ann., Tit. 19, §705 (2005); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§31–48d (West 2003)). At present, it is uncertain how&para;<br>workplace norms, and the law’s treatment of them, will&para;<br>evolve.&para;<br>Even if the Court were certain that the O’Connor plural­&para;<br>ity’s approach were the right one, the Court would have&para;<br>difficulty predicting how employees’ privacy expectations&para;<br>will be shaped by those changes or the degree to which&para;<br>society will be prepared to recognize those expectations as&para;<br>reasonable. See 480 U. S., at 715. Cell phone and text&para;<br>message communications are so pervasive that some&para;<br>persons may consider them to be essential means or nec­&para;<br>essary instruments for self-expression, even self­&para;<br>identification. That might strengthen the case for an&para;<br>expectation of privacy. On the other hand, the ubiquity of&para;<br>those devices has made them generally affordable, so one&para;<br>could counter that employees who need cell phones or&para;<br>similar devices for personal matters can purchase and pay&para;<br>for their own. And employer policies concerning commu­&para;<br>nications will of course shape the reasonable expectations&para;<br>of their employees, especially to the extent that such&para;<br>policies are clearly communicated.&para;<br>A broad holding concerning employees’ privacy expecta­&para;<br>tions vis-à-vis employer-provided technological equipment&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>might have implications for future cases that cannot be&para;<br>predicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on nar­&para;<br>rower grounds. For present purposes we assume several&para;<br>propositions arguendo: First, Quon had a reasonable&para;<br>expectation of privacy in the text messages sent on the&para;<br>pager provided to him by the City; second, petitioners’&para;<br>review of the transcript constituted a search within the&para;<br>meaning of the Fourth Amendment; and third, the princi­&para;<br>ples applicable to a government employer’s search of an&para;<br>employee’s physical office apply with at least the same&para;<br>force when the employer intrudes on the employee’s pri­&para;<br>vacy in the electronic sphere.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in&para;<br>his text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the&para;<br>transcripts. Although as a general matter, warrantless&para;<br>searches “are per se unreasonable under the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment,” there are “a few specifically established and&para;<br>well-delineated exceptions” to that general rule. Katz,&para;<br>supra, at 357. The Court has held that the “ ‘special&para;<br>needs’ ” of the workplace justify one such exception.&para;<br>O’Connor, 480 U. S., at 725 (plurality opinion); id., at 732&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Von Raab, 489 U. S.,&para;<br>at 666–667.&para;<br>Under the approach of the O’Connor plurality, when&para;<br>conducted for a “noninvestigatory, work-related purpos[e]”&para;<br>or for the “investigatio[n] of work-related misconduct,” a&para;<br>government employer’s warrantless search is reasonable if&para;<br>it is “ ‘justified at its inception’ ” and if “ ‘the measures&para;<br>adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the&para;<br>search and not excessively intrusive in light of’ ” the cir­&para;<br>cumstances giving rise to the search. 480 U. S., at 725–&para;<br>726. The search here satisfied the standard of the&para;<br>O’Connor plurality and was reasonable under that ap­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>proach.&para;<br>The search was justified at its inception because there&para;<br>were “reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search&para;<br>[was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related pur­&para;<br>pose.” Id., at 726. As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered&para;<br>the search in order to determine whether the character&para;<br>limit on the City’s contract with Arch Wireless was suffi­&para;<br>cient to meet the City’s needs. This was, as the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit noted, a “legitimate work-related rationale.” 529&para;<br>F. 3d, at 908. The City and OPD had a legitimate interest&para;<br>in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay&para;<br>out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or on&para;<br>the other hand that the City was not paying for extensive&para;<br>personal communications.&para;<br>As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts&para;<br>was reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient&para;<br>way to determine whether Quon’s overages were the result&para;<br>of work-related messaging or personal use. The review&para;<br>was also not “ ‘excessively intrusive.’ ” O’Connor, supra, at&para;<br>726 (plurality opinion). Although Quon had gone over his&para;<br>monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested&para;<br>transcripts for only the months of August and September&para;<br>2002. While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD&para;<br>to review transcripts of all the months in which Quon&para;<br>exceeded his allowance, it was certainly reasonable for&para;<br>OPD to review messages for just two months in order to&para;<br>obtain a large enough sample to decide whether the char­&para;<br>acter limits were efficacious. And it is worth noting that&para;<br>during his internal affairs investigation, McMahon re­&para;<br>dacted all messages Quon sent while off duty, a measure&para;<br>which reduced the intrusiveness of any further review of&para;<br>the transcripts.&para;<br>Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon&para;<br>had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of&para;<br>his messages, the extent of an expectation is relevant to&para;<br>assessing whether the search was too intrusive. See Von&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Raab, supra, at 671; cf. Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Ac&para;<br>ton, 515 U. S. 646, 654–657 (1995). Even if he could as­&para;<br>sume some level of privacy would inhere in his messages,&para;<br>it would not have been reasonable for Quon to conclude&para;<br>that his messages were in all circumstances immune from&para;<br>scrutiny. Quon was told that his messages were subject to&para;<br>auditing. As a law enforcement officer, he would or should&para;<br>have known that his actions were likely to come under&para;<br>legal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his&para;<br>on-the-job communications. Under the circumstances, a&para;<br>reasonable employee would be aware that sound manage­&para;<br>ment principles might require the audit of messages to&para;<br>determine whether the pager was being appropriately&para;<br>used. Given that the City issued the pagers to Quon and&para;<br>other SWAT Team members in order to help them more&para;<br>quickly respond to crises—and given that Quon had re­&para;<br>ceived no assurances of privacy—Quon could have antici­&para;<br>pated that it might be necessary for the City to audit&para;<br>pager messages to assess the SWAT Team’s performance&para;<br>in particular emergency situations.&para;<br>From OPD’s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had&para;<br>only a limited privacy expectation, with boundaries that&para;<br>we need not here explore, lessened the risk that the review&para;<br>would intrude on highly private details of Quon’s life.&para;<br>OPD’s audit of messages on Quon’s employer-provided&para;<br>pager was not nearly as intrusive as a search of his per­&para;<br>sonal e-mail account or pager, or a wiretap on his home&para;<br>phone line, would have been. That the search did reveal&para;<br>intimate details of Quon’s life does not make it unreason­&para;<br>able, for under the circumstances a reasonable employer&para;<br>would not expect that such a review would intrude on such&para;<br>matters. The search was permissible in its scope.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals erred in finding the search unrea­&para;<br>sonable. It pointed to a “host of simple ways to verify the&para;<br>efficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding&para;<br>on [respondents’] Fourth Amendment rights.” 529 F. 3d,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 909. The panel suggested that Scharf “could have&para;<br>warned Quon that for the month of September he was&para;<br>forbidden from using his pager for personal communica­&para;<br>tions, and that the contents of all his messages would be&para;<br>reviewed to ensure the pager was used only for work­&para;<br>related purposes during that time frame. Alternatively, if&para;<br>[OPD] wanted to review past usage, it could have asked&para;<br>Quon to count the characters himself, or asked him to&para;<br>redact personal messages and grant permission to [OPD]&para;<br>to review the redacted transcript.” Ibid.&para;<br>This approach was inconsistent with controlling prece­&para;<br>dents. This Court has “repeatedly refused to declare that&para;<br>only the ‘least intrusive’ search practicable can be reason­&para;<br>able under the Fourth Amendment.” Vernonia, supra, at&para;<br>663; see also, e.g., Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist.&para;<br>No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 837&para;<br>(2002); Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 647 (1983).&para;<br>That rationale “could raise insuperable barriers to the&para;<br>exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers,”&para;<br>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 557, n. 12&para;<br>(1976), because “judges engaged in post hoc evaluations of&para;<br>government conduct can almost always imagine some&para;<br>alternative means by which the objectives of the govern­&para;<br>ment might have been accomplished,” Skinner, 489 U. S.,&para;<br>at 629, n. 9 (internal quotation marks and brackets omit­&para;<br>ted). The analytic errors of the Court of Appeals in this&para;<br>case illustrate the necessity of this principle. Even assum­&para;<br>ing there were ways that OPD could have performed the&para;<br>search that would have been less intrusive, it does not&para;<br>follow that the search as conducted was unreasonable.&para;<br>Respondents argue that the search was per se unrea­&para;<br>sonable in light of the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that&para;<br>Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the&para;<br>transcripts of Quon’s text messages. The merits of the&para;<br>SCA claim are not before us. But even if the Court of&para;<br>Appeals was correct to conclude that the SCA forbade&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Arch Wireless from turning over the transcripts, it does&para;<br>not follow that petitioners’ actions were unreasonable.&para;<br>Respondents point to no authority for the proposition that&para;<br>the existence of statutory protection renders a search per&para;<br>se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. And the&para;<br>precedents counsel otherwise. See Virginia v. Moore, 553&para;<br>U. S. 164, 168 (2008) (search incident to an arrest that&para;<br>was illegal under state law was reasonable); California v.&para;<br>Greenwood, 486 U. S. 35, 43 (1988) (rejecting argument&para;<br>that if state law forbade police search of individual’s gar­&para;<br>bage the search would violate the Fourth Amendment).&para;<br>Furthermore, respondents do not maintain that any OPD&para;<br>employee either violated the law him- or herself or knew&para;<br>or should have known that Arch Wireless, by turning over&para;<br>the transcript, would have violated the law. The other­&para;<br>wise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreason­&para;<br>able by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the&para;<br>SCA by turning over the transcripts.&para;<br>Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work­&para;<br>related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope,&para;<br>the search was reasonable under the approach of the&para;<br>O’Connor plurality. 480 U. S., at 726. For these same&para;<br>reasons—that the employer had a legitimate reason for&para;<br>the search, and that the search was not excessively intru­&para;<br>sive in light of that justification—the Court also concludes&para;<br>that the search would be “regarded as reasonable and&para;<br>normal in the private-employer context” and would satisfy&para;<br>the approach of JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence. Id., at 732.&para;<br>The search was reasonable, and the Court of Appeals&para;<br>erred by holding to the contrary. Petitioners did not vio­&para;<br>late Quon’s Fourth Amendment rights.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Finally, the Court must consider whether the search&para;<br>violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Jerilyn Quon,&para;<br>Florio, and Trujillo, the respondents who sent text mes­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Petitioners and respondents disagree&para;<br>whether a sender of a text message can have a reasonable&para;<br>expectation of privacy in a message he knowingly sends to&para;<br>someone’s employer-provided pager. It is not necessary to&para;<br>resolve this question in order to dispose of the case, how­&para;<br>ever. Respondents argue that because “the search was&para;<br>unreasonable as to Sergeant Quon, it was also unreason­&para;<br>able as to his correspondents.” Brief for Respondents 60&para;<br>(some capitalization omitted; boldface deleted). They&para;<br>make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable&para;<br>as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to&para;<br>Quon’s correspondents. See id., at 65–66.

Justice Blackmun, writing for the&para;<br>four dissenting Justices in O’Connor, agreed with JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA that an employee enjoys a reasonable expectation&para;<br>of privacy in his office. 480 U. S., at 737. But he advo&para;<br>cated a third approach to the reasonable expectation of&para;<br>privacy inquiry, separate from those proposed by the&para;<br>O’Connor plurality and by JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 8.&para;<br>Recognizing that it is particularly important to safeguard&para;<br>“a public employee’s expectation of privacy in the work&para;<br>place” in light of the “reality of work in modern time,” 480&para;<br>U.

And he emphasized that courts should determine&para;<br>this expectation in light of the specific facts of each par&para;<br>ticular search, rather than by announcing a categorical&para;<br>standard.

He therefore had only&para;<br>a limited expectation of privacy in relation to this particu&para;<br>lar audit of his pager messages. Whether one applies the&para;<br>reasoning from Justice O’Connor’s opinion, JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA’s concurrence, or Justice Blackmun’s dissent* in&para;<br>O’Connor, the result is the same: The judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals in this case must be reversed.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* I do not contend that Justice Blackmun’s opinion is controlling un&para;<br>der Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), but neither is his&para;<br>approach to evaluating a reasonable expectation of privacy foreclosed&para;<br>by O’Connor.

Ortega, 480 U.

It was that analysis—&para;<br>regarding the proper standard for evaluating a search when an em&para;<br>ployee has a reasonable expectation of privacy—that produced the&para;<br>opposite result in the case. This case does not implicate that debate&para;<br>because it does not involve an investigatory search.

Even accepting at face value Quon’s and his&para;<br>co-plaintiffs’ claims that the Fourth Amendment applies to&para;<br>their messages, the city’s search was reasonable, and thus&para;<br>did not violate the Amendment. See id., at 726 (plurality&para;<br>opinion); id., at 732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Since it is unnecessary to decide whether the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment applies, it is unnecessary to resolve which&para;<br>approach in O’Connor controls: the plurality’s or mine.*&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Despite his disclaimer, ante, at 2, n. (concurring opinion), JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS’ concurrence implies, ante, at 1–2, that it is also an open&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ONTARIO v. QUON&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>That should end the matter.&para;<br>The Court concedes as much, ante, at 9, 12–17, yet it&para;<br>inexplicably interrupts its analysis with a recitation of the&para;<br>parties’ arguments concerning, and an excursus on the&para;<br>complexity and consequences of answering, that admit&para;<br>tedly irrelevant threshold question, ante, at 9–12. That&para;<br>discussion is unnecessary. (To whom do we owe an addi&para;<br>tional explanation for declining to decide an issue, once we&para;<br>have explained that it makes no difference?) It also seems&para;<br>to me exaggerated. Applying the Fourth Amendment to&para;<br>new technologies may sometimes be difficult, but when it&para;<br>is necessary to decide a case we have no choice. The&para;<br>Court’s implication, ante, at 10, that where electronic&para;<br>privacy is concerned we should decide less than we other&para;<br>wise would (that is, less than the principle of law neces&para;<br>sary to resolve the case and guide private action)—or that&para;<br>we should hedge our bets by concocting case-specific stan&para;<br>dards or issuing opaque opinions—is in my view indefen&para;<br>sible. The-times-they-are-a-changin’ is a feeble excuse for&para;<br>disregard of duty.&para;<br>Worse still, the digression is self-defeating. Despite the&para;<br>Court’s insistence that it is agnostic about the proper test,&para;<br>lower courts will likely read the Court’s self-described&para;<br>“instructive” expatiation on how the O’Connor plurality’s&para;<br>approach would apply here (if it applied), ante, at 9–11, as&para;<br>a heavy-handed hint about how they should proceed.&para;<br>Litigants will do likewise, using the threshold question&para;<br>whether the Fourth Amendment is even implicated as a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>question whether the approach advocated by Justice Blackmun in his&para;<br>dissent in O’Connor is the proper standard. There is room for reason&para;<br>able debate as to which of the two approaches advocated by Justices&para;<br>whose votes supported the judgment in O’Connor—the plurality’s and&para;<br>mine—is controlling under Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193&para;<br>(1977). But unless O’Connor is overruled, it is assuredly false that a&para;<br>test that would have produced the opposite result in that case is still in&para;<br>the running.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>basis for bombarding lower courts with arguments about&para;<br>employer policies, how they were communicated, and&para;<br>whether they were authorized, as well as the latest trends&para;<br>in employees’ use of electronic media. In short, in saying&para;<br>why it is not saying more, the Court says much more than&para;<br>it should.&para;<br>The Court’s inadvertent boosting of the O’Connor plural&para;<br>ity’s standard is all the more ironic because, in fleshing&para;<br>out its fears that applying that test to new technologies&para;<br>will be too hard, the Court underscores the unworkability&para;<br>of that standard. Any rule that requires evaluating&para;<br>whether a given gadget is a “necessary instrumen[t] for&para;<br>self-expression, even self-identification,” on top of assess&para;<br>ing the degree to which “the law’s treatment of [workplace&para;<br>norms has] evolve[d],” ante, at 11, is (to put it mildly)&para;<br>unlikely to yield objective answers.&para;<br>I concur in the Court’s judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
