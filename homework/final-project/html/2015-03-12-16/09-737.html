JORDAN ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–737.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 1, 2010—Decided January 24, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Ortiz, a former inmate in an Ohio reformatory, brought a&para;<br>civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 seeking a judgment for&para;<br>damages against superintending prison officers. On two consecutive&para;<br>nights during her incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually as&para;<br>saulted by a corrections officer. Although she promptly reported the&para;<br>first assault, she further alleged, respondent Jordan, a case manager&para;<br>in her living unit, did nothing to ward off the second sexual assault,&para;<br>despite Jordan’s awareness of the substantial risk of that occurrence.&para;<br>Ortiz further charged that respondent Bright, a prison investigator,&para;<br>retaliated against Ortiz for her accusations by placing her, shackled&para;<br>and handcuffed, in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate&para;<br>heat, clothing, bedding, or blankets. The responses of both officers,&para;<br>she said, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and Four&para;<br>teenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from violence while in&para;<br>custody.&para;<br>Jordan and Bright moved for summary judgment on pleas of&para;<br>“qualified immunity.” The District Court, noting factual disputes&para;<br>material to Ortiz’s claims and the officers’ qualified immunity de&para;<br>fenses, denied the summary judgment motion. The officers did not&para;<br>appeal that ruling. The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned&para;<br>a verdict against Jordan and Bright. They sought judgment as a&para;<br>matter of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), both&para;<br>at the close of Ortiz’s evidence and at the close of their own presenta&para;<br>tion. But they did not contest the jury’s liability finding by renewing,&para;<br>under Rule 50(b), their request for judgment as a matter of law. Nor&para;<br>did they request a new trial under Rule 59(a). The District Court en&para;<br>tered judgment for Ortiz. On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged, inter&para;<br>alia, that the District Court should have granted their motion for&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ORTIZ v. JORDAN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>summary judgment based on their qualified immunity defense. The&para;<br>Sixth Circuit agreed and reversed the judgment entered on the jury’s&para;<br>verdict, holding that both defendants were sheltered from Ortiz’s suit&para;<br>by qualified immunity.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: A party may not appeal a denial of summary judgment after a&para;<br>district court has conducted a full trial on the merits. A qualified&para;<br>immunity plea, not upheld at the summary judgment stage, may be&para;<br>pursued at trial, but at that stage, the plea must be evaluated in&para;<br>light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.&para;<br>Ordinarily, orders denying summary judgment are interlocutory and&para;<br>do not qualify as “final decisions” subject to appeal under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1291. Because a qualified immunity plea can spare an official not&para;<br>only from liability but from trial, this Court has recognized a limited&para;<br>exception to the categorization of summary judgment denials as non&para;<br>appealable orders. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 525–526. The&para;<br>exception permits an immediate appeal when summary judgment is&para;<br>denied to a defendant who urges that qualified immunity shelters her&para;<br>from suit. Id., at 527. Such an immediate appeal is not available,&para;<br>however, when the district court determines that factual issues genu&para;<br>inely in dispute preclude summary adjudication. Johnson v. Jones,&para;<br>515 U. S. 304, 313. Here, Jordan and Bright sought no immediate&para;<br>appeal from the denial of their summary judgment motion. Nor did&para;<br>they avail themselves of Rule 50(b), which permits the entry of judg&para;<br>ment, postverdict, for the verdict loser if the court finds the evidence&para;<br>legally insufficient to sustain the verdict. Absent such a motion, an&para;<br>appellate court is “powerless” to review the sufficiency of the evidence&para;<br>after trial. Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546&para;<br>U. S. 394, 405. This Court need not address the officers’ argument&para;<br>that a qualified immunity plea raising a “purely legal” issue is pre&para;<br>served for appeal by an unsuccessful summary judgment motion even&para;<br>if the plea is not reiterated in a Rule 50(b) motion. Cases fitting that&para;<br>bill typically involve disputes about the substance and clarity of pre&para;<br>existing law. In this case, however, what was controverted was not&para;<br>the pre-existing law, but the facts that could render Jordan and&para;<br>Bright answerable under §1983, e.g., whether Jordan was adequately&para;<br>informed, after the first assault, of the assailant’s identity and of&para;<br>Ortiz’s fear of a further assault. Because the dispositive facts were&para;<br>disputed, the officers’ qualified immunity defenses did not present&para;<br>“ ‘neat abstract issues of law.’ ” Johnson, 515 U. S., at 317. To the ex&para;<br>tent that Jordan and Bright urge Ortiz has not proved her case, they&para;<br>were, by their own account, obliged to raise that sufficiency-of-the&para;<br>evidence issue by postverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law&para;<br>under Rule 50(b). They did not do so. The Sixth Circuit, therefore,&para;<br>had no warrant to upset the jury’s decision on their liability. Pp. 6–&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

S. C. §1983 by&para;<br>Michelle Ortiz, a former inmate at the Ohio Reformatory&para;<br>for Women. Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Ortiz filed a&para;<br>complaint in federal court stating key facts on which she&para;<br>based claims for damages against superintending prison&para;<br>officers. On two consecutive nights during her one-year&para;<br>incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually assaulted by&para;<br>a corrections officer. Although she promptly reported the&para;<br>first incident, she further alleged, prison authorities took&para;<br>no measures to protect her against the second assault.&para;<br>After that assault, Ortiz charged, and in retaliation for&para;<br>accounts she gave of the two episodes, prison officials&para;<br>placed her, shackled and handcuffed, in solitary confine&para;<br>ment in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or&para;<br>blankets. The treatment to which she was exposed, Ortiz&para;<br>claimed, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from&para;<br>violence while in custody.&para;<br>Principal defendants in the suit, Paula Jordan, a case&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ORTIZ v. JORDAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>manager at Ortiz’s living unit, and Rebecca Bright, a&para;<br>prison investigator, moved for summary judgment on their&para;<br>pleas of “qualified immunity,” a defense that shields offi&para;<br>cials from suit if their conduct “d[id] not violate clearly&para;<br>established statutory or constitutional rights of which a&para;<br>reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzger&para;<br>ald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). Finding that the qualified&para;<br>immunity defense turned on material facts genuinely in&para;<br>dispute, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a), the District Judge&para;<br>denied summary judgment.&para;<br>Ortiz v. Voinovich, 211&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 917, 923–930 (SD Ohio 2002).&para;<br>The case then proceeded to trial, and the jury returned&para;<br>verdicts for Ortiz against both Jordan and Bright. The&para;<br>two officers appealed to the United States Court of Ap&para;<br>peals for the Sixth Circuit, targeting, inter alia, the denial&para;<br>of their pretrial motion for summary judgment. “[C]ourts&para;<br>normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment&para;<br>motion after a trial on the merits,” the Court of Appeals&para;<br>recognized. 316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (2009). Nevertheless,&para;<br>the Court continued, “denial of summary judgment based&para;<br>on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.” Ibid.&para;<br>Reversing the judgment entered on the jury’s verdict, the&para;<br>appeals court held that both defendants were sheltered&para;<br>from Ortiz’s suit by qualified immunity.&para;<br>We granted review, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), to decide a&para;<br>threshold question on which the Circuits are split: May a&para;<br>party, as the Sixth Circuit believed, appeal an order deny&para;<br>ing summary judgment after a full trial on the merits?1&para;<br>Our answer is no. The order retains its interlocutory&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Compare, e.g., Black v. J. I. Case Co., 22 F. 3d 568, 570–571 (CA5&para;<br>1994) (declining to review denial of summary judgment after trial);&para;<br>Price v. Kramer, 200 F. 3d 1237, 1243–1244 (CA9 2000) (no exception&para;<br>where summary judgment rejected assertion of qualified immunity),&para;<br>with Goff v. Bise, 173 F. 3d 1068, 1072 (CA8 1999) (denial of summary&para;<br>judgment based on qualified immunity reviewable after trial on the&para;<br>merits); 316 Fed.

Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337&para;<br>U. S. 541, 546 (1949). Once the case proceeds to trial, the&para;<br>full record developed in court supersedes the record exist&para;<br>ing at the time of the summary judgment motion. A quali&para;<br>fied immunity defense, of course, does not vanish when a&para;<br>district court declines to rule on the plea summarily. The&para;<br>plea remains available to the defending officials at trial;&para;<br>but at that stage, the defense must be evaluated in light of&para;<br>the character and quality of the evidence received in court.&para;<br>When summary judgment is sought on a qualified im&para;<br>munity defense, the court inquires whether the party&para;<br>opposing the motion has raised any triable issue barring&para;<br>summary adjudication. “[O]nce trial has been had,” how&para;<br>ever, “the availability of official immunity should be de&para;<br>termined by the trial record, not the pleadings nor the&para;<br>summary judgment record.” 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;&para;<br>E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure §3914.10, p. 684&para;<br>(2d ed. 1992 and Supp. 2010). After trial, if defendants&para;<br>continue to urge qualified immunity, the decisive question,&para;<br>ordinarily, is whether the evidence favoring the party&para;<br>seeking relief is legally sufficient to overcome the defense.&para;<br>See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b) (stating conditions on&para;<br>which judgment may be granted as a matter of law).&para;<br>In the case before us, the Court of Appeals, although&para;<br>purporting to review the District Court’s denial of the&para;<br>prison officials’ pretrial summary-judgment motion, 316&para;<br>Fed. Appx., at 453, several times pointed to evidence&para;<br>presented only at the trial stage of the proceedings, see&para;<br>id., at 453–454. The appeals court erred, but not fatally,&para;<br>by incorrectly placing its ruling under a summary&para;<br>judgment headline. Its judgment was infirm, however,&para;<br>because Jordan’s and Bright’s failure to renew their mo&para;<br>tion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 50(b) left the appellate forum with no&para;<br>warrant to reject the appraisal of the evidence by “the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ORTIZ v.

West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 330&para;<br>U. S. 212, 216 (1947).&para;<br>I&para;<br>Michelle Ortiz, serving a sentence for aggravated as&para;<br>sault against her husband,2 maintained that she was&para;<br>sexually assaulted on consecutive days by Corrections&para;<br>Officer Douglas Schultz. On Friday, November 8, 1996,&para;<br>Ortiz recounted, Schultz walked up behind her in the&para;<br>washroom of her living quarters and grabbed one of her&para;<br>breasts.3 Ortiz fended off the assault, but Schultz re&para;<br>turned later that day and threatened to “see [her] tomor&para;<br>row,” Tr. 36.&para;<br>The next day, Ortiz described the incident to Jordan.&para;<br>After assuring Ortiz that “no one has the right to touch&para;<br>you,” 316 Fed. Appx., at 451 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), Jordan told Ortiz that Schultz had been reas&para;<br>signed to another correctional facility and was serving his&para;<br>last day at the reformatory. Ortiz could file a written&para;<br>complaint, Jordan noted. She suggested, however, that&para;<br>Ortiz not do so, in view of Schultz’s imminent departure.&para;<br>Jordan advised Ortiz that she “always ha[d] the right to&para;<br>defend [her]self,” Tr. 43, and counseled her to “ ‘hang out&para;<br>with [her] friends’ for the rest of the day so that Schultz&para;<br>would not have the chance to be alone with her,” 316 Fed.&para;<br>Appx., at 451 (alteration in original).&para;<br>The day of her conversation with Ortiz, Jordan wrote an&para;<br>incident report describing her version of the encounter. In&para;<br>that account, Jordan stated that Ortiz had refused to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Ortiz maintained in her criminal prosecution that she acted in re&para;<br>taliation for multiple incidents of domestic violence to which she had&para;<br>been subjected over a span of several years. 316 Fed.

Jordan did not immediately notify her supe&para;<br>riors of the assault Ortiz reported and Ortiz’s consequent&para;<br>fears about her safety. Taking the incident report home in&para;<br>her workbag, Jordan submitted it upon her return to work&para;<br>two days later.&para;<br>Ortiz endeavored to follow Jordan’s advice about staying&para;<br>in the company of friends. But later in the day, feeling ill,&para;<br>she returned to her room and fell asleep. Three other&para;<br>inmates were in the room when Ortiz went to sleep. They&para;<br>were gone when she awoke to find Schultz standing over&para;<br>her, one hand fondling her left breast, the fingers of the&para;<br>other hand inside her underwear penetrating her vagina.&para;<br>Bright’s investigation began two days after the second&para;<br>assault. During its course, Bright placed Ortiz in solitary&para;<br>confinement. Ortiz maintained that Bright isolated her in&para;<br>retaliation for her accusations against Schultz. Bright,&para;<br>however, testified that she segregated Ortiz because Ortiz&para;<br>continued to discuss the investigation with other inmates,&para;<br>disobeying Bright’s repeated instructions to refrain from&para;<br>speaking about it.&para;<br>In her §1983 action, Ortiz claimed that Jordan did&para;<br>nothing to ward off Schultz’s second sexual assault, de&para;<br>spite Jordan’s awareness of the substantial risk of that&para;<br>occurrence. Bright, Ortiz charged, retaliated against her&para;<br>because she resisted Bright’s efforts to induce her to re&para;<br>tract her accounts of Schultz’s assaults. (Schultz, having&para;<br>resigned from state employment, could not be found and&para;<br>served with process.) The District Court, noting multiple&para;<br>factual disputes material to Ortiz’s claims and the officers’&para;<br>defense of qualified immunity, denied summary judgment&para;<br>to Jordan and Bright, 211 F. Supp. 2d, at 923–930;4 nei&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 As to Jordan, the District Court determined, inter alia, that “a jury&para;<br>could reasonably find . . . that Ortiz did inform Jordan of Schultz’s&para;<br>identity,” and that “Ortiz made Jordan aware that [Ortiz] reasonably&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ORTIZ v.

Jordan and&para;<br>Bright sought judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to&para;<br>Rule 50(a), both at the close of Ortiz’s evidence and at the&para;<br>close of their own presentation. But they did not contest&para;<br>the jury’s liability finding by renewing, under Rule 50(b),&para;<br>their request for judgment as a matter of law. Nor did&para;<br>they request a new trial under Rule 59(a). The District&para;<br>Court entered judgment for Ortiz in accordance with the&para;<br>jury’s verdict.&para;<br>On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged both that the Dis&para;<br>trict Court should have granted them summary judgment&para;<br>on their defense of qualified immunity and that the ver&para;<br>dict was “against the weight of the evidence.” Brief for&para;<br>Defendants-Appellants in No. 06–3627 (CA6), pp. 21, 26.&para;<br>Appraising the parties’ evidence under a de novo standard&para;<br>of review, the Court of Appeals “reverse[d] the denial of&para;<br>qualified immunity to both Bright and Jordan.” 316 Fed.&para;<br>Appx., at 455.5&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the&para;<br>Circuits as to whether a party may appeal a denial of&para;<br>summary judgment after a district court has conducted a&para;<br>full trial on the merits.

C.&para;<br>§1291 extends only to “appeals from . . . final decisions of&para;<br>the district courts.” Ordinarily, orders denying summary&para;<br>judgment do not qualify as “final decisions” subject to&para;<br>appeal. Summary judgment must be denied when the&para;<br>court of first instance determines that a “genuine dispute&para;<br>as to [a] material fact” precludes immediate entry of&para;<br>judgment as a matter of law. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).&para;<br>Such rulings, we have observed, are “by their terms inter&para;<br>locutory.” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737,&para;<br>744 (1976).&para;<br>Because a plea of qualified immunity can spare an&para;<br>official not only from liability but from trial, we have&para;<br>recognized a limited exception to the categorization of&para;<br>summary judgment denials as nonappealable orders.&para;<br>Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 525–526 (1985). When&para;<br>summary judgment is denied to a defendant who urges&para;<br>that qualified immunity shelters her from suit, the court’s&para;<br>order “finally and conclusively [disposes of] the defen&para;<br>dant’s claim of right not to stand trial.” Id., at 527 (em&para;<br>phasis deleted). Therefore, Mitchell held, an immediate&para;<br>appeal may be pursued. Ibid.&para;<br>We clarified in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304 (1995),&para;<br>that immediate appeal from the denial of summary judg&para;<br>ment on a qualified immunity plea is available when the&para;<br>appeal presents a “purely legal issue,” illustratively, the&para;<br>determination of “what law was ‘clearly established’ ” at&para;<br>the time the defendant acted. Id., at 313. However, in&para;<br>stant appeal is not available, Johnson held, when the&para;<br>district court determines that factual issues genuinely in&para;<br>dispute preclude summary adjudication. Ibid.&para;<br>Jordan and Bright sought no immediate appeal from the&para;<br>denial of their motion for summary judgment. In light of&para;<br>Johnson, that abstinence is unsurprising. Moreover, even&para;<br>had instant appellate review been open to them, the time&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ORTIZ v.

Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A) (notice of appeal must&para;<br>generally be filed “within 30 days after the judgment or&para;<br>order appealed from”). Nor did they avail themselves of&para;<br>Rule 50(b), which permits the entry, postverdict, of judg&para;<br>ment for the verdict loser if the court finds that the evi&para;<br>dence was legally insufficient to sustain the verdict. See&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b). Absent such a motion, we&para;<br>have repeatedly held, an appellate court is “powerless” to&para;<br>review the sufficiency of the evidence after trial.&para;<br>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v.

S., at 218.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Jordan&para;<br>&para;<br>and Bright contend that their failure to file a Rule 50(b)&para;<br>motion cannot be the basis for overturning the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals. Because Ortiz presented no argument about the absence of a&para;<br>Rule 50(b) motion in her brief to the Sixth Circuit or in her petition for&para;<br>certiorari, Jordan and Bright argue, she has forfeited the objection.&para;<br>Jordan and Bright are not well positioned to make this argument.&para;<br>They did not suggest that Ortiz had forfeited her Rule 50(b) objection,&para;<br>or argue that such an objection is forfeitable, until their merits brief to&para;<br>this Court. Ordinarily we do not consider “a nonjurisdictional argu&para;<br>ment not raised in a respondent’s brief in opposition to a petition.”&para;<br>Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 34 (2004) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>In any case, we do not see how Ortiz can be held to have forfeited&para;<br>her Rule 50(b) objection. The arguments Jordan and Bright made in&para;<br>the Court of Appeals invited no such objection. Jordan and Bright&para;<br>urged on appeal that the jury’s verdict was “against the weight of the&para;<br>evidence.” Brief for Defendants-Appellants in No. 06-3627 (CA6), pp.&para;<br>21–43. A plea that a verdict is “against the weight of the evidence,” of&para;<br>course, is not equivalent to a plea that the evidence submitted at trial&para;<br>was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury. 11 C.&para;<br>Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure §2806,&para;<br>pp. 65–67 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2010).

Mont&para;<br>gomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Duncan, 311 U. S. 243, 250–251 (1940). Ortiz&para;<br>objected, accordingly, that Jordan and Bright had not asked the Dis&para;<br>trict Court for a new trial and were therefore “bar[red] [from] appeal on&para;<br>this ground.” Brief for Plaintiff-Appellee in No. 06–3627 (CA6), p. 23.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Jordan&para;<br>and Bright insist, however, in defense of the Sixth Cir&para;<br>cuit’s judgment, that sufficiency of the evidence is not&para;<br>what is at stake in this case. A qualified immunity plea&para;<br>raising an issue of a “purely legal nature,” they urge, ibid.,&para;<br>is preserved for appeal by an unsuccessful motion for&para;<br>summary judgment, and need not be brought up again&para;<br>under Rule 50(b). Id., at 11–12 (citing as pathmarking&para;<br>Rekhi v. Wildwood Indus., Inc., 61 F. 3d 1313, 1318 (CA7&para;<br>1995)). Unlike an “evidence sufficiency” claim that neces&para;<br>sarily “hinge[s] on the facts adduced at trial,” they main&para;<br>tain, a purely legal issue can be resolved “with reference&para;<br>only to undisputed facts.” Brief for Respondents 16 (quot&para;<br>ing Mitchell, 472 U. S., at 530, n. 10).&para;<br>We need not address this argument, for the officials’&para;<br>claims of qualified immunity hardly present “purely legal”&para;<br>issues capable of resolution “with reference only to undis&para;<br>puted facts.” Cases fitting that bill typically involve con&para;<br>tests not about what occurred, or why an action was taken&para;<br>or omitted, but disputes about the substance and clarity of&para;<br>pre-existing law. See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299,&para;<br>313 (1996); Johnson, 515 U. S, at 317.&para;<br>Here, however, the pre-existing law was not in contro&para;<br>versy. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 834, 847&para;<br>(1994) (prison official may be held liable for “deliberate&para;<br>indifference” to a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment right to&para;<br>protection against violence while in custody if the official&para;<br>“knows that [the] inmat[e] face[s] a substantial risk of&para;<br>serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>Ortiz thus responded altogether appropriately to the arguments Jordan&para;<br>&para;<br>and Bright made. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ORTIZ v.

What, if anything,&para;<br>could Jordan have done to distance Ortiz from the assail&para;<br>ant, thereby insulating her against a second assault? See&para;<br>id., at 4–5.8 Did Bright place and retain Ortiz in solitary&para;<br>confinement as a retaliatory measure or as a control&para;<br>needed to safeguard the integrity of the investigation? 9&para;<br>In sum, the qualified immunity defenses asserted by&para;<br>Jordan and Bright do not present “neat abstract issues of&para;<br>law.” See Johnson, 515 U. S., at 317 (quoting 15A C.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The Court of Appeals held that Ortiz’s complaint had not properly&para;<br>tied her claim against Bright to the First Amendment. 316 Fed.

Appx., at 457&para;<br>(Daughtrey, J., dissenting).&para;<br>9 Apart from Bright’s testimony, the defense produced no evidence&para;<br>that Ortiz “continually” talked about the assaults or in any other way&para;<br>interfered with the investigation.

The Court&para;<br>also reaches beyond that question, however, to address the&para;<br>effect of Jordan and Bright’s failure to renew their motion&para;<br>for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 50(b). I would limit our decision to the&para;<br>question presented and remand for consideration of any&para;<br>additional issues.&para;<br>As the Court concludes, a party ordinarily cannot appeal&para;<br>an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on&para;<br>the merits. See ante, at 7–8. Most such orders are not&para;<br>appealable at all, because they neither qualify as “final&para;<br>decisions” capable of appeal under 28 U. S.

Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. 394, 405 (2006)). The&para;<br>Court does so because it concludes that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals did not confine itself to the pretrial record and&para;<br>instead reviewed the trial evidence. Ante, at 3.&para;<br>I do not think it necessary to reach beyond the question&para;<br>presented. It is clear from the opinion that the appeals&para;<br>court reviewed the order denying summary judgment, and&para;<br>that was error. The Court of Appeals explained that&para;<br>“[a]lthough courts normally do not review the denial of a&para;<br>summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,”&para;<br>this case “is an exception to th[at] rule.” 316 Fed. Appx.&para;<br>449, 453 (CA6 2009). And to support that conclusion, the&para;<br>court cited Goff v. Bise, 173 F. 3d 1068 (1999), in which&para;<br>the Eighth Circuit reviewed an order denying summary&para;<br>judgment. Finally, the Court of Appeals equated its re&para;<br>view in this case to the review of an “interlocutory appea[l]&para;<br>of qualified immunity,” which suggests that the court saw&para;<br>itself as reviewing the interlocutory order denying sum&para;<br>mary judgment. 316 Fed. Appx., at 453. Whether, in&para;<br>erroneously reviewing the order denying summary judg&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, the Court of Appeals considered the pretrial or full&para;<br>trial record is beside the point.&para;<br>I also think it unwise to reach the Rule 50 issue and the&para;<br>questions that follow. Ortiz’s opening brief at the merits&para;<br>stage focused on the question presented—whether the&para;<br>Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review an order&para;<br>denying summary judgment. It was not until Jordan and&para;<br>Bright’s response brief in this Court, in which they argued&para;<br>that they had not actually appealed the order denying&para;<br>summary judgment, that the Rule 50 issues were ad&para;<br>dressed at any length. This Court normally proceeds&para;<br>more cautiously. Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not&para;<br>address these issues at all, and we are ordinarily “a court&para;<br>of final review and not first view.” Adarand Constructors,&para;<br>Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110 (2001) (per curiam)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). This seems a good&para;<br>rule to follow in a case like this, which raises difficult and&para;<br>far-reaching questions of civil procedure.&para;<br>For these reasons, I would resolve only the question on&para;<br>which we granted certiorari.
