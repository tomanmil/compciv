BAYER CORP.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1205. Argued January 18, 2011—Decided June 16, 2011&para;<br>Respondent (Bayer) moved in Federal District Court for an injunction&para;<br>ordering a West Virginia state court not to consider a motion for class&para;<br>certification filed by petitioners (Smith), who were plaintiffs in the&para;<br>state-court action. Bayer thought such an injunction warranted be&para;<br>cause, in a separate case, Bayer had persuaded the same Federal&para;<br>District Court to deny a similar class-certification motion that had&para;<br>been filed against Bayer by a different plaintiff, George McCollins.&para;<br>The District Court had denied McCollins’ certification motion under&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23.&para;<br>The court granted Bayer’s requested injunction against the state&para;<br>court proceedings, holding that its denial of certification in McCollins’&para;<br>case precluded litigation of the certification issue in Smith’s case.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. It first noted&para;<br>that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act) generally prohibits federal courts&para;<br>from enjoining state court proceedings. But it found that the Act’s re&para;<br>litigation exception authorized this injunction because ordinary rules&para;<br>of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his pro&para;<br>posed class. In so doing, the court concluded that Smith was invok&para;<br>ing a State Rule, W. Va. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, that was sufficiently&para;<br>similar to the Federal Rule McCollins had invoked, such that the cer&para;<br>tification issues presented in the two cases were the same. The court&para;<br>further held that Smith, as an unnamed member of McCollins’ puta&para;<br>tive class action, could be bound by the judgment in McCollins’ case.&para;<br>Held: In enjoining the state court from considering Smith’s class certifi&para;<br>cation request, the federal court exceeded its authority under the “re&para;<br>litigation exception” to the Act. Pp. 5–18.&para;<br>(a) Under that Act, a federal court “may not grant an injunction to&para;<br>stay proceedings in a State court except” in rare cases, when neces&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sary to “protect or effectuate [the federal court’s] judgments.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2283. The Act’s “specifically defined exceptions,” Atlantic&para;<br>Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, 286, “are&para;<br>narrow and are ‘not [to] be enlarged by loose statutory construction,’ ”&para;<br>Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U. S. 140, 146. Indeed, “[a]ny&para;<br>doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court&para;<br>proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts&para;<br>to proceed.” Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 398 U. S., at 297. The excep&para;<br>tion at issue in this case, known as the “relitigation exception,” au&para;<br>thorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue&para;<br>“that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.”&para;<br>Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147. This exception is designed to im&para;<br>plement “well-recognized concepts” of claim and issue preclusion.&para;<br>Ibid. Because deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclu&para;<br>sive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court—here, the West&para;<br>Virginia court—every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state&para;<br>court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction&para;<br>can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure. For the&para;<br>federal court’s class-action determination to preclude the state court’s&para;<br>adjudication of Smith’s motion, at least two conditions must be met.&para;<br>First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one&para;<br>presented in the state tribunal. And second, Smith must have been a&para;<br>party to the federal suit or must fall within one of a few discrete ex&para;<br>ceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) The issue the federal court decided was not the same as the one&para;<br>presented in the state tribunal. This case is little more than a rerun&para;<br>of Chick Kam Choo. There, a federal court dismissed a suit involving&para;<br>Singapore law on forum non conveniens grounds and then enjoined&para;<br>the plaintiff from pursuing the “same” claim in Texas state court.&para;<br>However, because the legal standards for forum non conveniens dif&para;<br>fered in the two courts, the issues before those courts differed, mak&para;<br>ing an injunction unwarranted. Here, Smith’s proposed class mir&para;<br>rored McCollins’, and the two suits’ substantive claims broadly&para;<br>overlapped. But the federal court adjudicated McCollins’ certification&para;<br>motion under Federal Rule 23, whereas the state court was poised to&para;<br>consider Smith’s proposed class under W. Va. Rule 23. And the State&para;<br>Supreme Court has generally stated that it will not necessarily inter&para;<br>pret its Rule 23 as coterminous with the Federal Rule. Absent clear&para;<br>evidence that the state courts had adopted an approach to State Rule&para;<br>23 tracking the federal court’s analysis in McCollins’ case, this Court&para;<br>could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule the same way&para;<br>and, thus, could not tell whether the certification issues in the two&para;<br>courts were the same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunc&para;<br>tion. And indeed, the case against an injunction here is even&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>stronger, because the State Supreme Court has expressly disap&para;<br>proved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement&para;<br>embraced by the Federal District Court. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(c) The District Court’s injunction was independently improper be&para;<br>cause Smith was not a party to the federal suit and was not covered&para;<br>by any exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion. Generally,&para;<br>a party “is ‘[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,’ ” United&para;<br>States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, or&para;<br>who “become[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party&para;<br>practice,” Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77. The definition of “party”&para;<br>cannot be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom&para;<br>McCollins was denied leave to represent. The only exception to the&para;<br>rule against nonparty preclusion potentially relevant here is the ex&para;<br>ception that binds non-named members of “properly conducted class&para;<br>actions” to judgments entered in such proceedings. Taylor v. Stur&para;<br>gell, 553 U. S. 880, 894. But McCollins’ suit was not a proper class&para;<br>action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues should have pre&para;<br>clusive effect is the District Court’s decision not to certify a class.&para;<br>Absent certification of a class under Federal Rule 23, the precondi&para;<br>tion for binding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed, nor a re&para;<br>jected, class action may bind nonparties. See id., at 901. Bayer&para;<br>claims that this Court’s approach to class actions would permit class&para;<br>counsel to try repeatedly to certify the same class simply by changing&para;<br>plaintiffs. But principles of stare decisis and comity among courts&para;<br>generally suffice to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of simi&para;<br>lar litigation brought by different plaintiffs. The right approach does&para;<br>not lie in binding nonparties to a judgment. And to the extent class&para;<br>actions raise special relitigation problems, the federal Class Action&para;<br>Fairness Act of 2005 provides a remedy that does not involve depart&para;<br>ing from the usual preclusion rules.

BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the District Court’s judgment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Because the question before us involves the effect of a&para;<br>former adjudication on this case, we begin our statement&para;<br>of the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another. In&para;<br>August 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer&para;<br>Corporation in the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West&para;<br>Virginia, asserting various state-law claims arising from&para;<br>Bayer’s sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug&para;<br>called Baycol (which Bayer withdrew from the market that&para;<br>same month). McCollins contended that Bayer had vio&para;<br>lated West Virginia’s consumer-protection statute and the&para;<br>company’s express and implied warranties by selling him&para;<br>a defective product. And pursuant to West Virginia Rule&para;<br>of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), McCollins asked the state&para;<br>court to certify a class of West Virginia residents who had&para;<br>also purchased Baycol, so that the case could proceed as a&para;<br>class action.&para;<br>Approximately one month later, the suit now before us&para;<br>began in a different part of West Virginia. Petitioners&para;<br>Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short) filed&para;<br>state-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in&para;<br>McCollins’ suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County,&para;<br>West Virginia. And like McCollins, Smith asked the court&para;<br>to certify under West Virginia’s Rule 23 a class of Baycol&para;<br>purchasers residing in the State. Neither Smith nor&para;<br>McCollins knew about the other’s suit.&para;<br>In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins’ case to the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Southern District of&para;<br>West Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §§1332, 1441. The case was then transferred to&para;<br>the District of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order&para;<br>of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which&para;<br>had consolidated all federal suits involving Baycol (num&para;<br>bering in the tens of thousands) before a single District&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court Judge. See §1407. Bayer, however, could not&para;<br>remove Smith’s case to federal court because Smith&para;<br>had sued several West Virginia defendants in addition to&para;<br>Bayer, and so the suit lacked complete diversity. See&para;<br>§1441(b).1 Smith’s suit thus remained in the state court&para;<br>house in Brooke County.&para;<br>Over the next six years, the two cases proceeded along&para;<br>their separate pretrial paths at roughly the same pace. By&para;<br>2008, both courts were preparing to turn to their respec&para;<br>tive plaintiffs’ motions for class certification. The Federal&para;<br>District Court was the first to reach a decision.&para;<br>Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23,2 the Dis&para;<br>trict Court declined to certify McCollins’ proposed class&para;<br>of West Virginia Baycol purchasers. The District Court’s&para;<br>reasoning proceeded in two steps. The court first ruled&para;<br>that, under West Virginia law, each plaintiff would have&para;<br>to prove “actual injury” from his use of Baycol to recover.&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The court then held that be&para;<br>cause the necessary showing of harm would vary from&para;<br>plaintiff to plaintiff, “individual issues of fact predomi&para;<br>nate[d]” over issues common to all members of the pro&para;<br>posed class, and so the case was not suitable for class&para;<br>treatment. Id., at 45a. In the same order, the District&para;<br>Court also dismissed McCollins’ claims on the merits in&para;<br>light of his failure to demonstrate physical injury from his&para;<br>use of Baycol. McCollins chose not to appeal.&para;<br>Although McCollins’ suit was now concluded, Bayer&para;<br>asked the District Court for another order based upon it,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 119 Stat. 4, which postdates&para;<br>and therefore does not govern this lawsuit, now enables a defendant to&para;<br>remove to federal court certain class actions involving nondiverse&para;<br>parties. See 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d), 1453(b); see also infra, at 17.&para;<br>2 Although McCollins had originally sought certification under West&para;<br>Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), federal procedural rules&para;<br>govern a case that has been removed to federal court. See Shady Grove&para;<br>Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>this one affecting Smith’s case in West Virginia. In a&para;<br>motion—receipt of which first apprised Smith of McCol&para;<br>lins’ suit—Bayer explained that the proposed class in&para;<br>Smith’s case was identical to the one the federal court had&para;<br>just rejected. Bayer therefore requested that the federal&para;<br>court enjoin the West Virginia state court from hearing&para;<br>Smith’s motion to certify a class. According to Bayer, that&para;<br>order was appropriate to protect the District Court’s&para;<br>judgment in McCollins’ suit denying class certification.&para;<br>The District Court agreed and granted the injunction.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>In re Baycol Prods. Litigation, 593 F. 3d 716 (2010). The&para;<br>court noted that the Anti-Injunction Act generally prohib&para;<br>its federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.&para;<br>But the court held that the Act’s relitigation exception&para;<br>authorized the injunction here because ordinary rules of&para;<br>issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of&para;<br>his proposed class. According to the court, Smith was&para;<br>invoking a similar class action rule as McCollins had used&para;<br>to seek certification “of the same class” in a suit alleging&para;<br>“the same legal theories,” id., at 724; the issue in the state&para;<br>court therefore was “sufficiently identical” to the one the&para;<br>federal court had decided to warrant preclusion, ibid. In&para;<br>addition, the court held, the parties in the two proceedings&para;<br>were sufficiently alike: Because Smith was an unnamed&para;<br>member of the class McCollins had proposed, and because&para;<br>their “interests were aligned,” Smith was appropriately&para;<br>bound by the federal court’s judgment. Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. __ (2010), because the&para;<br>order issued here implicates two circuit splits arising from&para;<br>application of the Anti-Injunction Act’s relitigation excep&para;<br>tion. The first involves the requirement of preclusion law&para;<br>that a subsequent suit raise the “same issue” as a previous&para;<br>case.3 The second concerns the scope of the rule that a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Compare&para;<br>&para;<br>In re Baycol Prods.

Exxon Corp., 486 U. S. 140,&para;<br>146 (1988). And the Act’s core message is one of respect&para;<br>for state courts.

Indeed, “[a]ny doubts as to the&para;<br>propriety of a federal injunction against state court pro&para;<br>ceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the&para;<br>state courts to proceed.” Id., at 297.&para;<br>This case involves the last of the Act’s three exceptions,&para;<br>known as the relitigation exception. That exception is de&para;<br>signed to implement “well-recognized concepts” of claim&para;<br>and issue preclusion. Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147.&para;<br>The provision authorizes an injunction to prevent state&para;<br>litigation of a claim or issue “that previously was pre&para;<br>sented to and decided by the federal court.” Ibid. But in&para;<br>applying this exception, we have taken special care to&para;<br>keep it “strict and narrow.” Id., at 148. After all, a court&para;<br>does not usually “get to dictate to other courts the preclu&para;<br>sion consequences of its own judgment.” 18 C. Wright,&para;<br>A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure&para;<br>§4405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).&para;<br>Deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive&para;<br>effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court (here, the&para;<br>one in West Virginia). So issuing an injunction under the&para;<br>relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.5 For&para;<br>that reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the&para;<br>state court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>peradventure.&para;<br>The question here is whether the federal court’s rejec&para;<br>tion of McCollins’ proposed class precluded a later adjudi&para;<br>cation in state court of Smith’s certification motion. For&para;<br>the federal court’s determination of the class issue to have&para;<br>this preclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.6&para;<br>First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same&para;<br>as the one presented in the state tribunal. See 18 Wright&para;<br>&amp; Miller §4417, at 412. And second, Smith must have&para;<br>been a party to the federal suit, or else must fall within&para;<br>one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against&para;<br>binding nonparties. See 18A id., §4449, at 330. In fact,&para;<br>as we will explain, the issues before the two courts were&para;<br>not the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the ex&para;<br>ceptional kind of nonparty who can be bound. So the&para;<br>courts below erred in finding the certification issue pre&para;<br>cluded, and erred all the more in thinking an injunction&para;<br>appropriate.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 We have held that federal common law governs the preclusive effect&para;<br>of a decision of a federal court sitting in diversity. See Semtek Int’l Inc.&para;<br>v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 508 (2001). Smith assumes&para;<br>that federal common law should here incorporate West Virginia’s&para;<br>preclusion law, see Brief for Petitioners 15–16, whereas Bayer favors&para;<br>looking only to federal rules of preclusion because of the federal inter&para;<br>ests at stake in this case, see Brief for Respondent 18. We do not think&para;<br>the question matters here. Neither party identifies any way in which&para;<br>federal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any relevant&para;<br>respect. Nor have we found any such divergence. Compare, e.g.,&para;<br>Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153–154 (1979) (describing&para;<br>elements of issue preclusion), with State v. Miller, 194 W. Va. 3, 9, 459&para;<br>S. E. 2d 114, 120 (1995) (same). We therefore need not decide whether,&para;<br>in general, federal common law ought to incorporate state law in&para;<br>situations such as this.&para;<br>7 Because we rest our decision on the Anti-Injunction Act and the&para;<br>principles of issue preclusion that inform it, we do not consider Smith’s&para;<br>argument, based on Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797&para;<br>(1985), that the District Court’s action violated the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In our most recent case on the relitigation exception,&para;<br>Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon, we applied the “same issue”&para;<br>requirement of preclusion law to invalidate a federal&para;<br>court’s injunction. 486 U. S., at 151. The federal court&para;<br>had dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on grounds&para;<br>of forum non conveniens. After the plaintiff brought the&para;<br>same claim in Texas state court, the federal court issued&para;<br>an injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in&para;<br>that alternate forum. We held that the District Court had&para;<br>gone too far. “[A]n essential prerequisite for applying the&para;<br>relitigation exception,” we explained, “is that the . . . is&para;<br>sues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation&para;<br>in state proceedings actually have been decided by the&para;<br>federal court.” Id., at 148. That prerequisite, we thought,&para;<br>was not satisfied because the issue to be adjudicated in&para;<br>state court was not the one the federal court had resolved.&para;<br>The federal court had considered the permissibility of the&para;<br>claim under federal forum non conveniens principles. But&para;<br>the Texas courts, we thought, “would apply a significantly&para;<br>different forum non conveniens analysis,” id., at 149; they&para;<br>had in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal&para;<br>doctrine. Our conclusion followed: “[W]hether the Texas&para;<br>state courts are an appropriate forum for [the plaintiff’s]&para;<br>Singapore law claims has not yet been litigated.” Ibid.&para;<br>Because the legal standards in the two courts differed, the&para;<br>issues before the courts differed, and an injunction was&para;<br>unwarranted.&para;<br>The question here closely resembles the one in Chick&para;<br>Kam Choo. The class Smith proposed in state court mir&para;<br>rored the class McCollins sought to certify in federal court:&para;<br>Both included all Baycol purchasers resident in West&para;<br>Virginia. Moreover, the substantive claims in the two&para;<br>suits broadly overlapped: Both complaints alleged that&para;<br>Bayer had sold a defective product in violation of the&para;<br>State’s consumer protection law and the company’s war&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ranties. So far, so good for preclusion. But not so fast:&para;<br>a critical question—the question of the applicable legal&para;<br>standard—remains. The District Court ruled that the&para;<br>proposed class did not meet the requirements of Federal&para;<br>Rule 23 (because individualized issues would predominate&para;<br>over common ones). But the state court was poised to&para;<br>consider whether the proposed class satisfied West Vir&para;<br>ginia Rule 23. If those two legal standards differ (as&para;<br>federal and state forum non conveniens law differed in&para;<br>Chick Kam Choo)—then the federal court resolved an&para;<br>issue not before the state court. In that event, much like&para;<br>in Chick Kam Choo, “whether the [West Virginia] state&para;<br>cour[t]” should certify the proposed class action “has not&para;<br>yet been litigated.” 486 U. S., at 149.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals and Smith offer us two competing&para;<br>ways of deciding whether the West Virginia and Federal&para;<br>Rules differ, but we think the right path lies somewhere in&para;<br>the middle. The Eighth Circuit relied almost exclusively&para;<br>on the near-identity of the two Rules’ texts. See 593 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 723. That was the right place to start, but not to end.&para;<br>Federal and state courts, after all, can and do apply iden&para;<br>tically worded procedural provisions in widely varying&para;<br>ways. If a State’s procedural provision tracks the lan&para;<br>guage of a Federal Rule, but a state court interprets that&para;<br>provision in a manner federal courts have not, then the&para;<br>state court is using a different standard and thus deciding&para;<br>a different issue. See 18 Wright &amp; Miller §4417, at 454&para;<br>(stating that preclusion is “inappropriate” when “different&para;<br>legal standards . . . masquerad[e] behind similar legal&para;<br>labels”). At the other extreme, Smith contends that the&para;<br>source of law is all that matters: a different sovereign&para;<br>must in each and every case “have the opportunity, if it&para;<br>chooses, to construe its procedural rule differently.” Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 22 (quoting ALI, Principles of the Law,&para;<br>Aggregate Litigation §2.11, Reporters’ Notes, cmt. b,&para;<br>p. 181 (2010)). But if state courts have made crystal clear&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that they follow the same approach as the federal court&para;<br>applied, we see no need to ignore that determination; in&para;<br>that event, the issues in the two cases would indeed be the&para;<br>same. So a federal court considering whether the relitiga&para;<br>tion exception applies should examine whether state law&para;<br>parallels its federal counterpart. But as suggested earlier,&para;<br>see supra, at 6, the federal court must resolve any uncer&para;<br>tainty on that score by leaving the question of preclusion&para;<br>to the state courts.&para;<br>Under this approach, the West Virginia Supreme Court&para;<br>has gone some way toward resolving the matter before us&para;<br>by declaring its independence from federal courts’ inter&para;<br>pretation of the Federal Rules—and particularly of Rule&para;<br>23. In In re W. Va. Rezulin Litigation, 214 W. Va. 52, 585&para;<br>S. E. 2d 52 (2003) (In re Rezulin), the West Virginia high&para;<br>court considered a plaintiff’s motion to certify a class—&para;<br>coincidentally enough, in a suit about an allegedly defec&para;<br>tive pharmaceutical product. The court made a point of&para;<br>complaining about the parties’ and lower court’s near&para;<br>exclusive reliance on federal cases about Federal Rule 23&para;<br>to decide the certification question. Such cases, the court&para;<br>cautioned, “ ‘may be persuasive, but [they are] not binding&para;<br>or controlling.’ ” Id., at 61, 585 S. E. 2d, at 61. And lest&para;<br>anyone mistake the import of this message, the court went&para;<br>on: The aim of “this rule is to avoid having our legal&para;<br>analysis of our Rules ‘amount to nothing more than Pav&para;<br>lovian responses to federal decisional law.’ ” Ibid. (italics&para;<br>omitted). Of course, the state courts might still have&para;<br>adopted an approach to their Rule 23 that tracked the&para;<br>analysis the federal court used in McCollins’ case. But&para;<br>absent clear evidence that the state courts had done so, we&para;<br>could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule in&para;<br>the same way. And if that is so, we could not tell whether&para;<br>the certification issues in the state and federal courts were&para;<br>the same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.&para;<br>But here the case against an injunction is even stronger,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>because the West Virginia Supreme Court has disap&para;<br>proved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance&para;<br>requirement that the Federal District Court embraced.&para;<br>Recall that the federal court held that the presence of&para;<br>a single individualized issue—injury from the use of&para;<br>Baycol—prevented class certification. See supra, at 3. The&para;<br>court did not identify the common issues in the case; nor&para;<br>did it balance these common issues against the need to&para;<br>prove individual injury to determine which predominated.&para;<br>The court instead applied a strict test barring class treat&para;<br>ment when proof of each plaintiff’s injury is necessary.8&para;<br>By contrast, the West Virginia Supreme Court in In&para;<br>re Rezulin adopted an all-things-considered, balancing&para;<br>inquiry in interpreting its Rule 23. Rejecting any “rigid&para;<br>test,” the state court opined that the predominance re&para;<br>quirement “contemplates a review of many factors.” 214&para;<br>W. Va., at 72, 585 S. E. 2d, at 72. Indeed, the court noted,&para;<br>a “ ‘single common issue’ ” in a case could outweigh “ ‘nu&para;<br>merous . . . individual questions.’ ” Ibid. That meant, the&para;<br>court further explained (quoting what it termed the “lead&para;<br>ing treatise” on the subject), that even objections to certifi&para;<br>cation “ ‘based on . . . causation, or reliance’ ”—which typi&para;<br>cally involve showings of individual injury—“ ‘will not bar&para;<br>predominance satisfaction.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 2 A. Conte &amp;&para;<br>H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions §4.26, p. 241 (4th&para;<br>ed. 2002)). So point for point, the analysis set out in In re&para;<br>Rezulin diverged from the District Court’s interpretation&para;<br>of Federal Rule 23. A state court using the In re Rezulin&para;<br>standard would decide a different question than the one&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The District Court’s approach to the predominance inquiry is consis&para;<br>tent with the approach employed by the Eighth Circuit. See In re St.&para;<br>Jude Medical, Inc., 522 F. 3d 836, 837–840 (2008) (holding that most&para;<br>commercial misrepresentation cases are “unsuitable for class treat&para;<br>ment” because individual issues of reliance necessarily predominate).&para;<br>We express no opinion as to the correctness of this approach.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the federal court had earlier resolved.9&para;<br>This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun of Chick&para;<br>Kam Choo. A federal court and a state court apply differ&para;<br>ent law. That means they decide distinct questions. The&para;<br>federal court’s resolution of one issue does not preclude the&para;<br>state court’s determination of another. It then goes with&para;<br>out saying that the federal court may not issue an injunc&para;<br>tion. The Anti-Injunction Act’s re-litigation exception does&para;<br>not extend nearly so far.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The injunction issued here runs into another basic&para;<br>premise of preclusion law: A court’s judgment binds only&para;<br>the parties to a suit, subject to a handful of discrete and&para;<br>limited exceptions. See, e.g., 18A Wright &amp; Miller §4449,&para;<br>at 330. The importance of this rule and the narrowness of&para;<br>its exceptions go hand in hand. We have repeatedly “em&para;<br>phasize[d] the fundamental nature of the general rule”&para;<br>that only parties can be bound by prior judgments; accord&para;<br>ingly, we have taken a “constrained approach to nonparty&para;<br>preclusion.” Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 898 (2008).&para;<br>Against this backdrop, Bayer defends the decision below&para;<br>by arguing that Smith—an unnamed member of a pro&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Bayer argues that In re Rezulin does not preclude an injunction in&para;<br>this case because the West Virginia court there decided that common&para;<br>issues predominated over individual issues of damages, not over indi&para;<br>vidual issues of liability (as exist here). See Brief for Respondent 25–&para;<br>26. We think Bayer is right about this distinction, but wrong about its&para;<br>consequence. Our point is not that In re Rezulin dictates the answer&para;<br>to the class certification question here; the two cases are indeed too&para;<br>dissimilar for that to be true. The point instead is that In re Rezulin&para;<br>articulated a general approach to the predominance requirement that&para;<br>differs markedly from the one the federal court used. Minor variations&para;<br>in the application of what is in essence the same legal standard do not&para;<br>defeat preclusion; but where, as here, the State’s courts “would apply a&para;<br>significantly different . . . analysis,” Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp.,&para;<br>486 U. S. 140, 149 (1988), the federal and state courts decide different&para;<br>issues.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

See Brief for Respondent 32–34.&para;<br>Alternatively, Bayer claims that the District Court’s&para;<br>judgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to&para;<br>the rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class&para;<br>actions. See id., at 34–39. We think neither contention&para;<br>has merit.&para;<br>Bayer’s first claim ill-comports with any proper under&para;<br>standing of what a “party” is. In general, “[a] ‘party’ to&para;<br>litigation is ‘[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is&para;<br>brought,’ ” United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New&para;<br>York, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4), or one who&para;<br>“become[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third&para;<br>party practice,” Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987).&para;<br>And we have further held that an unnamed member of a&para;<br>certified class may be “considered a ‘party’ for the [particu&para;<br>lar] purpos[e] of appealing” an adverse judgment. Devlin&para;<br>v. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1, 7 (2002). But as the dissent in&para;<br>Devlin noted, no one in that case was “willing to advance&para;<br>the novel and surely erroneous argument that a non&para;<br>named class member is a party to the class-action litiga&para;<br>tion before the class is certified.” Id., at 16, n. 1 (opinion of&para;<br>SCALIA, J.). Still less does that argument make sense once&para;<br>certification is denied. The definition of the term “party”&para;<br>can on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person&para;<br>like Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied&para;<br>leave to represent.10 If the judgment in the McCollins&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 In support of its claim that Smith counts as a party, Bayer cites two&para;<br>cases in which we held that a putative member of an uncertified class&para;<br>may wait until after the court rules on the certification motion to file an&para;<br>individual claim or move to intervene in the suit. See Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 32–33 (citing United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385&para;<br>(1977); American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974)). But&para;<br>these cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of judicial&para;<br>administration, demonstrate only that a person not a party to a class&para;<br>suit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling of a limitations&para;<br>period) related to that proceeding. See id., at 553; McDonald, 432&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>litigation can indeed bind Smith, it must do so under&para;<br>principles of nonparty preclusion.&para;<br>As Bayer notes, see Brief for Respondent 37, one such&para;<br>principle allows unnamed members of a class action to be&para;<br>bound, even though they are not parties to the suit. See&para;<br>Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U. S.&para;<br>867, 874 (1984) (“[U]nder elementary principles of prior&para;<br>adjudication a judgment in a properly entertained class&para;<br>action is binding on class members in any subsequent&para;<br>litigation”); see also Taylor, 553 U. S., at 894 (stating that&para;<br>nonparties can be bound in “properly conducted class&para;<br>actions”). But here Bayer faces a conundrum. If we know&para;<br>one thing about the McCollins suit, we know that it was&para;<br>not a class action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer&para;<br>argues ought to be given preclusive effect is the District&para;<br>Court’s decision that a class could not properly be certi&para;<br>fied. So Bayer wants to bind Smith as a member of a class&para;<br>action (because it is only as such that a nonparty in&para;<br>Smith’s situation can be bound) to a determination that&para;<br>there could not be a class action. And if the logic of that&para;<br>position is not immediately transparent, here is Bayer’s&para;<br>attempt to clarify: “[U]ntil the moment when class certi&para;<br>fication was denied, the McCollins case was a properly&para;<br>conducted class action.” Brief for Respondent 37. That is&para;<br>true, according to Bayer, because McCollins’ interests&para;<br>were aligned with the members of the class he proposed&para;<br>and he “act[ed] in a representative capacity when he&para;<br>sought class certification.” Id., at 36.&para;<br>But wishing does not make it so. McCollins sought class&para;<br>certification, but he failed to obtain that result. Because&para;<br>the District Court found that individual issues predomi&para;<br>——————&para;<br>U. S., at 394, n. 15. That result is consistent with a commonplace of&para;<br>preclusion law—that nonparties sometimes may benefit from, even&para;<br>though they cannot be bound by, former litigation. See Parklane Ho&para;<br>siery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 326–333 (1979); Blonder-Tongue&para;<br>Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313 (1971).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule&para;<br>23’s requirements for class proceedings. In these circum&para;<br>stances, we cannot say that a properly conducted class&para;<br>action existed at any time in the litigation. Federal Rule&para;<br>23 determines what is and is not a class action in federal&para;<br>court, where McCollins brought his suit. So in the absence&para;<br>of a certification under that Rule, the precondition for&para;<br>binding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed class&para;<br>action nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties.&para;<br>What does have this effect is a class action approved under&para;<br>Rule 23. But McCollins’ lawsuit was never that.&para;<br>We made essentially these same points in Taylor v.&para;<br>Sturgell just a few Terms ago. The question there con&para;<br>cerned the propriety of binding nonparties under a theory&para;<br>of “virtual representation” based on “identity of interests&para;<br>and some kind of relationship between parties and non&para;<br>parties.” 553 U. S., at 901. We rejected the theory&para;<br>unanimously, explaining that it “would ‘recogniz[e], in&para;<br>effect, a common-law kind of class action.’ ” Ibid. Such a&para;<br>device, we objected, would authorize preclusion “shorn of&para;<br>[Rule 23’s] procedural protections.” Ibid. Or as otherwise&para;<br>stated in the opinion: We could not allow “circumvent[ion]”&para;<br>of Rule 23’s protections through a “virtual representation&para;<br>doctrine that allowed courts to ‘create de facto class ac&para;<br>tions at will.’ ” Ibid. We could hardly have been more&para;<br>clear that a “properly conducted class action,” with bind&para;<br>ing effect on nonparties, can come about in federal courts&para;<br>in just one way—through the procedure set out in Rule 23.&para;<br>Bayer attempts to distinguish Taylor by noting that the&para;<br>party in the prior litigation there did not propose a class&para;<br>action. But we do not see why that difference matters.&para;<br>Yes, McCollins wished to represent a class, and made a&para;<br>motion to that effect. But it did not come to pass. To&para;<br>allow McCollins’ suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the very theory Taylor rejected.11&para;<br>Bayer’s strongest argument comes not from established&para;<br>principles of preclusion, but instead from policy concerns&para;<br>relating to use of the class action device. Bayer warns&para;<br>that under our approach class counsel can repeatedly try&para;<br>to certify the same class “by the simple expedient of&para;<br>changing the named plaintiff in the caption of the com&para;<br>plaint.” Brief for Respondent 47–48. And in this world of&para;<br>“serial relitigation of class certification,” Bayer contends,&para;<br>defendants “would be forced in effect to buy litigation&para;<br>peace by settling.” Id., at 2, 12; see also In re Bridge&para;<br>stone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prods. Liability Litigation,&para;<br>333 F. 3d 763, 767 (CA7 2003) (objecting to an “an asym&para;<br>metric system in which class counsel can win but never&para;<br>lose” because of their ability to relitigate the issue of&para;<br>certification).&para;<br>But this form of argument flies in the face of the rule&para;<br>against nonparty preclusion. That rule perforce leads to&para;<br>relitigation of many issues, as plaintiff after plaintiff after&para;<br>plaintiff (none precluded by the last judgment because&para;<br>none a party to the last suit) tries his hand at establishing&para;<br>some legal principle or obtaining some grant of relief. We&para;<br>confronted a similar policy concern in Taylor, which in&para;<br>volved litigation brought under the Freedom of Infor&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The great weight of scholarly authority—from the Restatement of&para;<br>Judgments to the American Law Institute to Wright and Miller—&para;<br>agrees that an uncertified class action cannot bind proposed class&para;<br>members.

But&para;<br>we rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a&para;<br>single successful FOIA suit—disclosure of documents to&para;<br>the public—could “trum[p]” or “subsum[e]” all prior losses,&para;<br>just as a single successful class certification motion could&para;<br>do. In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 333 F. 3d, at 766, 767. As&para;<br>that response suggests, our legal system generally relies&para;<br>on principles of stare decisis and comity among courts to&para;<br>mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litiga&para;<br>tion brought by different plaintiffs. We have not thought&para;<br>that the right approach (except in the discrete categories&para;<br>of cases we have recognized) lies in binding nonparties to a&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>And to the extent class actions raise special problems of&para;<br>relitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does not&para;<br>involve departing from the usual rules of preclusion. In&para;<br>the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled&para;<br>defendants to remove to federal court any sizable class&para;<br>action involving minimal diversity of citizenship. Once&para;<br>removal takes place, Federal Rule 23 governs certification.&para;<br>And federal courts may consolidate multiple overlapping&para;<br>suits against a single defendant in one court (as the Judi&para;<br>cial Panel on Multi-District Litigation did for the many&para;<br>actions involving Baycol). See §1407. Finally, we would&para;<br>expect federal courts to apply principles of comity to each&para;<br>other’s class certification decisions when addressing a&para;<br>common dispute. See, e.g., Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill&para;<br>Harbert Constr. Co., 529 U. S. 193, 198 (2000) (citing&para;<br>Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.

BAYER CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gress’s decision to address the relitigation concerns associ&para;<br>ated with class actions through the mechanism of removal&para;<br>provides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere&para;<br>in this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.12&para;<br>And once again, that is especially so when the federal&para;<br>court is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a state&para;<br>proceeding.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the order the District&para;<br>Court entered here.

But this case does not even strike us&para;<br>as close. The issues in the federal and state lawsuits&para;<br>differed because the relevant legal standards differed.&para;<br>And the mere proposal of a class in the federal action&para;<br>could not bind persons who were not parties there.
