JONES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1259. Argued November 8, 2011—Decided January 23, 2012&para;<br>The Government obtained a search warrant permitting it to install a&para;<br>Global-Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle registered to respondent Jones’s wife. The warrant authorized installation in the District of Columbia and within 10 days, but agents installed the device on the 11th day and in Maryland. The Government&para;<br>then tracked the vehicle’s movements for 28 days. It subsequently&para;<br>secured an indictment of Jones and others on drug trafficking conspiracy charges. The District Court suppressed the GPS data obtained while the vehicle was parked at Jones’s residence, but held the&para;<br>remaining data admissible because Jones had no reasonable expectation of privacy when the vehicle was on public streets. Jones was&para;<br>convicted. The D. C. Circuit reversed, concluding that admission of&para;<br>the evidence obtained by warrantless use of the GPS device violated&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment.&para;<br>Held: The Government’s attachment of the GPS device to the vehicle,&para;<br>and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s movements, constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the people to be&para;<br>secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Here, the Government’s physical intrusion on an “effect” for the purpose of obtaining information constitutes a “search.” This type of encroachment on an area enumerated&para;<br>in the Amendment would have been considered a search within the&para;<br>meaning of the Amendment at the time it was adopted. Pp. 3–4.&para;<br>(b) This conclusion is consistent with this Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, which until the latter half of the 20th century&para;<br>was tied to common-law trespass. Later cases, which have deviated&para;<br>from that exclusively property-based approach, have applied the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>analysis of Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Katz v. United States, 389&para;<br>U. S. 347, which said that the Fourth Amendment protects a person’s&para;<br>“reasonable expectation of privacy,” id., at 360. Here, the Court need&para;<br>not address the Government’s contention that Jones had no “reasonable expectation of privacy,” because Jones’s Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom, the&para;<br>Court must “assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against&para;<br>government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.”&para;<br>Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 34. Katz did not repudiate the&para;<br>understanding that the Fourth Amendment embodies a particular&para;<br>concern for government trespass upon the areas it enumerates. The&para;<br>Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, but&para;<br>not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. See Alderman&para;<br>v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 176; Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S.&para;<br>56, 64. United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, and United States v.&para;<br>Karo, 468 U. S. 705—post-Katz cases rejecting Fourth Amendment&para;<br>challenges to “beepers,” electronic tracking devices representing another form of electronic monitoring—do not foreclose the conclusion&para;<br>that a search occurred here. New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, and&para;<br>Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, also do not support the Government’s position. Pp. 4–12.&para;<br>(c) The Government’s alternative argument—that if the attachment and use of the device was a search, it was a reasonable one—is&para;<br>forfeited because it was not raised below.

Officers employed various&para;<br>investigative techniques, including visual surveillance of&para;<br>the nightclub, installation of a camera focused on the front&para;<br>door of the club, and a pen register and wiretap covering&para;<br>Jones’s cellular phone.&para;<br>Based in part on information gathered from these&para;<br>sources, in 2005 the Government applied to the United&para;<br>States District Court for the District of Columbia for a&para;<br>warrant authorizing the use of an electronic tracking&para;<br>device on the Jeep Grand Cherokee registered to Jones’s&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>wife. A warrant issued, authorizing installation of the device in the District of Columbia and within 10 days.&para;<br>On the 11th day, and not in the District of Columbia but&para;<br>in Maryland,1 agents installed a GPS tracking device on&para;<br>the undercarriage of the Jeep while it was parked in a&para;<br>public parking lot. Over the next 28 days, the Government used the device to track the vehicle’s movements,&para;<br>and once had to replace the device’s battery when the&para;<br>vehicle was parked in a different public lot in Maryland.&para;<br>By means of signals from multiple satellites, the device&para;<br>established the vehicle’s location within 50 to 100 feet, and&para;<br>communicated that location by cellular phone to a Government computer. It relayed more than 2,000 pages of&para;<br>data over the 4-week period.&para;<br>The Government ultimately obtained a multiple-count&para;<br>indictment charging Jones and several alleged coconspirators with, as relevant here, conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or&para;<br>more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in&para;<br>violation of 21 U. S. C. §§841 and 846. Before trial, Jones&para;<br>filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the&para;<br>GPS device.

(quoting United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 281&para;<br>(1983)).

S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, charging Jones and others with the same conspiracy. The Government introduced at trial the same GPSderived locational data admitted in the first trial, which&para;<br>connected Jones to the alleged conspirators’ stash house&para;<br>that contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of cocaine,&para;<br>and 1 kilogram of cocaine base. The jury returned a guilty&para;<br>verdict, and the District Court sentenced Jones to life&para;<br>imprisonment.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of&para;<br>Columbia Circuit reversed the conviction because of admission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of&para;<br>the GPS device which, it said, violated the Fourth Amendment. United States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544 (2010).&para;<br>The D. C. Circuit denied the Government’s petition for&para;<br>rehearing en banc, with four judges dissenting. 625 F. 3d&para;<br>766 (2010). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that&para;<br>“[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,&para;<br>houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches&para;<br>and seizures, shall not be violated.” It is beyond dispute&para;<br>that a vehicle is an “effect” as that term is used in the&para;<br>Amendment. United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 12&para;<br>(1977). We hold that the Government’s installation of a&para;<br>GPS device on a target’s vehicle,2 and its use of that device&para;<br>to monitor the vehicle’s movements, constitutes a “search.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 As&para;<br>&para;<br>we have noted, the Jeep was registered to Jones’s wife. The Government acknowledged, however, that Jones was “the exclusive driver.”&para;<br>Id., at 555, n. (internal quotation marks omitted). If Jones was not the&para;<br>owner he had at least the property rights of a bailee. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals concluded that the vehicle’s registration did not affect his&para;<br>ability to make a Fourth Amendment objection, ibid., and the Government has not challenged that determination here. We therefore do not&para;<br>consider the Fourth Amendment significance of Jones’s status.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>It is important to be clear about what occurred in this&para;<br>case: The Government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no&para;<br>doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been&para;<br>considered a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment when it was adopted. Entick v. Carrington,&para;<br>95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C. P. 1765), is a “case we have described&para;<br>as a ‘monument of English freedom’ ‘undoubtedly familiar’&para;<br>to ‘every American statesman’ at the time the Constitution&para;<br>was adopted, and considered to be ‘the true and ultimate&para;<br>expression of constitutional law’ ” with regard to search&para;<br>and seizure. Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 596&para;<br>(1989) (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626&para;<br>(1886)). In that case, Lord Camden expressed in plain&para;<br>terms the significance of property rights in search-andseizure analysis:&para;<br>“[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred,&para;<br>that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour’s close&para;<br>without his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though&para;<br>he does no damage at all; if he will tread upon his&para;<br>neighbour’s ground, he must justify it by law.” Entick,&para;<br>supra, at 817.&para;<br>The text of the Fourth Amendment reflects its close connection to property, since otherwise it would have referred&para;<br>simply to “the right of the people to be secure against&para;<br>unreasonable searches and seizures”; the phrase “in their&para;<br>persons, houses, papers, and effects” would have been&para;<br>superfluous.&para;<br>Consistent with this understanding, our Fourth&para;<br>Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass, at least until the latter half of the 20th century.&para;<br>Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001); Kerr, The&para;<br>Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional&para;<br>Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801,&para;<br>816 (2004). Thus, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>438 (1928), we held that wiretaps attached to telephone&para;<br>wires on the public streets did not constitute a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment search because “[t]here was no entry of the&para;<br>houses or offices of the defendants,” id., at 464.&para;<br>Our later cases, of course, have deviated from that&para;<br>exclusively property-based approach. In Katz v. United&para;<br>States, 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967), we said that “the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment protects people, not places,” and found a&para;<br>violation in attachment of an eavesdropping device to a&para;<br>public telephone booth. Our later cases have applied the&para;<br>analysis of Justice Harlan’s concurrence in that case,&para;<br>which said that a violation occurs when government officers violate a person’s “reasonable expectation of privacy,”&para;<br>id., at 360. See, e.g., Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334&para;<br>(2000); California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207 (1986); Smith&para;<br>v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979).&para;<br>The Government contends that the Harlan standard&para;<br>shows that no search occurred here, since Jones had no&para;<br>“reasonable expectation of privacy” in the area of the Jeep&para;<br>accessed by Government agents (its underbody) and in the&para;<br>locations of the Jeep on the public roads, which were&para;<br>visible to all. But we need not address the Government’s&para;<br>contentions, because Jones’s Fourth Amendment rights&para;<br>do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom,&para;<br>we must “assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy&para;<br>against government that existed when the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment was adopted.” Kyllo, supra, at 34. As explained, for most of our history the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>was understood to embody a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas (“persons, houses, papers, and effects”) it enumerates.3 Katz did not repudiate&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence (hereinafter concurrence) doubts the&para;<br>wisdom of our approach because “it is almost impossible to think of&para;<br>late-18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in&para;<br>this case.” Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). But in fact it&para;<br>posits a situation that is not far afield—a constable’s concealing himself&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that understanding. Less than two years later the Court&para;<br>upheld defendants’ contention that the Government could&para;<br>not introduce against them conversations between other&para;<br>people obtained by warrantless placement of electronic&para;<br>surveillance devices in their homes. The opinion rejected&para;<br>the dissent’s contention that there was no Fourth&para;<br>Amendment violation “unless the conversational privacy of&para;<br>the homeowner himself is invaded.”4 Alderman v. United&para;<br>States, 394 U. S. 165, 176 (1969). “[W]e [do not] believe&para;<br>that Katz, by holding that the Fourth Amendment protects&para;<br>persons and their private conversations, was intended&para;<br>to withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment&para;<br>extends to the home . . . .” Id., at 180.&para;<br>More recently, in Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56&para;<br>(1992), the Court unanimously rejected the argument that&para;<br>although a “seizure” had occurred “in a ‘technical’ sense”&para;<br>when a trailer home was forcibly removed, id., at 62, no&para;<br>Fourth Amendment violation occurred because law enforcement had not “invade[d] the [individuals’] privacy,”&para;<br>id., at 60. Katz, the Court explained, established that&para;<br>“property rights are not the sole measure of Fourth&para;<br>——————&para;<br>in the target’s coach in order to track its movements. Ibid. There is no&para;<br>doubt that the information gained by that trespassory activity would be&para;<br>the product of an unlawful search—whether that information consisted&para;<br>of the conversations occurring in the coach, or of the destinations to&para;<br>which the coach traveled.&para;<br>In any case, it is quite irrelevant whether there was an 18th-century&para;<br>analog. Whatever new methods of investigation may be devised, our&para;<br>task, at a minimum, is to decide whether the action in question would&para;<br>have constituted a “search” within the original meaning of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment. Where, as here, the Government obtains information by&para;<br>physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search&para;<br>has undoubtedly occurred.&para;<br>4 Thus, the concurrence’s attempt to recast Alderman as meaning that&para;<br>individuals have a “legitimate expectation of privacy in all conversations that [take] place under their roof,” post, at 6–7, is foreclosed by&para;<br>the Court’s opinion. The Court took as a given that the homeowner’s&para;<br>“conversational privacy” had not been violated.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Amendment violations,” but did not “snuf[f ] out the previously recognized protection for property.” 506 U. S., at 64.&para;<br>As Justice Brennan explained in his concurrence in&para;<br>Knotts, Katz did not erode the principle “that, when the&para;<br>Government does engage in physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information,&para;<br>that intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.” 460 U. S., at 286 (opinion concurring in&para;<br>judgment). We have embodied that preservation of past&para;<br>rights in our very definition of “reasonable expectation&para;<br>of privacy” which we have said to be an expectation “that&para;<br>has a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by&para;<br>reference to concepts of real or personal property law or&para;<br>to understandings that are recognized and permitted by&para;<br>society.” Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 88 (1998)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Katz did not narrow&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment’s scope.5&para;<br>The Government contends that several of our post-Katz&para;<br>cases foreclose the conclusion that what occurred here&para;<br>constituted a search. It relies principally on two cases in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>concurrence notes that post-Katz we have explained that “ ‘an&para;<br>actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.’ ” Post, at 6 (quoting United States v. Karo, 468 U. S.&para;<br>705, 713 (1984)). That is undoubtedly true, and undoubtedly irrelevant. Karo was considering whether a seizure occurred, and as the&para;<br>concurrence explains, a seizure of property occurs, not when there is a&para;<br>trespass, but “when there is some meaningful interference with an&para;<br>individual’s possessory interests in that property.” Post, at 2 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Likewise with a search. Trespass alone&para;<br>does not qualify, but there must be conjoined with that what was&para;<br>present here: an attempt to find something or to obtain information.&para;<br>Related to this, and similarly irrelevant, is the concurrence’s point&para;<br>that, if analyzed separately, neither the installation of the device nor&para;<br>its use would constitute a Fourth Amendment search. See ibid. Of&para;<br>course not. A trespass on “houses” or “effects,” or a Katz invasion of&para;<br>privacy, is not alone a search unless it is done to obtain information;&para;<br>and the obtaining of information is not alone a search unless it is&para;<br>achieved by such a trespass or invasion of privacy.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>which we rejected Fourth Amendment challenges to&para;<br>“beepers,” electronic tracking devices that represent another form of electronic monitoring. The first case, Knotts,&para;<br>upheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the use of a&para;<br>“beeper” that had been placed in a container of chloroform,&para;<br>allowing law enforcement to monitor the location of the&para;<br>container. 460 U. S., at 278. We said that there had been&para;<br>no infringement of Knotts’ reasonable expectation of privacy since the information obtained—the location of the&para;<br>automobile carrying the container on public roads, and&para;<br>the location of the off-loaded container in open fields near&para;<br>Knotts’ cabin—had been voluntarily conveyed to the public.6 Id., at 281–282. But as we have discussed, the Katz&para;<br>reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to,&para;<br>not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. The&para;<br>holding in Knotts addressed only the former, since the&para;<br>latter was not at issue. The beeper had been placed in&para;<br>the container before it came into Knotts’ possession, with&para;<br>the consent of the then-owner. 460 U. S., at 278. Knotts&para;<br>did not challenge that installation, and we specifically declined to consider its effect on the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>analysis. Id., at 279, n. Knotts would be relevant, perhaps, if the Government were making the argument that&para;<br>what would otherwise be an unconstitutional search is&para;<br>not such where it produces only public information. The&para;<br>Government does not make that argument, and we know&para;<br>of no case that would support it.&para;<br>The second “beeper” case, United States v. Karo, 468&para;<br>U. S. 705 (1984), does not suggest a different conclusion.&para;<br>There we addressed the question left open by Knotts,&para;<br>whether the installation of a beeper in a container&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Knotts noted the “limited use which the government made of the&para;<br>signals from this particular beeper,” 460 U. S., at 284; and reserved the&para;<br>question whether “different constitutional principles may be applicable”&para;<br>to “dragnet-type law enforcement practices” of the type that GPS&para;<br>tracking made possible here, ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>amounted to a search or seizure. 468 U. S., at 713. As in&para;<br>Knotts, at the time the beeper was installed the container&para;<br>belonged to a third party, and it did not come into possession of the defendant until later. 468 U. S., at 708. Thus,&para;<br>the specific question we considered was whether the installation “with the consent of the original owner constitute[d] a search or seizure . . . when the container is delivered to a buyer having no knowledge of the presence of the&para;<br>beeper.” Id., at 707 (emphasis added). We held not. The&para;<br>Government, we said, came into physical contact with&para;<br>the container only before it belonged to the defendant Karo;&para;<br>and the transfer of the container with the unmonitored&para;<br>beeper inside did not convey any information and thus did&para;<br>not invade Karo’s privacy. See id., at 712. That conclusion is perfectly consistent with the one we reach here.&para;<br>Karo accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and&para;<br>all, and was therefore not entitled to object to the beeper’s&para;<br>presence, even though it was used to monitor the container’s location. Cf. On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747,&para;<br>751–752 (1952) (no search or seizure where an informant,&para;<br>who was wearing a concealed microphone, was invited into&para;<br>the defendant’s business). Jones, who possessed the Jeep&para;<br>at the time the Government trespassorily inserted the&para;<br>information-gathering device, is on much different footing.&para;<br>The Government also points to our exposition in New&para;<br>York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106 (1986), that “[t]he exterior of&para;<br>a car . . . is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine&para;<br>it does not constitute a ‘search.’ ” Id., at 114. That statement is of marginal relevance here since, as the Government acknowledges, “the officers in this case did more&para;<br>than conduct a visual inspection of respondent’s vehicle,”&para;<br>Brief for United States 41 (emphasis added). By attaching&para;<br>the device to the Jeep, officers encroached on a protected&para;<br>area. In Class itself we suggested that this would make a&para;<br>difference, for we concluded that an officer’s momentary&para;<br>reaching into the interior of a vehicle did constitute a&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>search.7 475 U. S., at 114–115.&para;<br>Finally, the Government’s position gains little support&para;<br>from our conclusion in Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S.&para;<br>170 (1984), that officers’ information-gathering intrusion&para;<br>on an “open field” did not constitute a Fourth Amendment&para;<br>search even though it was a trespass at common law, id.,&para;<br>at 183. Quite simply, an open field, unlike the curtilage of&para;<br>a home, see United States v. Dunn, 480 U. S. 294, 300&para;<br>(1987), is not one of those protected areas enumerated in&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment. Oliver, supra, at 176–177. See&para;<br>also Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 59 (1924). The&para;<br>Government’s physical intrusion on such an area—unlike&para;<br>its intrusion on the “effect” at issue here—is of no Fourth&para;<br>Amendment significance.8&para;<br>B&para;<br>The concurrence begins by accusing us of applying&para;<br>“18th-century tort law.” Post, at 1.

Whether the plurality said so because no search occurred or because the search was reasonable is unclear. Compare id., at 591 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)&para;<br>(“[W]e fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed”),&para;<br>with id., at 592 (“Under circumstances such as these, where probable&para;<br>cause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not&para;<br>unreasonable . . . ”).&para;<br>8 Thus, our theory is not that the Fourth Amendment is concerned&para;<br>with “any technical trespass that led to the gathering of evidence.”&para;<br>Post, at 3 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis added). The&para;<br>Fourth Amendment protects against trespassory searches only with&para;<br>regard to those items (“persons, houses, papers, and effects”) that it&para;<br>enumerates.

This Court has&para;<br>to date not deviated from the understanding that mere&para;<br>visual observation does not constitute a search. See Kyllo,&para;<br>533 U. S., at 31–32.

JONES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on public streets” is okay, but that “the use of longer term&para;<br>GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses” is no&para;<br>good. Post, at 13 (emphasis added). That introduces yet&para;<br>another novelty into our jurisprudence. There is no precedent for the proposition that whether a search has occurred depends on the nature of the crime being investigated. And even accepting that novelty, it remains&para;<br>unexplained why a 4-week investigation is “surely” too&para;<br>long and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy involving substantial amounts of cash and narcotics is not an “extraordinary offens[e]” which may permit longer observation.&para;<br>See post, at 13–14. What of a 2-day monitoring of a&para;<br>suspected purveyor of stolen electronics? Or of a 6-month&para;<br>monitoring of a suspected terrorist? We may have to&para;<br>grapple with these “vexing problems” in some future case&para;<br>where a classic trespassory search is not involved and&para;<br>resort must be had to Katz analysis; but there is no reason&para;<br>for rushing forward to resolve them here.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Government argues in the alternative that even if&para;<br>the attachment and use of the device was a search, it was&para;<br>reasonable—and thus lawful—under the Fourth Amendment because “officers had reasonable suspicion, and indeed probable cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader&para;<br>in a large-scale cocaine distribution conspiracy.” Brief for&para;<br>United States 50–51.

As the majority’s opinion makes clear, however,&para;<br>Katz’s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test augmented,&para;<br>but did not displace or diminish, the common-law trespassory test that preceded it.

Thus, “when the&para;<br>Government does engage in physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information,&para;<br>that intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.” United States v.

See post, at 5–7 (opinion concurring in&para;<br>judgment).

In cases of electronic or other novel modes of surveillance that do not depend upon a physical invasion&para;<br>on property, the majority opinion’s trespassory test may&para;<br>provide little guidance.

Under that rubric, I agree with JUSTICE ALITO that,&para;<br>at the very least, “longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of&para;<br>privacy.” Post, at 13.&para;<br>In cases involving even short-term monitoring, some&para;<br>unique attributes of GPS surveillance relevant to the Katz&para;<br>analysis will require particular attention. GPS monitoring&para;<br>generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person’s&para;<br>public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about&para;<br>her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual&para;<br>associations. See, e.g., People v. Weaver, 12 N. Y. 3d 433,&para;<br>441–442, 909 N. E. 2d 1195, 1199 (2009) (“Disclosed in&para;<br>[GPS] data . . . will be trips the indisputably private nature of which takes little imagination to conjure: trips&para;<br>to the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic,&para;<br>the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal&para;<br>defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and&para;<br>on and on”). The Government can store such records&para;<br>and efficiently mine them for information years into the&para;<br>future. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d, at 1124 (opinion of&para;<br>Kozinski, C. J.). And because GPS monitoring is cheap&para;<br>in comparison to conventional surveillance techniques and,&para;<br>by design, proceeds surreptitiously, it evades the ordinary&para;<br>checks that constrain abusive law enforcement practices:&para;<br>“limited police resources and community hostility.” Illinois v.

And the Government’s unrestrained power to assemble data that reveal&para;<br>private aspects of identity is susceptible to abuse. The net&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>result is that GPS monitoring—by making available at a&para;<br>relatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate&para;<br>information about any person whom the Government, in&para;<br>its unfettered discretion, chooses to track—may “alter the&para;<br>relationship between citizen and government in a way&para;<br>that is inimical to democratic society.” United States v.&para;<br>Cuevas-Perez, 640 F. 3d 272, 285 (CA7 2011) (Flaum, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>I would take these attributes of GPS monitoring into&para;<br>account when considering the existence of a reasonable&para;<br>societal expectation of privacy in the sum of one’s public&para;<br>movements. I would ask whether people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain,&para;<br>more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs,&para;<br>sexual habits, and so on. I do not regard as dispositive&para;<br>the fact that the Government might obtain the fruits of&para;<br>GPS monitoring through lawful conventional surveillance&para;<br>techniques. See Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 35, n. 2; ante, at 11&para;<br>(leaving open the possibility that duplicating traditional&para;<br>surveillance “through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of&para;<br>privacy”). I would also consider the appropriateness of&para;<br>entrusting to the Executive, in the absence of any oversight from a coordinate branch, a tool so amenable to&para;<br>misuse, especially in light of the Fourth Amendment’s goal&para;<br>to curb arbitrary exercises of police power to and prevent&para;<br>“a too permeating police surveillance,” United States v.&para;<br>Di Re, 332 U.

(Is it possible to imagine a case in&para;<br>which a constable secreted himself somewhere in a coach&para;<br>and remained there for a period of time in order to monitor&para;<br>the movements of the coach’s owner?3) The Court’s theory&para;<br>seems to be that the concept of a search, as originally understood, comprehended any technical trespass that led&para;<br>to the gathering of evidence, but we know that this is incorrect. At common law, any unauthorized intrusion on&para;<br>private property was actionable, see Prosser &amp; Keeton 75,&para;<br>but a trespass on open fields, as opposed to the “curtilage”&para;<br>of a home, does not fall within the scope of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment because private property outside the curtilage&para;<br>is not part of a “hous[e]” within the meaning of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.

In the early electronic surveillance cases, the&para;<br>Court concluded that a Fourth Amendment search occurred when private conversations were monitored as a&para;<br>result of an “unauthorized physical penetration into the&para;<br>premises occupied” by the defendant. Silverman v. United&para;<br>States, 365 U. S. 505, 509 (1961). In Silverman, police&para;<br>officers listened to conversations in an attached home by&para;<br>inserting a “spike mike” through the wall that this house&para;<br>shared with the vacant house next door. Id., at 506. This&para;<br>procedure was held to be a search because the mike made&para;<br>contact with a heating duct on the other side of the wall&para;<br>and thus “usurp[ed] . . . an integral part of the premises.”&para;<br>Id., at 511.&para;<br>By contrast, in cases in which there was no trespass, it&para;<br>was held that there was no search. Thus, in Olmstead v.&para;<br>United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), the Court found that&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment did not apply because “[t]he taps&para;<br>from house lines were made in the streets near the&para;<br>houses.” Id., at 457. Similarly, the Court concluded that no&para;<br>search occurred in Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S.&para;<br>129, 135 (1942), where a “detectaphone” was placed on the&para;<br>outer wall of defendant’s office for the purpose of overhearing conversations held within the room.&para;<br>This trespass-based rule was repeatedly criticized. In&para;<br>Olmstead, Justice Brandeis wrote that it was “immaterial&para;<br>where the physical connection with the telephone wires&para;<br>was made.” 277 U. S., at 479 (dissenting opinion).

United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), finally did&para;<br>away with the old approach, holding that a trespass was&para;<br>not required for a Fourth Amendment violation. Katz involved the use of a listening device that was attached to&para;<br>the outside of a public telephone booth and that allowed&para;<br>police officers to eavesdrop on one end of the target’s&para;<br>phone conversation. This procedure did not physically&para;<br>intrude on the area occupied by the target, but the Katz&para;<br>Court “repudiate[ed]” the old doctrine, Rakas v. Illinois,&para;<br>439 U. S. 128, 143 (1978), and held that “[t]he fact that the&para;<br>electronic device employed . . . did not happen to penetrate&para;<br>the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance,” 389 U.

In Oliver, the Court&para;<br>wrote:&para;<br>“The existence of a property right is but one element&para;<br>in determining whether expectations of privacy are&para;<br>legitimate. ‘The premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize&para;<br>has been discredited.’ Katz, 389 U.

See Rakas, 439 U. S., at 144, n. 12 (citing Alderman&para;<br>for the proposition that “the Court has not altogether&para;<br>abandoned use of property concepts in determining the&para;<br>presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by&para;<br>that Amendment”); 439 U. S., at 153 (Powell, J., concurring) (citing Alderman for the proposition that “property&para;<br>rights reflect society’s explicit recognition of a person’s authority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and therefore should be considered in determining whether an&para;<br>individual’s expectations of privacy are reasonable); Karo,&para;<br>supra, at 732 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Alderman in support of the proposition&para;<br>that “a homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy&para;<br>in the contents of his home, including items owned by&para;<br>others”).&para;<br>In sum, the majority is hard pressed to find support in&para;<br>post-Katz cases for its trespass-based theory.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Disharmony with a substantial body of existing case law&para;<br>is only one of the problems with the Court’s approach in&para;<br>this case.&para;<br>I will briefly note four others. First, the Court’s reasoning largely disregards what is really important (the use of&para;<br>a GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking) and instead&para;<br>attaches great significance to something that most would&para;<br>view as relatively minor (attaching to the bottom of a car a&para;<br>small, light object that does not interfere in any way with&para;<br>the car’s operation). Attaching such an object is generally&para;<br>regarded as so trivial that it does not provide a basis for&para;<br>recovery under modern tort law. See Prosser &amp; Keeton&para;<br>§14, at 87 (harmless or trivial contact with personal property not actionable); D. Dobbs, Law of Torts 124 (2000)&para;<br>(same). But under the Court’s reasoning, this conduct&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>may violate the Fourth Amendment. By contrast, if longterm monitoring can be accomplished without committing&para;<br>a technical trespass—suppose, for example, that the Federal Government required or persuaded auto manufacturers to include a GPS tracking device in every car—the&para;<br>Court’s theory would provide no protection.&para;<br>Second, the Court’s approach leads to incongruous&para;<br>results. If the police attach a GPS device to a car and use&para;<br>the device to follow the car for even a brief time, under the&para;<br>Court’s theory, the Fourth Amendment applies. But if the&para;<br>police follow the same car for a much longer period using&para;<br>unmarked cars and aerial assistance, this tracking is not&para;<br>subject to any Fourth Amendment constraints.&para;<br>In the present case, the Fourth Amendment applies, the&para;<br>Court concludes, because the officers installed the GPS&para;<br>device after respondent’s wife, to whom the car was registered, turned it over to respondent for his exclusive use.&para;<br>See ante, at 8. But if the GPS had been attached prior to&para;<br>that time, the Court’s theory would lead to a different&para;<br>result. The Court proceeds on the assumption that respondent “had at least the property rights of a bailee,”&para;<br>ante, at 3, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a trespass to&para;<br>chattel only if the injury occurs during the term of the&para;<br>bailment. See 8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment §166, pp. 685–&para;<br>686 (2009). So if the GPS device had been installed before&para;<br>respondent’s wife gave him the keys, respondent would&para;<br>have no claim for trespass—and, presumably, no Fourth&para;<br>Amendment claim either.&para;<br>Third, under the Court’s theory, the coverage of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment may vary from State to State. If the&para;<br>events at issue here had occurred in a community property&para;<br>State4 or a State that has adopted the Uniform Marital&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Cal. Family Code Ann. §760 (West 2004).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Property Act,5 respondent would likely be an owner of&para;<br>the vehicle, and it would not matter whether the GPS was&para;<br>installed before or after his wife turned over the keys. In&para;<br>non-community-property States, on the other hand, the&para;<br>registration of the vehicle in the name of respondent’s wife&para;<br>would generally be regarded as presumptive evidence that&para;<br>she was the sole owner. See 60 C. J. S., Motor Vehicles&para;<br>§231, pp. 398–399 (2002); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles&para;<br>§1208, pp. 859–860 (2007).&para;<br>Fourth, the Court’s reliance on the law of trespass will&para;<br>present particularly vexing problems in cases involving&para;<br>surveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as&para;<br>opposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked.&para;<br>For example, suppose that the officers in the present case&para;<br>had followed respondent by surreptitiously activating a&para;<br>stolen vehicle detection system that came with the car&para;<br>when it was purchased. Would the sending of a radio&para;<br>signal to activate this system constitute a trespass to&para;<br>chattels? Trespass to chattels has traditionally required a&para;<br>physical touching of the property. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §217 and Comment e (1963 and 1964);&para;<br>Dobbs, supra, at 123. In recent years, courts have wrestled with the application of this old tort in cases involving&para;<br>unwanted electronic contact with computer systems, and&para;<br>some have held that even the transmission of electrons&para;<br>that occurs when a communication is sent from one computer to another is enough. See, e.g., CompuServe, Inc. v.&para;<br>Cyber Promotions, Inc. 962 F. Supp. 1015, 1021 (SD Ohio&para;<br>1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559,&para;<br>1566, n. 6 (1996). But may such decisions be followed in&para;<br>applying the Court’s trespass theory? Assuming that&para;<br>what matters under the Court’s theory is the law of trespass as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Fourth&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 See&para;<br>&para;<br>Uniform Marital Property Act §4, 9A U. L. A. 116 (1998).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JONES&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Amendment, do these recent decisions represent a change&para;<br>in the law or simply the application of the old tort to new&para;<br>situations?&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Katz expectation-of-privacy test avoids the problems&para;<br>and complications noted above, but it is not without its&para;<br>own difficulties. It involves a degree of circularity, see&para;<br>Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 34, and judges are apt to confuse their&para;<br>own expectations of privacy with those of the hypothetical&para;<br>reasonable person to which the Katz test looks. See&para;<br>Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 97 (1998) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>concurring). In addition, the Katz test rests on the assumption that this hypothetical reasonable person has a&para;<br>well-developed and stable set of privacy expectations. But&para;<br>technology can change those expectations.&para;<br>Dramatic&para;<br>technological change may lead to periods in which popular&para;<br>expectations are in flux and may ultimately produce significant changes in popular attitudes. New technology&para;<br>may provide increased convenience or security at the&para;<br>expense of privacy, and many people may find the tradeoff&para;<br>worthwhile. And even if the public does not welcome&para;<br>the diminution of privacy that new technology entails,&para;<br>they may eventually reconcile themselves to this development as inevitable.6&para;<br>On the other hand, concern about new intrusions on&para;<br>privacy may spur the enactment of legislation to protect&para;<br>against these intrusions. This is what ultimately happened with respect to wiretapping.

S., at 465–466, has been borne out.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Recent years have seen the emergence of many new&para;<br>devices that permit the monitoring of a person’s movements. In some locales, closed-circuit television video&para;<br>monitoring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll roads, automatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the&para;<br>movements of motorists who choose to make use of&para;<br>that convenience. Many motorists purchase cars that are&para;<br>equipped with devices that permit a central station to&para;<br>ascertain the car’s location at any time so that roadside&para;<br>assistance may be provided if needed and the car may be&para;<br>found if it is stolen.&para;<br>Perhaps most significant, cell phones and other wireless&para;<br>devices now permit wireless carriers to track and record&para;<br>the location of users—and as of June 2011, it has been&para;<br>reported, there were more than 322 million wireless devices in use in the United States.8 For older phones, the&para;<br>accuracy of the location information depends on the density of the tower network, but new “smart phones,” which&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 See Kerr, The Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich.

For example, when a user activates the GPS on&para;<br>such a phone, a provider is able to monitor the phone’s&para;<br>location and speed of movement and can then report back&para;<br>real-time traffic conditions after combining (“crowdsourcing”) the speed of all such phones on any particular road.9&para;<br>Similarly, phone-location-tracking services are offered as&para;<br>“social” tools, allowing consumers to find (or to avoid)&para;<br>others who enroll in these services.

Traditional surveillance for any extended period&para;<br>of time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely undertaken. The surveillance at issue in this case—constant&para;<br>monitoring of the location of a vehicle for four weeks—&para;<br>would have required a large team of agents, multiple&para;<br>vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance.10 Only an investigation of unusual importance could have justified such an&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See, e.g., The bright side of sitting in traffic: Crowdsourcing road&para;<br>congestion data, Google Blog, http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/&para;<br>bright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html.&para;<br>10 Even with a radio transmitter like those used in United States v.&para;<br>Knotts, 460 U.

Devices like&para;<br>the one used in the present case, however, make long-term&para;<br>monitoring relatively easy and cheap. In circumstances&para;<br>involving dramatic technological change, the best solution&para;<br>to privacy concerns may be legislative. See, e.g., Kerr, 102&para;<br>Mich. L. Rev., at 805–806. A legislative body is well situated to gauge changing public attitudes, to draw detailed&para;<br>lines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a comprehensive way.&para;<br>To date, however, Congress and most States have not&para;<br>enacted statutes regulating the use of GPS tracking technology for law enforcement purposes. The best that we&para;<br>can do in this case is to apply existing Fourth Amendment&para;<br>doctrine and to ask whether the use of GPS tracking in a&para;<br>particular case involved a degree of intrusion that a reasonable person would not have anticipated.&para;<br>Under this approach, relatively short-term monitoring&para;<br>of a person’s movements on public streets accords with&para;<br>expectations of privacy that our society has recognized&para;<br>as reasonable. See Knotts, 460 U. S., at 281–282. But&para;<br>the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of&para;<br>most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For&para;<br>such offenses, society’s expectation has been that law&para;<br>enforcement agents and others would not—and indeed, in&para;<br>the main, simply could not—secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual’s car for&para;<br>a very long period. In this case, for four weeks, law enforcement agents tracked every movement that respondent made in the vehicle he was driving. We need not&para;<br>identify with precision the point at which the tracking of&para;<br>this vehicle became a search, for the line was surely&para;<br>crossed before the 4-week mark. Other cases may present&para;<br>more difficult questions.

In such cases, long-term&para;<br>tracking might have been mounted using previously available techniques.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For these reasons, I conclude that the lengthy monitoring that occurred in this case constituted a search under&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment. I therefore agree with the majority that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 In this case, the agents obtained a warrant, but they did not comply&para;<br>with two of the warrant’s restrictions: They did not install the GPS&para;<br>device within the 10-day period required by the terms of the warrant&para;<br>and by Fed.
