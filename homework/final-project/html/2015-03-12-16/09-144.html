VAN HOOK&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–144.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided November 9, 2009 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted&para;<br>habeas relief to Robert Van Hook on the ground that he&para;<br>did not receive effective assistance of counsel during the&para;<br>sentencing phase of his capital trial. Because we think it&para;<br>clear that Van Hook’s attorneys met the constitutional&para;<br>minimum of competence under the correct standard, we&para;<br>grant the petition and reverse.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On February 18, 1985, Van Hook went to a Cincinnati&para;<br>bar that catered to homosexual men, hoping to find some&para;<br>one to rob. He approached David Self, and after the two&para;<br>spent several hours drinking together they left for Self’s&para;<br>apartment. There Van Hook “lured Self into a vulnerable&para;<br>position” and attacked him, first strangling him until he&para;<br>was unconscious, then killing him with a kitchen knife&para;<br>and mutilating his body. State v. Van Hook, 39 Ohio St.&para;<br>3d 256, 256–257, 530 N. E. 2d 883, 884 (1988). Before&para;<br>fleeing with Self’s valuables, Van Hook attempted to cover&para;<br>his tracks, stuffing the knife and other items into the body&para;<br>and smearing fingerprints he had left behind. Six weeks&para;<br>later, police found him in Florida, where he confessed.&para;<br>Van Hook was indicted in Ohio for aggravated murder,&para;<br>with one capital specification, and aggravated robbery. He&para;<br>waived his right to a jury trial, and a three-judge panel&para;<br>found him guilty of both charges and the capital specifica&para;<br>tion. At the sentencing hearing, the defense called eight&para;<br>mitigation witnesses, and Van Hook himself gave an&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. VAN HOOK&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>unsworn statement. After weighing the aggravating and&para;<br>mitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the&para;<br>death penalty. The Ohio courts affirmed on direct appeal,&para;<br>id., at 265, 530 N. E. 2d, at 892; State v. Van Hook, No.&para;<br>C–85–0565, 1987 WL 11202 (Ohio App., May 13, 1987)&para;<br>(per curiam), and we denied certiorari, Van Hook v. Ohio,&para;<br>489 U. S. 1100 (1989). Van Hook also sought state post&para;<br>conviction relief, which the Ohio courts denied. State v.&para;<br>Van Hook, No. C–910505, 1992 WL 308350 (Ohio App.,&para;<br>Oct. 21, 1992) (per curiam), appeal denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d&para;<br>1440, 608 N. E. 2d 1085, rehearing denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d&para;<br>1470, 611 N. E. 2d 328 (1993); State v. Van Hook, 70 Ohio&para;<br>St. 3d 1216, 639 N. E. 2d 1199 (1994).&para;<br>Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in 1995. The&para;<br>District Court denied relief on all 17 of his claims. Van&para;<br>Hook v. Anderson, No. C–1–94–269 (SD Ohio, Aug. 7,&para;<br>2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a. A panel of the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hook’s confes&para;<br>sion was unconstitutionally obtained under Edwards v.&para;<br>Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981). See Van Hook v. Anderson,&para;<br>444 F. 3d 830, 832 (2006). The en banc Sixth Circuit&para;<br>vacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper,&para;<br>and it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van&para;<br>Hook’s other claims. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 488 F. 3d&para;<br>411, 428 (2007). Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certio&para;<br>rari, which we denied. Van Hook v. Hudson, 552 U. S.&para;<br>1023 (2007).&para;<br>On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief&para;<br>again, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys&para;<br>were ineffective during the penalty phase because they did&para;<br>not adequately investigate and present mitigating evi&para;<br>dence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health&para;<br>expert, and requested and relied on a presentence investi&para;<br>gation report without objecting to damaging evidence it&para;<br>contained. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 535 F. 3d 458, 461&para;<br>(2008). The en banc Sixth Circuit again vacated the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>panel’s opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second&para;<br>time it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion. See&para;<br>Van Hook v. Anderson, 560 F. 3d 523, 524 (2009). In its&para;<br>third opinion, the panel—relying on guidelines published&para;<br>by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 2003—granted&para;<br>relief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers&para;<br>performed deficiently in investigating and presenting&para;<br>mitigating evidence. See id., at 525. The State petitioned&para;<br>for a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Because Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition&para;<br>before April 24, 1996, the provisions of the Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 do not apply. See&para;<br>Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 327 (1997). Even without&para;<br>the Act’s added layer of deference to state-court judg&para;<br>ments, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that&para;<br>Van Hook is entitled to relief.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to&para;<br>the “ ‘effective assistance of counsel’ ”—that is, representa&para;<br>tion that does not fall “below an objective standard of&para;<br>reasonableness” in light of “prevailing professional&para;<br>norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686&para;<br>(1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759,&para;<br>771, n. 14 (1970)). That standard is necessarily a general&para;<br>one. “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s&para;<br>conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of&para;<br>circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of&para;<br>legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a&para;<br>criminal defendant.” 466 U. S., at 688–689. Restatements&para;<br>of professional standards, we have recognized, can be&para;<br>useful as “guides” to what reasonableness entails, but only&para;<br>to the extent they describe the professional norms prevail&para;<br>ing when the representation took place. Id., at 688.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. VAN HOOK&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>on ABA guidelines announced 18 years after Van Hook&para;<br>went to trial. See 560 F. 3d, at 526–528 (quoting ABA&para;<br>Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of De&para;<br>fense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment., pp.&para;<br>81–83 (rev. ed. 2003)). The ABA standards in effect in&para;<br>1985 described defense counsel’s duty to investigate both&para;<br>the merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms:&para;<br>“It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investiga&para;<br>tion of the circumstances of the case and to explore all&para;<br>avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case&para;<br>and the penalty in the event of conviction.” 1 ABA Stan&para;<br>dards for Criminal Justice 4–4.1, p. 4–53 (2d ed. 1980).&para;<br>The accompanying two-page commentary noted that de&para;<br>fense counsel have “a substantial and important role to&para;<br>perform in raising mitigating factors,” and that&para;<br>“[i]nformation concerning the defendant’s background,&para;<br>education, employment record, mental and emotional&para;<br>stability, family relationships, and the like, will be rele&para;<br>vant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the&para;<br>commission of the offense itself.” Id., at 4–55.&para;<br>Quite different are the ABA’s 131-page “Guidelines” for&para;<br>capital defense counsel, published in 2003, on which the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit relied. Those directives expanded what had&para;<br>been (in the 1980 Standards) a broad outline of defense&para;<br>counsel’s duties in all criminal cases into detailed pre&para;<br>scriptions for legal representation of capital defendants.&para;<br>They discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence&para;<br>in exhaustive detail, specifying what attorneys should look&para;<br>for, where to look, and when to begin. See ABA Guidelines&para;<br>10.7, comment., at 80–85. They include, for example, the&para;<br>requirement that counsel’s investigation cover every pe&para;<br>riod of the defendant’s life from “the moment of concep&para;<br>tion,” id., at 81, and that counsel contact “virtually every&para;<br>one . . . who knew [the defendant] and his family” and&para;<br>obtain records “concerning not only the client, but also his&para;<br>parents, grandparents, siblings, and children,” id., at 83.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Judging counsel’s conduct in the 1980’s on the basis of&para;<br>these 2003 Guidelines—without even pausing to consider&para;<br>whether they reflected the prevailing professional practice&para;<br>at the time of the trial—was error.&para;<br>To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following&para;<br>Circuit precedent) treated the ABA’s 2003 Guidelines not&para;<br>merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys&para;<br>would do, but as inexorable commands with which all&para;<br>capital defense counsel “ ‘must fully comply.’ ” 560 F. 3d, at&para;<br>526 (quoting Dickerson v. Bagley, 453 F. 3d 690, 693 (CA6&para;<br>2006)). Strickland stressed, however, that “American Bar&para;<br>Association standards and the like” are “only guides” to&para;<br>what reasonableness means, not its definition. 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 688. We have since regarded them as such.1 See Wig&para;<br>gins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003). What we have&para;<br>said of state requirements is a fortiori true of standards&para;<br>set by private organizations: “[W]hile States are free to&para;<br>impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that&para;<br>criminal defendants are well represented, we have held&para;<br>that the Federal Constitution imposes one general re&para;<br>quirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable&para;<br>choices.” Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479 (2000).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Van Hook insists that the Sixth Circuit’s missteps made&para;<br>no difference because his counsel were ineffective even&para;<br>under professional standards prevailing at the time. He is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The narrow grounds for our opinion should not be regarded as ac&para;<br>cepting the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the Guidelines to&para;<br>evaluate post-2003 representation. For that to be proper, the Guide&para;<br>lines must reflect “[p]revailing norms of practice,” Strickland, 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 688, and “standard practice,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524&para;<br>(2003), and must not be so detailed that they would “interfere with the&para;<br>constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide&para;<br>latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions,” Strickland,&para;<br>supra, at 689. We express no views on whether the 2003 Guidelines&para;<br>meet these criteria.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. VAN HOOK&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>wrong.&para;<br>Like the Court of Appeals, Van Hook first contends that&para;<br>his attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late,&para;<br>waiting until he was found guilty—only days before the&para;<br>sentencing hearing—to dig into his background. See 560&para;<br>F. 3d, at 528. But the record shows they started much&para;<br>sooner. Between Van Hook’s indictment and his trial less&para;<br>than three months later, they contacted their lay wit&para;<br>nesses early and often: They spoke nine times with his&para;<br>mother (beginning within a week after the indictment),&para;<br>once with both parents together, twice with an aunt who&para;<br>lived with the family and often cared for Van Hook as a&para;<br>child, and three times with a family friend whom Van&para;<br>Hook visited immediately after the crime. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 380a–383a, 384a–387a. As for their expert wit&para;<br>nesses, they were in touch with one more than a month&para;<br>before trial, and they met with the other for two hours a&para;<br>week before the trial court reached its verdict. Id., at&para;<br>382a, 386a. Moreover, after reviewing his military his&para;<br>tory, they met with a representative of the Veterans Ad&para;<br>ministration seven weeks before trial and attempted to&para;<br>obtain his medical records. Id., at 381a, 386a. And they&para;<br>looked into enlisting a mitigation specialist when the trial&para;<br>was still five weeks away. Id., at 386a. The Sixth Circuit,&para;<br>in short, was simply incorrect in saying Van Hook’s law&para;<br>yers waited until the “last minute.” 560 F. 3d, at 528. Cf.&para;<br>Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 395 (2000) (counsel&para;<br>waited “until a week before the trial” to prepare for the&para;<br>sentencing phase).&para;<br>Nor was the scope of counsel’s investigation unreason&para;<br>able.2 The Sixth Circuit said Van Hook’s attorneys found&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In his brief in this Court, Van Hook also alludes to his counsel’s&para;<br>failure to obtain an independent mental-health expert and their reli&para;<br>ance on (and failure to object to harmful evidence in) a presentence&para;<br>investigation report—grounds on which the Sixth Circuit panel previ&para;<br>ously relied but which it abandoned in its final opinion. See supra, at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>only “a little information about his traumatic childhood&para;<br>experience,” 560 F. 3d, at 528, but that is a gross distor&para;<br>tion. The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook&para;<br>(whose parents were both “heavy drinkers”) started drink&para;<br>ing as a toddler, began “barhopping” with his father at age&para;<br>9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from&para;<br>age 11 forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol&para;<br>into adulthood. App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–312a, 323a–&para;<br>326a, 328a–330a, 373a. The court also heard that Van&para;<br>Hook grew up in a “ ‘combat zone’ ”: He watched his father&para;<br>beat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and&para;<br>knife-point, “observed” episodes of “sexual violence” while&para;<br>sleeping in his parents’ bedroom, and was beaten himself&para;<br>at least once. Id., at 321a, 338a–339a, 371a. It learned&para;<br>that Van Hook, who had “fantasies about killing and war”&para;<br>from an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and&para;<br>alcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and at&para;<br>tempted suicide five times (including a month before the&para;<br>murder), id., at 351a–353a, 372a. And although the ex&para;<br>perts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a “mental&para;<br>disease or defect,” the trial court learned that Van Hook’s&para;<br>borderline personality disorder and his consumption of&para;<br>drugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired “his abil&para;<br>ity to refrain from the [crime],” id., at 303a, and that his&para;<br>“explo[sion]” of “senseless and bizarre brutality” may have&para;<br>resulted from what one expert termed a “homosexual&para;<br>panic,” id., at 376a.&para;<br>Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did&para;<br>present, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his&para;<br>counsel for failing to find more. What his counsel did&para;<br>discover, the argument goes, gave them “reason to suspect&para;<br>that much worse details existed,” and that suspicion&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>2–3. Van Hook now concedes, however, that neither ground is a “basis&para;<br>&para;<br>for issuing the writ,” Brief in Opposition 5; see also id., at 7, and&para;<br>&para;<br>accordingly we do not address them. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. VAN HOOK&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>should have prompted them to interview other family&para;<br>members—his stepsister, two uncles, and two aunts—as&para;<br>well as a psychiatrist who once treated his mother, all of&para;<br>whom “could have helped his counsel narrate the true&para;<br>story of Van Hook’s childhood experiences.” 560 F. 3d, at&para;<br>528. But there comes a point at which evidence from more&para;<br>distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only&para;<br>cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more&para;<br>important duties. The ABA Standards prevailing at the&para;<br>time called for Van Hook’s counsel to cover several broad&para;<br>categories of mitigating evidence, see 1 ABA Standards&para;<br>4–4.1, comment., at 4–55, which they did. And given all&para;<br>the evidence they unearthed from those closest to Van&para;<br>Hook’s upbringing and the experts who reviewed his his&para;<br>tory, it was not unreasonable for his counsel not to identify&para;<br>and interview every other living family member or every&para;<br>therapist who once treated his parents. This is not a case&para;<br>in which the defendant’s attorneys failed to act while&para;<br>potentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in&para;<br>the face, cf. Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 525, or would have been&para;<br>apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would&para;<br>have obtained, cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 389–&para;<br>393 (2005). It is instead a case, like Strickland itself, in&para;<br>which defense counsel’s “decision not to seek more” miti&para;<br>gating evidence from the defendant’s background “than&para;<br>was already in hand” fell “well within the range of profes&para;<br>sionally reasonable judgments.” 466 U. S., at 699.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 In addition to the evidence the Sixth Circuit said his attorneys over&para;<br>looked, Van Hook alleges that his lawyers failed to provide the expert&para;<br>witnesses with a “complete set of relevant records or [his] complete&para;<br>psycho-social history.” Brief in Opposition 4. But he offers no support&para;<br>for that assertion. He further claims that his counsel failed to obtain or&para;<br>present records of his military service and prior hospitalizations, but&para;<br>the record shows that they did review the former, see App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 380a, and that the trial court learned (from one of the written&para;<br>expert reports) all the relevant information Van Hook says it would&para;<br>have gleaned from the latter, see id., at 373a–377a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>What is more, even if Van Hook’s counsel performed&para;<br>deficiently by failing to dig deeper, he suffered no preju&para;<br>dice as a result. See id., at 694. As the Ohio court that&para;<br>rejected Van Hook’s state habeas petition found, the affi&para;<br>davits submitted by the witnesses not interviewed shows&para;<br>their testimony would have added nothing of value. See&para;<br>State v. Van Hook, No. C–910505, 1992 WL 308350, *2.&para;<br>Only two witnesses even arguably would have added new,&para;<br>relevant information: One of Van Hook’s uncles noted that&para;<br>Van Hook’s mother was temporarily committed to a psy&para;<br>chiatric hospital, and Van Hook’s stepsister mentioned&para;<br>that his father hit Van Hook frequently and tried to kill&para;<br>Van Hook’s mother. App. to Pet. for Cert. 227a, 232a. But&para;<br>the trial court had already heard—from Van Hook’s&para;<br>mother herself—that she had been “under psychiatric&para;<br>care” more than once. Id., at 340a. And it was already&para;<br>aware that his father had a violent nature, had attacked&para;<br>Van Hook’s mother, and had beaten Van Hook at least&para;<br>once. See also id., at 305a (noting that Van Hook “suffered&para;<br>from a significant degree of neglect and abuse” throughout&para;<br>his “chaotic” childhood). Neither the Court of Appeals nor&para;<br>Van Hook has shown why the minor additional details the&para;<br>trial court did not hear would have made any difference.&para;<br>On the other side of the scales, moreover, was the evi&para;<br>dence of the aggravating circumstance the trial court&para;<br>found: that Van Hook committed the murder alone in the&para;<br>course of an aggravated robbery. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann.&para;<br>§2929.04(A)(7) (Lexis 2006). Van Hook’s confession made&para;<br>clear, and he never subsequently denied, both that he was&para;<br>the sole perpetrator of the crime and that “[h]is intention&para;<br>from beginning to end was to rob [Self] at some point in&para;<br>their evening’s activities.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a; see&para;<br>id., at 276a–278a, 294a. Nor did he arrive at that inten&para;<br>tion on a whim: Van Hook had previously pursued the&para;<br>same strategy—of luring homosexual men into secluded&para;<br>settings to rob them—many times since his teenage years,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. VAN HOOK&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>and he employed it again even after Self’s murder in the&para;<br>weeks before his arrest. See id., at 279a, 295a, 374a.&para;<br>Although Van Hook apparently deviated from his original&para;<br>plan once the offense was underway—going beyond steal&para;<br>ing Self’s goods to killing him and disfiguring the dead&para;<br>body—that hardly helped his cause. The Sixth Circuit,&para;<br>which focused on the number of aggravating factors in&para;<br>stead of their weight, see 560 F. 3d, at 530; cf. Ohio Rev.&para;<br>Code Ann. §2929.04(B), gave all this evidence short shrift,&para;<br>leading it to overstate further the effect additional miti&para;<br>gating evidence might have had.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted.
