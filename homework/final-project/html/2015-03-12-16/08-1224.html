Argued January 12, 2010—Decided May 17, 2010&para;<br>Federal law allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a&para;<br>mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he&para;<br>would otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. §4248. The Government in&para;<br>stituted civil-commitment proceedings under §4248 against respon&para;<br>dents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that,&para;<br>in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Nec&para;<br>essary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Agreeing,&para;<br>the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed&para;<br>on the legislative-power ground.&para;<br>Held: The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority suf&para;<br>ficient to enact §4248. Taken together, five considerations compel&para;<br>this conclusion. Pp. 5–22.&para;<br>(1) The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in fur&para;<br>therance of its constitutionally enumerated powers. It makes clear&para;<br>that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied&para;<br>by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient, or useful” or “con&para;<br>ducive” to the enumerated power’s “beneficial exercise,” e.g.,&para;<br>McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413, 418, and that Congress&para;<br>can “legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be&para;<br>involved in the constitution,” id., at 421. In determining whether the&para;<br>Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be “means&para;<br>ends rationality” between the enacted statute and the source of fed&para;<br>eral power. Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605. The Constitu&para;<br>tion “addresse[s]” the “choice of means” “primarily . . . to the judg&para;<br>ment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really&para;<br>calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent&para;<br>to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship be&para;<br>tween the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>congressional determination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290&para;<br>U. S. 534, 547–548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants&para;<br>Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi&para;<br>cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to&para;<br>provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu&para;<br>rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the&para;<br>federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority&para;<br>to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental&para;<br>health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil&para;<br>commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De&para;<br>fense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–4247. A longstanding&para;<br>history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s con&para;<br>stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397&para;<br>U. S. 664, 678, but can be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a&para;<br>congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21,&para;<br>and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the&para;<br>new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs&para;<br>from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due&para;<br>to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu&para;<br>als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under&para;<br>§4246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention&para;<br>of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are&para;<br>thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities&para;<br>between §4246 and §4248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest&para;<br>addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(3) There are sound reasons for §4248’s enactment. The Federal&para;<br>Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional&para;<br>power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from&para;<br>the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably&para;<br>adapted” to Congress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian.&para;<br>United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121. Congress could have rea&para;<br>sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill&para;<br>ness that causes them to “have serious difficulty in refraining from&para;<br>sexually violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high&para;<br>danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea&para;<br>sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals&para;<br>would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal&para;<br>custody. Congress’ desire to address these specific challenges, taken&para;<br>together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the&para;<br>conclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end rationality,”&para;<br>Sabri, supra, at 605. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(4) Respondents’ contention that §4248 violates the Tenth Amend&para;<br>ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not&para;<br>“reserve to the States” those powers that are “delegated to the United&para;<br>States by the Constitution,” including the powers delegated by the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,&para;<br>505 U. S. 144, 159. And §4248 does not “invade” state sovereignty,&para;<br>but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other&para;<br>things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the&para;<br>federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” of his detention, §4248(d),&para;<br>and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority&para;<br>over the individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate&para;<br>transfer to State custody, §4248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United&para;<br>States, 350 U. S. 366, 375–376, the Court rejected a similar challenge&para;<br>to §4248’s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because&para;<br>the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of&para;<br>state interests than §4248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in&para;<br>vade state interests. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>(5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents’&para;<br>argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more than one step re&para;<br>moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., McCulloch,&para;<br>supra, at 417. Nor will the Court’s holding today confer on Congress&para;<br>a general “police power, which the Founders denied the National&para;<br>Government and reposed in the States.” United States v. Morrison,&para;<br>529 U. S. 598, 618. Section §4248 has been applied to only a small&para;<br>fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al&para;<br>ready “in the custody of the” Federal Government, §4248(a). Thus,&para;<br>far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a reasonably adapted and&para;<br>narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government’s legitimate in&para;<br>terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its&para;<br>prison system. See New York, supra, at 157. Pp. 18–22.&para;<br>The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its&para;<br>application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due&para;<br>process, or any other constitutional rights. Respondents are free to&para;<br>pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.&para;<br>P. 22.&para;<br>551 F. 3d 274, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

GRAYDON &para;<br>&para;<br>EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[May 17, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>A federal civil-commitment statute authorizes the De&para;<br>partment of Justice to detain a mentally ill, sexually&para;<br>dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date the prisoner&para;<br>would otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. §4248. We have&para;<br>previously examined similar statutes enacted under state&para;<br>law to determine whether they violate the Due Process&para;<br>Clause. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 356–358&para;<br>(1997); Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407 (2002). But this&para;<br>case presents a different question. Here we ask whether&para;<br>the Federal Government has the authority under Article I&para;<br>of the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment&para;<br>program or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a&para;<br>government “of enumerated powers.” McCulloch v. Mary&para;<br>land, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819). We conclude that the&para;<br>Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact §4248&para;<br>as “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the&para;<br>powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the Government of&para;<br>the United States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The federal statute before us allows a district court to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>order the civil commitment of an individual who is cur&para;<br>rently “in the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,”&para;<br>§4248, if that individual (1) has previously “engaged or&para;<br>attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child&para;<br>molestation,” (2) currently “suffers from a serious mental&para;<br>illness, abnormality, or disorder,” and (3) “as a result of”&para;<br>that mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is “sexually&para;<br>dangerous to others,” in that “he would have serious diffi&para;<br>culty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child&para;<br>molestation if released.” §§4247(a)(5)–(6).&para;<br>In order to detain such a person, the Government (act&para;<br>ing through the Department of Justice) must certify to a&para;<br>federal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi&para;<br>tions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually&para;<br>violent activity or child molestation in the past and that&para;<br>he suffers from a mental illness that makes him corre&para;<br>spondingly dangerous to others. §4248(a). When such a&para;<br>certification is filed, the statute automatically stays the&para;<br>individual’s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the&para;<br>Government an opportunity to prove its claims at a hear&para;<br>ing through psychiatric (or other) evidence, §§4247(b)–(c),&para;<br>4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner “shall be&para;<br>represented by counsel” and shall have “an opportunity” at&para;<br>the hearing “to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena&para;<br>witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross&para;<br>examine” the Government’s witnesses. §§4247(d), 4248(c).&para;<br>If the Government proves its claims by “clear and con&para;<br>vincing evidence,” the court will order the prisoner’s con&para;<br>tinued commitment in “the custody of the Attorney Gen&para;<br>eral,” who must “make all reasonable efforts to cause” the&para;<br>State where that person was tried, or the State where he&para;<br>is domiciled, to “assume responsibility for his custody,&para;<br>care, and treatment.” §4248(d); cf. Sullivan v. Freeman,&para;<br>944 F. 2d 334, 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to&para;<br>assume that responsibility, the Attorney General “shall&para;<br>release” the individual “to the appropriate official” of that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>State. §4248(d). But if, “notwithstanding such efforts,&para;<br>neither such State will assume such responsibility,” then&para;<br>“the Attorney General shall place the person for treatment&para;<br>in a suitable [federal] facility.” Ibid.; cf. §4247(i)(A).&para;<br>Confinement in the federal facility will last until either&para;<br>(1) the person’s mental condition improves to the point&para;<br>where he is no longer dangerous (with or without appro&para;<br>priate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re&para;<br>leased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his cus&para;<br>tody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be&para;<br>transferred to the custody of that State. §§4248(d)(1)–(2).&para;<br>The statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric&para;<br>and judicial review of the individual’s case, including&para;<br>judicial hearings at the request of the confined person at&para;<br>six-month intervals. §§4247(e)(1)(B), (h).&para;<br>In November and December 2006, the Government&para;<br>instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the&para;<br>Eastern District of North Carolina against the five re&para;<br>spondents in this case. Three of the five had previously&para;<br>pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por&para;<br>nography, see 507 F. Supp. 2d 522, 526, and n. 2 (2007);&para;<br>§2252A(a), and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual&para;<br>abuse of a minor, see United States v. Vigil, No.&para;<br>1:99CR00509–001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); §§1153, 2243(a).&para;<br>With respect to each of them, the Government claimed&para;<br>that the respondent was about to be released from federal&para;<br>prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or&para;<br>child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a&para;<br>mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to oth&para;<br>ers. App. 38–40, 44–52. During that same time period,&para;<br>the Government instituted similar proceedings against the&para;<br>fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court&para;<br>with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found&para;<br>mentally incompetent to stand trial. See id., at 41–43;&para;<br>United States v. Catron, No. 04–778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27,&para;<br>2006); §4241(d).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil&para;<br>commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They&para;<br>claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi&para;<br>nal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates&para;<br>the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,&para;<br>and the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d,&para;<br>at 528. They claimed that the statute denies them sub&para;<br>stantive due process and equal protection of the laws.&para;<br>Ibid. They claimed that it violates their procedural due&para;<br>process rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous&para;<br>ness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead&para;<br>of by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid. And, finally,&para;<br>they claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex&para;<br>ceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, §8 of the Consti&para;<br>tution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause&para;<br>and the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>528–529.&para;<br>The District Court, accepting two of the respondents’&para;<br>claims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with&para;<br>respondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt, id., at 551–559 (citing In re Winship,&para;<br>397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the&para;<br>statute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers,&para;<br>507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530–551. On appeal, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on&para;<br>this latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278–&para;<br>284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof ques&para;<br>tion, nor did it address any of respondents’ other constitu&para;<br>tional challenges. Id., at 276, n. 1.&para;<br>The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its&para;<br>request, limited to the question of Congress’ authority&para;<br>under Art. I, §8 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since&para;<br>then, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that&para;<br>same question, each deciding it in the Government’s favor,&para;<br>thereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.&para;<br>See United States v. Volungus, 595 F. 3d 1 (CA1 2010);&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>United States v. Tom, 565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The question presented is whether the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, grants Congress authority&para;<br>sufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that&para;<br>question, we assume, but we do not decide, that other&para;<br>provisions of the Constitution—such as the Due Process&para;<br>Clause—do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum&para;<br>stances. Cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346; Addington v. Texas,&para;<br>441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for ar&para;<br>gument’s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit&para;<br>a State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether&para;<br>the Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow&para;<br>ers, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump&para;<br>tion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress&para;<br>legislative power sufficient to enact §4248. We base this&para;<br>conclusion on five considerations, taken together.&para;<br>First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress&para;<br>broad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200&para;<br>years ago, this Court stated that the Federal “[G]overn&para;<br>ment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated&para;<br>powers,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that&para;<br>“[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or&para;<br>more of” those powers, United States v. Morrison, 529&para;<br>U. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, “a govern&para;<br>ment, entrusted with such” powers “must also be en&para;<br>trusted with ample means for their execution.”&para;<br>McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary&para;<br>and Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution’s&para;<br>grants of specific federal legislative authority are accom&para;<br>panied by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient,&para;<br>or useful” or “conducive” to the authority’s “beneficial&para;<br>exercise.” Id., at 413, 418; see also id., at 421 (“[Congress&para;<br>can] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which&para;<br>must be involved in the constitution . . .”). Chief Justice&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Marshall emphasized that the word “necessary” does not&para;<br>mean “absolutely necessary.” Id., at 413–415 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462&para;<br>(2003) (“[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces&para;<br>sary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress&para;<br>be ‘ “absolutely necessary” ’ to the exercise of an enumer&para;<br>ated power”). In language that has come to define the&para;<br>scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:&para;<br>“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of&para;<br>the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,&para;<br>which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not&para;<br>prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the&para;<br>constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch, supra, at&para;<br>421.&para;<br>We have since made clear that, in determining whether&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the&para;<br>legislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,&para;<br>we look to see whether the statute constitutes a means&para;<br>that is rationally related to the implementation of a con&para;<br>stitutionally enumerated power. Sabri v. United States,&para;<br>541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (using term “means-ends ration&para;<br>ality” to describe the necessary relationship); ibid. (up&para;<br>holding Congress’ “authority under the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause” to enact a criminal statute in furtherance&para;<br>of the federal power granted by the Spending Clause); see&para;<br>Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (holding that&para;<br>because “Congress had a rational basis” for concluding&para;<br>that a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the&para;<br>statute falls within the scope of congressional “authority to&para;<br>‘make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper’ to&para;<br>‘regulate Commerce . . . among the several States’ ” (ellip&para;<br>sis in original)); see also United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.&para;<br>549, 557 (1995); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Rec&para;<br>lamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981).&para;<br>Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>statute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, §8, must&para;<br>also “not [be] prohibited” by the Constitution. McCulloch,&para;<br>supra, at 421. But as we have already stated, the present&para;<br>statute’s validity under provisions of the Constitution&para;<br>other than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue&para;<br>that is not before us. Under the question presented, the&para;<br>relevant inquiry is simply “whether the means chosen are&para;<br>‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end&para;<br>under the commerce power” or under other powers that&para;<br>the Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple&para;<br>ment. Gonzales, supra, at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,&para;<br>121 (1941)).&para;<br>We have also recognized that the Constitution “ad&para;<br>dresse[s]” the “choice of means”&para;<br>“primarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can&para;<br>be seen that the means adopted are really calculated&para;<br>to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex&para;<br>tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of&para;<br>the relationship between the means adopted and the&para;<br>end to be attained, are matters for congressional de&para;<br>termination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290&para;<br>U. S. 534, 547–548 (1934).&para;<br>See also Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903) (“[T]he&para;<br>Constitution . . . . leaves to Congress a large discretion as&para;<br>to the means that may be employed in executing a given&para;<br>power”); Morrison, supra, at 607 (applying a “presumption&para;<br>of constitutionality” when examining the scope of Con&para;<br>gressional power); McCulloch, supra, at 410, 421.&para;<br>Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly&para;<br>about the creation of federal crimes beyond those related&para;<br>to “counterfeiting,” “treason,” or “Piracies and Felonies&para;<br>committed on the high Seas” or “against the Law of Na&para;<br>tions,” Art. I, §8, cls. 6, 10; Art. III, §3, nonetheless grants&para;<br>Congress broad authority to create such crimes. See&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 416 (“All admit that the govern&para;<br>ment may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws;&para;<br>and yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of&para;<br>Congress”); see also United States v.

See, e.g., §1791 (prohibit&para;<br>ing smuggling contraband); §751 et seq. (prohibiting es&para;<br>cape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR §541.10 et seq.

But Con&para;<br>gress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of&para;<br>those things in the course of “carrying into Execution” the&para;<br>enumerated powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the&para;<br>Government of the United States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 18—&para;<br>authority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.&para;<br>Second, the civil-commitment statute before us consti&para;<br>tutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related&para;<br>mental-health statutes that have existed for many dec&para;<br>ades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of&para;<br>related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s&para;<br>constitutionality. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of&para;<br>New York, 397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970) (“[N]o one acquires a&para;<br>vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by&para;<br>long use . . .”); cf. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 612–614 (legisla&para;<br>tive history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect&para;<br>to Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can&para;<br>nonetheless be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a&para;<br>congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales, 545 U. S., at&para;<br>21; Walz, supra, at 678, and, in particular, the reason&para;<br>ableness of the relation between the new statute and pre&para;<br>existing federal interests.&para;<br>Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mental health care to federal prisoners, and has long&para;<br>provided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab&para;<br>lished Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in the District of Colum&para;<br>bia to provide treatment to “the insane of the army and&para;<br>navy . . . and of the District of Columbia.” Act of Mar. 3,&para;<br>1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for&para;<br>confinement at Saint Elizabeth’s of any person within the&para;<br>District of Columbia who had been “charged with [a]&para;<br>crime” and who was “insane” or later became “insane&para;<br>during the continuance of his or her sentence in the&para;<br>United States penitentiary.” Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11&para;<br>Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881). In&para;<br>1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,&para;<br>Congress provided for civil commitment in federal facili&para;<br>ties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of “all per&para;<br>sons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in&para;<br>any court of the United States” and who are or “shall&para;<br>become” insane “during the term of their imprisonment.”&para;<br>Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis&para;<br>added). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com&para;<br>mitment of those “charged” with federal offenses who&para;<br>become “insane” while in the “custody” of the United&para;<br>States. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis&para;<br>added). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress&para;<br>created a national, federal civil-commitment program&para;<br>under which any person who was either charged with or&para;<br>convicted of any federal offense in any federal court could&para;<br>be confined in a federal mental institution.&para;<br>These statutes did not raise the question presented&para;<br>here, for they all provided that commitment in a federal&para;<br>hospital would end upon the completion of the relevant&para;<br>“terms” of federal “imprisonment” as set forth in the un&para;<br>derlying criminal sentence or statute. §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252;&para;<br>see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.&para;<br>569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940’s that proviso was&para;<br>eliminated.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States&para;<br>proposed legislative reforms of the federal civil&para;<br>commitment system. The Judicial Conference based its&para;<br>proposals upon what this Court has described as a “long&para;<br>study by a conspicuously able committee” (chaired by&para;<br>Judge Calvert Magruder and whose members included&para;<br>Judge Learned Hand), involving consultation “with federal&para;<br>district and circuit judges” across the country as well as&para;<br>with the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United&para;<br>States, 350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United&para;<br>States, 219 F. 2d 376, 380–384 (CA8 1955) (describing the&para;<br>committee’s work). The committee studied, among other&para;<br>things, the “serious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris&para;<br>ons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the&para;<br>expiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be&para;<br>dangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no&para;<br>state will assume responsibility for their custody.” Judi&para;<br>cial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment&para;<br>Accorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged&para;<br>with Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),&para;<br>App. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in&para;<br>which the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob&para;<br>lem of “ ‘paranoid’ ” and “ ‘threatening’ ” individuals whom&para;<br>no State would accept. Id., at 9, App. 71. And it noted&para;<br>that, in the Bureau’s “[e]xperience,” States would not&para;<br>accept an “appreciable number” of “mental[ly] incompe&para;<br>tent” individuals “nearing expiration” of their prison&para;<br>terms, because of their “lack of legal residence in any&para;<br>State,” even though those individuals “ought not . . . be at&para;<br>large because they constitute a menace to public safety.”&para;<br>H.

Bennett, Director); see also Letter from&para;<br>Bennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee&para;<br>Report, App. 83–88. The committee, hence the Judicial&para;<br>Conference, therefore recommended that Congress enact&para;<br>“some provision of law authorizing the continued confine&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment of such persons after their sentences expired.”&para;<br>Committee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the&para;<br>Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).&para;<br>Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the&para;<br>Judicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.&para;<br>See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–&para;<br>4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §§4244–4248. It provided for the civil commit&para;<br>ment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally&para;<br>incompetent at any time after their arrest and before the&para;<br>expiration of their federal sentence, §§4241, 4244, 4247–&para;<br>4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards,&para;<br>§§4242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose&para;<br>prison term is about to expire, it specified the following:&para;<br>“Whenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons&para;<br>shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to&para;<br>expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of&para;<br>the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner&para;<br>is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released&para;<br>he will probably endanger the safety of the officers,&para;<br>the property, or other interests of the United States,&para;<br>and that suitable arrangements for the custody and&para;<br>care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the&para;<br>Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to . . .&para;<br>the court for the district in which the prisoner is con&para;<br>fined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner&para;<br>to be examined . . . and shall . . . hold a hearing . . . . If&para;<br>upon such hearing the court shall determine that the&para;<br>conditions specified above exist, the court may commit&para;<br>the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or&para;<br>his authorized representative.” §4247.&para;<br>The precondition that the mentally ill individual’s release&para;<br>would “probably endanger the safety of the officers, the&para;<br>property, or other interests of the United States” was&para;<br>uniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“release would endanger the safety of persons, property or&para;<br>the public interest in general—not merely the interests&para;<br>peculiar to the United States as such.” United States v.&para;<br>Curry, 410 F. 2d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also Royal v.&para;<br>United States, 274 F. 2d 846, 851–852 (CA10 1960).&para;<br>In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See&para;<br>Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §§4241–4247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it&para;<br>altered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris&para;<br>oner’s danger to the “interests of the United States,” to&para;<br>conform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre&para;<br>tation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as&para;<br>to authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to&para;<br>the other conditions, the prisoner’s “release would create a&para;<br>substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or&para;<br>serious damage to the property of another.” §4246(d).&para;<br>Congress also elaborated upon the required condition&para;<br>“that suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail&para;<br>able” by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative&para;<br>placement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.&para;<br>See ibid.; supra, at 2–3. With these modifications, the&para;<br>statutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of&para;<br>individuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once&para;<br>they have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal&para;<br>crime. §§4241(d), 4246; see also §4243(d). They continue&para;<br>to provide for the continued civil commitment of those&para;<br>individuals when they are “due for release” from federal&para;<br>custody because their “sentence is about to expire.” §4246.&para;<br>And, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari&para;<br>ous procedural and other requirements. E.g., §4247.&para;<br>In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before&para;<br>us. §302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S. C. §4248. It differs from&para;<br>earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons&para;<br>who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.&para;<br>Notably, many of these individuals were likely already&para;<br>subject to civil commitment under §4246, which, since&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal&para;<br>prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are&para;<br>thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But&para;<br>cf. H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from&para;<br>its specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, §4248 is&para;<br>similar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. §4246.&para;<br>In that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding&para;<br>federal statutory framework, which has been in place&para;<br>since 1855.&para;<br>Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding&para;<br>civil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually&para;<br>dangerous persons who are already in federal custody,&para;<br>even if doing so detains them beyond the termination of&para;<br>their criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus&para;<br>todian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to&para;<br>protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger&para;<br>federal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457&para;<br>U. S. 307, 320 (1982) (“In operating an institution such as&para;<br>[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces&para;<br>sary for the State to restrain the movement of residents—&para;<br>for example, to protect them as well as others from vio&para;<br>lence” (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one&para;<br>“who takes charge of a third person” is “under a duty to&para;<br>exercise reasonable care to control” that person to prevent&para;<br>him from causing reasonably foreseeable “bodily harm to&para;<br>others.”&para;<br>Restatement (Second) of Torts §319, p. 129&para;<br>(1963–1964); see Volungus, 595 F. 3d, at 7–8 (citing cases);&para;<br>see also United States v. S. A., 129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8&para;<br>1997) (“[Congress enacted §4246] to avert the public dan&para;<br>ger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and&para;<br>dangerous detainees”). If a federal prisoner is infected&para;<br>with a communicable disease that threatens others, surely&para;<br>it would be “necessary and proper” for the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal&para;<br>custodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to release that individual among the general public, where&para;<br>he might infect others (even if not threatening an inter&para;<br>state epidemic, cf. Art. I, §8, cl. 3). And if confinement of&para;<br>such an individual is a “necessary and proper” thing to do,&para;<br>then how could it not be similarly “necessary and proper”&para;<br>to confine an individual whose mental illness threatens&para;<br>others to the same degree?&para;<br>Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably adapted,” Darby, 312&para;<br>U. S., at 121, to Congress’ power to act as a responsible&para;<br>federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal&para;<br>criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement&para;<br>constitutionally enumerated authority, see supra, at 7–8).&para;<br>Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal&para;<br>inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them&para;<br>to “have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually&para;<br>violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially&para;<br>high danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.&para;<br>109–218, at 22–23. And Congress could also have rea&para;<br>sonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference’s&para;<br>report) that a reasonable number of such individuals&para;<br>would likely not be detained by the States if released from&para;<br>federal custody, in part because the Federal Government&para;<br>itself severed their claim to “legal residence in any State”&para;<br>by incarcerating them in remote federal prisons. H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 1319, at 2; Committee Report 7–11, App. 69–75;&para;<br>cf. post, at 6 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Here&para;<br>Congress’ desire to address the specific challenges identi&para;<br>fied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its&para;<br>responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con&para;<br>clusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end ration&para;<br>ality,” i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution’s insistence&para;<br>that a federal statute represent a rational means for im&para;<br>plementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.&para;<br>Sabri, 541 U. S., at 605 (citing McCulloch, 4 Wheat. 316).&para;<br>See Jinks, 538 U. S., at 462–463 (opinion for the Court by&para;<br>SCALIA, J.)

COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause when it “provides an alter&para;<br>native to [otherwise] unsatisfactory options” that are&para;<br>“obviously inefficient”).&para;<br>Fourth, the statute properly accounts for state interests.&para;<br>Respondents and the dissent contend that §4248 violates&para;<br>the Tenth Amendment because it “invades the province of&para;<br>state sovereignty” in an area typically left to state control.&para;<br>New York v.

S. 715,&para;<br>736 (1972) (“The States have traditionally exercised broad&para;<br>power to commit persons found to be mentally ill”). But&para;<br>the Tenth Amendment’s text is clear: “The powers not&para;<br>delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor&para;<br>prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States&para;<br>respectively, or to the people.” (Emphasis added.) The&para;<br>powers “delegated to the United States by the Constitu&para;<br>tion” include those specifically enumerated powers listed&para;<br>in Article I along with the implementation authority&para;<br>granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Virtually by&para;<br>definition, these powers are not powers that the Constitu&para;<br>tion “reserved to the States.” See New York, supra, at 156,&para;<br>159 (“[I]f a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitu&para;<br>tion, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any res&para;<br>ervation of that power to the States . . . .” “In the end . . .&para;<br>it makes no difference whether one views the question at&para;<br>issue in these cases as one of ascertaining the limits of the&para;<br>power delegated to the Federal Government under the&para;<br>affirmative provisions of the Constitution or one of dis&para;<br>cerning the core of sovereignty retained by the States&para;<br>under the Tenth Amendment”); Darby, supra, at 123–124;&para;<br>see also Hodel, 452 U. S., at 276–277, 281; Maryland v.&para;<br>Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 195–196 (1968); Lambert v. Yellow&para;<br>ley, 272 U.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with the States.” Post, at 7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To&para;<br>the contrary, it requires accommodation of state interests:&para;<br>The Attorney General must inform the State in which the&para;<br>federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” that he is&para;<br>detaining someone with respect to whom those States may&para;<br>wish to assert their authority, and he must encourage&para;<br>those States to assume custody of the individual.&para;<br>§4248(d). He must also immediately “release” that person&para;<br>“to the appropriate official of” either State “if such State&para;<br>will assume [such] responsibility.” Ibid. And either State&para;<br>has the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the&para;<br>individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate&para;<br>transfer to State custody. §4248(d)(1). Respondents con&para;<br>tend that the States are nonetheless “powerless to prevent&para;<br>the detention of their citizens under §4248, even if deten&para;<br>tion is contrary to the States’ policy choices.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the&para;<br>most natural reading of the statute, see §§4248(d)(1)–(e),&para;<br>and the Solicitor General acknowledges that “the Federal&para;<br>Government would have no appropriate role” with respect&para;<br>to an individual covered by the statute once “the transfer&para;<br>to State responsibility and State control has occurred.” Tr.&para;<br>of Oral Arg. 9.&para;<br>In Greenwood, 350 U. S. 366, the Court rejected a chal&para;<br>lenge to the current statute’s predecessor—i.e., to the 1949&para;<br>statute we described above, supra, at 11–12. The petition&para;<br>ers in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that&para;<br>the statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioner in Greenwood v. United States,&para;<br>O. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18–29. But the Court rejected&para;<br>that argument. See Greenwood, supra, at 375–376. And&para;<br>the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less&para;<br>protective of state interests than the current statute. That&para;<br>statute authorized federal custody so long as “suitable&para;<br>arrangements” were “not otherwise available” in a State or&para;<br>otherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner in Greenwood, supra, at 25 (“What has really&para;<br>happened is that the Federal government has been dissat&para;<br>isfied with the care given by the states to those mentally&para;<br>incompetent who have been released by the Federal au&para;<br>thorities”). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, §4248&para;<br>requires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant&para;<br>States to take custody of the individual without inquiring&para;<br>into the “suitability” of their intended care or treatment,&para;<br>and to relinquish federal authority whenever a State&para;<br>asserts its own. §4248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in&para;<br>Greenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,&para;<br>neither does §4248.&para;<br>Fifth, the links between §4248 and an enumerated&para;<br>Article I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the&para;<br>statutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the&para;<br>cautionary instruction that we may not “pile inference&para;<br>upon inference” in order to sustain congressional action&para;<br>under Article I, Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents&para;<br>argue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary&para;<br>and Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more&para;<br>than one step removed from a specifically enumerated&para;<br>power. See Brief for Respondents 21–22; Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>27–28. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece&para;<br>dents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that&para;<br>case we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of&para;<br>a mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac&para;<br>cused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at&para;<br>369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was&para;<br>the power to “Establish Post Offices and Post Roads.”&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 7.

For example, in Sabri&para;<br>we observed that “Congress has authority under the&para;<br>Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys” and that&para;<br>it therefore “has corresponding authority under the Neces&para;<br>sary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars”&para;<br>are not “siphoned off” by “corrupt public officers.” 541&para;<br>U. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that,&para;<br>in aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of “tax&para;<br>payer dollars,” Congress has the additional prophylactic&para;<br>power to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the&para;<br>stolen funds have not been “traceably skimmed from&para;<br>specific federal payments.” Ibid. Similarly, in United&para;<br>States v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Neces&para;<br>sary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in&para;<br>furtherance of Art. I, §8, cls. 11–13, to award “pensions to&para;<br>the wounded and disabled” soldiers of the armed forces&para;<br>and their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that im&para;<br>plied power we further inferred the “[i]mplied power” “to&para;<br>pass laws to . . . punish” anyone who fraudulently appro&para;<br>priated such pensions, id., at 346. See also Stewart v.&para;<br>Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 506–507 (1871).&para;<br>Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress&para;<br>has the implied power to criminalize any conduct that&para;<br>might interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,&para;<br>and also the additional power to imprison people who&para;<br>violate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>additional power to provide for the safe and reasonable&para;<br>management of those prisons, and the additional power to&para;<br>regulate the prisoners’ behavior even after their release.&para;<br>See post, at 12–13, 17, n. 11. Of course, each of those&para;<br>powers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and&para;<br>McCulloch, is ultimately “derived from” an enumerated&para;<br>power, Hall, supra, at 345. And, as the dissent agrees,&para;<br>that enumerated power is “the enumerated power that&para;<br>justifies the defendant’s statute of conviction,” post, at 17,&para;<br>n. 11. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single&para;<br>specific enumerated power “that justifies a criminal de&para;<br>fendant’s arrest or conviction,” post, at 12, in all cases&para;<br>because Congress relies on different enumerated powers&para;<br>(often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to&para;<br>enact its various federal criminal statutes, see supra, at 7–&para;<br>8. But every such statute must itself be legitimately&para;<br>predicated on an enumerated power. And the same enu&para;<br>merated power that justifies the creation of a federal&para;<br>criminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied&para;<br>federal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justi&para;<br>fies civil commitment under §4248 as well. See supra, at&para;<br>14–16. Thus, we must reject respondents’ argument that&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a&para;<br>single step between an enumerated power and an Act of&para;<br>Congress.&para;<br>Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on&para;<br>Congress a general “police power, which the Founders&para;<br>denied the National Government and reposed in the&para;<br>States.” Morrison, 529 U. S., at 618. As the Solicitor&para;<br>General repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, §4248 is&para;<br>narrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small frac&para;<br>tion of federal prisoners.

COMSTOCK&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>This separate writing serves two purposes. The first is&para;<br>to withhold assent from certain statements and proposi&para;<br>tions of the Court’s opinion. The second is to caution that&para;<br>the Constitution does require the invalidation of congres&para;<br>sional attempts to extend federal powers in some&para;<br>instances.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Court concludes that, when determining whether&para;<br>Congress has the authority to enact a specific law under&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause, we look “to see whether&para;<br>the statute constitutes a means that is rationally related&para;<br>to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated&para;<br>power.” Ante, at 6 (suggesting that Sabri v. United States,&para;<br>541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004), adopts a “means-ends rational&para;<br>ity” test).&para;<br>The terms “rationally related” and “rational basis” must&para;<br>be employed with care, particularly if either is to be used&para;<br>as a stand-alone test. The phrase “rational basis” most&para;<br>often is employed to describe the standard for determining&para;<br>whether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental&para;<br>liberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>Referring to this due process inquiry, and in what must be&para;<br>one of the most deferential formulations of the standard&para;<br>for reviewing legislation in all the Court’s precedents, the&para;<br>Court has said: “But the law need not be in every respect&para;<br>logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is&para;<br>enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and&para;<br>that it might be thought that the particular legislative&para;<br>measure was a rational way to correct it.” Williamson v.&para;<br>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487–488 (1955).&para;<br>This formulation was in a case presenting a due process&para;<br>challenge and a challenge to a State’s exercise of its own&para;<br>powers, powers not confined by the principles that control&para;<br>the limited nature of our National Government. The&para;<br>phrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>issue before us.&para;<br>The operative constitutional provision in this case is the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held&para;<br>that the Lee Optical test, asking if “it might be thought&para;<br>that the particular legislative measure was a rational way&para;<br>to correct” an evil, is the proper test in this context.&para;<br>Rather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, applica&para;<br>tion of a “rational basis” test should be at least as exacting&para;<br>as it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more&para;<br>so. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its&para;<br>opinion referring to “rational basis” are predominantly&para;<br>Commerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.&para;<br>See ante, at 6 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005);&para;<br>Lopez, supra; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recla&para;<br>mation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981)).&para;<br>There is an important difference between the two ques&para;<br>tions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.&para;<br>Raich, Lopez, and Hodel were all Commerce Clause cases.&para;<br>Those precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not&para;<br>a mere conceivable rational relation, as in Lee Optical.&para;<br>“ ‘[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particu&para;<br>lar activity substantially affects interstate commerce does&para;<br>not necessarily make it so.’ ” Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2&para;<br>(quoting Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Com&para;<br>merce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based&para;<br>on empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferen&para;<br>tial, this may well be different from the rational-basis test&para;<br>as Lee Optical described it.&para;<br>The Court relies on Sabri, supra, for its conclusion that&para;<br>a “means-ends rationality” is all that is required for a&para;<br>power to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause’s&para;<br>reach. See ante, at 6. Sabri only refers to “means-ends&para;<br>rationality” in a parenthetical describing the holding in&para;<br>McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819); it certainly&para;<br>did not import the Lee Optical rational-basis test into this&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>arena through such a parenthetical. See Sabri, supra, at&para;<br>612 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (“A statute can&para;<br>have a ‘rational’ connection to an enumerated power with&para;<br>out being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated&para;<br>power”). It should be remembered, moreover, that the&para;<br>spending power is not designated as such in the Constitu&para;<br>tion but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect&para;<br>taxes and other specified exactions in order, among other&para;<br>purposes, “to pay the Debts and provide for the common&para;<br>Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” Art. I,&para;<br>§8, cl. 1; see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206&para;<br>(1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been&para;<br>much discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to&para;<br>the Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the ana&para;<br>lytic approach in those precedents should be respected.&para;<br>A separate concern stems from the Court’s explanation&para;<br>of the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 16. I had thought it a&para;<br>basic principle that the powers reserved to the States&para;<br>consist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remain&para;<br>ing after taking account of powers granted to the National&para;<br>Government. The Constitution delegates limited powers&para;<br>to the National Government and then reserves the re&para;<br>mainder for the States (or the people), not the other way&para;<br>around, as the Court’s analysis suggests. And the powers&para;<br>reserved to the States are so broad that they remain unde&para;<br>fined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps&para;<br>imperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and&para;<br>the States alone.&para;<br>It is correct in one sense to say that if the National&para;<br>Government has the power to act under the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the&para;<br>States. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the&para;<br>Constitution inform which powers are properly exercised&para;<br>by the National Government in the first place. See Lopez,&para;<br>514 U. S., at 580–581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also&para;<br>McCulloch, supra, at 421 (powers “consist[ent] with the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional”). It&para;<br>is of fundamental importance to consider whether essen&para;<br>tial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the&para;<br>assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper&para;<br>Clause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is&para;<br>not one properly within the reach of federal power.&para;<br>The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to&para;<br>hold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on&para;<br>the exercise of congressional power are the Constitution’s&para;<br>express prohibitions. The Court’s discussion of the Tenth&para;<br>Amendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing&para;<br>from the federal system are of no import when defining&para;<br>the limits of the National Government’s power, as it pro&para;<br>ceeds by first asking whether the power is within the&para;<br>National Government’s reach, and if so it discards federal&para;<br>ism concerns entirely.&para;<br>These remarks explain why the Court ignores important&para;<br>limitations stemming from federalism principles. Those&para;<br>principles are essential to an understanding of the func&para;<br>tion and province of the States in our constitutional&para;<br>structure.&para;<br>II&para;<br>As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted&para;<br>within its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the&para;<br>federal detention of prisoners does not endanger third&para;<br>parties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State&para;<br>to take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so&para;<br>it is incumbent on the National Government to act. This&para;<br>obligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in&para;<br>tort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an&para;<br>unstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.&para;<br>Having acted within its constitutional authority to detain&para;<br>the person, the National Government can acknowledge a&para;<br>duty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does&para;<br>not prejudice the States and their citizens.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>I would note, as the Court’s opinion does, that §4248&para;<br>does not supersede the right and responsibility of the&para;<br>States to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil&para;<br>confinement. The federal program in question applies&para;<br>only to those in federal custody and thus involves little&para;<br>intrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the&para;<br>States.&para;<br>This is not a case in which the National Government&para;<br>demands that a State use its own governmental system to&para;<br>implement federal commands. See Printz v. United States,&para;<br>521 U. S. 898 (1997). It is not a case in which the Na&para;<br>tional Government relieves the States of their own pri&para;<br>mary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the&para;<br>safety and well being of their citizens. See United States&para;<br>v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Nor is it a case in which&para;<br>the exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and&para;<br>duties traditionally committed to the State. See Lopez,&para;<br>supra, at 580–581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).&para;<br>Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of author&para;<br>ity over a small class of persons already subject to the&para;<br>federal power. Importantly, §4248(d) requires the Attor&para;<br>ney General to release any civil detainee “to the appropri&para;<br>ate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or&para;<br>was tried if such State will assume responsibility for his&para;<br>custody, care, and treatment,” providing a strong assur&para;<br>ance that the proffered reason for the legislation’s neces&para;<br>sity is not a mere artifice.&para;<br>With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the&para;<br>Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §4248, in order to “carr[y] into Execution”&para;<br>powers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu&para;<br>tion, see Art.

Under this law, if neither the State of a pris&para;<br>oner’s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was&para;<br>tried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner’s&para;<br>“custody, care, and treatment,” the Federal Government is&para;<br>authorized to undertake that responsibility. §4248(d).&para;<br>The statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will&para;<br>assume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a&para;<br>dangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy&para;<br>federal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to&para;<br>any State.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

The&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional&para;<br>authority for most federal criminal statutes.

The States, in turn, are&para;<br>free to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not&para;<br>withhold from them. Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated&para;<br>to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by&para;<br>it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or&para;<br>to the people”).1 This constitutional structure establishes&para;<br>different default rules for Congress and the States: Con&para;<br>gress’ powers are “few and defined,” while those that&para;<br>belong to the States “remain . . . numerous and indefinite.”&para;<br>The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.&para;<br>Madison).&para;<br>The Constitution plainly sets forth the “few and defined”&para;<br>powers that Congress may exercise. Article I “vest[s]” in&para;<br>Congress “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,” §1, and&para;<br>carefully enumerates those powers in §8.

Second, there must be a&para;<br>necessary and proper fit between the “means” (the federal&para;<br>law) and the “end” (the enumerated power or powers) it is&para;<br>designed to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a&para;<br>certain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit&para;<br>under this second inquiry. The means Congress selects&para;<br>will be deemed “necessary” if they are “appropriate” and&para;<br>“plainly adapted” to the exercise of an enumerated power,&para;<br>and “proper” if they are not otherwise “prohibited” by the&para;<br>Constitution and not “[in]consistent” with its “letter and&para;<br>spirit.” Ibid.&para;<br>Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear&para;<br>relationship the Clause establishes between the two in&para;<br>quiries: Unless the end itself is “legitimate,” the fit be&para;<br>tween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no&para;<br>matter how “necessary” or “proper” an Act of Congress&para;<br>may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis&para;<br>late if the objective is anything other than “carrying into&para;<br>Execution” one or more of the Federal Government’s enu&para;<br>merated powers.

Referring to the “powers declared in the Constitu&para;<br>tion,” Alexander Hamilton noted that “it is expressly to&para;<br>execute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author&para;<br>izes the national legislature to pass all necessary and&para;<br>proper laws.” The Federalist No. 33, at 245.

But in citing these&para;<br>cases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit&para;<br>between means and ends matters only if the end is in fact&para;<br>legitimate—i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment’s enumerated powers.&para;<br>By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference&para;<br>owed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti&para;<br>mate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch’s first step and&para;<br>fails carefully to examine whether the end served by §4248&para;<br>is actually one of those powers. See Part III–A–2, infra.&para;<br>b&para;<br>Second, instead of asking the simple question of what&para;<br>enumerated power §4248 “carr[ies] into Execution” at&para;<br>McCulloch’s first step, the Court surveys other laws Con&para;<br>gress has enacted and concludes that, because §4248 is&para;<br>related to those laws, the “links” between §4248 and an&para;<br>enumerated power are not “too attenuated”; hence, §4248&para;<br>is a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and Proper&para;<br>Clause authority.

Ante, at 2–4 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other&para;<br>arguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have&para;<br>been lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 61&para;<br>(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an “ ‘obvious, simple, and&para;<br>direct relation’ ” to an exercise of Congress’ enumerated powers and&para;<br>must not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).&para;<br>But I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the&para;<br>analysis employed at McCulloch’s second step, see McCulloch v. Mary&para;<br>land, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), while the Court’s decision today errs by&para;<br>skipping the first.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>power.&para;<br>The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed&para;<br>authority to “criminalize conduct” that interferes with&para;<br>enumerated powers; to “imprison individuals who engage&para;<br>in that conduct”; to “enact laws governing [those] prisons”;&para;<br>and to serve as a “custodian of its prisoners.” Ante, at 9,&para;<br>14. From this, the Court assumes that §4248 must also be&para;<br>a valid exercise of congressional power because it is “ ‘rea&para;<br>sonably adapted’ ” to those exercises of Congress’ inciden&para;<br>tal—and thus unenumerated—authorities. See ante, at 15&para;<br>(concluding that “§4248 is ‘reasonably adapted’ to Con&para;<br>gress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian”&para;<br>(citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that “the stat&para;<br>ute is a ‘necessary and proper’ means of exercising the&para;<br>federal authority that permits Congress to create federal&para;<br>criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola&para;<br>tors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to&para;<br>maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but&para;<br>who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth&para;<br>ers”). But that is not the question. The Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to&para;<br>enact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con&para;<br>gress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author&para;<br>ity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every&para;<br>federal statute “carr[ies] into Execution” one or more of&para;<br>the Federal Government’s enumerated powers.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 McCulloch&para;<br>&para;<br>makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18–&para;<br>19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress’&para;<br>enumerated power to establish post offices and post roads “has been&para;<br>inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,” and, “from this&para;<br>implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who&para;<br>steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417.&para;<br>Contrary to the Court’s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest&para;<br>that the relationship between Congress’ implied power to punish postal&para;<br>crimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to&para;<br>satisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,&para;<br>McCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress’&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes&para;<br>with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who&para;<br>engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and&para;<br>treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal&para;<br>sentence satisfy this test because each helps to “carr[y]&para;<br>into Execution” the enumerated powers that justify a&para;<br>criminal defendant’s arrest or conviction. For example,&para;<br>Congress’ enumerated power “[t]o establish Post Offices&para;<br>and post Roads,” Art.

Simi&para;<br>larly, that enumerated power would be compromised if&para;<br>there were no prisons to hold persons who violate those&para;<br>laws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that&para;<br>prisoners could escape or demand their release on the&para;<br>grounds that the conditions of their confinement violate&para;<br>their constitutional rights, at least as we have defined&para;<br>them.

In other words, the Court analogizes&para;<br>§4248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care&para;<br>for federal inmates while they serve sentences or await&para;<br>trial. But while those laws help to “carr[y] into Execution”&para;<br>the enumerated power that justifies the imposition of&para;<br>criminal sanctions on the inmate, §4248 does not bear that&para;<br>essential characteristic for three reasons.&para;<br>First, the statute’s definition of a “sexually dangerous&para;<br>person” contains no element relating to the subject’s&para;<br>crime. See §§4247(a)(5)–(6). It thus does not require a&para;<br>federal court to find any connection between the reasons&para;<br>supporting civil commitment and the enumerated power&para;<br>with which that person’s criminal conduct interfered.

That possibility is not merely hypothetical:&para;<br>The Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals&para;<br>against whom §4248 proceedings have been brought fit&para;<br>this description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23–25.&para;<br>Second, §4248 permits the term of federal civil commit&para;<br>ment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject “has en&para;<br>gaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child&para;<br>molestation,” §4247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established&para;<br>by a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the&para;<br>person committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>prisoner’s sentence expires or the date on which the stat&para;<br>ute of limitations on an untried defendant’s crime has run.&para;<br>The statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a&para;<br>person at a time when the Government would lack juris&para;<br>diction to detain him for violating a criminal law that&para;<br>executes an enumerated power.&para;<br>The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United&para;<br>States, 350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast.&para;<br>That statute authorized the Federal Government to exer&para;<br>cise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men&para;<br>tally unfit to stand trial only “ ‘until the accused shall be&para;<br>mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending&para;<br>charges against him are disposed of according to law.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §4246 (1952 ed.)).&para;<br>Thus, that statute’s “end” reasonably could be interpreted&para;<br>as preserving the Government’s power to enforce a crimi&para;<br>nal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),&para;<br>however, authorizes federal detention of a person even&para;<br>after the Government loses the authority to prosecute him&para;<br>for a federal crime.&para;<br>Third, the definition of a “sexually dangerous person”&para;<br>relevant to §4248 does not require the court to find that&para;<br>the person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer&para;<br>ated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment has no express power to regulate sexual violence&para;<br>generally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib&para;<br>ing such conduct in special circumstances. All of these&para;<br>statutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a&para;<br>connection to one of Congress’ enumerated powers—such&para;<br>as interstate commerce, e.g., §2252(a)(2)—or that limit the&para;<br>statute’s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has&para;<br>plenary authority, e.g., §2243(a). Section 4248, by con&para;<br>trast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that&para;<br>the person is “sexually dangerous,” and presents a risk “to&para;<br>others,” §4247(a)(5).

See, e.g., United States v.

That citation is puzzling&para;<br>because federal authority derives from the Constitution,&para;<br>not the common law. In any event, nothing in the Re&para;<br>statement suggests that a common-law custodian has the&para;<br>powers that Congress seeks here. While the Restatement&para;<br>provides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable&para;<br>steps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause&para;<br>“bodily harm to others,” 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts&para;<br>§319, p. 129 (1963–1964), that duty terminates once the&para;<br>legal basis for custody expires:&para;<br>“There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third&para;<br>person as to prevent him from causing physical harm&para;<br>to another unless&para;<br>“(a) a special relation exists between the actor and&para;<br>the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor&para;<br>to control the third person’s conduct, or&para;<br>“(b) a special relation exists between the actor and&para;<br>the other which gives to the other a right to protec&para;<br>tion.” Id., §315, at 122.&para;<br>Once the Federal Government’s criminal jurisdiction over&para;<br>a prisoner ends, so does any “special relation[ship]” be&para;<br>tween the Government and the former prisoner.12&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), but&para;<br>that case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,&para;<br>an inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his&para;<br>constitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his&para;<br>bed at the hospital infirmary. Id., at 310–311. In assessing that claim,&para;<br>this Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to “protect its&para;<br>residents” from the danger of violence. Id., at 320 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to “nearby&para;<br>(and other) communities.” Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a&para;<br>state institution.

A federal criminal defendant’s&para;<br>“sexually dangerous” propensities are not “created by” the&para;<br>fact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed&para;<br>eral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government&para;<br>has the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of&para;<br>punishing him for a federal crime—sex-related or other&para;<br>wise—does not provide the Government with the addi&para;<br>tional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that&para;<br>person.13&para;<br>2&para;<br>Second, the Court describes §4248 as a “modest” expan&para;<br>sion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi&para;<br>gree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice&para;<br>could serve as a substitute for its constitutionality—and&para;<br>the Court admits that it cannot, ibid.—the Court over&para;<br>states the relevant history.&para;<br>Congress’ first foray into this general area occurred in&para;<br>1855, when it established St. Elizabeth’s Hospital to pro&para;<br>vide treatment to “insane” persons in the military and the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>is complete. 18 U.

Contrary to the Government’s&para;<br>suggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals&para;<br>serving terms of “supervised release” does not derive from the Govern&para;<br>ment’s “relationship” with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,&para;<br>but from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus&para;<br>serves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant’s&para;<br>statute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at&para;<br>sentencing.&para;<br>13 The fact that Congress has the authority to “provide for the appre&para;<br>hension of escaped federal prisoners,” see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur&para;<br>ring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority&para;<br>derives from Congress’ power to vindicate the enumerated power with&para;<br>which the escaped defendant’s crime of conviction interfered, not a&para;<br>freestanding police power.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

First, the Court and both&para;<br>concurrences suggest that Congress must have had the&para;<br>power to enact §4248 because a long period of federal&para;<br>incarceration might “seve[r]” a sexually dangerous pris&para;<br>oner’s “claim to ‘legal residence’ ” in any particular State,&para;<br>ante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris&para;<br>oner without any “home State to take charge” of him upon&para;<br>release, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ing the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea&para;<br>sonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of&para;<br>United States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>see ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting&para;<br>that many federal prisoners, “as a result of lengthy federal&para;<br>incarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any&para;<br>State”). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As&para;<br>an initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional&para;<br>authority to “take charge” of a federal prisoner released&para;<br>within their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow&para;<br>ers not delegated to the Federal Government are “re&para;<br>served” to the States, and to the people). In addition, the&para;<br>assumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise&para;<br>that authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern&para;<br>ment stated at oral argument that its “default position” is&para;<br>to release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was&para;<br>convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR §2.33(b)&para;<br>(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue&para;<br>that a State has the power to refuse such a person domi&para;<br>cile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,&para;<br>in the absence of 18 U. S. C. §4248, a State would take no&para;<br>action when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger&para;<br>ous federal prisoner was about to be released within its&para;<br>jurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted&para;<br>in recent decades to protect communities from sex offend&para;<br>ers,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 As&para;<br>&para;<br>we have noted before, all 50 States have developed “some varia&para;<br>tion” of a system “for mandatory registration of sex offenders and&para;<br>corresponding community notification.” Smith v.

But even in the event a State made such a deci&para;<br>sion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that&para;<br>decision, and its consequences, to the state government&para;<br>alone.&para;<br>Next, the Court submits that §4248 does not upset the&para;<br>balance of federalism or invade the States’ reserved pow&para;<br>ers because it “requires accommodation of state interests”&para;<br>by instructing the Attorney General to release a commit&para;<br>ted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried&para;<br>if that State wishes to “ ‘assume . . . responsibility’ ” for&para;<br>him. Ante, at 17 (quoting §4248(d)). This right of first&para;<br>refusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (“It is&para;<br>not the usual course that the State does take responsibil&para;<br>ity”). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur&para;<br>ance that §4248 preserves the principle of dual sover&para;<br>eignty—the “letter and spirit” of the Constitution—as the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>§632.480 et seq.

Yet, I agree entirely with the&para;<br>Court that “ ‘it makes no difference whether one views the question at&para;<br>issue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to&para;<br>the Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti&para;<br>tution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the&para;<br>States under the Tenth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting New York v.&para;<br>United States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu&para;<br>tional because it does not “carr[y] into Execution” an enumerated&para;<br>power. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti&para;<br>tution reserves to the States and to the people.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

For once it is determined that Congress&para;<br>has the authority to provide for the civil detention of&para;<br>sexually dangerous persons, Congress “is acting within the&para;<br>powers granted it under the Constitution,” and “may&para;<br>impose its will on the States.” Gregory, 501 U.

Section 4248’s right of first refusal is&para;<br>thus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of&para;<br>legislative grace.&para;<br>Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that&para;<br>§4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not&para;<br>object to Congress retaining custody of “sexually danger&para;<br>ous persons” after their criminal sentences expire because&para;<br>the cost of detaining such persons is “expensive”—&para;<br>approximately $64,000 per year—and these States would&para;<br>rather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief&para;<br>for Kansas et al. 2; ibid. (“[S]ex offender civil commitment&para;<br>programs are expensive to operate”); id., at 4 (“these pro&para;<br>grams are expensive”); id., at 8 (“[T]here are very practical&para;<br>reasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex&para;<br>offender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason&para;<br>is the significant cost”).&para;<br>Congress’ power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;&para;<br>it does not expand merely to suit the States’ policy prefer&para;<br>ences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices&para;<br>regarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the&para;<br>Federal Government power over “certain enumerated&para;<br>objects only,” the Constitution “leaves to the several States&para;<br>a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other ob&para;<br>jects.” The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J. Madison). The&para;<br>purpose of this design is to preserve the “balance of power&para;<br>between the States and the Federal Government . . . [that]&para;<br>protect[s] our fundamental liberties.” Garcia v. San Anto&para;<br>nio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 572&para;<br>(1985) (Powell, J., dissenting); New York v.

The Federalist No. 17, at 169 (A.&para;<br>Hamilton). The Constitution gives States no more power&para;<br>to decline this responsibility than it gives them to infringe&para;<br>upon those liberties in the first instance. FTC v.
