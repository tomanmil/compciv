EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean&para;<br>Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide&para;<br>and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection&para;<br>Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking pe&para;<br>tition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor&para;<br>vehicles. In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under §111 of&para;<br>the Act, 42 U. S. C. §7411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions&para;<br>from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pur&para;<br>suant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to&para;<br>issuing a final rule by May 2012.&para;<br>The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated ef&para;<br>forts to regulate greenhouse gases. Two groups of plaintiffs, respon&para;<br>dents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court&para;<br>against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners&para;<br>here. One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York&para;<br>City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts. According to the&para;<br>complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide&para;<br>in the Nation. By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs as&para;<br>serted, the defendants’ emissions substantially and unreasonably in&para;<br>terfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of&para;<br>interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law. All plain&para;<br>tiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defen&para;<br>dant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually.&para;<br>The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticia&para;<br>ble political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed. On the&para;<br>threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred&para;<br>by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had ade&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>quately alleged Article III standing. On the merits, the court held&para;<br>that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the “federal common law&para;<br>of nuisance,” relying on this Court’s decisions holding that States&para;<br>may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by&para;<br>other States or by out-of-state industry, see, e.g., Illinois v. Milwau&para;<br>kee, 406 U. S. 91, 93 (Milwaukee I). The court further determined&para;<br>that the Clean Air Act did not “displace” federal common law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Second Circuit’s exercise of jurisdiction is affirmed by an&para;<br>equally divided Court. P. 6.&para;<br>2. The Clean Air Act and the EPA action the Act authorizes dis&para;<br>place any federal common-law right to seek abatement of carbon&para;<br>dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pp. 6–16.&para;<br>(a) Since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, recognized&para;<br>that there “is no federal general common law,” a new federal common&para;<br>law has emerged for subjects of national concern. When dealing&para;<br>“with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a&para;<br>federal common law.” Milwaukee I, 406 U. S., at 103. Decisions of&para;<br>this Court predating Erie, but compatible with the emerging distinc&para;<br>tion between general common law and the new federal common law,&para;<br>have approved federal common-law suits brought by one State to&para;<br>abate pollution emanating from another State. See, e.g., Missouri v.&para;<br>Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241–243. The plaintiffs contend that their&para;<br>right to maintain this suit follows from such cases. But recognition&para;<br>that a subject is meet for federal law governance does not necessarily&para;<br>mean that federal courts should create the controlling law. The&para;<br>Court need not address the question whether, absent the Clean Air&para;<br>Act and the EPA actions it authorizes, the plaintiffs could state a&para;<br>federal common-law claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emis&para;<br>sions because of their contribution to global warming. Any such&para;<br>claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA&para;<br>to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) “[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed&para;<br>by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an un&para;<br>usual exercise of law-making by federal courts disappears.” Milwau&para;<br>kee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 314 (Milwaukee II). Legislative dis&para;<br>placement of federal common law does not require the “same sort of&para;<br>evidence of a clear and manifest [congressional] purpose” demanded&para;<br>for preemption of state law. Id., at 317. Rather, the test is simply&para;<br>whether the statute “speak[s] directly to [the] question” at issue.&para;<br>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625. Here, Massa&para;<br>chusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air&para;<br>pollution subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. 549 U. S., at&para;<br>528–529. And it is equally plain that the Act “speaks directly” to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants’ plants. The Act di&para;<br>rects EPA to establish emissions standards for categories of station&para;<br>ary sources that, “in [the Administrator’s] judgment,” “caus[e], or&para;<br>contribut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be&para;<br>anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” §7411(b)(1)(A).&para;<br>Once EPA lists a category, it must establish performance standards&para;<br>for emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that&para;<br>category, §7411(b)(1)(B), and, most relevant here, must regulate ex&para;<br>isting sources within the same category, §7411(d). The Act also pro&para;<br>vides multiple avenues for enforcement. If EPA does not set emis&para;<br>sions limits for a particular pollutant or source of pollution, States&para;<br>and private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and&para;<br>EPA’s response will be reviewable in federal court. See §7607(b)(1).&para;<br>The Act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of&para;<br>carbon dioxide from domestic power plants—the same relief the&para;<br>plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law. There is no room for&para;<br>a parallel track. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(c) The Court rejects the plaintiffs’ argument, and the Second&para;<br>Circuit’s holding, that federal common law is not displaced until EPA&para;<br>actually exercises its regulatory authority by setting emissions stan&para;<br>dards for the defendants’ plants. The relevant question for displace&para;<br>ment purposes is “whether the field has been occupied, not whether it&para;<br>has been occupied in a particular manner.” Milwaukee II, 451 U. S.,&para;<br>at 324. The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the Legislature’s&para;<br>“considered judgment” concerning air pollution regulation because it&para;<br>permits emissions until EPA acts. The critical point is that Congress&para;<br>delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon&para;<br>dioxide emissions from power plants; the delegation displaces federal&para;<br>common law. If the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the&para;<br>outcome of EPA’s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse is to seek&para;<br>Court of Appeals review, and, ultimately, to petition for certiorari.&para;<br>The Act’s prescribed order of decisionmaking—first by the expert&para;<br>agency, and then by federal judges—is yet another reason to resist&para;<br>setting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.&para;<br>The appropriate amount of regulation in a particular greenhouse gas&para;<br>producing sector requires informed assessment of competing inter&para;<br>ests. The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to EPA in&para;<br>the first instance, in combination with state regulators. The expert&para;<br>agency is surely better equipped to do the job than federal judges,&para;<br>who lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an&para;<br>agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order. The plaintiffs’&para;<br>proposal to have federal judges determine, in the first instance, what&para;<br>amount of carbon-dioxide emissions is “unreasonable” and what level&para;<br>of reduction is necessary cannot be reconciled with Congress’ scheme.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v.

In light of the holding here that the&para;<br>Clean Air Act displaces federal common law, the availability vel non&para;<br>of a state lawsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the&para;<br>federal Act. Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or&para;<br>otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance&para;<br>law, the matter is left for consideration on remand.

POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>helps keep the Earth warm enough for life.” 74 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>66499 (2009).1 Massachusetts held that the Environ&para;<br>mental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread the Clean&para;<br>Air Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking&para;<br>controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor&para;<br>vehicles. 549 U. S., at 510–511. Greenhouse gases, we&para;<br>determined, qualify as “air pollutant[s]” within the mean&para;<br>ing of the governing Clean Air Act provision, id., at 528–&para;<br>529 (quoting §7602(g)); they are therefore within EPA’s&para;<br>regulatory ken. Because EPA had authority to set green&para;<br>house gas emission standards and had offered no “rea&para;<br>soned explanation” for failing to do so, we concluded that&para;<br>the agency had not acted “in accordance with law” when it&para;<br>denied the requested rulemaking. Id., at 534–535 (quot&para;<br>ing §7607(d)(9)(A)).&para;<br>Responding to our decision in Massachusetts, EPA un&para;<br>dertook greenhouse gas regulation. In December 2009,&para;<br>the agency concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from&para;<br>motor vehicles “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which&para;<br>may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health&para;<br>or welfare,” the Act’s regulatory trigger. §7521(a)(1); 74&para;<br>Fed.

The agency observed that “atmospheric&para;<br>greenhouse gas concentrations are now at elevated and&para;<br>essentially unprecedented levels,” almost entirely “due to&para;<br>anthropogenic emissions,” id., at 66517; mean global&para;<br>temperatures, the agency continued, demonstrate an&para;<br>“unambiguous warming trend over the last 100 years,”&para;<br>and particularly “over the past 30 years,” ibid. Acknowl&para;<br>edging that not all scientists agreed on the causes and&para;<br>consequences of the rise in global temperatures, id., at&para;<br>66506, 66518, 66523–66524, EPA concluded that “compel&para;<br>ling” evidence supported the “attribution of observed&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In addition to carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gases emitted&para;<br>by human activities include methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocar&para;<br>bons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 Fed.

Id., at 66524–&para;<br>66535.2&para;<br>EPA and the Department of Transportation subse&para;<br>quently issued a joint final rule regulating emissions from&para;<br>light-duty vehicles, see 75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (2010), and&para;<br>initiated a joint rulemaking covering medium- and heavy&para;<br>duty vehicles, see id., at 74152. EPA also began phasing&para;<br>in requirements that new or modified “[m]ajor [greenhouse&para;<br>gas] emitting facilities” use the “best available control&para;<br>technology.” §7475(a)(4); 75 Fed. Reg. 31520–31521. Fin&para;<br>ally, EPA commenced a rulemaking under §111 of the Act,&para;<br>42 U. S.

For this determination,&para;<br>the court relied dominantly on a series of this Court’s&para;<br>decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate&para;<br>air and water pollution produced by other States or by out&para;<br>of-state industry. Id., at 350–351; see, e.g., Illinois v.&para;<br>Milwaukee, 406 U.

In Mil&para;<br>waukee v. Illinois, 451 U.

That legislation installed an all&para;<br>encompassing regulatory program, supervised by an ex&para;<br>pert administrative agency, to deal comprehensively with&para;<br>interstate water pollution.

Milwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 310–311 (citing&para;<br>§1311).

Massachusetts made plain that emis&para;<br>sions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to&para;<br>regulation under the Act. 549 U. S., at 528–529. And we&para;<br>think it equally plain that the Act “speaks directly” to&para;<br>emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants’ plants.&para;<br>Section 111 of the Act directs the EPA Administrator to&para;<br>list “categories of stationary sources” that “in [her] judg&para;<br>ment . . . caus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pol&para;<br>lution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger&para;<br>public health or welfare.” §7411(b)(1)(A).

See&para;<br>County of Oneida, 470 U. S., at 237–239 (reach of remedial&para;<br>provisions is important to determination whether statute&para;<br>displaces federal common law). EPA may delegate im&para;<br>plementation and enforcement authority to the States,&para;<br>§7411(c)(1), (d)(1), but the agency retains the power to in&para;<br>spect and monitor regulated sources, to impose adminis&para;<br>trative penalties for noncompliance, and to commence civil&para;<br>actions against polluters in federal court. §§7411(c)(2),&para;<br>(d)(2), 7413, 7414. In specified circumstances, the Act im&para;<br>poses criminal penalties on any person who knowingly&para;<br>violates emissions standards issued under §7411. See&para;<br>§7413(c). And the Act provides for private enforcement. If&para;<br>States (or EPA) fail to enforce emissions limits against&para;<br>regulated sources, the Act permits “any person” to bring a&para;<br>civil enforcement action in federal court. §7604(a).&para;<br>If EPA does not set emissions limits for a particular pol&para;<br>lutant or source of pollution, States and private parties&para;<br>may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and EPA’s&para;<br>response will be reviewable in federal court.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§7607(b)(1); Massachusetts, 549 U.

As&para;<br>earlier noted, see supra, at 3, EPA is currently engaged in&para;<br>a §7411 rulemaking to set standards for greenhouse gas&para;<br>emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. To settle&para;<br>litigation brought under §7607(b) by a group that included&para;<br>the majority of the plaintiffs in this very case, the agency&para;<br>agreed to complete that rulemaking by May 2012. 75 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 82392. The Act itself thus provides a means to seek&para;<br>limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power&para;<br>plants—the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking&para;<br>federal common law. We see no room for a parallel track.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>The plaintiffs argue, as the Second Circuit held, that&para;<br>federal common law is not displaced until EPA actually&para;<br>exercises its regulatory authority, i.e., until it sets stan&para;<br>dards governing emissions from the defendants’ plants.&para;<br>We disagree.&para;<br>The sewage discharges at issue in Milwaukee II, we do&para;<br>not overlook, were subject to effluent limits set by EPA;&para;<br>under the displacing statute, “[e]very point source dis&para;<br>charge” of water pollution was “prohibited unless covered&para;<br>by a permit.” 451 U. S., at 318–320 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>As Milwaukee II made clear, however, the relevant ques&para;<br>tion for purposes of displacement is “whether the field&para;<br>has been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a&para;<br>particular manner.” Id., at 324. Of necessity, Congress se&para;<br>lects different regulatory regimes to address different&para;<br>problems. Congress could hardly preemptively prohibit&para;<br>every discharge of carbon dioxide unless covered by a&para;<br>permit. After all, we each emit carbon dioxide merely by&para;<br>breathing.&para;<br>The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the legisla&para;<br>ture’s “considered judgment” concerning the regulation of&para;<br>air pollution because it permits emissions until EPA&para;<br>acts. See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National&para;<br>Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 22, n. 32 (1981) (finding&para;<br>displacement although Congress “allowed some continued&para;<br>dumping of sludge” prior to a certain date). The critical&para;<br>point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision&para;<br>whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions&para;<br>from power plants; the delegation is what displaces federal&para;<br>common law. Indeed, were EPA to decline to regulate&para;<br>carbon-dioxide emissions altogether at the conclusion of its&para;<br>ongoing §7411 rulemaking, the federal courts would have&para;<br>no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance&para;<br>to upset the agency’s expert determination.&para;<br>EPA’s judgment, we hasten to add, would not escape&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>judicial review. Federal courts, we earlier observed, see&para;<br>supra, at 11, can review agency action (or a final rule&para;<br>declining to take action) to ensure compliance with the&para;<br>statute Congress enacted. As we have noted, see supra,&para;<br>at 10, the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish emissions standards for categories of stationary sources that,&para;<br>“in [the Administrator’s] judgment,” “caus[e], or contri&para;<br>but[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably&para;<br>be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”&para;<br>§7411(b)(1)(A). “[T]he use of the word ‘judgment,’ ” we&para;<br>explained in Massachusetts, “is not a roving license to&para;<br>ignore the statutory text.” 549 U. S., at 533. “It is but a&para;<br>direction to exercise discretion within defined statutory&para;<br>limits.” Ibid. EPA may not decline to regulate carbon&para;<br>dioxide emissions from power plants if refusal to act would&para;<br>be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other&para;<br>wise not in accordance with law.” §7607(d)(9)(A). If the&para;<br>plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome&para;<br>of EPA’s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse under&para;<br>federal law is to seek Court of Appeals review, and, ulti&para;<br>mately, to petition for certiorari in this Court.&para;<br>Indeed, this prescribed order of decisionmaking—the&para;<br>first decider under the Act is the expert administrative&para;<br>agency, the second, federal judges—is yet another reason&para;<br>to resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree&para;<br>under federal tort law. The appropriate amount of regula&para;<br>tion in any particular greenhouse gas-producing sector&para;<br>cannot be prescribed in a vacuum: as with other questions&para;<br>of national or international policy, informed assessment of&para;<br>competing interests is required. Along with the environ&para;<br>mental benefit potentially achievable, our Nation’s energy&para;<br>needs and the possibility of economic disruption must&para;<br>weigh in the balance.&para;<br>The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to&para;<br>EPA in the first instance, in combination with state regu&para;<br>lators.

And the agency may&para;<br>waive compliance with emission limits to permit a facility&para;<br>to test drive an “innovative technological system” that has&para;<br>“not [yet] been adequately demonstrated.” §7411(j)(1)(A).&para;<br>The Act envisions extensive cooperation between federal&para;<br>and state authorities, see §7401(a), (b), generally permit&para;<br>ting each State to take the first cut at determining how&para;<br>best to achieve EPA emissions standards within its do&para;<br>main, see §7411(c)(1), (d)(1)–(2).&para;<br>It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an ex&para;<br>pert agency, here, EPA, as best suited to serve as primary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. The expert&para;<br>agency is surely better equipped to do the job than indi&para;<br>vidual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case injunc&para;<br>tions. Federal judges lack the scientific, economic, and&para;<br>technological resources an agency can utilize in coping&para;<br>with issues of this order. See generally Chevron U. S. A.&para;<br>Inc. v.
