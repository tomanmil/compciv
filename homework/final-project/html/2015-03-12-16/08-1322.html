Argued February 22, 2010—Decided June 14, 2010&para;<br>Respondent Ratliff was Ruby Kills Ree’s attorney in Ree’s successful&para;<br>suit against the United States Social Security Administration for So­&para;<br>cial Security benefits. The District Court granted Ree’s unopposed&para;<br>motion for attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act&para;<br>(EAJA), which provides, inter alia, that “a court shall award to a pre­&para;<br>vailing party . . . fees and other expenses . . . in any civil action . . .&para;<br>brought by or against the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(1)(A).&para;<br>Before paying the fees award, the Government discovered that Ree&para;<br>owed the United States a debt that predated the award. Accordingly,&para;<br>it sought an administrative offset against the award under 31&para;<br>U. S. C. §3716, which subjects to offset all “funds payable by the&para;<br>United States,” §3701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delin­&para;<br>quent federal debts, see §3701(b), unless, e.g., payment is exempted&para;<br>by statute or regulation. See, e.g., §3716(e)(2). The parties to this&para;<br>case have not established that any such exemption applies to&para;<br>§2412(d) fees awards, which, as of 2005, are covered by the Treasury&para;<br>Department’s Offset Program (TOP). After the Government notified&para;<br>Ree that it would apply TOP to offset her fees award against a por­&para;<br>tion of her debt, Ratliff intervened, challenging the offset on the&para;<br>grounds that §2412(d) fees belong to a litigant’s attorney and thus&para;<br>may not be used to satisfy the litigant’s federal debts. The District&para;<br>Court held that because §2412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the&para;<br>“prevailing party,” not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to&para;<br>challenge the offset. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that under&para;<br>its precedent, EAJA attorney’s fees are awarded to prevailing parties’&para;<br>attorneys.&para;<br>Held: A §2412(d)(1)(A) attorney’s fees award is payable to the litigant&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. RATLIFF&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and is therefore subject to an offset to satisfy the litigant’s pre­&para;<br>existing debt to the Government. Pp. 3–11.&para;<br>(a) Nothing in EAJA contradicts this Court’s longstanding view&para;<br>that the term “prevailing party” in attorney’s fees statutes is a “term&para;<br>of art” that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buckhannon&para;<br>Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Hu&para;<br>man Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603. That the term has its usual&para;<br>meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is underscored by the fact that sub­&para;<br>section (d)(1)(B) and other provisions clearly distinguish the party&para;<br>who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who per­&para;<br>formed the work that generated the fees. The Court disagrees with&para;<br>Ratliff’s assertion that subsection (d)(1)(A)’s use of the verb “award”&para;<br>nonetheless renders §2412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing&para;<br>party’s attorney. The dictionaries show that, in the litigation context,&para;<br>the transitive verb “award” has the settled meaning of giving or as­&para;<br>signing by judicial decree. Its plain meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is&para;<br>thus that the court shall “give or assign by . . . judicial determina­&para;<br>tion” to the “prevailing party” (here, Ree) attorney’s fees in the&para;<br>amount sought and substantiated under, inter alia, subsection&para;<br>(d)(1)(B). That the prevailing party’s attorney may have a beneficial&para;<br>interest or a contractual right in the fees does not alter this conclu­&para;<br>sion. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) The Court rejects Ratliff’s argument that other EAJA provi­&para;<br>sions, combined with the Social Security Act (SSA) and the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attor­&para;<br>neys in Social Security cases, render §2412(d) at least ambiguous on&para;<br>the question presented here, and that these other provisions resolve&para;<br>the ambiguity in her favor. Even accepting that §2412(d) is ambigu­&para;<br>ous¸ the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter the&para;<br>Court’s conclusion. Subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions differ­&para;<br>entiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys&para;<br>on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the&para;<br>conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsec­&para;<br>tion (d)(1)(A) awards. Nor is the necessity of such payments estab­&para;<br>lished by the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies. That SSA fees&para;<br>awards are payable directly to a prevailing claimant’s attorney, see&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §406(b)(1)(A), undermines Ratliff’s case by showing that&para;<br>Congress knows how to create a direct fee requirement where it de­&para;<br>sires to do so. Given the stark contrast between the language of the&para;<br>SSA and EAJA provisions, the Court is reluctant to interpret subsec­&para;<br>tion (d)(1)(A) to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual&para;<br>evidence that such a requirement applies. Such evidence is not sup­&para;<br>plied by a 1985 EAJA amendment requiring that, “where the claim­&para;<br>ant’s attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S. C.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§406(b) and 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)], the . . . attorney [must] refun[d] to&para;<br>the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.” See note following&para;<br>§2412. Ratliff’s argument that this recognition that an attorney will&para;<br>sometimes “receiv[e]” §2412(d) fees suggests that subsection (d)(1)(A)&para;<br>should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to at­&para;<br>torneys that the SSA expressly authorizes gives more weight to “re­&para;<br>cei[pt]” than the term can bear: The ensuing reference to the attor­&para;<br>ney’s obligation to “refund” the smaller fee to the claimant&para;<br>demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first&para;<br>place. Moreover, Ratliff’s reading is irreconcilable with the textual&para;<br>differences between the two Acts. The fact that the Government, un­&para;<br>til 2006, frequently paid EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in&para;<br>SSA cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney&para;<br>her rights in the award does not alter the Court’s interpretation of&para;<br>the Act’s fees provision. That some such cases involved a prevailing&para;<br>party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising, given that it&para;<br>was not until 2005 that the TOP was modified to require offsets&para;<br>against attorney’s fees awards. And as Ratliff admits, the Govern­&para;<br>ment has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in&para;<br>cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has as­&para;<br>signed her right to fees to the attorney. Finally, the Court’s conclu­&para;<br>sion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1988, which contains language virtually identical to §2412(d)(1)(A)’s.&para;<br>See, e.g., Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717, 730−732, and n. 19.

S. C. §2412(d), provides in perti&para;<br>nent part that “a court shall award to a prevailing party&para;<br>. . . fees and other expenses . . . in any civil action . . .&para;<br>brought by or against the United States . . . unless the&para;<br>court finds that the position of the United States was&para;<br>substantially justified.” We consider whether an award of&para;<br>“fees and other expenses” to a “prevailing party” under&para;<br>§2412(d) is payable to the litigant or to his attorney. We&para;<br>hold that a §2412(d) fees award is payable to the litigant&para;<br>and is therefore subject to a Government offset to satisfy a&para;<br>pre-existing debt that the litigant owes the United States.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case arises out of proceedings in which a Social&para;<br>Security claimant, Ruby Willows Kills Ree, prevailed on a&para;<br>claim for benefits against the United States. Respondent&para;<br>Catherine Ratliff was Ree’s attorney in those proceedings.&para;<br>The District Court granted Ree’s unopposed motion for a&para;<br>§2412(d) fees award in the amount of $2,112.60. Before&para;<br>the United States paid the fees award, however, it discov&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. RATLIFF&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ered that Ree owed the Government a debt that predated&para;<br>the District Court’s approval of the award. Accordingly,&para;<br>the United States sought an administrative offset against&para;<br>the fees award to satisfy part of that debt.&para;<br>The Government’s authority to use administrative&para;<br>offsets is statutory. See 31 U. S. C. §§3711(a), 3716(a)&para;<br>(authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are&para;<br>unsuccessful to “collect the claim by administrative off&para;<br>set”).1 Congress has subjected to offset all “funds payable&para;<br>by the United States,” §3701(a)(1), to an individual who&para;<br>owes certain delinquent federal debts, see §3701(b),&para;<br>unless, as relevant here, payment is exempted by statute,&para;<br>see §3716(e)(2). No such exemption applies to attorney’s&para;<br>fees awards under 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(1)(A) (hereinafter&para;<br>subsection (d)(1)(A)), which are otherwise subject to offset,&para;<br>see 31 CFR §285.5(e)(1) (2009), and which, as of January&para;<br>2005, are covered by the Treasury Offset Program (TOP)&para;<br>operated by the Treasury Department’s Financial Man&para;<br>agement Service (FMS). See Brief for Petitioner 4 (ex&para;<br>plaining TOP’s extension to cover so-called “ ‘miscellane&para;<br>ous’ ” payments that include attorney’s fees payments&para;<br>the Treasury Department makes on behalf of federal&para;<br>agencies).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Section&para;<br>&para;<br>3701 defines an administrative offset as “withholding funds&para;<br>payable by the United States” to the debtor. §3701(a)(1). An agency&para;<br>may effect such an offset by cooperating with another agency to with&para;<br>hold such funds, or by notifying the Treasury Department of the debt so&para;<br>Treasury may include it in Treasury’s centralized offset program. See&para;<br>31 CFR §§285.5(d)(2), 901.3(b)(1), (c). Alternatively, the Treasury&para;<br>Department may attempt an administrative offset after receiving notice&para;<br>from a creditor agency that a legally enforceable nontax debt has&para;<br>become more than 180 days delinquent. See 31 U. S. C. §3716(c)(6); 31&para;<br>CFR §§285.5(d)(1), 901.3(b)(1).&para;<br>2 Respondent Ratliff argues for the first time in her merits brief be&para;<br>fore this Court that the 2005 amendments to the FMS regulations&para;<br>exempt the EAJA fees award in this case from administrative offset&para;<br>against Ree’s outstanding federal debt. See Brief for Respondent 8, 46&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In this case, the Government, relying on the TOP, noti&para;<br>fied Ree that the Government would apply her §2412(d)&para;<br>fees award to offset a portion of her outstanding federal&para;<br>debt. Ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the&para;<br>grounds that §2412(d) fees belong to a litigant’s attorney&para;<br>and thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a&para;<br>litigant’s federal debts. The District Court held that&para;<br>because §2412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the pre&para;<br>vailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing&para;<br>to challenge the Government’s proposed offset. See No.&para;<br>CIV. 06–5070–RHB, 2007 WL 6894710, *1 (D SD, May 10,&para;<br>2007).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.&para;<br>540 F. 3d 800 (2008). It held that under Circuit precedent,&para;<br>“EAJA attorneys’ fees are awarded to prevailing parties’&para;<br>attorneys.” Id., at 802. The Court of Appeals recognized&para;<br>that its decision did not accord with a “literal interpreta&para;<br>tion of the EAJA,” ibid., and exacerbated a split among the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals, compare id., at 801–802, with, e.g.,&para;<br>Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F. 3d 732, 733 (CA11 2008); Manning&para;<br>v. Astrue, 510 F. 3d 1246, 1249–1251 (CA10 2007); FDL&para;<br>Technologies, Inc. v.

We need not decide this question because&para;<br>Ratliff did not raise the regulations as a bar to offset in her brief in&para;<br>opposition to the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, see this&para;<br>Court’s Rule 15.2, or in the proceedings below.&para;<br>3 The split exists in the Social Security context because the Social&para;<br>Security Act (SSA), 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §301 et seq.,&para;<br>provides for payment of attorney’s fees awards directly to counsel, see&para;<br>§406(b)(1)(A), and until 2006 the Government in many cases treated&para;<br>fees awards under EAJA the same way, see Reply Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>13−14.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. RATLIFF &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>Subsection (d)(1)(A) directs that courts “shall award to a&para;<br>prevailing party . . . fees and other expenses . . . incurred&para;<br>by that party.” (Emphasis added.) We have long held that&para;<br>the term “prevailing party” in fee statutes is a “term of&para;<br>art” that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buck&para;<br>hannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of&para;<br>Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001).&para;<br>This treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award&para;<br>attorney’s fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the&para;<br>“ ‘American Rule’ ” that each litigant “bear [his] own attor&para;<br>ney’s fees.” Id., at 602 (citing Key Tronic Corp. v. United&para;<br>States, 511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994)). Nothing in EAJA sup&para;<br>ports a different reading. Cf. Arthur Andersen LLP v.&para;<br>Carlisle, 556 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2009) (slip op., at 6, n. 4)&para;<br>(where Congress employs “identical words and phrases&para;<br>within the same statute,” they are presumed to carry “the&para;<br>same meaning” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Indeed, other subsections within §2412(d) underscore that&para;<br>the term “prevailing party” in subsection (d)(1)(A) carries&para;<br>its usual and settled meaning—prevailing litigant. Those&para;<br>other subsections clearly distinguish the party who re&para;<br>ceives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who&para;<br>performed the work that generated the fees. See, e.g.,&para;<br>§2412(d)(1)(B) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(B)) (the “pre&para;<br>vailing party” must apply for the fees award and “sho[w]”&para;<br>that he “is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an&para;<br>award” by, among other things, submitting “an itemized&para;<br>statement from any attorney . . . representing or appearing&para;<br>in behalf of the party” that details the attorney’s hourly&para;<br>rate and time spent on the case (emphasis added)); see&para;<br>also Part III, infra.&para;<br>Ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection (d)(1)(A)’s&para;<br>use of the verb “award” renders §2412(d) fees payable&para;<br>directly to a prevailing party’s attorney and thus protects&para;<br>the fees from a Government offset against the prevailing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>party’s federal debts. See Brief for Respondent 11−19&para;<br>(arguing that subsection (d)(1)(A)’s use of the word&para;<br>“ ‘award’ ” “expressly incorporates a critical distinction”&para;<br>between the right to an “ ‘award’ ” of fees and the right to&para;<br>“ ‘receiv[e]’ ” the fees). We disagree.&para;<br>The transitive verb “ ‘award’ ” has a settled meaning in&para;<br>the litigation context: It means “[t]o give or assign by&para;<br>sentence or judicial determination.” Black’s Law Diction&para;<br>ary 125 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added); see also Web&para;<br>ster’s Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (“to&para;<br>give by judicial decree” (emphasis added)). The plain&para;<br>meaning of the word “award” in subsection (d)(1)(A) is&para;<br>thus that the court shall “give or assign by . . . judicial&para;<br>determination” to the “prevailing party” (here, Ratliff’s&para;<br>client Ree) attorney’s fees in the amount sought and sub&para;<br>stantiated under, inter alia, subsection (d)(1)(B).&para;<br>Ratliff’s contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny.&para;<br>According to Ratliff, subsection (d)(1)(B), which uses “the&para;<br>noun ‘award’ ” to mean a “ ‘decision,’ ” requires us to con&para;<br>strue subsection (d)(1)(A) (which uses “award” as a verb)&para;<br>to mean that “[o]nly the prevailing party may receive the&para;<br>award (the decision granting fees), but only the attorney&para;<br>who earned the fee (the payment asked or given for profes&para;<br>sional services) is entitled to receive it.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 16, 15 (emphasis in original; some internal quotation&para;<br>marks and footnote omitted). This argument ignores the&para;<br>settled definitions above, and even the definitions Ratliff&para;<br>proffers, because each makes clear that the verb “award”&para;<br>in subsection (d)(1)(A) means to “give by the decision of a&para;<br>law court” or to “grant . . . by judicial decree,” not simply to&para;<br>“give a decision” itself. Id., at 16, and n. 39 (emphasis&para;<br>added; internal quotation marks omitted). We thus agree&para;<br>with the Government that under the statutory language&para;<br>here, the “judicial decision is the means by which the court&para;<br>confers a right to payment upon the prevailing party; it is&para;<br>not itself the thing that the court gives (or orders the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. RATLIFF&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>defendant to give) to the party.” Reply Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>4 (emphasis in original) (citing Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S.&para;<br>755, 761 (1987) (explaining that “[i]n all civil litigation,&para;<br>the judicial decree is not the end but the means”)). This&para;<br>settled and natural construction of the operative statutory&para;<br>language is reflected in our cases. See, e.g., Scarborough&para;<br>v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 405 (2004) (“EAJA authorizes&para;<br>the payment of fees to a prevailing party” (emphasis&para;<br>added)).&para;<br>Ratliff’s final textual argument—that subsection&para;<br>(d)(1)(A)’s reference to “attorney’s fees” itself establishes&para;<br>that the fees are payable to the prevailing party’s attor&para;<br>ney, see Brief for Respondent 19−22—proves far too much.&para;<br>The fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party&para;<br>fees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest&para;<br>or a contractual right does not establish that the statute&para;<br>“awards” the fees directly to the attorney. For the reasons&para;<br>we have explained, the statute’s plain text does the oppo&para;<br>site—it “awards” the fees to the litigant, and thus subjects&para;<br>them to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has&para;<br>outstanding federal debts.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In an effort to avoid the Act’s plain meaning, Ratliff&para;<br>argues that other provisions of EAJA, combined with the&para;<br>SSA and the Government’s practice of paying some EAJA&para;<br>fees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases,&para;<br>render §2412(d) at least ambiguous on the question pre&para;<br>sented here, and that these other provisions resolve the&para;<br>ambiguity in her favor. Again we disagree. Even accept&para;<br>ing §2412(d) as ambiguous on the question presented, the&para;<br>provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter our&para;<br>conclusion that EAJA fees are payable to litigants and are&para;<br>thus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding&para;<br>federal debts.&para;<br>To begin with, §2412(d)(1)’s provisions differentiate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attor&para;<br>neys on par with other service providers, in a manner that&para;<br>forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to&para;<br>direct payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards. As noted&para;<br>above, subsection (d)(1)(B) requires the prevailing party to&para;<br>submit a fee application showing that she is otherwise&para;<br>“eligible to receive an award” and, as a complement to that&para;<br>requirement, compels the prevailing party to submit “an&para;<br>itemized statement from any attorney . . . representing or&para;<br>appearing in behalf of the party” that details the attorney’s&para;<br>hourly rate and time the attorney spent on the case.&para;<br>(Emphasis added.) This language would make little sense&para;<br>if, as Ratliff contends, §2412(d)’s “prevailing party” lan&para;<br>guage effectively refers to the prevailing litigant’s attor&para;<br>ney. Subsection (d)(1)(B) similarly makes clear that the&para;<br>“prevailing party” (not her attorney) is the recipient of the&para;<br>fees award by requiring the prevailing party to demon&para;<br>strate that her net worth falls within the range the statute&para;<br>requires for fees awards. And EAJA’s cost provision fur&para;<br>ther underscores the point. That provision uses language&para;<br>identical to that in the attorney’s fees provision to allow&para;<br>prevailing parties to recover “the reasonable expenses of&para;<br>expert witnesses” and “any study, analysis, engineering&para;<br>report, test, or project” necessary to prepare “the party’s&para;<br>case,” §2412(d)(2)(A), yet Ratliff does not argue that it&para;<br>makes costs payable directly to the vendors who provide&para;<br>the relevant services.&para;<br>Nor do the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies estab&para;<br>lish that subsection (d)(1)(A) fees awards are payable to&para;<br>prevailing parties’ attorneys. It is true that the SSA&para;<br>makes fees awards under that statute payable directly to a&para;<br>prevailing claimant’s attorney.&para;<br>See 42 U. S.

But the SSA’s express authorization of&para;<br>such payments undermines Ratliff’s case insofar as it&para;<br>shows that Congress knows how to make fees awards&para;<br>payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.&para;<br>Given the stark contrast between the SSA’s express au&para;<br>thorization of direct payments to attorneys and the ab&para;<br>sence of such language in subsection (d)(1)(A), we are&para;<br>reluctant to interpret the latter provision to contain a&para;<br>direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence sup&para;<br>porting such an interpretation.&para;<br>Ratliff contends that Congress’ 1985 amendments to&para;<br>§206(b) of EAJA supply just such evidence, at least in&para;<br>Social Security cases. See §3(2), 99 Stat. 186, note follow&para;<br>ing 28 U. S. C. §2412. The 1985 amendments address the&para;<br>fact that Social Security claimants may be eligible to&para;<br>receive fees awards under both the SSA and EAJA, and&para;<br>clarify the procedure that attorneys and their clients must&para;<br>follow to prevent the windfall of an unauthorized double&para;<br>recovery of fees for the same work. Section 206(b) pro&para;<br>vides that no violation of law occurs “if, where the claim&para;<br>ant’s attorney receives fees for the same work under both&para;<br>[42 U. S. C. §406(b) and 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)], the claim&para;<br>ant’s attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the&para;<br>smaller fee.” According to Ratliff, the fact that §206(b)&para;<br>recognizes, or at least assumes, that an attorney will&para;<br>sometimes “receiv[e]” fees under 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)&para;<br>suggests that we should construe subsection (d)(1)(A) to&para;<br>incorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that&para;<br>the SSA expressly authorizes.&para;<br>This argument gives more weight to §206(b)’s reference&para;<br>to attorney “recei[pt]” of fees than the reference can bear.&para;<br>Section 206(b)’s ensuing reference to the attorney’s obliga&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Thus, even accept&para;<br>ing Ratliff’s argument that subsection (d)(1)(A) is ambigu&para;<br>ous, the statutory provisions she cites resolve any ambigu&para;<br>ity in favor of treating subsection (d)(1)(A) awards as&para;<br>payable to the prevailing litigant, and thus subject to&para;<br>offset where the litigant has relevant federal debts.&para;<br>The Government’s history of paying EAJA awards di&para;<br>rectly to attorneys in certain cases does not compel a&para;<br>different conclusion. The Government concedes that until&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Ratliff&para;<br>&para;<br>argues that fees awarded under 42 U. S. C. §406(b) can never&para;<br>be “ ‘refund[ed]’ ” in this sense because SSA fees are “never paid initially&para;<br>to the client.” Brief for Respondent 14 (emphasis in original). That is&para;<br>not accurate. As we have explained, Social Security claimants and&para;<br>attorneys normally enter into contingent-fee agreements that are&para;<br>subject to judicial “review for reasonableness.” Gisbrecht v. Barnhart,&para;<br>535 U. S. 789, 809 (2002). Where the court allows a fee, §406(b) per&para;<br>mits the Commissioner to collect the approved fee out of the client’s&para;<br>benefit award and to certify the fee for “payment to such attorney out&para;<br>of” that award. §406(b)(1)(A). In such cases, the attorney would&para;<br>“refun[d]” the fee to the client in the event that the attorney also&para;<br>receives a (larger) EAJA award, because the attorney “receive[d]” the&para;<br>SSA fee from the client’s funds. Similarly inaccurate is Ratliff’s sugges&para;<br>tion that our construction of EAJA §206(b)’s reference to “refun[d]”&para;<br>would preclude attorneys from collecting any fees from a prevailing&para;<br>party until both SSA and EAJA payments are awarded. Our construc&para;<br>tion does not alter or preclude what we have recognized as courts’&para;<br>common practice of awarding EAJA fees at the time a court remands a&para;<br>case to the Social Security Administration (Administration) for benefits&para;<br>proceedings. Such awards often allow attorneys to collect EAJA fees&para;<br>months before any fees are awarded under 42 U. S.C §406(b), because&para;<br>§406(b) fees cannot be determined until the Administration enters a&para;<br>final benefits ruling. See Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U. S. 292, 295−302&para;<br>(1993).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. RATLIFF&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2006, it “frequently paid EAJA fees in Social Security&para;<br>cases directly to attorneys.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 13.&para;<br>But this fact does not alter our interpretation of subsec&para;<br>tion (d)(1)(A)’s “prevailing party” language or the Govern&para;<br>ment’s rights and obligations under the statute. As the&para;<br>Government explains, it most often paid EAJA fees di&para;<br>rectly to attorneys in cases in which the prevailing party&para;<br>had assigned its rights in the fees award to the attorney&para;<br>(which assignment would not be necessary if the statute&para;<br>rendered the fees award payable to the attorney in the&para;<br>first instance). The fact that some such cases involved a&para;<br>prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsur&para;<br>prising given that it was not until 2005 that the Treasury&para;<br>Department modified the TOP to require offsets against&para;<br>“miscellaneous” payments such as attorney’s fees awards.&para;<br>And as Ratliff admits, the Government has since contin&para;<br>ued the direct payment practice only in cases where “the&para;<br>plaintiff does not owe a debt to the government and as&para;<br>signs the right to receive the fees to the attorney.” Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 28 (boldface deleted). The Government’s&para;<br>decision to continue direct payments only in such cases is&para;<br>easily explained by the 2005 amendments to the TOP, and&para;<br>nothing about the Government’s past payment practices&para;<br>altered the statutory text that governs this case or es&para;<br>topped the Government from conforming its payment&para;<br>practices to the Treasury Department’s revised regula&para;<br>tions. For all of these reasons, neither EAJA nor the SSA&para;<br>supports Ratliff’s reading of subsection (d)(1)(A).&para;<br>Our cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C. §1988,&para;<br>which contains language virtually identical to the EAJA&para;<br>provision we address here,5 buttress this conclusion. Our&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Section&para;<br>&para;<br>1988(b) provides that in actions covered by the statute and&para;<br>subject to exceptions not relevant here, “the court, in its discretion, may&para;<br>allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable&para;<br>attorney’s fee.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 86&para;<br>(1990). But these cases emphasize the nonstatutory (con&para;<br>tractual and other assignment-based) rights that typically&para;<br>confer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of&para;<br>the fees award the statute confers on the prevailing liti&para;<br>gant. As noted above, these kinds of arrangements would&para;<br>be unnecessary if, as Ratliff contends, statutory fees lan&para;<br>guage like that in §1988(b) and EAJA provides attorneys&para;<br>with a statutory right to direct payment of awards. Hence&para;<br>our conclusion that “the party, rather than the lawyer,”&para;<br>id., at 87, is “entitle[d] to receive the fees” under §1988(b),&para;<br>id., at 88, and that the statute “controls what the losing&para;<br>defendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff&para;<br>must pay his lawyer,” id., at 90; see also Evans v.

S. C. §2412(d) is payable to the prevailing litigant&para;<br>rather than the attorney. The EAJA does not legally&para;<br>obligate the Government to pay a prevailing litigant’s&para;<br>attorney, and the litigant’s obligation to pay her attorney&para;<br>is controlled not by the EAJA but by contract and the law&para;<br>governing that contract. That conclusion, however, does&para;<br>not answer the question whether Congress intended the&para;<br>Government to deduct moneys from EAJA fee awards to&para;<br>offset a litigant’s pre-existing and unrelated debt, as the&para;<br>Treasury Department began to do only in 2005 pursuant&para;<br>to its authority under the Debt Collection Improvement&para;<br>Act of 1996 (DCIA). In my view, it is likely both that&para;<br>Congress did not consider that question and that, had it&para;<br>done so, it would not have wanted EAJA fee awards to be&para;<br>subject to offset. Because such offsets undercut the effec&para;<br>tiveness of the EAJA and cannot be justified by reference&para;<br>to the DCIA’s text or purpose, it seems probable that&para;<br>Congress would have made, and perhaps will in the future&para;<br>make, the opposite choice if clearly presented with it.&para;<br>In enacting the EAJA, Congress found “that certain&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v.

The point of an award of attorney’s fees, after&para;<br>all, is to enable a prevailing litigant to pay her attorney.&para;<br>See, e.g., Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.

First, the Government&para;<br>suggests that because EAJA fee awards are limited to&para;<br>those circumstances in which the Government’s position is&para;<br>not “substantially justified,” 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(1)(A), no&para;<br>lawyer can rely on an EAJA fee award when deciding to&para;<br>take a case, so the possibility of an offset eliminating the&para;<br>award will play no additional role in the lawyer’s deci&para;<br>sion.2 Reply Brief for Petitioner 16–17. But it is common&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In its brief, the Government downplays the frequency with which fee&para;<br>awards under the EAJA are made. At oral argument, respondent’s&para;<br>counsel represented that EAJA fee awards are made in 42% of Social&para;<br>Security cases in which the claimant prevails and in 70% of all vet&para;<br>eran’s benefits cases filed. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42–43. The Government did&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. RATLIFF&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>sense that increasing the risk that an attorney will not&para;<br>receive a fee award will inevitably decrease the willing&para;<br>ness of attorneys to undertake representation in these&para;<br>kinds of cases.&para;<br>Second, the Government contends that any disincentive&para;<br>the fear of administrative offset may create is mitigated in&para;<br>the Social Security context by the Social Security Act’s&para;<br>independent provision authorizing a fee award payable&para;<br>directly to the attorney. See id., at 17–18 (citing 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §406(b)(1)(A)). But as the Government acknowl&para;<br>edges, the “EAJA’s fee-shifting provisions are potentially&para;<br>more generous than [the Social Security Act’s] in at least&para;<br>three respects”: (1) A court may not award attorney’s fees&para;<br>under the Social Security Act, but may under the EAJA,&para;<br>when the claimant wins only a procedural victory and does&para;<br>not obtain any past-due benefits; (2) fees under the Social&para;<br>Security Act are limited to a percentage of benefits&para;<br>awarded, while EAJA fees are calculated under the lode&para;<br>star method by examining the attorney’s reasonable hours&para;<br>expended and her reasonable hourly rate; and (3) in con&para;<br>trast to the Social Security Act, fees may be awarded&para;<br>under the EAJA in addition to, rather than out of, the&para;<br>benefits awarded. Brief for Petitioner 6–7. EAJA awards&para;<br>thus provide an important additional incentive for attor&para;<br>neys to undertake Social Security cases.&para;<br>Finally, the Government argues that lawyers can easily&para;<br>determine at the outset whether a potential client owes&para;<br>the Government a debt and can then assist the client in&para;<br>establishing a written repayment plan that would prevent&para;<br>an offset. Reply Brief for Petitioner 18. At oral argument,&para;<br>however, the Government acknowledged that it was not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>not contest the number for Social Security cases but suggested that the&para;<br>percentage of veteran’s benefits cases resulting in EAJA awards is&para;<br>closer to 50% or 60%. Id., at 52. Under either estimate, these are&para;<br>hardly vanishing odds of success for an attorney deciding whether to&para;<br>take a client’s case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Helping a client establish a&para;<br>repayment plan would be a time-consuming endeavor&para;<br>uncompensated by any fee-shifting provision, and a client&para;<br>who needs such assistance is unlikely to have the funds to&para;<br>pay the attorney for that service.

NOSSCR Brief 25 (describing deterrent effect of offsets&para;<br>on representation).&para;<br>In the end, the Government has no compelling response&para;<br>to the fact that today’s decision will make it more difficult&para;<br>for the neediest litigants to find attorneys to represent&para;<br>them in cases against the Government. I “find it difficult&para;<br>to ascribe to Congress an intent to throw” an EAJA liti&para;<br>gant “a lifeline that it knew was a foot short. . . .

For more than two dec&para;<br>ades after the EAJA was enacted in 1980, the Commis&para;<br>sioner of Social Security “consistently paid” EAJA fee&para;<br>awards directly to the attorney, not the prevailing party.&para;<br>Stephens ex rel. R. E. v. Astrue, 565 F. 3d 131, 135 (CA4&para;<br>2009); see also Bryant v. Commissioner of Social Security,&para;<br>578 F. 3d 443, 446 (CA6 2009); cf. ante, at 3, n. 3, 9–10.&para;<br>“In fact, the Commissioner created a direct deposit system&para;<br>for attorneys and issued [Internal Revenue Service] 1099&para;<br>forms directly to the attorneys who received awards, not&para;<br>ing the awards as taxable attorney income.” Stephens, 565&para;<br>F. 3d, at 135. Not until 2005, when the Treasury Depart&para;<br>ment extended the offset program to cover “miscellaneous”&para;<br>federal payments, including “fees,” did the Commissioner&para;<br>cease paying EAJA fee awards directly to attorneys and&para;<br>adopt the position that the awards were appropriately&para;<br>considered the property of the prevailing party. Id., at 136&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bryant, 578&para;<br>F. 3d, at 446; ante, at 2, 10. Congress therefore had no&para;<br>reason to include a specific exemption of EAJA fee awards&para;<br>(in the Social Security context or otherwise) from the offset&para;<br>program when it enacted the DCIA in 1996.&para;<br>I am further reluctant to conclude that Congress would&para;<br>want EAJA fee awards to be offset for a prevailing liti&para;<br>gant’s unrelated debts because it is not likely to effectuate&para;<br>the DCIA’s purpose of “maximiz[ing] collections of delin&para;<br>quent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick&para;<br>action to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all ap&para;<br>propriate collection tools.” §31001(b)(1), 110 Stat. 1321–&para;<br>358.
