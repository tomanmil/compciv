FEDERAL &para;<br>&para;<br>COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1545. Argued January 16, 2013—Decided May 20, 2013*&para;<br>The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires state or local&para;<br>governments to act on siting applications for wireless facilities “within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.” 47&para;<br>U. S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(ii). Relying on its broad authority to implement&para;<br>the Communications Act, see 47 U. S. C. §201(b), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a Declaratory Ruling concluding that the phrase “reasonable period of time” is presumptively (but&para;<br>rebuttably) 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna&para;<br>on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications.&para;<br>The cities of Arlington and San Antonio, Texas, sought review of the&para;<br>Declaratory Ruling in the Fifth Circuit. They argued that the Commission lacked authority to interpret §332(c)(7)(B)’s limitations. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals, relying on Circuit precedent holding that Chevron&para;<br>U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.&para;<br>837, applies to an agency’s interpretation of its own statutory jurisdiction, applied Chevron to that question. Finding the statute ambiguous, it upheld as a permissible construction of the statute the&para;<br>FCC’s view that §201(b)’s broad grant of regulatory authority empowered it to administer §332(c)(7)(B).&para;<br>Held: Courts must apply the Chevron framework to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the&para;<br>agency’s statutory authority (i.e., its jurisdiction). Pp. 4–17.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 11–1547, Cable, Telecommunications, and Technology Committee of New Orleans City Council v. Federal Communications Commission, also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) Under Chevron, a reviewing court must first ask whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue; if so, the&para;<br>court must give effect to Congress’ unambiguously expressed intent.&para;<br>467 U. S., at 842–843. However, if “the statute is silent or ambiguous,” the court must defer to the administering agency’s construction&para;<br>of the statute so long as it is permissible. Id., at 843. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) When a court reviews an agency’s interpretation of a statute it&para;<br>administers, the question is always, simply, whether the agency has&para;<br>stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority. There is no distinction between an agency’s “jurisdictional” and “nonjurisdictional”&para;<br>interpretations. The “jurisdictional-nonjurisdictional” line is meaningful in the judicial context because Congress has the power to tell&para;<br>the courts what classes of cases they may decide—that is, to define&para;<br>their jurisdiction—but not to prescribe how they decide those cases.&para;<br>But for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes,&para;<br>both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than&para;<br>when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.&para;<br>Because the question is always whether the agency has gone beyond&para;<br>what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for&para;<br>carving out an arbitrary subset of “jurisdictional” questions from the&para;<br>Chevron framework. See, e.g., National Cable &amp; Telecommunications&para;<br>Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S. 327, 333, 339. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(c) This Court has consistently afforded Chevron deference to agencies’ constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833;&para;<br>United States v. Eurodif S. A., 555 U. S. 305, 316. Chevron applies to&para;<br>statutes designed to curtail the scope of agency discretion, see Chemical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 470 U. S.&para;<br>116, 123, and even where concerns about agency self-aggrandizement&para;<br>are at their apogee—i.e., where an agency’s expansive construction of&para;<br>the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental&para;<br>change in the regulatory scheme, see FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson&para;<br>Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(d) The contention that Chevron deference is not appropriate here&para;<br>because the FCC asserted jurisdiction over matters of traditional&para;<br>state and local concern is meritless. These cases have nothing to do&para;<br>with federalism: The statute explicitly supplants state authority, so&para;<br>the question is simply whether a federal agency or federal courts will&para;<br>draw the lines to which the States must hew. P. 14.&para;<br>(e) United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, requires that, for&para;<br>Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the&para;<br>particular manner adopted. But Mead denied Chevron deference to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>action, by an agency with rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking. There is no case in which a general conferral of rulemaking&para;<br>or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support Chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency’s&para;<br>substantive field. A general conferral of rulemaking authority validates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering. It suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference&para;<br>under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously&para;<br>vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.

FCC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nas must be approved by local zoning authorities. In the&para;<br>Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress “impose[d]&para;<br>specific limitations on the traditional authority of state&para;<br>and local governments to regulate the location, construction, and modification of such facilities,” Rancho Palos&para;<br>Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, 115 (2005), and incorporated those limitations into the Communications Act of&para;<br>1934, see 110 Stat. 56, 151. Section 201(b) of that Act&para;<br>empowers the Federal Communications Commission to&para;<br>“prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary&para;<br>in the public interest to carry out [its] provisions.” Ch.&para;<br>296, 52 Stat. 588, codified at 47 U. S. C. §201(b). Of&para;<br>course, that rulemaking authority extends to the subsequently added portions of the Act. See AT&amp;T Corp. v.&para;<br>Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 377–378 (1999).&para;<br>The Act imposes five substantive limitations, which are&para;<br>codified in 47 U. S. C. §332(c)(7)(B); only one of them,&para;<br>§332(c)(7)(B)(ii), is at issue here. That provision requires&para;<br>state or local governments to act on wireless siting applications “within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.” Two other features of §332(c)(7) are&para;<br>relevant. First, subparagraph (A), known as the “saving&para;<br>clause,” provides that nothing in the Act, except those&para;<br>limitations provided in §332(c)(7)(B), “shall limit or affect&para;<br>the authority of a State or local government” over siting&para;<br>decisions. Second, §332(c)(7)(B)(v) authorizes a person&para;<br>who believes a state or local government’s wireless-siting&para;<br>decision to be inconsistent with any of the limitations in&para;<br>§332(c)(7)(B) to “commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.”&para;<br>In theory, §332(c)(7)(B)(ii) requires state and local&para;<br>zoning authorities to take prompt action on siting applications for wireless facilities. But in practice, wireless providers often faced long delays. In July 2008, CTIA—The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Wireless Association,1 which represents wireless service&para;<br>providers, petitioned the FCC to clarify the meaning of&para;<br>§332(c)(7)(B)(ii)’s requirement that zoning authorities act&para;<br>on siting requests “within a reasonable period of time.” In&para;<br>November 2009, the Commission, relying on its broad&para;<br>statutory authority to implement the provisions of the&para;<br>Communications Act, issued a declaratory ruling responding to CTIA’s petition. In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994, 14001. The Commission found&para;<br>that the “record evidence demonstrates that unreasonable&para;<br>delays in the personal wireless service facility siting&para;<br>process have obstructed the provision of wireless services”&para;<br>and that such delays “impede the promotion of advanced services and competition that Congress deemed&para;<br>critical in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.” Id., at&para;<br>14006, 14008.&para;<br>A “reasonable period of time” under&para;<br>§332(c)(7)(B)(ii), the Commission determined, is presumptively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process a collocation&para;<br>application (that is, an application to place a new antenna&para;<br>on an existing tower) and 150 days to process all other&para;<br>applications. Id., at 14005.&para;<br>Some state and local governments opposed adoption of&para;<br>the Declaratory Ruling on the ground that the Commission lacked “authority to interpret ambiguous provisions of&para;<br>Section 332(c)(7).” Id., at 14000. Specifically, they argued&para;<br>that the saving clause, §332(c)(7)(A), and the judicial&para;<br>review provision, §337(c)(7)(B)(v), together display a congressional intent to withhold from the Commission authority to interpret the limitations in §332(c)(7)(B).

FCC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ruling in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.&para;<br>Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals held&para;<br>that the Chevron framework applied to the threshold&para;<br>question whether the FCC possessed statutory authority&para;<br>to adopt the 90- and 150-day timeframes. 668 F. 3d 229,&para;<br>248 (CA5 2012) (citing Texas v. United States, 497 F. 3d&para;<br>491, 501 (CA5 2007)). Applying Chevron, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals found “§332(c)(7)(A)’s effect on the FCC’s authority to administer §332(c)(7)(B)’s limitations ambiguous,”&para;<br>668 F. 3d, at 250, and held that “the FCC’s interpretation&para;<br>of its statutory authority” was a permissible construction&para;<br>of the statute. Id., at 254. On the merits, the court upheld&para;<br>the presumptive 90- and 150-day deadlines as a “permissible construction of §332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) . . . entitled to&para;<br>Chevron deference.” Id., at 256.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), limited to&para;<br>the first question presented: “Whether . . . a court should&para;<br>apply Chevron to . . . an agency’s determination of its own&para;<br>jurisdiction.” Pet. for Cert. in No. 11–1545, p. i.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>As this case turns on the scope of the doctrine enshrined&para;<br>in Chevron, we begin with a description of that case’s nowcanonical formulation. “When a court reviews an agency’s&para;<br>construction of the statute which it administers, it is&para;<br>confronted with two questions.” 467 U. S., at 842. First,&para;<br>applying the ordinary tools of statutory construction, the&para;<br>court must determine “whether Congress has directly&para;<br>spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of&para;<br>Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the&para;<br>court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id., at 842–843.&para;<br>But “if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to&para;<br>the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the&para;<br>agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the statute.” Id., at 843.&para;<br>Chevron is rooted in a background presumption of congressional intent: namely, “that Congress, when it left&para;<br>ambiguity in a statute” administered by an agency, “understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and&para;<br>foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather&para;<br>than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion&para;<br>the ambiguity allows.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),&para;<br>N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740–741 (1996). Chevron thus provides a stable background rule against which Congress&para;<br>can legislate: Statutory ambiguities will be resolved,&para;<br>within the bounds of reasonable interpretation, not by the&para;<br>courts but by the administering agency. See Iowa Utilities&para;<br>Bd., 525 U. S., at 397. Congress knows to speak in plain&para;<br>terms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capacious&para;<br>terms when it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The question here is whether a court must defer under&para;<br>Chevron to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency’s statutory&para;<br>authority (that is, its jurisdiction). The argument against&para;<br>deference rests on the premise that there exist two distinct&para;<br>classes of agency interpretations: Some interpretations—&para;<br>the big, important ones, presumably—define the agency’s&para;<br>“jurisdiction.” Others—humdrum, run-of-the-mill stuff—&para;<br>are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly&para;<br>has. That premise is false, because the distinction between “jurisdictional” and “nonjurisdictional” interpretations is a mirage. No matter how it is framed, the question&para;<br>a court faces when confronted with an agency’s interpretation of a statute it administers is always, simply,&para;<br>whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its&para;<br>statutory authority.&para;<br>The misconception that there are, for Chevron purposes,&para;<br>separate “jurisdictional” questions on which no deference&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>is due derives, perhaps, from a reflexive extension to agencies of the very real division between the jurisdictional&para;<br>and nonjurisdictional that is applicable to courts. In the&para;<br>judicial context, there is a meaningful line: Whether the&para;<br>court decided correctly is a question that has different&para;<br>consequences from the question whether it had the power&para;<br>to decide at all. Congress has the power (within limits) to&para;<br>tell the courts what classes of cases they may decide, see&para;<br>Trainmen v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. Co., 321 U. S. 50, 63–64&para;<br>(1944); Lauf v. E. G. Shinner &amp; Co., 303 U. S. 323, 330&para;<br>(1938), but not to prescribe or superintend how they decide&para;<br>those cases, see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.&para;<br>211, 218–219 (1995). A court’s power to decide a case is&para;<br>independent of whether its decision is correct, which is&para;<br>why even an erroneous judgment is entitled to res judicata&para;<br>effect. Put differently, a jurisdictionally proper but substantively incorrect judicial decision is not ultra vires.&para;<br>That is not so for agencies charged with administering&para;<br>congressional statutes. Both their power to act and how&para;<br>they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress,&para;<br>so that when they act improperly, no less than when they&para;<br>act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.&para;<br>Because the question—whether framed as an incorrect&para;<br>application of agency authority or an assertion of authority not conferred—is always whether the agency has gone&para;<br>beyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no&para;<br>principled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of&para;<br>such claims as “jurisdictional.”&para;<br>An example will illustrate just how illusory the proposed line between “jurisdictional” and “nonjurisdictional”&para;<br>agency interpretations is. Imagine the following validlyenacted statute:&para;<br>COMMON CARRIER ACT&para;<br>SECTION 1. The Agency shall have jurisdiction to prohibit any common carrier from imposing an unreason-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>able condition upon access to its facilities.&para;<br>There is no question that this provision—including the&para;<br>terms “common carrier” and “unreasonable condition”—&para;<br>defines the Agency’s jurisdiction. Surely, the argument&para;<br>goes, a court must determine de novo the scope of that&para;<br>jurisdiction.&para;<br>Consider, however, this alternative formulation of the&para;<br>statute:&para;<br>COMMON CARRIER ACT&para;<br>SECTION 1. No common carrier shall impose an unreasonable condition upon access to its facilities.&para;<br>SECTION 2. The Agency may prescribe rules and regulations necessary in the public interest to effectuate&para;<br>Section 1 of this Act.&para;<br>Now imagine that the Agency, invoking its Section 2&para;<br>authority, promulgates this Rule: “(1) The term ‘common&para;<br>carrier’ in Section 1 includes Internet Service Providers.&para;<br>(2) The term ‘unreasonable condition’ in Section 1 includes&para;<br>unreasonably high prices. (3) A monthly fee greater than&para;<br>$25 is an unreasonable condition on access to Internet&para;<br>service.” By this Rule, the Agency has claimed for itself&para;<br>jurisdiction that is doubly questionable: Does its authority&para;<br>extend to Internet Service Providers? And does it extend&para;<br>to setting prices? Yet Section 2 makes clear that Congress, in petitioners’ words, “conferred interpretive power&para;<br>on the agency” with respect to Section 1. Brief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p. 14. Even under petitioners’ theory,&para;<br>then, a court should defer to the Agency’s interpretation of&para;<br>the terms “common carrier” and “unreasonable condition”—that is to say, its assertion that its “jurisdiction”&para;<br>extends to regulating Internet Service Providers and&para;<br>setting prices.&para;<br>In the first case, by contrast, petitioners’ theory would&para;<br>accord the agency no deference. The trouble with this is&para;<br>that in both cases, the underlying question is exactly the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>same: Does the statute give the agency authority to regulate Internet Service Providers and cap prices, or not?2&para;<br>The reality, laid bare, is that there is no difference, insofar&para;<br>as the validity of agency action is concerned, between an&para;<br>agency’s exceeding the scope of its authority (its “jurisdiction”) and its exceeding authorized application of authority&para;<br>that it unquestionably has. “To exceed authorized application is to exceed authority. Virtually any administrative&para;<br>action can be characterized as either the one or the other,&para;<br>depending on how generally one wishes to describe the&para;<br>‘authority.’ ” Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi&para;<br>ex rel. Moore, 487 U. S. 354, 381 (1988) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); see also Monaghan, Marbury and&para;<br>the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 29 (1983)&para;<br>(“Administrative application of law is administrative&para;<br>formulation of law whenever it involves elaboration of the&para;<br>statutory norm.”).&para;<br>This point is nicely illustrated by our decision in National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf&para;<br>Power Co., 534 U. S. 327 (2002). That case considered&para;<br>whether the FCC’s “jurisdiction” to regulate the rents&para;<br>utility-pole owners charge for “pole attachments” (defined&para;<br>as attachments by a cable television system or provider of&para;<br>telecommunications service) extended to attachments that&para;<br>provided both cable television and high-speed Internet&para;<br>access (attachments for so-called “commingled services”).&para;<br>Id., at 331–336. We held, sensibly, that Chevron applied.&para;<br>534 U. S., at 333, 339. Whether framed as going to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent’s non-answer to this example reveals the hollowness of&para;<br>its theory. It “might,” the dissent claims, be “harder” to interpret the&para;<br>first Act, because it is (somehow) less “clear” than the second Act. Post,&para;<br>at 15–16 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). That it is even possible that the&para;<br>two could come out differently under the dissent’s test (whatever it is)&para;<br>shows that that test must be wrong.

One of&para;<br>the briefs in support of petitioners explains, helpfully, that&para;<br>“[j]urisdictional questions concern the who, what, where,&para;<br>and when of regulatory power: which subject matters may&para;<br>an agency regulate and under what conditions.” Brief for&para;<br>IMLA Respondents 18–19. But an agency’s application of&para;<br>its authority pursuant to statutory text answers the same&para;<br>questions. Who is an “outside salesman”? What is a “pole&para;<br>attachment”? Where do the “waters of the United States”&para;<br>end? When must a Medicare provider challenge a reimbursement determination in order to be entitled to an&para;<br>administrative appeal? These can all be reframed as questions about the scope of agencies’ regulatory jurisdiction—&para;<br>and they are all questions to which the Chevron&para;<br>framework applies. See Christopher v.

One of our opinions explicitly says that no&para;<br>“exception exists to the normal [deferential] standard of&para;<br>review” for “ ‘jurisdictional or legal question[s] concerning&para;<br>the coverage’ ” of an Act. NLRB v. City Disposal Systems,&para;<br>Inc., 465 U. S. 822, 830, n. 7 (1984). A prime example of&para;<br>deferential review for questions of jurisdiction is Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833&para;<br>(1986). That case involved a CFTC interpretation of 7&para;<br>U. S. C. §18(c), which provides that before the Commission&para;<br>takes action on a complaint, the complainant must file a&para;<br>bond to cover “any reparation award that may be issued by&para;<br>the Commission against the complainant on any counterclaim by respondent.” (Emphasis added.) The CFTC,&para;<br>pursuant to its broad rulemaking authority, see §12a(5),&para;<br>interpreted that oblique reference to counterclaims as&para;<br>granting it “the power to take jurisdiction over” not just&para;<br>federal-law counterclaims, but state-law counterclaims as&para;<br>well. Schor, supra, at 844. We not only deferred under&para;<br>Chevron to the Commission’s “eminently reasonable . . .&para;<br>interpretation of the statute it is entrusted to administer,”&para;<br>but also chided the Court of Appeals for declining to afford deference because of the putatively “ ‘statutory interpretationjurisdictional’ nature of the question at issue.” 478 U.

We held that we had no need to “defer to the Secretary of&para;<br>Labor’s view of the scope of” that private right of action “because&para;<br>Congress has expressly established the Judiciary and not the Department of Labor as the adjudicator of private rights of action arising&para;<br>under the statute.” Ibid. Adams Fruit stands for the modest proposition that the Judiciary, not any executive agency, determines “the&para;<br>scope”—including the available remedies—“of judicial power vested by”&para;<br>statutes establishing private rights of action.

FCC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Our cases hold that Chevron applies equally to statutes&para;<br>designed to curtail the scope of agency discretion. For&para;<br>instance, in Chemical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 470 U. S. 116, 123 (1985), we considered a statute prohibiting the Environmental Protection Agency from “modify[ing] any requirement of this&para;<br>section as it applies to any specific pollutant which is on&para;<br>the toxic pollutant list.” The EPA construed the statute as&para;<br>not precluding it from granting variances with respect to&para;<br>certain toxic pollutants. Finding no “clear congressional&para;<br>intent to forbid EPA’s sensible variance mechanism,” id.,&para;<br>at 134, we deferred to the EPA’s construction of this express limitation on its own regulatory authority, id., at&para;<br>125 (citing Chevron, 467 U.

Reports are shot through with applications of&para;<br>Chevron to agencies’ constructions of the scope of their&para;<br>own jurisdiction. And we have applied Chevron where&para;<br>concerns about agency self-aggrandizement are at their&para;<br>apogee: in cases where an agency’s expansive construction&para;<br>of the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental change in the regulatory scheme. In FDA v.&para;<br>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120 (2000),&para;<br>the threshold question was the “appropriate framework for&para;<br>analyzing” the FDA’s assertion of “jurisdiction to regulate&para;<br>tobacco products,” id., at 126, 132—a question of vast&para;<br>“economic and political magnitude,” id., at 133. “Because&para;<br>this case involves an administrative agency’s construction&para;<br>——————&para;<br>case expressly lists the Communications Act as an example of a statute&para;<br>under which an agency’s “authority is clear because the statute gives&para;<br>an agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute.” 546&para;<br>U.

The question whether Congress has delegated to an agency the authority to provide&para;<br>an interpretation that carries the force of law is for the&para;<br>judge to answer independently. The judge, considering&para;<br>“traditional tools of statutory construction,” CardozaFonseca, supra, at 446, will ask whether Congress has&para;<br>spoken unambiguously. If so, the text controls. If not, the&para;<br>judge will ask whether Congress would have intended the&para;<br>agency to resolve the resulting ambiguity. If so, deference&para;<br>is warranted. See Mead, supra, at 229. Even if not, however, sometimes an agency interpretation, in light of the&para;<br>agency’s special expertise, will still have the “power to&para;<br>persuade, if lacking power to control,” Skidmore v. Swift &amp;&para;<br>Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).&para;<br>The case before us offers an example. The relevant&para;<br>statutory provision requires state or local governments to&para;<br>act on wireless siting applications “within a reasonable&para;<br>period of time after” a wireless service provider files such&para;<br>a request. 47 U. S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) argued that this provision granted it a degree of leeway in determining the&para;<br>amount of time that is reasonable. Many factors favor the&para;<br>agency’s view: (1) the language of the Telecommunications&para;<br>Act grants the FCC broad authority (including rulemaking&para;<br>authority) to administer the Act; (2) the words are openended—i.e. “ambiguous”; (3) the provision concerns an&para;<br>interstitial administrative matter, in respect to which the&para;<br>agency’s expertise could have an important role to play;&para;<br>and (4) the matter, in context, is complex, likely making&para;<br>the agency’s expertise useful in helping to answer the “reasonableness” question that the statute poses. See §151&para;<br>(creating the FCC); §201(b) (providing rulemaking authority); National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v.&para;<br>Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.

First, a nearby&para;<br>saving clause says: “Except as provided in this paragraph,&para;<br>nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority&para;<br>of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof&para;<br>over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and&para;<br>modification of personal wireless service facilities.”&para;<br>§332(c)(7)(A). Second, a judicial review provision, says:&para;<br>“Any person adversely affected by any final action or&para;<br>failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure&para;<br>to act, commence an action in any court of competent&para;<br>jurisdiction.” §332(c)(7)(B)(v).&para;<br>In my view, however, these two provisions cannot provide good reason for reaching the conclusion advocated by&para;<br>petitioners. The first provision begins with an exception,&para;<br>stating that it does not apply to (among other things) the&para;<br>“reasonableness” provision here at issue. The second simply sets forth a procedure for judicial review, a review&para;<br>that applies to most government actions.

FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).&para;<br>Although modern administrative agencies fit most comfortably within the Executive Branch, as a practical matter&para;<br>they exercise legislative power, by promulgating regulations with the force of law; executive power, by policing&para;<br>compliance with those regulations; and judicial power, by&para;<br>adjudicating enforcement actions and imposing sanctions&para;<br>on those found to have violated their rules. The accumulation of these powers in the same hands is not an occasional&para;<br>or isolated exception to the constitutional plan; it is a&para;<br>central feature of modern American government.&para;<br>The administrative state “wields vast power and touches&para;<br>almost every aspect of daily life.” Free Enterprise Fund v.&para;<br>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). The Framers could hardly have&para;<br>envisioned today’s “vast and varied federal bureaucracy”&para;<br>and the authority administrative agencies now hold over&para;<br>our economic, social, and political activities.

And the federal bureaucracy continues to grow; in the last 15 years, Congress has launched&para;<br>more than 50 new agencies. Compare Office of the Federal&para;<br>Register, United States Government Manual 1997/1998,&para;<br>with Office of the Federal Register, United States Government Manual 2012.

As&para;<br>scholars have noted, “no President (or his executive office&para;<br>staff) could, and presumably none would wish to, supervise so broad a swath of regulatory activity.” Kagan,&para;<br>Presidential Administration, 114 Harv.

President Truman&para;<br>colorfully described his power over the administrative&para;<br>state by complaining, “I thought I was the president, but&para;<br>when it comes to these bureaucrats, I can’t do a damn&para;<br>thing.” See R. Nathan, The Administrative Presidency 2&para;<br>(1986). President Kennedy once told a constituent, “I&para;<br>agree with you, but I don’t know if the government will.”&para;<br>See id., at 1. The collection of agencies housed outside the&para;<br>traditional executive departments, including the Federal&para;<br>Communications Commission, is routinely described as&para;<br>the “headless fourth branch of government,” reflecting not&para;<br>only the scope of their authority but their practical independence. See, e.g., Administrative Conference of United&para;<br>States, D. Lewis &amp; J. Selin, Sourcebook of United States&para;<br>Executive Agencies 11 (2012).&para;<br>As for judicial oversight, agencies enjoy broad power to&para;<br>construe statutory provisions over which they have been&para;<br>given interpretive authority. In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.&para;<br>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., we established a&para;<br>test for reviewing “an agency’s construction of the statute&para;<br>which it administers.” 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). If Congress has “directly spoken to the precise question at issue,”&para;<br>we said, “that is the end of the matter.” Ibid. A contrary&para;<br>agency interpretation must give way. But if Congress has&para;<br>not expressed a specific intent, a court is bound to defer to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

L. Rev. 1263, 1311 (1962). By design or default,&para;<br>Congress often fails to speak to “the precise question”&para;<br>before an agency.

EPA, 566 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip&para;<br>op., at 9–10) (rejecting agency argument that would “enable the strong-arming of regulated parties into ‘voluntary&para;<br>compliance’ without the opportunity for judicial review”).&para;<br>What the Court says in footnote 4 of its opinion is good,&para;<br>and true (except of course for the “dissent overstates”&para;<br>part). Ante, at 13–14, n. 4. The Framers did divide governmental power in the manner the Court describes,&para;<br>for the purpose of safeguarding liberty. And yet . . . the&para;<br>citizen confronting thousands of pages of regulations—&para;<br>promulgated by an agency directed by Congress to regulate, say, “in the public interest”—can perhaps be excused&para;<br>for thinking that it is the agency really doing the legislat-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing. And with hundreds of federal agencies poking into&para;<br>every nook and cranny of daily life, that citizen might also&para;<br>understandably question whether Presidential oversight—&para;<br>a critical part of the Constitutional plan—is always an&para;<br>effective safeguard against agency overreaching.&para;<br>It is against this background that we consider whether&para;<br>the authority of administrative agencies should be augmented even further, to include not only broad power to&para;<br>give definitive answers to questions left to them by Congress, but also the same power to decide when Congress&para;<br>has given them that power.&para;<br>Before proceeding to answer that question, however, it&para;<br>is necessary to sort through some confusion over what this&para;<br>litigation is about. The source of the confusion is a familiar culprit: the concept of “jurisdiction,” which we have&para;<br>repeatedly described as a word with “ ‘many, too many,&para;<br>meanings.’ ” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,&para;<br>558 U. S. 67, 81 (2009).&para;<br>The Court states that the question “is whether a court&para;<br>must defer under Chevron to an agency’s interpretation of&para;<br>a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency’s statutory authority (that is, its jurisdiction).” Ante, at&para;<br>5. That is fine—until the parenthetical. The parties,&para;<br>amici, and court below too often use the term “jurisdiction”&para;<br>imprecisely, which leads the Court to misunderstand the&para;<br>argument it must confront. That argument is not that&para;<br>“there exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations,”&para;<br>some “big, important ones” that “define the agency’s ‘jurisdiction,’ ” and other “humdrum, run-of-the-mill” ones that&para;<br>“are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly&para;<br>has.” Ibid. The argument is instead that a court should&para;<br>not defer to an agency on whether Congress has granted&para;<br>the agency interpretive authority over the statutory ambiguity at issue.&para;<br>You can call that “jurisdiction” if you’d like, as petitioners do in the question presented. But given that the term&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>is ambiguous, more is required to understand its use in&para;<br>that question than simply “having read it.” Ante, at 15,&para;<br>n. 5. It is important to keep in mind that the term, in the&para;<br>present context, has the more precise meaning noted&para;<br>above, encompassing congressionally delegated authority&para;<br>to issue interpretations with the force and effect of law.&para;<br>See 668 F. 3d 229, 248 (CA5 2012) (case below) (“The issue&para;<br>in the instant case is whether the FCC possessed statutory&para;<br>authority to administer §332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) by adopting the 90- and 150-day time frames”). And that has&para;<br>nothing do with whether the statutory provisions at issue&para;<br>are “big” or “small.”&para;<br>II&para;<br>“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial&para;<br>department to say what the law is.” Marbury v. Madison,&para;<br>1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). The rise of the modern administrative state has not changed that duty. Indeed, the&para;<br>Administrative Procedure Act, governing judicial review of&para;<br>most agency action, instructs reviewing courts to decide&para;<br>“all relevant questions of law.” 5 U. S. C. §706.&para;<br>We do not ignore that command when we afford an&para;<br>agency’s statutory interpretation Chevron deference; we&para;<br>respect it. We give binding deference to permissible agency&para;<br>interpretations of statutory ambiguities because Congress has delegated to the agency the authority to interpret those ambiguities “with the force of law.” United&para;<br>States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229 (2001); see also&para;<br>Monaghan, Marbury and the Administrative State, 83&para;<br>Colum. L. Rev. 1, 27–28 (1983) (“the court is not abdicating its constitutional duty to ‘say what the law is’ by deferring to agency interpretations of law: it is simply applying&para;<br>the law as ‘made’ by the authorized law-making entity”).&para;<br>But before a court may grant such deference, it must on&para;<br>its own decide whether Congress—the branch vested with&para;<br>lawmaking authority under the Constitution—has in fact&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>delegated to the agency lawmaking power over the ambiguity at issue. See ante, at 4 (BREYER, J., concurring in&para;<br>part and concurring in judgment) (“The question whether&para;<br>Congress has delegated to an agency the authority to&para;<br>provide an interpretation that carries the force of law is&para;<br>for the judge to answer independently.”). Agencies are&para;<br>creatures of Congress; “an agency literally has no power to&para;<br>act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”&para;<br>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 374&para;<br>(1986). Whether Congress has conferred such power is the&para;<br>“relevant question[ ] of law” that must be answered before&para;<br>affording Chevron deference. 5 U. S. C. §706.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Our precedents confirm this conclusion—beginning with&para;<br>Chevron itself. In Chevron, the EPA promulgated a regulation interpreting the term “stationary sources” in the&para;<br>Clean Air Act. 467 U. S., at 840 (quoting 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§7502(b)(6)(1982 ed.)). An environmental group petitioned&para;<br>for review of the rule, challenging it as an impermissible&para;<br>interpretation of the Act. 467 U. S., at 841, 859. Finding&para;<br>the statutory text “not dispositive” and the legislative&para;<br>history “silent on the precise issue,” we upheld the rule.&para;<br>Id., at 862, 866.&para;<br>In our view, the challenge to the agency’s interpretation&para;<br>“center[ed] on the wisdom of the agency’s policy, rather&para;<br>than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left&para;<br>open by Congress.” Id., at 866. Judges, we said, “are not&para;<br>experts in the field, and are not part of either political&para;<br>branch of the Government.” Id., at 865. Thus, because&para;<br>Congress had not answered the specific question at issue,&para;<br>judges had no business providing their own resolution on&para;<br>the basis of their “personal policy preferences.” Ibid.&para;<br>Instead, the “agency to which Congress ha[d] delegated&para;<br>policymaking responsibilities” was the appropriate politi-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>cal actor to resolve the competing interests at stake, “within&para;<br>the limits of that delegation.” Ibid.&para;<br>Chevron’s rule of deference was based on—and limited&para;<br>by—this congressional delegation. And the Court did not&para;<br>ask simply whether Congress had delegated to the EPA&para;<br>the authority to administer the Clean Air Act generally.&para;<br>We asked whether Congress had “delegat[ed] authority to&para;<br>the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute&para;<br>by regulation.” Id., at 843–844 (emphasis added); see id.,&para;<br>at 844 (discussing “the legislative delegation to an agency&para;<br>on a particular question” (emphasis added)). We deferred&para;<br>to the EPA’s interpretation of “stationary sources” based&para;<br>on our conclusion that the agency had been “charged with&para;<br>responsibility for administering the provision.” Id., at 865&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>B&para;<br>We have never faltered in our understanding of this&para;<br>straightforward principle, that whether a particular agency&para;<br>interpretation warrants Chevron deference turns on the&para;<br>court’s determination whether Congress has delegated to&para;<br>the agency the authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity at issue.&para;<br>We made the point perhaps most clearly in Adams Fruit&para;<br>Co. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638 (1990). In that case, the&para;<br>Department of Labor contended the Court should defer to&para;<br>its interpretation of the scope of the private right of action&para;<br>provided by the Migrant and Seasonal Agriculture Worker&para;<br>Protection Act (AWPA), 29 U. S. C. §1854, against employers who intentionally violated the Act’s motor vehicle&para;<br>safety provisions. We refused to do so. Although “as an&para;<br>initial matter” we rejected the idea that Congress left a&para;<br>“statutory ‘gap’ ” for the agency to fill, we reasoned that if&para;<br>the “AWPA’s language establishing a private right of&para;<br>action is ambiguous,” the Secretary of Labor’s interpretation of its scope did not warrant Chevron deference. 494&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S., at 649.&para;<br>In language directly applicable to the question before us,&para;<br>we explained that “[a] precondition to deference under&para;<br>Chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative&para;<br>authority.” Ibid. Although “Congress clearly envisioned,&para;<br>indeed expressly mandated, a role for the Department of&para;<br>Labor in administering the statute by requiring the Secretary to promulgate standards implementing AWPA’s&para;<br>motor vehicle provisions,” we found “[n]o such delegation&para;<br>regarding AWPA’s enforcement provisions.” Id., at 650&para;<br>(emphasis added). It would therefore be “inappropriate,”&para;<br>we said, “to consult executive interpretations” of the enforcement provisions to resolve ambiguities “surrounding&para;<br>the scope of AWPA’s judicially enforceable remedy.” Ibid.&para;<br>Without questioning the principle that agency determinations “within the scope of delegated authority are entitled&para;<br>to deference,” we explained that “it is fundamental ‘that&para;<br>an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it&para;<br>has no jurisdiction.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Federal Maritime&para;<br>Comm’n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U. S. 726, 745 (1973)).&para;<br>Our subsequent cases follow the same approach. In&para;<br>United States v. Mead Corp., supra, for example, Chevron&para;<br>deference turned on whether Congress had delegated to&para;<br>the agency authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity&para;<br>by a particular means. The Customs Service had issued a&para;<br>“classification ruling,” interpreting the term “diaries” in a&para;<br>tariff schedule to include “day planners” of the type Mead&para;<br>imported, and on that basis subjected the planners to a&para;<br>four-percent tariff. Mead protested the imposition of the&para;<br>tariff, the Customs Service claimed Chevron deference for&para;<br>its interpretation, and the controversy made its way to our&para;<br>Court. Id., at 224–226.&para;<br>In Mead, we again made clear that the “category of&para;<br>interpretative choices” to which Chevron deference applies&para;<br>is defined by congressional intent. Id., at 229. Chevron&para;<br>deference, we said, rests on a recognition that Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>has delegated to an agency the interpretive authority to&para;<br>implement “a particular provision” or answer “ ‘a particular question.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844).&para;<br>An agency’s interpretation of “a particular statutory provision” thus qualifies for Chevron deference only “when it&para;<br>appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency&para;<br>generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that&para;<br>the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” 533 U. S., at&para;<br>226–227.&para;<br>The Court did not defer to the agency’s views but instead determined that Congress had not delegated interpretive authority to the Customs Service to definitively&para;<br>construe the tariff schedule through classification rulings.&para;<br>Neither the statutory authorization for the classification&para;<br>rulings, nor the Customs Service’s practice in issuing such&para;<br>rulings, “reasonably suggest[ed] that Congress ever&para;<br>thought of [such] classification rulings as deserving the&para;<br>deference claimed for them.” Id., at 231. And in the absence of such a delegation, we concluded the interpretations adopted in those rulings were “beyond the Chevron&para;<br>pale.” Id., at 234.&para;<br>Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), is in the same&para;<br>line of precedent. In that case, as here, deference turned&para;<br>on whether a congressional delegation of interpretive&para;<br>authority reached a particular statutory ambiguity. The&para;<br>Attorney General claimed Chevron deference for his interpretation of the phrase “legitimate medical purpose” in the&para;<br>Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to exclude the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances for the purpose of assisting suicide. Id., at 254, 258. No one disputed&para;<br>that “legitimate medical purpose” was “ambiguous in the&para;<br>relevant sense.” Id., at 258. Nor did any Justice dispute&para;<br>that the Attorney General had been granted the power in&para;<br>the CSA to promulgate rules with the force of law. Ibid.;&para;<br>see id., at 281 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Court explained, “Chevron deference . . . is not accorded&para;<br>merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.” Id., at 258. The regulation&para;<br>advancing the interpretation, we said, “must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the&para;<br>official.” Ibid. (citing Mead, supra, at 226–227).&para;<br>In the CSA, Congress delegated to the Attorney General&para;<br>the authority to promulgate regulations “relating to the&para;<br>registration and control of the manufacture, distribution,&para;<br>and dispensing of controlled substances,” 21 U. S. C. §821,&para;<br>or “for the efficient execution of his functions under [the&para;<br>CSA],” §871(b). After considering the text, structure, and&para;<br>purpose of the Act, the Court concluded on its own that&para;<br>interpreting “legitimate medical purpose” fell under neither delegation. Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 258–269. Because&para;<br>the regulation “was not promulgated pursuant to the&para;<br>Attorney General’s authority, its interpretation of ‘legitimate medical purpose’ d[id] not receive Chevron deference.” Id., at 268.&para;<br>Adams Fruit, Mead, and Gonzales thus confirm that&para;<br>Chevron deference is based on, and finds legitimacy as, a&para;<br>congressional delegation of interpretive authority. An&para;<br>agency interpretation warrants such deference only if&para;<br>Congress has delegated authority to definitively interpret&para;<br>a particular ambiguity in a particular manner. Whether&para;<br>Congress has done so must be determined by the court on&para;<br>its own before Chevron can apply. See H. Edwards, L.&para;<br>Elliot, &amp; M. Levy, Federal Courts Standards of Review 168&para;<br>(2d ed. 2013) (“a court decides de novo whether an agency&para;<br>has acted within the bounds of congressionally delegated&para;<br>authority” (citing Mead, supra, at 226–227, and Gonzales,&para;<br>supra, at 258)); Sales &amp; Adler, The Rest is Silence: Chevron&para;<br>Deference, Agency Jurisdiction, and Statutory Silences,&para;<br>2009 U. Ill. L.

FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>whether a delegation has taken place”).&para;<br>In other words, we do not defer to an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous provision unless Congress wants&para;<br>us to, and whether Congress wants us to is a question that&para;<br>courts, not agencies, must decide. Simply put, that question is “beyond the Chevron pale.” Mead, supra, at 234.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Despite these precedents, the FCC argues that a court&para;<br>need only locate an agency and a grant of general rulemaking authority over a statute. Chevron deference then&para;<br>applies, it contends, to the agency’s interpretation of any&para;<br>ambiguity in the Act, including ambiguity in a provision&para;<br>said to carve out specific provisions from the agency’s&para;<br>general rulemaking authority. If Congress intends to&para;<br>exempt part of the statute from the agency’s interpretive&para;<br>authority, the FCC says, Congress “can ordinarily be&para;<br>expected to state that intent explicitly.” Brief for Federal&para;<br>Respondents 30 (citing American Hospital Assn. v.

Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844.

J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ity over the CSA between the Attorney General and the&para;<br>Secretary of Health and Human Services); Sutton v. United&para;<br>Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471, 478 (1999) (authority to&para;<br>issue regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act “is split primarily among three Government&para;<br>agencies”). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and&para;<br>Consumer Protection Act, for example, authorizes rulemaking by at least eight different agencies. See Congressional Research Service, C. Copeland, Rulemaking&para;<br>Requirements and Authorities in the Dodd-Frank Wall&para;<br>Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 7 (2010).&para;<br>When presented with an agency’s interpretation of such a&para;<br>statute, a court cannot simply ask whether the statute is&para;<br>one that the agency administers; the question is whether&para;<br>authority over the particular ambiguity at issue has been&para;<br>delegated to the particular agency.&para;<br>By the same logic, even when Congress provides interpretive authority to a single agency, a court must decide if&para;<br>the ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with&para;<br>the force of law is one to which the congressional delegation extends. A general delegation to the agency to administer the statute will often suffice to satisfy the court that&para;<br>Congress has delegated interpretive authority over the&para;<br>ambiguity at issue. But if Congress has exempted particular provisions from that authority, that exemption must be&para;<br>respected, and the determination whether Congress has&para;<br>done so is for the courts alone.&para;<br>The FCC’s argument that Congress “can ordinarily be&para;<br>expected to state that intent explicitly,” Brief for Federal&para;<br>Respondents 30 (citing American Hospital, supra), goes to&para;<br>the merits of that determination, not to whether a court&para;<br>should decide the question de novo or defer to the agency.&para;<br>Indeed, that is how the Court in American Hospital considered it. It was in the process of “employing the traditional tools of statutory construction” that the Court said&para;<br>it would have expected Congress to speak more clearly if it&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>had intended to exclude an entire subject area—employee&para;<br>units for collecting bargaining—from the NLRB’s general&para;<br>rulemaking authority. Id., at 613, 614. The Court concluded, after considering the language, structure, policy,&para;<br>and legislative history of the Act on its own—without&para;<br>deferring to the agency—that the meaning of the statute&para;<br>was “clear and contrary to the meaning advanced by petitioner.” Id., at 609–614. To be sure, the Court also noted&para;<br>that “[e]ven if we could find any ambiguity in [the provision] after employing the traditional tools of statutory&para;<br>construction, we would still defer to Board’s reasonable&para;<br>interpretation.” Id., at 614 (emphasis added). But that&para;<br>single sentence of dictum cannot carry the day for the FCC&para;<br>here.&para;<br>V&para;<br>As the preceding analysis makes clear, I do not understand petitioners to ask the Court—nor do I think it&para;<br>necessary—to draw a “specious, but scary-sounding” line&para;<br>between “big, important” interpretations on the one hand&para;<br>and “humdrum, run-of-the-mill” ones on the other. Ante,&para;<br>at 5, 12. Drawing such a line may well be difficult. Distinguishing between whether an agency’s interpretation of&para;<br>an ambiguous term is reasonable and whether that term is&para;<br>for the agency to interpret is not nearly so difficult. It&para;<br>certainly did not confuse the FCC in this proceeding.&para;<br>Compare In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC&para;<br>Rcd. 13994, 14000–14003 (2009) (addressing the latter&para;<br>question), with id., at 14003–14015 (addressing the former). Nor did it confound the Fifth Circuit. Compare 668&para;<br>F. 3d, at 247–254 (deciding “whether the FCC possessed&para;<br>statutory authority to administer §332(c)(7)(B)(ii)”), with&para;<br>id., at 254–260 (considering “whether the 90- and 150-day&para;<br>time frames themselves also pass muster under Chevron”).&para;<br>More importantly, if the legitimacy of Chevron deference is&para;<br>based on a congressional delegation of interpretive author-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ity, then the line is one the Court must draw.&para;<br>The majority’s hypothetical Common Carrier Acts do not&para;<br>demonstrate anything different. Ante, at 6–8. The majority states that in its second Common Carrier Act, Section 2&para;<br>makes clear that Congress “ ‘conferred interpretative&para;<br>power on the agency’ ” to interpret the ambiguous terms&para;<br>“common carrier” and “unreasonable condition.” Ante,&para;<br>at 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p. 14).&para;<br>Thus, it says, under anyone’s theory a court must defer to&para;<br>the agency’s reasonable interpretations of those terms.&para;<br>Correct.&para;<br>The majority claims, however, that “petitioners’ theory&para;<br>would accord the agency no deference” in its interpretation&para;<br>of the same ambiguous terms in the first Common Carrier&para;<br>Act. Ante, at 7–8. But as I understand petitioners’&para;<br>argument—and certainly in my own view—a court, in both&para;<br>cases, need only decide for itself whether Congress has&para;<br>delegated to the agency authority to interpret the ambiguous terms, before affording the agency’s interpretation&para;<br>Chevron deference.&para;<br>For the second Common Carrier Act, the answer is easy.&para;<br>The majority’s hypothetical Congress has spoken clearly&para;<br>and specifically in Section 2 of the Act about its delegation&para;<br>of authority to interpret Section 1. As for the first Act, it&para;<br>is harder to analyze the question, given only one section of&para;<br>a presumably much larger statute. But if the first Common Carrier Act is like most agencies’ organic statutes, I&para;<br>have no reason to doubt that the agency would likewise&para;<br>have interpretive authority over the same ambiguous&para;<br>terms, and therefore be entitled to deference in construing them, just as with the second Common Carrier&para;<br>Act. There is no new “test” to worry about, cf. ante, at 16;&para;<br>courts would simply apply the normal rules of statutory&para;<br>construction.&para;<br>That the question might be harder with respect to the&para;<br>first Common Carrier Act should come as no surprise. The&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ARLINGTON v. FCC&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>second hypothetical Congress has more carefully defined&para;<br>the agency’s authority than the first. Whatever standard&para;<br>of review applies, it is more difficult to interpret an unclear statute than a clear one. My point is simply that&para;<br>before a court can defer to the agency’s interpretation of&para;<br>the ambiguous terms in either Act, it must determine for&para;<br>itself that Congress has delegated authority to the agency&para;<br>to issue those interpretations with the force of law.&para;<br>The majority also expresses concern that adopting petitioners’ position would undermine Chevron’s stable background rule against which Congress legislates. Ante, at 5.&para;<br>That, of course, begs the question of what that stable&para;<br>background rule is. See Merrill &amp; Hickman, Chevron’s&para;<br>Domain, 89 Geo. L. Rev. 833, 910 (2001) (“Courts have&para;<br>never deferred to agencies with respect to questions such&para;<br>as whether Congress has delegated to an agency the power&para;<br>to act with the force of law through either legislative rules&para;<br>or binding adjudications. Similarly, it has never been&para;<br>maintained that Congress would want courts to give Chevron deference to an agency’s determination that it is&para;<br>entitled to Chevron deference, or should give Chevron&para;<br>deference to an agency’s determination of what types of&para;<br>interpretations are entitled to Chevron deference” (footnote omitted)).&para;<br>VI&para;<br>The Court sees something nefarious behind the view&para;<br>that courts must decide on their own whether Congress&para;<br>has delegated interpretative authority to an agency, before&para;<br>deferring to that agency’s interpretation of law. What is&para;<br>afoot, according to the Court, is a judicial power-grab, with&para;<br>nothing less than “Chevron itself ” as “the ultimate target.”&para;<br>Ante, at 12.&para;<br>The Court touches on a legitimate concern: Chevron&para;<br>importantly guards against the Judiciary arrogating to&para;<br>itself policymaking properly left, under the separation of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>powers, to the Executive. But there is another concern at&para;<br>play, no less firmly rooted in our constitutional structure.&para;<br>That is the obligation of the Judiciary not only to confine&para;<br>itself to its proper role, but to ensure that the other&para;<br>branches do so as well.&para;<br>An agency’s interpretive authority, entitling the agency&para;<br>to judicial deference, acquires its legitimacy from a delegation of lawmaking power from Congress to the Executive.&para;<br>Our duty to police the boundary between the Legislature&para;<br>and the Executive is as critical as our duty to respect that&para;<br>between the Judiciary and the Executive. See Zivotofsky&para;<br>v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8). In the&para;<br>present context, that means ensuring that the Legislative&para;<br>Branch has in fact delegated lawmaking power to an&para;<br>agency within the Executive Branch, before the Judiciary&para;<br>defers to the Executive on what the law is. That concern&para;<br>is heightened, not diminished, by the fact that the administrative agencies, as a practical matter, draw upon a&para;<br>potent brew of executive, legislative, and judicial power.&para;<br>And it is heightened, not diminished, by the dramatic&para;<br>shift in power over the last 50 years from Congress to the&para;<br>Executive—a shift effected through the administrative&para;<br>agencies.&para;<br>We reconcile our competing responsibilities in this area&para;<br>by ensuring judicial deference to agency interpretations&para;<br>under Chevron—but only after we have determined on our&para;<br>own that Congress has given interpretive authority to the&para;<br>agency. Our “task is to fix the boundaries of delegated&para;<br>authority,” Monaghan, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 27; that is&para;<br>not a task we can delegate to the agency. We do not leave&para;<br>it to the agency to decide when it is in charge.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In these cases, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling&para;<br>interpreting the term “reasonable period of time” in 47&para;<br>U.
