THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS &para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, &para;<br>&para;<br>CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION&para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–10189.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued February 25, 2013—Decided May 28, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, ___, this Court held that “a procedural&para;<br>default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [State’s] initial-review&para;<br>collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.” Martinez regarded a prisoner from Arizona,&para;<br>where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim&para;<br>during his first state collateral review proceeding. Ibid. This case&para;<br>regards a prisoner from Texas, where state procedural law does not&para;<br>require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claim on collateral review. Rather, Texas law appears to permit a&para;<br>prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review, but the structure and&para;<br>design of the Texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner&para;<br>to do so. The question presented in this case is whether, despite this&para;<br>difference, the rule set out in Martinez applies in Texas.&para;<br>Petitioner Trevino was convicted of capital murder in Texas state&para;<br>court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a life sentence. Neither new counsel&para;<br>appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state&para;<br>collateral review raised the claim that Trevino’s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances. When&para;<br>that claim was finally raised in Trevino’s federal habeas petition, the&para;<br>District Court stayed the proceedings so Trevino could raise it in&para;<br>state court. The state court found the claim procedurally defaulted&para;<br>because of Trevino’s failure to raise it in his initial state postconviction proceedings, and the federal court then concluded that this fail-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the federal courts from considering the claim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Its decision predated Martinez, but that court has since concluded&para;<br>that Martinez does not apply in Texas because Martinez’s good-cause&para;<br>exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must initially raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in initial&para;<br>state collateral review proceedings, while Texas law appears to permit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Where, as here, a State’s procedural framework, by reason of its&para;<br>design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a&para;<br>defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffectiveassistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the exception recognized in Martinez applies. Pp. 5–15.&para;<br>(a) A finding that a defendant’s state law “procedural default” rests&para;<br>on “an independent and adequate state ground” ordinarily prevents a&para;<br>federal habeas court from considering the defendant’s federal constitutional claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,729–730. However, a “prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by&para;<br>showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of the&para;<br>federal law.” Martinez, supra, at ___. In Martinez, the Court recognized a “narrow exception” to Coleman’s statement “that an attorney’s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does&para;<br>not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.” 566 U. S., at&para;<br>___. That exception allows a federal habeas court to find “cause” to&para;<br>excuse such default where (1) the ineffective-assistance-of-trialcounsel claim was a “substantial” claim; (2) the “cause” consisted of&para;<br>there being “no counsel” or only “ineffective” counsel during the state&para;<br>collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral review proceeding was the “initial” review proceeding in respect to the “ineffectiveassistance-of-trial-counsel claim”; and (4) state law requires that the&para;<br>claim “be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.” Id., at&para;<br>___. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) The difference between the Texas law—which in theory grants&para;<br>permission to bring an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on&para;<br>direct appeal but in practice denies a meaningful opportunity to do&para;<br>so—and the Arizona law at issue in Martinez—which required the&para;<br>claim to be raised in an initial collateral review proceeding—does not&para;<br>matter in respect to the application of Martinez. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(1) This conclusion is supported by two characteristics of Texas’&para;<br>procedures. First, Texas procedures make it nearly impossible for an&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim to be presented on direct&para;<br>review. The nature of an ineffective-assistance claim means that the&para;<br>trial record is likely to be insufficient to support the claim. And a&para;<br>motion for a new trial to develop the record is usually inadequate be-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cause of Texas rules regarding time limits on the filing, and the disposal, of such motions and the availability of trial transcripts. Thus,&para;<br>a writ of habeas corpus is normally needed to gather the facts necessary for evaluating these claims in Texas. Second, were Martinez not&para;<br>to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant unfairness because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants to&para;<br>raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims on collateral, rather than on direct, review. Texas can point to only a few cases in&para;<br>which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial mechanism to&para;<br>expand the record on appeal. Texas suggests that there are other&para;<br>mechanisms by which a prisoner can expand the record on appeal,&para;<br>but these mechanisms seem special and limited in their application,&para;<br>and cannot overcome the Texas courts’ own well-supported determination that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural&para;<br>route for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Respondent also argues that there is no equitable problem here, where&para;<br>appellate counsel’s failure to bring a substantial ineffectiveassistance claim on direct appeal may constitute cause to excuse the&para;<br>procedural default, but respondent points to no case in which such a&para;<br>failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffective. Pp. 8–13.&para;<br>(2) The very factors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for applying that exception here. The right involved—adequate assistance of trial counsel—&para;<br>is similarly and critically important. In both instances practical considerations—the need for a new lawyer, the need to expand the trial&para;<br>court record, and the need for sufficient time to develop the claim—&para;<br>argue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral,&para;<br>not on direct, review. See Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___. In both instances failure to consider a lawyer’s “ineffectiveness” during an initial-review collateral proceeding as a potential “cause” for excusing a&para;<br>procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for&para;<br>review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. See id., at&para;<br>___. Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a State&para;<br>that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and (2) a&para;<br>State that grants permission but denies a fair, meaningful opportunity to develop the claim is a distinction without a difference.

Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012), we considered&para;<br>the right of a state prisoner to raise, in a federal habeas&para;<br>corpus proceeding, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel. In that case an Arizona procedural rule required&para;<br>a defendant convicted at trial to raise a claim of ineffective&para;<br>assistance of trial counsel during his first state collateral&para;<br>review proceeding—or lose the claim. The defendant in&para;<br>Martinez did not comply with the state procedural rule.&para;<br>But he argued that the federal habeas court should excuse&para;<br>his state procedural failing, on the ground that he had&para;<br>good “cause” for not raising the claim at the right time,&para;<br>namely that, not only had he lacked effective counsel&para;<br>during trial, but also he lacked effective counsel during his&para;<br>first state collateral review proceeding.&para;<br>We held that lack of counsel on collateral review might&para;<br>excuse defendant’s state law procedural default. We&para;<br>wrote:&para;<br>“[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective&para;<br>assistance at trial if, in the [State’s] initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in&para;<br>that proceeding was ineffective.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 15).&para;<br>At the same time we qualified our holding. We said&para;<br>that the holding applied where state procedural law said&para;<br>that “claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must&para;<br>be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.” Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>In this case Texas state law does not say “must.” It does&para;<br>not on its face require a defendant initially to raise an&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a state collateral review proceeding. Rather, that law appears at&para;<br>first glance to permit (but not require) the defendant&para;<br>initially to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel on direct appeal. The structure and design of the&para;<br>Texas system in actual operation, however, make it “virtually impossible” for an ineffective assistance claim to be&para;<br>presented on direct review. See Robinson v. State, 16&para;<br>S. W. 3d 808, 810–811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We must&para;<br>now decide whether the Martinez exception applies in this&para;<br>procedural regime. We conclude that it does.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A Texas state court jury convicted petitioner, Carlos&para;<br>Trevino, of capital murder. After a subsequent penaltyphase hearing, the jury found that Trevino “would commit&para;<br>criminal acts of violence in the future which would constitute a continuing threat to society,” that he “actually&para;<br>caused the death of Linda Salinas or, if he did not actually&para;<br>cause her death, he intended to kill her or another, or he&para;<br>anticipated a human life would be taken,” and that “there&para;<br>were insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a&para;<br>sentence of life imprisonment” rather than death. 449&para;<br>Fed. Appx. 415, 418 (CA5 2011). The judge consequently&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>imposed a sentence of death.&para;<br>Eight days later the judge appointed new counsel to&para;<br>handle Trevino’s direct appeal. App. 1, 3. Seven months&para;<br>after sentencing, when the trial transcript first became&para;<br>available, that counsel filed an appeal. The Texas Court of&para;<br>Criminal Appeals then considered and rejected Trevino’s&para;<br>appellate claims. Trevino’s appellate counsel did not&para;<br>claim that Trevino’s trial counsel had been constitutionally&para;<br>ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial court proceedings. Id., at 12–24.&para;<br>About six months after sentencing, the trial judge appointed Trevino a different new counsel to seek state&para;<br>collateral relief. As Texas’ procedural rules provide, that&para;<br>third counsel initiated collateral proceedings while Trevino’s appeal still was in progress. This new counsel first&para;<br>sought postconviction relief (through collateral review) in&para;<br>the trial court itself. After a hearing, the trial court denied relief; and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals&para;<br>affirmed that denial. Id., at 25–26, 321–349. Trevino’s&para;<br>postconviction claims included a claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the penalty&para;<br>phase of Trevino’s trial, but it did not include a claim that&para;<br>trial counsel’s ineffectiveness consisted in part of a failure&para;<br>adequately to investigate and to present mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase of Trevino’s trial. Id., at&para;<br>321–349; see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 523 (2003)&para;<br>(counsel’s failure to investigate and present mitigating&para;<br>circumstances deprived defendant of effective assistance of&para;<br>counsel).&para;<br>Trevino then filed a petition in federal court seeking a&para;<br>writ of habeas corpus. The Federal District Court appointed another new counsel to represent him. And that&para;<br>counsel claimed for the first time that Trevino had not&para;<br>received constitutionally effective counsel during the&para;<br>penalty phase of his trial in part because of trial counsel’s&para;<br>failure to adequately investigate and present mitigating&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>circumstances during the penalty phase. App. 438, 456–&para;<br>478. Federal habeas counsel pointed out that Trevino’s&para;<br>trial counsel had presented only one witness at the sentencing phase, namely Trevino’s aunt. The aunt had&para;<br>testified that Trevino had had a difficult upbringing, that&para;<br>his mother had an alcohol problem, that his family was on&para;<br>welfare, and that he had dropped out of high school. She&para;<br>had added that Trevino had a child, that he was good with&para;<br>children, and that he was not violent. Id., at 285–291.&para;<br>Federal habeas counsel then told the federal court that&para;<br>Trevino’s trial counsel should have found and presented at&para;<br>the penalty phase other mitigating matters that his own&para;<br>investigation had brought to light. These included, among&para;<br>other things, that Trevino’s mother abused alcohol while&para;<br>she was pregnant with Trevino, that Trevino weighed only&para;<br>four pounds at birth, that throughout his life Trevino&para;<br>suffered the deleterious effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,&para;<br>that as a child Trevino had suffered numerous head injuries without receiving adequate medical attention, that&para;<br>Trevino’s mother had abused him physically and emotionally, that from an early age Trevino was exposed to, and&para;<br>abused, alcohol and drugs, that Trevino had attended&para;<br>school irregularly and performed poorly, and that Trevino’s cognitive abilities were impaired. Id., at 66–67.&para;<br>The federal court stayed proceedings to permit Trevino&para;<br>to raise this claim in state court. The state court held that&para;<br>because Trevino had not raised this claim during his&para;<br>initial postconviction proceedings, he had procedurally&para;<br>defaulted the claim, id., at 27–28; and the Federal District&para;<br>Court then denied Trevino’s ineffective-assistance-of-trialcounsel claim, id., at 78–79. The District Court concluded&para;<br>in relevant part that, despite the fact that “even the most&para;<br>minimal investigation . . . would have revealed a wealth&para;<br>of additional mitigating evidence,” an independent and&para;<br>adequate state ground (namely Trevino’s failure to raise&para;<br>the issue during his state postconviction proceeding)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>barred the federal habeas court from considering the&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Id., at 131–&para;<br>132. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729–730&para;<br>(1991).&para;<br>Trevino appealed. The Fifth Circuit, without considering the merits of Trevino’s ineffective-assistance-of-trialcounsel claim, agreed with the District Court that an&para;<br>independent, adequate state ground, namely Trevino’s&para;<br>procedural default, barred its consideration. 449 Fed.&para;<br>Appx., at 426. Although the Circuit decided Trevino’s case&para;<br>before this Court decided Martinez, the Fifth Circuit’s&para;<br>reasoning in a later case, Ibarra v. Thaler, 687 F. 3d 222&para;<br>(2012), makes clear that the Fifth Circuit would have&para;<br>found that Martinez would have made no difference.&para;<br>That is because in Ibarra the Circuit recognized that&para;<br>Martinez had said that its good-cause exception applies&para;<br>where state law says that a criminal defendant must&para;<br>initially raise his claim of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel in initial state collateral review proceedings. 687&para;<br>F. 3d, at 225–226. Texas law, the Circuit pointed out, does&para;<br>not say explicitly that the defendant must initially raise&para;<br>the claim in state collateral review proceedings. Rather&para;<br>Texas law on its face appears to permit a criminal defendant to raise such a claim on direct appeal. Id., at 227.&para;<br>And the Circuit held that that fact means that Martinez&para;<br>does not apply in Texas. 687 F. 3d, at 227. Since the&para;<br>Circuit’s holding in Ibarra (that Martinez does not apply&para;<br>in Texas) would similarly govern this case, we granted&para;<br>certiorari here to determine whether Martinez applies in&para;<br>Texas.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We begin with Martinez. We there recognized the historic importance of federal habeas corpus proceedings as&para;<br>a method for preventing individuals from being held in&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>custody in violation of federal law. Martinez, 566 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 6–7). See generally Preiser v. Rodriguez,&para;<br>411 U. S. 475, 484–485 (1973). In general, if a convicted&para;<br>state criminal defendant can show a federal habeas court&para;<br>that his conviction rests upon a violation of the Federal&para;<br>Constitution, he may well obtain a writ of habeas corpus&para;<br>that requires a new trial, a new sentence, or release.&para;<br>We similarly recognized the importance of federal habeas corpus principles designed to prevent federal courts&para;<br>from interfering with a State’s application of its own firmly&para;<br>established, consistently followed, constitutionally proper&para;<br>procedural rules. Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>6–7). Those principles have long made clear that a&para;<br>conviction that rests upon a defendant’s state law “procedural default” (for example, the defendant’s failure to raise&para;<br>a claim of error at the time or in the place that state law&para;<br>requires), normally rests upon “an independent and adequate state ground.” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729–730.&para;<br>And where a conviction rests upon such a ground, a federal habeas court normally cannot consider the defendant’s&para;<br>federal constitutional claim. Ibid.; see Martinez, 566&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6–7).&para;<br>At the same time, we pointed out that “[t]he doctrine&para;<br>barring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is&para;<br>not without exceptions. A prisoner may obtain federal&para;<br>review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of federal law.” Id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 6–7). And we turned to the issue directly&para;<br>before the Court: whether Martinez had shown “cause” to&para;<br>excuse his state procedural failing. Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 15).&para;<br>Martinez argued that his lawyer should have raised, but&para;<br>did not raise, his claim of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel during state collateral review proceedings. Id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 4). He added that this failure, itself&para;<br>amounting to ineffective assistance, was the “cause” of,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and ought to excuse, his procedural default. Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 4). But this Court had previously held that&para;<br>“[n]egligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction&para;<br>attorney does not qualify as ‘cause,’ ” primarily because a&para;<br>“principal” such as the prisoner, “bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent,” the attorney. Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)&para;<br>(quoting Coleman, supra, at 753–754; emphasis added).&para;<br>Martinez, in effect, argued for an exception to Coleman’s&para;<br>broad statement of the law.&para;<br>We ultimately held that a “narrow exception” should&para;<br>“modify the unqualified statement in Coleman that an&para;<br>attorney’s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction&para;<br>proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.” Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). We&para;<br>did so for three reasons. First, the “right to the effective&para;<br>assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our&para;<br>justice system. . . . Indeed, the right to counsel is the&para;<br>foundation for our adversary system.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 9).&para;<br>Second, ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appellate review could amount to “cause,” excusing a defendant’s failure to raise (and thus procedurally defaulting) a&para;<br>constitutional claim. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). But States&para;<br>often have good reasons for initially reviewing claims of&para;<br>ineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collateral proceedings rather than on direct appellate review.&para;<br>Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9–10). That is because review of&para;<br>such a claim normally requires a different attorney, because it often “depend[s] on evidence outside the trial&para;<br>record,” and because efforts to expand the record on direct&para;<br>appeal may run afoul of “[a]bbreviated deadlines,” depriving the new attorney of “adequate time . . . to investigate&para;<br>the ineffective-assistance claim.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 10).&para;<br>Third, where the State consequently channels initial&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>review of this constitutional claim to collateral proceedings, a lawyer’s failure to raise an ineffective-assistanceof-trial-counsel claim during initial-review collateral&para;<br>proceedings, could (were Coleman read broadly) deprive a&para;<br>defendant of any review of that claim at all. Martinez,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).&para;<br>We consequently read Coleman as containing an exception, allowing a federal habeas court to find “cause,”&para;<br>thereby excusing a defendant’s procedural default, where&para;<br>(1) the claim of “ineffective assistance of trial counsel” was&para;<br>a “substantial” claim; (2) the “cause” consisted of there&para;<br>being “no counsel” or only “ineffective” counsel during the&para;<br>state collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral&para;<br>review proceeding was the “initial” review proceeding in&para;<br>respect to the “ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claim”; and (4) state law requires that an “ineffective&para;<br>assistance of trial counsel [claim] . . . be raised in an&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceeding.” Martinez, supra, at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 11, 15).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Here state law differs from that in Martinez in respect&para;<br>to the fourth requirement. Unlike Arizona, Texas does not&para;<br>expressly require the defendant to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in an initial collateral&para;<br>review proceeding. Rather Texas law on its face appears&para;<br>to permit (but not require) the defendant to raise the claim&para;<br>on direct appeal. Does this difference matter?&para;<br>1&para;<br>Two characteristics of the relevant Texas procedures&para;<br>lead us to conclude that it should not make a difference in&para;<br>respect to the application of Martinez. First, Texas procedure makes it “virtually impossible for appellate counsel&para;<br>to adequately present an ineffective assistance [of trial&para;<br>counsel] claim” on direct review. Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>810–811. As the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals itself&para;<br>has pointed out, “the inherent nature of most ineffective&para;<br>assistance” of trial counsel “claims” means that the trial&para;<br>court record will often fail to “contai[n] the information&para;<br>necessary to substantiate” the claim. Ex parte Torres, 943&para;<br>S. W. 2d 469, 475 (1997) (en banc).&para;<br>As the Court of Criminal Appeals has also noted, a&para;<br>convicted defendant may make a motion in the trial court&para;<br>for a new trial in order to develop the record on appeal.&para;<br>See Reyes v. State, 849 S. W. 2d 812, 816 (1993). And, in&para;<br>principle, the trial court could, in connection with that&para;<br>motion, allow the defendant some additional time to develop a further record. Ibid. But that motion-for-new-trial&para;<br>“vehicle is often inadequate because of time constraints&para;<br>and because the trial record has generally not been transcribed at this point.” Torres, supra, at 475. See Tex. Rule&para;<br>App. Proc. 21.4 (2013) (motion for a new trial must be&para;<br>made within 30 days of sentencing); Rules 21.8(a), (c) (trial&para;<br>court must dispose of motion within 75 days of sentencing); Rules 35.2(b), 35.3(c) (transcript must be prepared&para;<br>within 120 days of sentencing where a motion for a new&para;<br>trial is filed and this deadline may be extended). Thus, as&para;<br>the Court of Criminal Appeals has concluded, in Texas “a&para;<br>writ of habeas corpus” issued in state collateral proceedings ordinarily “is essential to gathering the facts necessary to . . . evaluate . . . [ineffective-assistance-of-trialcounsel] claims.” Torres, supra, at 475. See Robinson,&para;<br>supra, at 810–811 (noting that there is “not generally a&para;<br>realistic opportunity to adequately develop the record for&para;<br>appeal in post-trial motions” and that “[t]he time requirements for filing and presenting a motion for new trial&para;<br>would have made it virtually impossible for appellate&para;<br>counsel to adequately present an ineffective assistance&para;<br>claim to the trial court”).&para;<br>See also Thompson v. State, 9 S. W. 3d 808, 813–814,&para;<br>and n. 6 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (“[I]n the vast majority of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v.

The present capital case illustrates why it does not. The trial court appointed new&para;<br>counsel for Trevino eight days after sentencing. Counsel&para;<br>thus had 22 days to decide whether, and on what grounds,&para;<br>to make a motion for a new trial. She then may have had&para;<br>an additional 45 days to provide support for the motion&para;<br>but without the help of a transcript (which did not become&para;<br>available until much later—seven months after the trial).&para;<br>It would have been difficult, perhaps impossible, within&para;<br>that time frame to investigate Trevino’s background, determine whether trial counsel had adequately done so,&para;<br>and then develop evidence about additional mitigating&para;<br>background circumstances.

That&para;<br>is because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants&para;<br>to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel&para;<br>on collateral, rather than on direct, review. As noted, they&para;<br>have explained why direct review proceedings are likely&para;<br>inadequate. See supra, at 8–10. They have held that&para;<br>failure to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the&para;<br>defendant from raising the claim in collateral proceedings.&para;<br>See, e.g., Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at 813; Ex parte Duffy,&para;<br>607 S. W. 2d 507, 512–513 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (overruled on other grounds by Hernandez v. State, 988 S. W.&para;<br>2d 770 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)). They have held that the&para;<br>defendant’s decision to raise the claim on direct review&para;<br>does not bar the defendant from also raising the claim in&para;<br>collateral proceedings. See, e.g., Lopez v. State, 343 S. W.&para;<br>3d 137, 143 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); Torres, supra, at 475.&para;<br>They have suggested that appellate counsel’s failure to&para;<br>raise the claim on direct review does not constitute “ineffective assistance of counsel.” See Sprouse v. State, No.&para;<br>AP–74933, 2007 WL 283152, *7 (Tex. Crim. App., Jan. 31,&para;<br>2007) (unpublished). And Texas’ highest criminal court&para;<br>has explicitly stated that “[a]s a general rule” the defendant “should not raise an issue of ineffective assistance&para;<br>of counsel on direct appeal,” but rather in collateral review proceedings. Mata v. State, 226 S. W. 3d 425, 430,&para;<br>n. 14 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). See Robinson, supra, at 810 (“[A] post-conviction writ proceeding,&para;<br>rather than a motion for new trial, is the preferred method&para;<br>for gathering the facts necessary to substantiate” an&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim).&para;<br>The criminal bar, not surprisingly, has taken this strong&para;<br>judicial advice seriously. See Guidelines and Standards&para;<br>for Texas Capital Counsel, 69 Tex. B. J. 966, 977, Guideline 12.2(B)(1)(d) (2006) (“[S]tate habeas corpus is the first&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>opportunity for a capital client to raise challenges to the&para;<br>effectiveness of trial or direct appeal counsel”). Texas now&para;<br>can point to only a comparatively small number of cases in&para;<br>which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial&para;<br>mechanism to expand the record on appeal and then received a hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-trialcounsel claim on direct appeal. Brief for Respondent&para;<br>35–36, and n. 6 (citing, inter alia, State v. Morales, 253 S. W.&para;<br>3d 686, 689–691 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); Robertson v.&para;<br>State, 187 S. W. 3d 475, 480–481 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)).&para;<br>And, of those, precisely one case involves trial counsel’s&para;<br>investigative failures of the kind at issue here. See Armstrong v. State, No. AP–75706, 2010 WL 359020 (Tex.&para;<br>Crim. App., Jan. 27, 2010) (unpublished). How could&para;<br>federal law deny defendants the benefit of Martinez solely&para;<br>because of the existence of a theoretically available procedural alternative, namely direct appellate review, that&para;<br>Texas procedures render so difficult, and in the typical&para;<br>case all but impossible, to use successfully, and which&para;<br>Texas courts so strongly discourage defendants from&para;<br>using?&para;<br>Respondent argues that Texas courts enforce the relevant time limits more flexibly than we have suggested.&para;<br>Sometimes, for example, an appellate court can abate an&para;<br>appeal and remand the case for further record development in the trial court. See Cooks v. State, 240 S. W. 3d&para;<br>906 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). But the procedural possibilities to which Texas now points seem special, limited in&para;<br>their application, and, as far as we can tell, rarely used.&para;<br>See 43A Texas Practice §50:15, at 636–639; 43B id.,&para;<br>§56:235, at 607–609. Cooks, for example, the case upon&para;<br>which respondent principally relies, involved a remand for&para;<br>further record development, but in circumstances where&para;<br>the lower court wrongly failed to give a defendant new&para;<br>counsel in time to make an ordinary new trial motion. 240&para;<br>S. W. 3d, at 911. We do not believe that this, or other,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>special, rarely used procedural possibilities can overcome&para;<br>the Texas courts’ own well-supported determination that&para;<br>collateral review normally constitutes the preferred—and&para;<br>indeed as a practical matter, the only—method for raising&para;<br>an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.&para;<br>Respondent further argues that there is no equitable&para;<br>problem to be solved in Texas because if counsel fails to&para;<br>bring a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel on direct appeal, the ineffectiveness of appellate&para;<br>counsel may constitute cause to excuse the procedural&para;<br>default. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986). But&para;<br>respondent points to no case in which such a failure by&para;<br>appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffective. And that lack of authority is not surprising given&para;<br>the fact that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has&para;<br>directed defendants to bring such claims on collateral&para;<br>review.&para;<br>2&para;<br>For the reasons just stated, we believe that the Texas&para;<br>procedural system—as a matter of its structure, design,&para;<br>and operation—does not offer most defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance&para;<br>of trial counsel on direct appeal. What the Arizona law&para;<br>prohibited by explicit terms, Texas law precludes as a&para;<br>matter of course. And, that being so, we can find no significant difference between this case and Martinez. The very&para;<br>factors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to&para;<br>Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for the application of&para;<br>that exception here.&para;<br>The right involved—adequate assistance of counsel at&para;<br>trial—is similarly and critically important. In both instances practical considerations, such as the need for a&para;<br>new lawyer, the need to expand the trial court record, and&para;<br>the need for sufficient time to develop the claim, argue&para;<br>strongly for initial consideration of the claim during col-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lateral, rather than on direct, review. See Martinez, 566&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); see also Massaro v. United&para;<br>States, 538 U. S. 500, 505 (2003). In both instances failure&para;<br>to consider a lawyer’s “ineffectiveness” during an initialreview collateral proceeding as a potential “cause” for&para;<br>excusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant&para;<br>of any opportunity at all for review of an ineffectiveassistance-of-trial-counsel claim. See Martinez, supra, at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 7).&para;<br>Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a&para;<br>State that denies permission to raise the claim on direct&para;<br>appeal and (2) a State that in theory grants permission&para;<br>but, as a matter of procedural design and systemic operation, denies a meaningful opportunity to do so is a distinction without a difference. In saying this, we do not (any&para;<br>more than we did in Martinez) seek to encourage States&para;<br>to tailor direct appeals so that they provide a fuller opportunity to raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claims. That is a matter for the States to decide. And, as&para;<br>we have said, there are often good reasons for hearing the&para;<br>claim initially during collateral proceedings.&para;<br>III&para;<br>For these reasons, we conclude that where, as here,&para;<br>state procedural framework, by reason of its design and&para;<br>operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that&para;<br>a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct&para;<br>appeal, our holding in Martinez applies:&para;<br>“[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas&para;<br>court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective&para;<br>assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral&para;<br>proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that&para;<br>proceeding was ineffective.” 566 U.

Likewise, we do not decide here&para;<br>whether Trevino’s claim of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel is substantial or whether Trevino’s initial state&para;<br>habeas attorney was ineffective.&para;<br>For these reasons we vacate the Fifth Circuit’s judgment&para;<br>and remand the case for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Taylor, 529 U. S. 420,&para;<br>437 (2000). This basic principle reflects the fact that&para;<br>federal habeas review “ ‘intrudes on state sovereignty to&para;<br>a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.’ ” Richter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting&para;<br>Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 282 (1989) (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>dissenting)).&para;<br>In order to prevent circumvention of the state courts&para;<br>and the unjustified intrusion on state sovereignty that&para;<br>results, we have held that “a state prisoner [who] fails to&para;<br>exhaust state remedies . . . [or] has failed to meet the&para;<br>State’s procedural requirements for presenting his federal&para;<br>claims” will not be entitled to federal habeas relief unless&para;<br>he can show “cause” to excuse his default. Coleman v.&para;<br>Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 732, 750 (1991). There is an&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

We recognized in Coleman that&para;<br>“[w]here a [habeas] petitioner defaults a claim as a result&para;<br>of the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel,&para;<br>the State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default.”&para;<br>Id., at 754. But we simultaneously recognized that “[a]&para;<br>different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure&para;<br>that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.”&para;<br>Ibid. In that situation, we held, “it is the petitioner who&para;<br>must bear the burden of a failure to follow state procedural rules.” Ibid. Because the error in Coleman occurred&para;<br>during state postconviction proceedings, a point at which&para;<br>the habeas petitioner had no constitutional right to counsel, the petitioner had to bear the cost of his default. Id.,&para;<br>at 757.&para;<br>Last Term, in Martinez v. Ryan, we announced a “narrow exception” to Coleman’s “unqualified statement . . .&para;<br>that an attorney’s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a&para;<br>procedural default.” 566 U. S. 1, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6).&para;<br>In Martinez, Arizona law did not allow defendants to raise&para;<br>ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal;&para;<br>they could only raise such claims in state collateral proceedings. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). We held that while&para;<br>Arizona was free to structure its state court procedures in&para;<br>this way, its “decision is not without consequences for the&para;<br>State’s ability to assert a procedural default in later proceedings.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). “By deliberately&para;<br>choosing to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the&para;<br>direct-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally&para;<br>guaranteed, the State significantly diminishes prisoners’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ability to file such claims.” Ibid. Thus, “within the context of this state procedural framework,” attorney error&para;<br>would qualify as cause to excuse procedural default if it&para;<br>occurred in the first proceeding at which the prisoner was&para;<br>“allow[ed]” to raise his trial ineffectiveness claim. Id., at&para;<br>___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 13).&para;<br>We were unusually explicit about the narrowness of our&para;<br>decision: “The holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,” and “does not&para;<br>extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the&para;<br>first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of&para;<br>ineffective assistance at trial.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at&para;<br>13–14). “Our holding here addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this case, where the State&para;<br>barred the defendant from raising the claims on direct&para;<br>appeal.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). In “all but the limited&para;<br>circumstances recognized here,” we said, “[t]he rule of&para;<br>Coleman governs.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).&para;<br>This aggressively limiting language was not simply a&para;<br>customary nod to the truism that “we decide only the case&para;<br>before us.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383, 396&para;<br>(1981). It was instead an important part of our explanation for why “[t]his limited qualification to Coleman does&para;<br>not implicate the usual concerns with upsetting reliance&para;<br>interests protected by stare decisis principles.” Martinez,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12). The fact that the exception&para;<br>was clearly delineated ensured that the Coleman rule&para;<br>would remain administrable. And because States could&para;<br>readily anticipate how such a sharply defined exception&para;<br>would apply to various procedural frameworks, the exception could be reconciled with our concerns for comity and&para;<br>equitable balancing that led to Coleman’s baseline rule in&para;<br>the first place. See Coleman, supra, at 750–751. The&para;<br>States had a clear choice, which they could make with full&para;<br>knowledge of the consequences: If a State “deliberately&para;<br>cho[se] to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TREVINO v. THALER&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 14).&para;<br>Today, with hardly a mention of these concerns, the&para;<br>majority throws over the crisp limit we made so explicit&para;<br>just last Term. We announced in Martinez that the exception applies “where the State barred the defendant from&para;<br>raising the claims on direct appeal.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>14). But today, the Court takes all the starch out of its&para;<br>rule with an assortment of adjectives, adverbs, and modifying clauses: Martinez’s “narrow exception” now applies&para;<br>whenever the “state procedural framework, by reason of&para;<br>its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a&para;<br>typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful&para;<br>opportunity” to raise his claim on direct appeal. Ante, at&para;<br>14.&para;<br>The questions raised by this equitable equation are as&para;<br>endless as will be the state-by-state litigation it takes to&para;<br>work them out. We are not told, for example, how meaningful is meaningful enough, how meaningful-ness is to be&para;<br>measured, how unlikely highly unlikely is, how often a&para;<br>procedural framework’s “operation” must be reassessed, or&para;<br>what case qualifies as the “typical” case. Take just this&para;<br>last example: The case before us involved a jury trial&para;<br>(hardly typical), a capital conviction (even less typical),&para;<br>and—as the majority emphasizes—a particular species of&para;<br>ineffectiveness claim that depends on time-consuming&para;<br>investigation of personal background and other mitigating&para;<br>circumstances. Ante, at 10. Yet the majority holds it up,&para;<br>apparently, as a case that is typical in the relevant sense,&para;<br>saying that “[t]he present capital case illustrates” the&para;<br>“systematic” working of Texas’s procedural framework.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Given that the standard is so opaque and malleable, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>majority cannot describe the exception applied here as&para;<br>narrow, and does not do so. Gone are the repeated words&para;<br>of limitation that characterized the Martinez opinion.&para;<br>Gone too is the clear choice that Martinez gave the States&para;<br>about how to structure their criminal justice systems.&para;<br>Now, the majority offers them a gamble: If a State allows&para;<br>defendants to bring ineffectiveness claims both on direct&para;<br>appeal and in postconviction proceedings, then a prisoner&para;<br>might have to comply with state procedural requirements&para;<br>in order to preserve the availability of federal habeas&para;<br>review, if a federal judge decides that the state system&para;<br>gave the defendant (or enough other “typical” defendants)&para;<br>a sufficiently meaningful opportunity to press his claim.&para;<br>This invitation to litigation will, in precisely the manner&para;<br>that Coleman foreclosed, “ ‘frustrate both the States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith&para;<br>attempts to honor constitutional rights.’ ” Coleman, 501&para;<br>U. S., at 748 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128&para;<br>(1982)). In what I suspect (though cannot know) will be a&para;<br>broad swath of cases, the Court’s approach will excuse&para;<br>procedural defaults that, under Coleman, should preclude&para;<br>federal review. But even in cases where federal courts&para;<br>ultimately decide that the habeas petitioner cannot establish cause under the new standard, the years of procedural&para;<br>wrangling it takes to reach that decision will themselves&para;<br>undermine the finality of sentences necessary to effective&para;<br>criminal justice. Because that approach is inconsistent&para;<br>with Coleman, Martinez itself, and the principles of equitable discretion and comity at the heart of both, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.
