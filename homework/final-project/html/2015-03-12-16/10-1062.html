Argued January 9, 2012—Decided March 21, 2012&para;<br>The Clean Water Act prohibits “the discharge of any pollutant by any&para;<br>person,” 33 U. S. C. §1311, without a permit, into “navigable waters,”&para;<br>§1344. Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may either issue a compliance&para;<br>order or initiate a civil enforcement action. §1319(a)(3). The resulting civil penalty may not “exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation.” §1319(d). The Government contends that the amount doubles&para;<br>to $75,000 when the EPA prevails against a person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply.&para;<br>The Sacketts, petitioners here, received a compliance order from&para;<br>the EPA, which stated that their residential lot contained navigable&para;<br>waters and that their construction project violated the Act. The&para;<br>Sacketts sought declarative and injunctive relief in the Federal District Court, contending that the compliance order was “arbitrary&para;<br>[and] capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §706(2)(A), and that it deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the&para;<br>claims for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Clean Water Act precluded preenforcement judicial review of compliance orders and that such preclusion did not violate due process.&para;<br>Held: The Sacketts may bring a civil action under the APA to challenge&para;<br>the issuance of the EPA’s order. Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>(a) The APA provides for judicial review of “final agency action for&para;<br>which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” 5 U. S.

EPA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 178, requiring the Sacketts to restore their&para;<br>property according to an agency-approved plan and to give the EPA&para;<br>access. Also, “legal consequences . . . flow” from the order, ibid.,&para;<br>which, according to the Government’s litigating position, exposes the&para;<br>Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings. The&para;<br>order also severely limits their ability to obtain a permit for their fill&para;<br>from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C. §1344; 33 CFR&para;<br>§326.3(e)(1)(iv). Further, the order’s issuance marks the “consummation” of the agency’s decisionmaking process, Bennett, supra, at 178,&para;<br>for the EPA’s findings in the compliance order were not subject to&para;<br>further agency review. The Sacketts also had “no other adequate&para;<br>remedy in a court,” 5 U. S. C. §704. A civil action brought by the EPA&para;<br>under 33 U. S. C. §1319 ordinarily provides judicial review in such&para;<br>cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that process. And each day&para;<br>they wait, they accrue additional potential liability. Applying to the&para;<br>Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if&para;<br>that permit is denied also does not provide an adequate remedy for&para;<br>the EPA’s action. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) The Clean Water Act is not a statute that “preclude[s] judicial&para;<br>review” under the APA, 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(1). The APA creates a&para;<br>“presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.”&para;<br>Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349. While&para;<br>this presumption “may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn&para;<br>from the statutory scheme as a whole,” ibid., the Government’s arguments do not support an inference that the Clean Water Act’s statutory scheme precludes APA review.

S. C. §500 et seq., to challenge the issuance by&para;<br>the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of an admin­&para;<br>istrative compliance order under §309 of the Clean Water&para;<br>Act, 33 U. S. C. §1319. The order asserts that the Sack­&para;<br>etts’ property is subject to the Act, and that they have&para;<br>violated its provisions by placing fill material on the prop­&para;<br>erty; and on this basis it directs them immediately to&para;<br>restore the property pursuant to an EPA work plan.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Clean Water Act prohibits, among other things, “the&para;<br>discharge of any pollutant by any person,” §1311, without&para;<br>a permit, into the “navigable waters,” §1344—which the&para;<br>Act defines as “the waters of the United States,” §1362(7).&para;<br>If the EPA determines that any person is in violation of&para;<br>this restriction, the Act directs the agency either to issue&para;<br>a compliance order or to initiate a civil enforcement action.&para;<br>§1319(a)(3). When the EPA prevails in a civil action, the&para;<br>Act provides for “a civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SACKETT v. EPA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>day for each violation.”1 §1319(d). And according to the&para;<br>Government, when the EPA prevails against any person&para;<br>who has been issued a compliance order but has failed&para;<br>to comply, that amount is increased to $75,000—up to&para;<br>$37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional&para;<br>$37,500 for violating the compliance order.&para;<br>The particulars of this case flow from a dispute about&para;<br>the scope of “the navigable waters” subject to this en­&para;<br>forcement regime. Today we consider only whether the&para;<br>dispute may be brought to court by challenging the com­&para;<br>pliance order—we do not resolve the dispute on the merits.&para;<br>The reader will be curious, however, to know what all&para;<br>the fuss is about. In United States v. Riverside Bayview&para;<br>Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 (1985), we upheld a regulation&para;<br>that construed “the navigable waters” to include “freshwa­&para;<br>ter wetlands,” id., at 124, themselves not actually naviga­&para;<br>ble, that were adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters. Later,&para;<br>in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army&para;<br>Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 (2001), we held that an&para;<br>abandoned sand and gravel pit, which “seasonally ponded”&para;<br>but which was not adjacent to open water, id., at 164, was&para;<br>not part of the navigable waters. Then most recently, in&para;<br>Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006), we consid­&para;<br>ered whether a wetland not adjacent to navigable-in-fact&para;<br>waters fell within the scope of the Act. Our answer was&para;<br>no, but no one rationale commanded a majority of the&para;<br>Court. In his separate opinion, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ex­&para;<br>pressed the concern that interested parties would lack&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>original statute set a penalty cap of $25,000 per violation per&para;<br>day. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 104&para;<br>Stat. 890, note following 28 U. S. C. §2461, as amended by the Debt&para;<br>Collection Improvement Act of 1996, §3720E, 110 Stat. 1321–373, note&para;<br>following 28 U. S. C. §2461, p. 1315 (Amendment), authorizes the EPA&para;<br>to adjust that maximum penalty for inflation. On the basis of that&para;<br>authority, the agency has raised the cap to $37,500. See 74 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>626, 627 (2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Their property lies just north of Priest Lake, but is&para;<br>separated from the lake by several lots containing perma­&para;<br>nent structures. In preparation for constructing a house,&para;<br>the Sacketts filled in part of their lot with dirt and rock.&para;<br>Some months later, they received from the EPA a compli­&para;<br>ance order. The order contained a number of “Findings&para;<br>and Conclusions,” including the following:&para;<br>“1.4 [The Sacketts’ property] contains wetlands with­&para;<br>in the meaning of 33 C. F. R. §328.4(8)(b); the wet­&para;<br>lands meet the criteria for jurisdictional wetlands in&para;<br>the 1987 ‘Federal Manual for Identifying and Deline­&para;<br>ating Jurisdictional Wetlands.’&para;<br>“1.5 The Site’s wetlands are adjacent to Priest Lake&para;<br>within the meaning of 33 C.

EPA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“1.11 [The Sacketts’] discharge of pollutants into wa­&para;<br>ters of the United States at the Site without [a] per­&para;<br>mit constitutes a violation of section 301 of the Act, 33&para;<br>U. S. C. §1311.” App. 19–20.&para;<br>On the basis of these findings and conclusions, the order&para;<br>directs the Sacketts, among other things, “immediately&para;<br>[to] undertake activities to restore the Site in accordance&para;<br>with [an EPA-created] Restoration Work Plan” and to “provide and/or obtain access to the Site . . . [and] access to&para;<br>all records and documentation related to the conditions at&para;<br>the Site . . . to EPA employees and/or their designated&para;<br>representatives.” Id., at 21–22, ¶¶2.1, 2.7.&para;<br>The Sacketts, who do not believe that their property is&para;<br>subject to the Act, asked the EPA for a hearing, but that&para;<br>request was denied. They then brought this action in the&para;<br>United States District Court for the District of Idaho,&para;<br>seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their complaint&para;<br>contended that the EPA’s issuance of the compliance order&para;<br>was “arbitrary [and] capricious” under the Administrative&para;<br>Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A), and that it&para;<br>deprived them of “life, liberty, or property, without due&para;<br>process of law,” in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The&para;<br>District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject­&para;<br>matter jurisdiction, and the United States Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 622 F. 3d 1139&para;<br>(2010).&para;<br>It concluded that the Act “preclude[s] pre­&para;<br>enforcement judicial review of compliance orders,” id., at&para;<br>1144, and that such preclusion does not violate the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment’s due process guarantee, id., at 1147. We&para;<br>granted certiorari. 564 U.

S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>order is final agency action. There is no doubt it is agency&para;<br>action, which the APA defines as including even a “failure&para;<br>to act.” §§551(13), 701(b)(2). But is it final? It has all of&para;<br>the hallmarks of APA finality that our opinions establish.&para;<br>Through the order, the EPA “ ‘determined’ ” “ ‘rights or ob­&para;<br>ligations.’ ” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997)&para;<br>(quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71 (1970)).&para;<br>By reason of the order, the Sacketts have the legal obliga­&para;<br>tion to “restore” their property according to an agency­&para;<br>approved Restoration Work Plan, and must give the EPA&para;<br>access to their property and to “records and documentation&para;<br>related to the conditions at the Site.” App. 22, ¶2.7. Also,&para;<br>“ ‘legal consequences . . . flow’ ” from issuance of the order.&para;<br>Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Marine Terminal, supra,&para;<br>at 71). For one, according to the Government’s current&para;<br>litigating position, the order exposes the Sacketts to dou­&para;<br>ble penalties in a future enforcement proceeding.2 It also&para;<br>severely limits the Sacketts’ ability to obtain a permit for&para;<br>their fill from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1344. The Corps’ regulations provide that, once the EPA&para;<br>has issued a compliance order with respect to certain&para;<br>property, the Corps will not process a permit application&para;<br>for that property unless doing so “is clearly appropriate.”&para;<br>33 CFR §326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011).3&para;<br>The issuance of the compliance order also marks the&para;<br>“ ‘consummation’ ” of the agency’s decisionmaking process.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 We do not decide today that the Government’s position is correct,&para;<br>but assume the consequences of the order to be what the Government&para;<br>asserts.&para;<br>3 The regulation provides this consequence for “enforcement litigation&para;<br>that has been initiated by other Federal . . . regulatory agencies.” 33&para;<br>CFR §326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). The Government acknowledges, however,&para;<br>that EPA’s issuance of a compliance order is considered by the Corps to&para;<br>fall within the provision. Brief for Respondents 31. Here again, we&para;<br>take the Government at its word without affirming that it represents a&para;<br>proper interpretation of the regulation.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SACKETT v. EPA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Chicago &amp; Southern Air&para;<br>Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113&para;<br>(1948)). As the Sacketts learned when they unsuccessfully&para;<br>sought a hearing, the “Findings and Conclusions” that the&para;<br>compliance order contained were not subject to further&para;<br>agency review. The Government resists this conclusion,&para;<br>pointing to a portion of the order that invited the Sacketts&para;<br>to “engage in informal discussion of the terms and re­&para;<br>quirements” of the order with the EPA and to inform the&para;<br>agency of “any allegations [t]herein which [they] believe[d]&para;<br>to be inaccurate.” App. 22–23, ¶2.11. But that confers no&para;<br>entitlement to further agency review. The mere possibil­&para;<br>ity that an agency might reconsider in light of “informal&para;<br>discussion” and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not&para;<br>suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.&para;<br>The APA’s judicial review provision also requires that&para;<br>the person seeking APA review of final agency action have&para;<br>“no other adequate remedy in a court,” 5 U. S. C. §704. In&para;<br>Clean Water Act enforcement cases, judicial review ordi­&para;<br>narily comes by way of a civil action brought by the EPA&para;<br>under 33 U. S. C. §1319. But the Sacketts cannot initiate&para;<br>that process, and each day they wait for the agency to drop&para;<br>the hammer, they accrue, by the Government’s telling, an&para;<br>additional $75,000 in potential liability. The other possi­&para;<br>ble route to judicial review—applying to the Corps of&para;<br>Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA&para;<br>if a permit is denied—will not serve either. The remedy&para;<br>for denial of action that might be sought from one agency&para;<br>does not ordinarily provide an “adequate remedy” for action already taken by another agency. The Government,&para;<br>to its credit, does not seriously contend that other availa­&para;<br>ble remedies alone foreclose review under §704. Instead,&para;<br>the Government relies on §701(a)(1) of the APA, which&para;<br>excludes APA review “to the extent that [other] statutes&para;<br>preclude judicial review.” The Clean Water Act, it says, is&para;<br>such a statute.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>Nothing in the Clean Water Act expressly precludes&para;<br>judicial review under the APA or otherwise. But in de­&para;<br>termining “[w]hether and to what extent a particular&para;<br>statute precludes judicial review,” we do not look “only [to]&para;<br>its express language.” Block v. Community Nutrition&para;<br>Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 345 (1984). The APA, we have&para;<br>said, creates a “presumption favoring judicial review of&para;<br>administrative action,” but as with most presumptions,&para;<br>this one “may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn&para;<br>from the statutory scheme as a whole.” Id., at 349. The&para;<br>Government offers several reasons why the statutory&para;<br>scheme of the Clean Water Act precludes review.&para;<br>The Government first points to 33 U. S. C. §1319(a)(3),&para;<br>which provides that, when the EPA “finds that any person&para;<br>is in violation” of certain portions of the Act, the agency&para;<br>“shall issue an order requiring such person to comply&para;<br>with [the Act], or . . . shall bring a civil action [to enforce&para;<br>the Act].” The Government argues that, because Congress&para;<br>gave the EPA the choice between a judicial proceeding and&para;<br>an administrative action, it would undermine the Act to&para;<br>allow judicial review of the latter. But that argument&para;<br>rests on the question-begging premise that the relevant&para;<br>difference between a compliance order and an enforcement&para;<br>proceeding is that only the latter is subject to judicial&para;<br>review. There are eminently sound reasons other than&para;<br>insulation from judicial review why compliance orders&para;<br>are useful. The Government itself suggests that they&para;<br>“provid[e] a means of notifying recipients of potential vio­&para;<br>lations and quickly resolving the issues through voluntary compliance.” Brief for Respondents 39. It is entirely&para;<br>consistent with this function to allow judicial review when&para;<br>the recipient does not choose “voluntary compliance.” The&para;<br>Act does not guarantee the EPA that issuing a compliance&para;<br>order will always be the most effective choice.&para;<br>The Government also notes that compliance orders are&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SACKETT v. EPA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not self-executing, but must be enforced by the agency in&para;<br>a plenary judicial action. It suggests that Congress there­&para;<br>fore viewed a compliance order “as a step in the delibera­&para;<br>tive process[,] . . . rather than as a coercive sanction that&para;<br>itself must be subject to judicial review.” Id., at 38. But&para;<br>the APA provides for judicial review of all final agency&para;<br>actions, not just those that impose a self-executing sanc­&para;<br>tion. And it is hard for the Government to defend its claim&para;<br>that the issuance of the compliance order was just “a step&para;<br>in the deliberative process” when the agency rejected the&para;<br>Sacketts’ attempt to obtain a hearing and when the next&para;<br>step will either be taken by the Sacketts (if they comply&para;<br>with the order) or will involve judicial, not administrative,&para;<br>deliberation (if the EPA brings an enforcement action). As&para;<br>the text (and indeed the very name) of the compliance&para;<br>order makes clear, the EPA’s “deliberation” over whether&para;<br>the Sacketts are in violation of the Act is at an end; the&para;<br>agency may still have to deliberate over whether it is&para;<br>confident enough about this conclusion to initiate litiga­&para;<br>tion, but that is a separate subject.&para;<br>The Government further urges us to consider that Con­&para;<br>gress expressly provided for prompt judicial review, on the&para;<br>administrative record, when the EPA assesses administra­&para;<br>tive penalties after a hearing, see §1319(g)(8), but did not&para;<br>expressly provide for review of compliance orders. But if&para;<br>the express provision of judicial review in one section of&para;<br>a long and complicated statute were alone enough to overcome the APA’s presumption of reviewability for all final&para;<br>agency action, it would not be much of a presumption at&para;<br>all.&para;<br>The cases on which the Government relies simply are&para;<br>not analogous. In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,&para;<br>supra, we held that the Agricultural Marketing Agree­&para;<br>ment Act of 1937, which expressly allowed milk handlers&para;<br>to obtain judicial review of milk market orders, precluded&para;<br>review of milk market orders in suits brought by milk&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>consumers. 467 U. S., at 345–348. Where a statute pro­&para;<br>vides that particular agency action is reviewable at the&para;<br>instance of one party, who must first exhaust administra­&para;<br>tive remedies, the inference that it is not reviewable at the&para;<br>instance of other parties, who are not subject to the admin­&para;<br>istrative process, is strong. In United States v. Erika, Inc.,&para;<br>456 U. S. 201 (1982), we held that the Medicare statute,&para;<br>which expressly provided for judicial review of awards&para;<br>under Part A, precluded review of awards under Part B.&para;<br>Id., at 206–208. The strong parallel between the award&para;<br>provisions in Part A and Part B of the Medicare statute&para;<br>does not exist between the issuance of a compliance order&para;<br>and the assessment of administrative penalties under the&para;<br>Clean Water Act. And in United States v. Fausto, 484&para;<br>U. S. 439 (1988), we held that the Civil Service Reform&para;<br>Act, which expressly excluded certain “nonpreference”&para;<br>employees from the statute’s review scheme, precluded&para;<br>review at the instance of those employees in a separate&para;<br>Claims Court action. Id., at 448–449. Here, there is no&para;<br>suggestion that Congress has sought to exclude compli­&para;<br>ance-order recipients from the Act’s review scheme; quite&para;<br>to the contrary, the Government’s case is premised on the&para;<br>notion that the Act’s primary review mechanisms are open&para;<br>to the Sacketts.&para;<br>Finally, the Government notes that Congress passed the&para;<br>Clean Water Act in large part to respond to the inefficien­&para;<br>cy of then-existing remedies for water pollution. Compli­&para;<br>ance orders, as noted above, can obtain quick remediation&para;<br>through voluntary compliance. The Government warns&para;<br>that the EPA is less likely to use the orders if they are&para;<br>subject to judicial review. That may be true—but it will be&para;<br>true for all agency actions subjected to judicial review.&para;<br>The APA’s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation&para;<br>of the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all.&para;<br>And there is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act&para;<br>was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SACKETT v.

The EPA&para;<br>may issue a compliance order demanding that the owners cease construction, engage in expensive remedial&para;<br>measures, and abandon any use of the property. If the&para;<br>owners do not do the EPA’s bidding, they may be fined up&para;<br>to $75,000 per day ($37,500 for violating the Act and&para;<br>another $37,500 for violating the compliance order). And&para;<br>if the owners want their day in court to show that their lot&para;<br>does not include covered wetlands, well, as a practical&para;<br>matter, that is just too bad. Until the EPA sues them,&para;<br>they are blocked from access to the courts, and the EPA&para;<br>may wait as long as it wants before deciding to sue.

In a nation that values due process, not to mention private property, such treatment is unthinkable.&para;<br>The Court’s decision provides a modest measure of relief. At least, property owners like petitioners will have&para;<br>the right to challenge the EPA’s jurisdictional determination under the Administrative Procedure Act. But the&para;<br>combination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act&para;<br>and the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case still leaves most property owners&para;<br>with little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA’s&para;<br>tune.&para;<br>Real relief requires Congress to do what it should have&para;<br>done in the first place: provide a reasonably clear rule regarding the reach of the Clean Water Act. When Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it provided&para;<br>that the Act covers “the waters of the United States.” 33&para;<br>U. S. C. §1362(7). But Congress did not define what it&para;<br>meant by “the waters of the United States”; the phrase&para;<br>was not a term of art with a known meaning; and the&para;<br>words themselves are hopelessly indeterminate. Unsurprisingly, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers interpreted the phrase as an essentially limitless grant of&para;<br>authority. We rejected that boundless view, see Rapanos&para;<br>v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 732–739 (2006) (plurality&para;<br>opinion); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.&para;<br>Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167–174 (2001),&para;<br>but the precise reach of the Act remains unclear. For 40&para;<br>years, Congress has done nothing to resolve this critical&para;<br>ambiguity, and the EPA has not seen fit to promulgate a&para;<br>rule providing a clear and sufficiently limited definition of&para;<br>the phrase. Instead, the agency has relied on informal&para;<br>guidance. But far from providing clarity and predictability, the agency’s latest informal guidance advises property&para;<br>owners that many jurisdictional determinations concerning wetlands can only be made on a case-by-case basis by&para;<br>EPA field staff.
