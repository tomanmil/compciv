SIRACUSANO&para;<br>ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1156. Argued January 10, 2011—Decided March 22, 2011&para;<br>Respondents filed this securities fraud class action, alleging that peti&para;<br>tioners (hereinafter Matrixx) violated §10(b) of the Securities Ex&para;<br>change Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule&para;<br>10b–5 by failing to disclose reports of a possible link between Ma&para;<br>trixx’s leading product, Zicam Cold Remedy, and loss of smell (anos&para;<br>mia), rendering statements made by Matrixx misleading. Matrixx&para;<br>moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that respondents had not&para;<br>pleaded the element of a material misstatement or omission and the&para;<br>element of scienter. The District Court granted the motion, but the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that the District Court erred in re&para;<br>quiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish material&para;<br>ity, concluding instead that the complaint adequately alleged infor&para;<br>mation linking Zicam and anosmia that would have been significant&para;<br>to a reasonable investor. It also held that Matrixx’s withholding of&para;<br>information about reports of adverse effects and about pending law&para;<br>suits by Zicam users gave rise to a strong inference of scienter.&para;<br>Held: Respondents have stated a claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5.&para;<br>Pp. 8–22.&para;<br>(a) To prevail on their claim, respondents must prove, as relevant&para;<br>here, a material misrepresentation or omission by Matrixx and sci&para;<br>enter. See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,&para;<br>Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157. Matrixx contends that they failed to plead&para;<br>these required elements because they did not allege that the reports&para;<br>Matrixx received reflected statistically significant evidence that Zi&para;<br>cam caused anosmia. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>(b) Respondents have adequately pleaded materiality. Pp. 9–19.&para;<br>(1) Under Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, §10(b)’s material&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ity requirement is satisfied when there is “ ‘a substantial likelihood&para;<br>that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the&para;<br>reasonable investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of&para;<br>information made available.’ ” Id., at 231–232. The Court declined to&para;<br>adopt a bright-line rule for determining materiality in Basic, observ&para;<br>ing that “[a]ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as&para;<br>always determinative of an inherently fact-specific finding such as&para;<br>materiality, must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.”&para;<br>Id., at 236. Here, Matrixx’s bright-line rule—that adverse event re&para;<br>ports regarding a pharmaceutical company’s products are not mate&para;<br>rial absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statisti&para;<br>cally significant risk that the product is causing the events—would&para;<br>“artificially exclud[e]” information that “would otherwise be consid&para;<br>ered significant to [a reasonable investor’s] trading decision.” Ibid.&para;<br>Matrixx’s premise that statistical significance is the only reliable in&para;<br>dication of causation is flawed. Both medical experts and the Food&para;<br>and Drug Administration rely on evidence other than statistically&para;<br>significant data to establish an inference of causation. It thus stands&para;<br>to reason that reasonable investors would act on such evidence. Be&para;<br>cause adverse reports can take many forms, assessing their material&para;<br>ity is a fact-specific inquiry, requiring consideration of their source,&para;<br>content, and context. The question is whether a reasonable investor&para;<br>would have viewed the nondisclosed information “ ‘as having signifi&para;<br>cantly altered the “total mix” of information made available.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>232. Something more than the mere existence of adverse event re&para;<br>ports is needed to satisfy that standard, but that something more is&para;<br>not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source,&para;<br>content, and context of the reports. Pp. 9–16.&para;<br>(2) Applying Basic’s “total mix” standard here, respondents ade&para;<br>quately pleaded materiality. The complaint’s allegations suffice to&para;<br>“raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence”&para;<br>satisfying the materiality requirement, Bell Atlantic Corp. v.&para;<br>Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 556, and to “allo[w] the court to draw the&para;<br>reasonable inference that the defendant is liable,” Ashcroft v. Iqbal,&para;<br>556 U. S. ___, ___. Assuming the complaint’s allegations to be true,&para;<br>Matrixx received reports from medical experts and researchers that&para;<br>plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between Zicam and anos&para;<br>mia. Consumers likely would have viewed Zicam’s risk as substan&para;<br>tially outweighing its benefit. Viewing the complaint’s allegations as&para;<br>a whole, the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to&para;<br>the commercial viability of Matrixx’s leading product. It is substan&para;<br>tially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this infor&para;<br>mation “ ‘as having significantly altered the “total mix” of informa&para;<br>tion made available.’ ”&para;<br>Basic, supra, at 232.&para;<br>Assuming the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>complaint’s allegations to be true, Matrixx told the market that reve&para;<br>nues were going to rise 50 and then 80 percent when it had informa&para;<br>tion indicating a significant risk to its leading revenue-generating&para;<br>product. It also publicly dismissed reports linking Zicam and anos&para;<br>mia and stated that zinc gluconate’s safety was well established,&para;<br>when it had evidence of a biological link between Zicam’s key ingre&para;<br>dient and anosmia and had conducted no studies to disprove that&para;<br>link. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>(c) Respondents have also adequately pleaded scienter, “ ‘a mental&para;<br>state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,’ ” Tellabs,&para;<br>Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. This Court&para;<br>assumes, without deciding, that the scienter requirement may be sat&para;<br>isfied by a showing of deliberate recklessness. Under the Private Se&para;<br>curities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a complaint adequately pleads&para;<br>scienter “only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of sci&para;<br>enter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one&para;<br>could draw from the facts alleged.” Id., at 324. Matrixx’s proposed&para;<br>bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to&para;<br>establish a strong inference of scienter is once again flawed. The&para;<br>complaint’s allegations, “taken collectively,” give rise to a “cogent and&para;<br>compelling” inference that Matrixx elected not to disclose adverse&para;<br>event reports not because it believed they were meaningless but be&para;<br>cause it understood their likely effect on the market. Id., at 323, 324.&para;<br>“[A] reasonable person” would deem the inference that Matrixx acted&para;<br>with deliberate recklessness “at least as compelling as any [plausible]&para;<br>opposing inference.” Id., at 324. Pp. 19–22.&para;<br>585 F. 3d 1167, affirmed.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §78j(b), and Securities and Exchange Commission&para;<br>(SEC) Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5 (2010), based on a&para;<br>pharmaceutical company’s failure to disclose reports of&para;<br>adverse events associated with a product if the reports do&para;<br>not disclose a statistically significant number of adverse&para;<br>events. Respondents, plaintiffs in a securities fraud class&para;<br>action, allege that petitioners, Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.,&para;<br>and three of its executives (collectively Matrixx), failed to&para;<br>disclose reports of a possible link between its leading&para;<br>product, a cold remedy, and loss of smell, rendering state­&para;<br>ments made by Matrixx misleading. Matrixx contends&para;<br>that respondents’ complaint does not adequately allege&para;<br>that Matrixx made a material representation or omission&para;<br>or that it acted with scienter because the complaint does&para;<br>not allege that Matrixx knew of a statistically significant&para;<br>number of adverse events requiring disclosure. We con­&para;<br>clude that the materiality of adverse event reports cannot&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>be reduced to a bright-line rule. Although in many cases&para;<br>reasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse&para;<br>events to be material information, respondents have al­&para;<br>leged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors&para;<br>would have viewed these particular reports as material.&para;<br>Respondents have also alleged facts “giving rise to a&para;<br>strong inference” that Matrixx “acted with the required&para;<br>state of mind.” 15 U. S. C. A. §78u–4(b)(2)(A) (Feb. 2011&para;<br>Supp.). We therefore hold, in agreement with the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, that respondents have&para;<br>stated a claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Through a wholly owned subsidiary, Matrixx develops,&para;<br>manufactures, and markets over-the-counter pharmaceu­&para;<br>tical products. Its core brand of products is called Zicam.&para;<br>All of the products sold under the name Zicam are used to&para;<br>treat the common cold and associated symptoms. At the&para;<br>time of the events in question, one of Matrixx’s products&para;<br>was Zicam Cold Remedy, which came in several forms&para;<br>including nasal spray and gel. The active ingredient in&para;<br>Zicam Cold Remedy was zinc gluconate. Respondents&para;<br>allege that Zicam Cold Remedy accounted for approxi­&para;<br>mately 70 percent of Matrixx’s sales.&para;<br>Respondents initiated this securities fraud class action&para;<br>against Matrixx on behalf of individuals who purchased&para;<br>Matrixx securities between October 22, 2003, and Febru­&para;<br>ary 6, 2004.1 The action principally arises out of state­&para;<br>ments that Matrixx made during the class period relating&para;<br>to revenues and product safety.

Respon­&para;<br>dents’ consolidated amended complaint alleges the follow­&para;<br>ing facts, which the courts below properly assumed to be&para;<br>true. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip&para;<br>op., at 14).&para;<br>In 1999, Dr. Alan Hirsch, neurological director of the&para;<br>Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, Ltd.,&para;<br>called Matrixx’s customer service line after discovering a&para;<br>possible link between Zicam nasal gel and a loss of smell&para;<br>“in a cluster of his patients.” App. 67a–68a. Dr. Hirsch&para;<br>told a Matrixx employee that “previous studies had dem­&para;<br>onstrated that intranasal application of zinc could be&para;<br>problematic.” Id., at 68a. He also told the employee about&para;<br>at least one of his patients who did not have a cold and&para;<br>who developed anosmia after using Zicam.&para;<br>In September 2002, Timothy Clarot, Matrixx’s vice&para;<br>president for research and development, called Miriam&para;<br>Linschoten, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado Health&para;<br>Sciences Center after receiving a complaint from a per­&para;<br>son Linschoten was treating who had lost her sense of&para;<br>smell after using Zicam. Clarot informed Linschoten that&para;<br>Matrixx had received similar complaints from other cus­&para;<br>tomers. Linschoten drew Clarot’s attention to “previous&para;<br>studies linking zinc sulfate to loss of smell.” Ibid. Clarot&para;<br>gave her the impression that he had not heard of the&para;<br>studies. She asked Clarot whether Matrixx had done any&para;<br>studies of its own; he responded that it had not but that it&para;<br>had hired a consultant to review the product. Soon there­&para;<br>after, Linschoten sent Clarot abstracts of the studies she&para;<br>had mentioned. Research from the 1930’s and 1980’s had&para;<br>confirmed “[z]inc’s toxicity.” Id., at 69a. Clarot called&para;<br>Linschoten to ask whether she would be willing to partici­&para;<br>pate in animal studies that Matrixx was planning, but she&para;<br>declined because her focus was human research.&para;<br>By September 2003, one of Linschoten’s colleagues at&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the University of Colorado, Dr. Bruce Jafek, had observed&para;<br>10 patients suffering from anosmia after Zicam use.&para;<br>Linschoten and Jafek planned to present their findings at&para;<br>a meeting of the American Rhinologic Society in a poster&para;<br>presentation entitled “Zicam® Induced Anosmia.” Ibid.&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). The American Rhi­&para;<br>nologic Society posted their abstract in advance of the&para;<br>meeting. The presentation described in detail a 55-year­&para;<br>old man with previously normal taste and smell who&para;<br>experienced severe burning in his nose, followed immedi­&para;<br>ately by a loss of smell, after using Zicam. It also reported&para;<br>10 other Zicam users with similar symptoms.&para;<br>Matrixx learned of the doctors’ planned presentation.&para;<br>Clarot sent a letter to Dr. Jafek warning him that he did&para;<br>not have permission to use Matrixx’s name or the names&para;<br>of its products. Dr. Jafek deleted the references to Zicam&para;<br>in the poster before presenting it to the American Rhi­&para;<br>nologic Society.&para;<br>The following month, two plaintiffs commenced a prod­&para;<br>uct liability lawsuit against Matrixx alleging that Zicam&para;<br>had damaged their sense of smell. By the end of the class&para;<br>period on February 6, 2004, nine plaintiffs had filed four&para;<br>lawsuits.&para;<br>Respondents allege that Matrixx made a series of public&para;<br>statements that were misleading in light of the foregoing&para;<br>information. In October 2003, after they had learned of&para;<br>Dr. Jafek’s study and after Dr. Jafek had presented his&para;<br>findings to the American Rhinologic Society, Matrixx&para;<br>stated that Zicam was “ ‘poised for growth in the upcoming&para;<br>cough and cold season’ ” and that the company had “ ‘very&para;<br>strong momentum.’ ”2 Id., at 72a–74a. Matrixx further&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 At oral argument, counsel for the United States, which submitted an&para;<br>amicus curiae brief in support of respondents, suggested that some of&para;<br>these statements might qualify as nonactionable “puffery.” Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 51–52.

In&para;<br>January 2004, Matrixx raised its revenue guidance, pre­&para;<br>dicting an increase in revenues of 80 percent and earnings&para;<br>per share in the 33-to-38-cent range.&para;<br>In its Form 10–Q filed with the SEC in November 2003,&para;<br>Zicam warned of the potential “ ‘material adverse effect’ ”&para;<br>that could result from product liability claims, “ ‘whether&para;<br>or not proven to be valid.’ ” Id., at 75a–76a. It stated that&para;<br>product liability actions could materially affect Matrixx’s&para;<br>“ ‘product branding and goodwill,’ ” leading to reduced&para;<br>customer acceptance.3 Id., at 76a. It did not disclose,&para;<br>however, that two plaintiffs had already sued Matrixx for&para;<br>allegedly causing them to lose their sense of smell.&para;<br>On January 30, 2004, Dow Jones Newswires reported&para;<br>that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was “ ‘look­&para;<br>ing into complaints that an over-the-counter common-cold&para;<br>medicine manufactured by a unit of Matrixx Initiatives,&para;<br>Inc. (MTXX) may be causing some users to lose their sense&para;<br>of smell’ ” in light of at least three product liability law­&para;<br>suits. Id., at 79a–80a. Matrixx’s stock fell from $13.55 to&para;<br>$11.97 per share after the report. In response, on Febru­&para;<br>ary 2, Matrixx issued a press release that stated:&para;<br>“All Zicam products are manufactured and mar­&para;<br>keted according to FDA guidelines for homeopathic&para;<br>medicine. Our primary concern is the health and&para;<br>safety of our customers and the distribution of factual information about our products.

Rather,&para;<br>the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treat­&para;<br>ment of symptoms related to the common cold have&para;<br>been well established in two double-blind, placebo­&para;<br>controlled, randomized clinical trials. In fact, in nei­&para;<br>ther study were there any reports of anosmia related&para;<br>to the use of this compound. The overall incidence of&para;<br>adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was ex­&para;<br>tremely low, with no statistically significant difference&para;<br>between the adverse event rates for the treated and&para;<br>placebo subsets.&para;<br>“A multitude of environmental and biologic influ­&para;<br>ences are known to affect the sense of smell.

As a result, the&para;<br>population most likely to use cold remedy products is&para;<br>already at increased risk of developing anosmia.&para;<br>Other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include&para;<br>age, nasal and sinus infections, head trauma, ana­&para;<br>tomical obstructions, and environmental irritants.”&para;<br>Id., at 77a–78a (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The day after Matrixx issued this press release, its stock&para;<br>price bounced back to $13.40 per share.&para;<br>On February 6, 2004, the end of the class period, Good&para;<br>Morning America, a nationally broadcast morning news&para;<br>program, highlighted Dr. Jafek’s findings. (The complaint&para;<br>does not allege that Matrixx learned of the news story&para;<br>before its broadcast.) The program reported that Dr. Jafek&para;<br>had discovered more than a dozen patients suffering from&para;<br>anosmia after using Zicam. It also noted that four law­&para;<br>suits had been filed against Matrixx. The price of Matrixx&para;<br>stock plummeted to $9.94 per share that same day. Zicam&para;<br>again issued a press release largely repeating its February&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 82a. According to the Form 8–K, “ ‘In the&para;<br>opinion of the panel, there is insufficient scientific evi­&para;<br>dence at this time to determine if zinc gluconate, when&para;<br>used as recommended, affects a person’s ability to smell.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. A few weeks later, a reporter quoted Matrixx as&para;<br>stating that it would begin conducting “ ‘animal and hu­&para;<br>man studies to further characterize these post-marketing&para;<br>complaints.’ ” Id., at 84a.&para;<br>On the basis of these allegations, respondents claimed&para;<br>that Matrixx violated §10(b) of the Securities Exchange&para;<br>Act and SEC Rule 10b–5 by making untrue statements of&para;<br>fact and failing to disclose material facts necessary to&para;<br>make the statements not misleading in an effort to main­&para;<br>tain artificially high prices for Matrixx securities.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Matrixx moved to dismiss respondents’ complaint, argu­&para;<br>ing that they had failed to plead the elements of a mate­&para;<br>rial misstatement or omission and scienter. The District&para;<br>Court granted the motion to dismiss. Relying on In re&para;<br>Carter-Wallace, Inc., Securities Litigation, 220 F. 3d 36&para;<br>(CA2 2000), it held that respondents had not alleged a&para;<br>“statistically significant correlation between the use of&para;<br>Zicam and anosmia so as to make failure to public[ly]&para;<br>disclose complaints and the University of Colorado study a&para;<br>material omission.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a. The Dis­&para;<br>trict Court similarly agreed that respondents had not&para;<br>stated with particularity facts giving rise to a strong&para;<br>inference of scienter. See 15 U. S. C. A. §78u–4(b)(2)(A)&para;<br>(Feb. 2011 Supp.).

As a result, assessing&para;<br>the materiality of adverse event reports is a “fact-specific”&para;<br>inquiry, Basic, 485 U.

We have not decided whether&para;<br>recklessness suffices to fulfill the scienter requirement.&para;<br>See Tellabs, 551 U. S., at 319, n. 3. Because Matrixx does&para;<br>not challenge the Court of Appeals’ holding that the&para;<br>scienter requirement may be satisfied by a showing of&para;<br>“deliberate recklessness,” see 585 F. 3d, at 1180 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted), we assume, without deciding,&para;<br>that the standard applied by the Court of Appeals is suffi­&para;<br>cient to establish scienter.14&para;<br>Under the PSLRA, a plaintiff must “state with par­&para;<br>ticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the&para;<br>defendant acted with the required state of mind.” 15&para;<br>U. S. C. A. §78u–4(b)(2)(A) (Feb. 2011 Supp.). This stan­&para;<br>dard requires courts to take into account “plausible oppos­&para;<br>ing inferences.” Tellabs, 551 U. S., at 323. A complaint&para;<br>adequately pleads scienter under the PSLRA “only if a&para;<br>reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter&para;<br>cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing infer­&para;<br>ence one could draw from the facts alleged.” Id., at 324.&para;<br>In making this determination, the court must review “all&para;<br>the allegations holistically.” Id., at 326. The absence of a&para;<br>motive allegation, though relevant, is not dispositive. Id.,&para;<br>at 325.&para;<br>Matrixx argues, in summary fashion, that because&para;<br>respondents do not allege that it knew of statistically&para;<br>significant evidence of causation, there is no basis to&para;<br>consider the inference that it acted recklessly or know­&para;<br>ingly to be at least as compelling as the alternative infer­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 Under&para;<br>&para;<br>the PSLRA, if the alleged misstatement or omission is a&para;<br>“forward-looking statement,” the required level of scienter is “actual&para;<br>knowledge.” 15 U. S. C. §78u–5(c)(1)(B). Matrixx has not argued that&para;<br>the statements or omissions here are “forward-looking statement[s].”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ences. “Rather,” it argues, “the most obvious inference is&para;<br>that petitioners did not disclose the [reports] simply be­&para;<br>cause petitioners believed they were far too few . . . to&para;<br>indicate anything meaningful about adverse reactions to&para;<br>use of Zicam.” Brief for Petitioners 49. Matrixx’s pro­&para;<br>posed bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical&para;<br>significance to establish a strong inference of scienter is&para;<br>just as flawed as its approach to materiality.&para;<br>The inference that Matrixx acted recklessly (or inten­&para;<br>tionally, for that matter) is at least as compelling, if not&para;<br>more compelling, than the inference that it simply thought&para;<br>the reports did not indicate anything meaningful about&para;<br>adverse reactions. According to the complaint, Matrixx&para;<br>was sufficiently concerned about the information it re­&para;<br>ceived that it informed Linschoten that it had hired a&para;<br>consultant to review the product, asked Linschoten to&para;<br>participate in animal studies, and convened a panel of&para;<br>physicians and scientists in response to Dr. Jafek’s pres­&para;<br>entation. It successfully prevented Dr. Jafek from using&para;<br>Zicam’s name in his presentation on the ground that he&para;<br>needed Matrixx’s permission to do so. Most significantly,&para;<br>Matrixx issued a press release that suggested that studies&para;<br>had confirmed that Zicam does not cause anosmia when,&para;<br>in fact, it had not conducted any studies relating to anos­&para;<br>mia and the scientific evidence at that time, according to&para;<br>the panel of scientists, was insufficient to determine&para;<br>whether Zicam did or did not cause anosmia.15&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 One of Matrixx’s amici argues that “the most cogent inference re­&para;<br>garding Matrixx’s state of mind is that it delayed releasing information&para;<br>regarding anosmia complaints in order to provide itself an opportunity&para;<br>to carefully review all evidence regarding any link between Zicam and&para;<br>anosmia.” Brief for Washington Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>26. We do not doubt that this may be the most cogent inference in some&para;<br>cases. Here, however, the misleading nature of Matrixx’s press release&para;<br>is sufficient to render the inference of scienter at least as compelling as&para;<br>the inference suggested by amicus.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>These allegations, “taken collectively,” give rise to a&para;<br>“cogent and compelling” inference that Matrixx elected not&para;<br>to disclose the reports of adverse events not because it&para;<br>believed they were meaningless but because it understood&para;<br>their likely effect on the market. Tellabs, 551 U. S., at&para;<br>323, 324. “[A] reasonable person” would deem the infer­&para;<br>ence that Matrixx acted with deliberate recklessness (or&para;<br>even intent) “at least as compelling as any opposing infer­&para;<br>ence one could draw from the facts alleged.” Id., at 324.&para;<br>We conclude, in agreement with the Court of Appeals, that&para;<br>respondents have adequately pleaded scienter.
