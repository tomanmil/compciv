BILL MCCOLLUM,&para;<br>ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA, ET AL.&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–10537.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided November 30, 2009 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Petitioner George Porter is a veteran who was both&para;<br>wounded and decorated for his active participation in two&para;<br>major engagements during the Korean War; his combat&para;<br>service unfortunately left him a traumatized, changed&para;<br>man. His commanding officer’s moving description of&para;<br>those two battles was only a fraction of the mitigating&para;<br>evidence that his counsel failed to discover or present&para;<br>during the penalty phase of his trial in 1988.&para;<br>In this federal postconviction proceeding, the District&para;<br>Court held that Porter’s lawyer’s failure to adduce that&para;<br>evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel&para;<br>and granted his application for a writ of habeas corpus.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, on&para;<br>the ground that the Florida Supreme Court’s determina&para;<br>tion that Porter was not prejudiced by any deficient per&para;<br>formance by his counsel was a reasonable application of&para;<br>Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Like the&para;<br>District Court, we are persuaded that it was objectively&para;<br>unreasonable to conclude there was no reasonable prob&para;<br>ability the sentence would have been different if the sen&para;<br>tencing judge and jury had heard the significant mitiga&para;<br>tion evidence that Porter’s counsel neither uncovered nor&para;<br>presented. We therefore grant the petition for certiorari in&para;<br>part and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 We&para;<br>&para;<br>deny the petition insofar as it challenges his conviction.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Porter was convicted of two counts of first-degree mur&para;<br>der for the shooting of his former girlfriend, Evelyn Wil&para;<br>liams, and her boyfriend Walter Burrows. He was sen&para;<br>tenced to death on the first count but not the second.&para;<br>In July 1986, as his relationship with Williams was&para;<br>ending, Porter threatened to kill her and then left town.&para;<br>When he returned to Florida three months later, he at&para;<br>tempted to see Williams but her mother told him that&para;<br>Williams did not want to see him. He drove past Williams’&para;<br>house each of the two days prior to the shooting, and the&para;<br>night before the murder he visited Williams, who called&para;<br>the police. Porter then went to two cocktail lounges and&para;<br>spent the night with a friend, who testified Porter was&para;<br>quite drunk by 11 p.m. Early the next morning, Porter&para;<br>shot Williams in her house. Burrows struggled with Por&para;<br>ter and forced him outside where Porter shot him.&para;<br>Porter represented himself, with standby counsel, for&para;<br>most of the pretrial proceedings and during the beginning&para;<br>of his trial. Near the completion of the State’s case in&para;<br>chief, Porter pleaded guilty. He thereafter changed his&para;<br>mind about representing himself, and his standby counsel&para;<br>was appointed as his counsel for the penalty phase. Dur&para;<br>ing the penalty phase, the State attempted to prove four&para;<br>aggravating factors: Porter had been “previously con&para;<br>victed” of another violent felony (i.e., in Williams’ case,&para;<br>killing Burrows, and in his case, killing Williams);2 the&para;<br>murder was committed during a burglary; the murder was&para;<br>committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated man&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 It is an aggravating factor under Florida law that “[t]he defendant&para;<br>was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a felony involv&para;<br>ing the use or threat of violence to the person.”&para;<br>Fla. Stat.&para;<br>§921.141(5)(b) (1987). In Porter’s case, the State established that factor&para;<br>by reference to Porter’s contemporaneous convictions stemming from&para;<br>the same episode: two counts of murder and one count of aggravated&para;<br>assault. Tr. 5 (Mar. 4, 1988).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>ner; and the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or&para;<br>cruel. The defense put on only one witness, Porter’s ex&para;<br>wife, and read an excerpt from a deposition. The sum&para;<br>total of the mitigating evidence was inconsistent testi&para;<br>mony about Porter’s behavior when intoxicated and testi&para;<br>mony that Porter had a good relationship with his son.&para;<br>Although his lawyer told the jury that Porter “has other&para;<br>handicaps that weren’t apparent during the trial” and&para;<br>Porter was not “mentally healthy,” he did not put on any&para;<br>evidence related to Porter’s mental health. 3 Tr. 477–478&para;<br>(Jan. 22, 1988).&para;<br>The jury recommended the death sentence for both&para;<br>murders. The trial court found that the State had proved&para;<br>all four aggravating circumstances for the murder of&para;<br>Williams but that only the first two were established with&para;<br>respect to Burrows’ murder. The trial court found no&para;<br>mitigating circumstances and imposed a death sentence&para;<br>for Williams’ murder only. On direct appeal, the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court affirmed the sentence over the dissent of&para;<br>two justices, but struck the heinous, atrocious, or cruel&para;<br>aggravating factor. Porter v. State, 564 So. 2d 1060 (1990)&para;<br>(per curiam). The court found the State had not carried its&para;<br>burden on that factor because the “record is consistent&para;<br>with the hypothesis that Porter’s was a crime of passion,&para;<br>not a crime that was meant to be deliberately and ex&para;<br>traordinarily painful.” Id., at 1063 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>The two dissenting justices would have reversed the pen&para;<br>alty because the evidence of drunkenness, “combined with&para;<br>evidence of Porter’s emotionally charged, desperate, frus&para;<br>trated desire to meet with his former lover, is sufficient to&para;<br>render the death penalty disproportional punishment in&para;<br>this instance.” Id., at 1065–1066 (Barkett, J., concurring&para;<br>in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>In 1995, Porter filed a petition for postconviction relief&para;<br>in state court, claiming his penalty-phase counsel failed to&para;<br>investigate and present mitigating evidence. The court&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>conducted a 2-day evidentiary hearing, during which&para;<br>Porter presented extensive mitigating evidence, all of&para;<br>which was apparently unknown to his penalty-phase&para;<br>counsel. Unlike the evidence presented during Porter’s&para;<br>penalty hearing, which left the jury knowing hardly any&para;<br>thing about him other than the facts of his crimes, the new&para;<br>evidence described his abusive childhood, his heroic mili&para;<br>tary service and the trauma he suffered because of it, his&para;<br>long-term substance abuse, and his impaired mental&para;<br>health and mental capacity.&para;<br>The depositions of his brother and sister described the&para;<br>abuse Porter suffered as a child. Porter routinely wit&para;<br>nessed his father beat his mother, one time so severely&para;<br>that she had to go to the hospital and lost a child. Porter’s&para;<br>father was violent every weekend, and by his siblings’&para;<br>account, Porter was his father’s favorite target, particu&para;<br>larly when Porter tried to protect his mother. On one&para;<br>occasion, Porter’s father shot at him for coming home late,&para;<br>but missed and just beat Porter instead. According to his&para;<br>brother, Porter attended classes for slow learners and left&para;<br>school when he was 12 or 13.&para;<br>To escape his horrible family life, Porter enlisted in the&para;<br>Army at age 17 and fought in the Korean War. His com&para;<br>pany commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Pratt,&para;<br>testified at Porter’s postconviction hearing. Porter was&para;<br>with the 2d Division, which had advanced above the 38th&para;<br>parallel to Kunu-ri when it was attacked by Chinese&para;<br>forces. Porter suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during&para;<br>the advance but was with the unit for the battle at Kunu&para;<br>ri. While the Eighth Army was withdrawing, the 2d Divi&para;<br>sion was ordered to hold off the Chinese advance, enabling&para;<br>the bulk of the Eighth Army to live to fight another day.&para;<br>As Colonel Pratt described it, the unit “went into position&para;<br>there in bitter cold night, terribly worn out, terribly&para;<br>weary, almost like zombies because we had been in con&para;<br>stant—for five days we had been in constant contact with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the enemy fighting our way to the rear, little or no sleep,&para;<br>little or no food, literally as I say zombies.” 1 Tr. 138 (Jan.&para;<br>4, 1996). The next morning, the unit engaged in a “fierce&para;<br>hand-to-hand fight with the Chinese” and later that day&para;<br>received permission to withdraw, making Porter’s regi&para;<br>ment the last unit of the Eighth Army to withdraw. Id., at&para;<br>139–140.&para;<br>Less than three months later, Porter fought in a second&para;<br>battle, at Chip’yong-ni. His regiment was cut off from the&para;<br>rest of the Eighth Army and defended itself for two days&para;<br>and two nights under constant fire. After the enemy broke&para;<br>through the perimeter and overtook defensive positions on&para;<br>high ground, Porter’s company was charged with retaking&para;<br>those positions. In the charge up the hill, the soldiers&para;<br>“were under direct open fire of the enemy forces on top of&para;<br>the hill. They immediately came under mortar, artillery,&para;<br>machine gun, and every other kind of fire you can imagine&para;<br>and they were just dropping like flies as they went along.”&para;<br>Id., at 150. Porter’s company lost all three of its platoon&para;<br>sergeants, and almost all of the officers were wounded.&para;<br>Porter was again wounded and his company sustained the&para;<br>heaviest losses of any troops in the battle, with more than&para;<br>50% casualties. Colonel Pratt testified that these battles&para;<br>were “very trying, horrifying experiences,” particularly for&para;<br>Porter’s company at Chip’yong-ni. Id., at 152. Porter’s&para;<br>unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for the&para;<br>engagement at Chip’yong-ni, and Porter individually&para;<br>received two Purple Hearts and the Combat Infantryman&para;<br>Badge, along with other decorations.&para;<br>Colonel Pratt testified that Porter went absent without&para;<br>leave (AWOL) for two periods while in Korea. He ex&para;<br>plained that this was not uncommon, as soldiers some&para;<br>times became disoriented and separated from the unit,&para;<br>and that the commander had decided not to impose any&para;<br>punishment for the absences. In Colonel Pratt’s experi&para;<br>ence, an “awful lot of [veterans] come back nervous&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>wrecks. Our [veterans’] hospitals today are filled with&para;<br>people mentally trying to survive the perils and hardships&para;<br>[of] . . . the Korean War,” particularly those who fought in&para;<br>the battles he described. Id., at 153.&para;<br>When Porter returned to the United States, he went&para;<br>AWOL for an extended period of time.3 He was sentenced&para;<br>to six months’ imprisonment for that infraction, but he&para;<br>received an honorable discharge. After his discharge, he&para;<br>suffered dreadful nightmares and would attempt to climb&para;<br>his bedroom walls with knives at night.4 Porter’s family&para;<br>eventually removed all of the knives from the house.&para;<br>According to Porter’s brother, Porter developed a serious&para;<br>drinking problem and began drinking so heavily that he&para;<br>would get into fights and not remember them at all.&para;<br>In addition to this testimony regarding his life history,&para;<br>Porter presented an expert in neuropsychology, Dr. Dee,&para;<br>who had examined Porter and administered a number of&para;<br>psychological assessments. Dr. Dee concluded that Porter&para;<br>suffered from brain damage that could manifest in impul&para;<br>sive, violent behavior. At the time of the crime, Dr. Dee&para;<br>testified, Porter was substantially impaired in his ability&para;<br>to conform his conduct to the law and suffered from an&para;<br>extreme mental or emotional disturbance, two statutory&para;<br>mitigating circumstances, Fla. Stat. §921.141(6). Dr. Dee&para;<br>also testified that Porter had substantial difficulties with&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Porter explained to one of the doctors who examined him for compe&para;<br>tency to stand trial that he went AWOL in order to spend time with his&para;<br>son. Record 904.&para;<br>4 Porter’s expert testified that these symptoms would “easily” warrant&para;<br>a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 2 Tr. 233 (Jan. 5,&para;<br>1996). PTSD is not uncommon among veterans returning from combat.&para;<br>See Hearing on Fiscal Year 2010 Budget for Veterans’ Programs before&para;<br>the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., 63&para;<br>(2009) (uncorrected copy) (testimony of Eric K. Shinseki, Secretary of&para;<br>Veterans Affairs (VA), reporting that approximately 23 percent of the&para;<br>Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans seeking treatment at a VA medical&para;<br>facility had been preliminarily diagnosed with PTSD).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Although the State’s experts reached&para;<br>different conclusions regarding the statutory mitigators,5&para;<br>each expert testified that he could not diagnose Porter or&para;<br>rule out a brain abnormality. 2 Tr. 345, 382 (Jan. 5,&para;<br>1996); 3 id., at 405.&para;<br>The trial judge who conducted the state postconviction&para;<br>hearing, without determining counsel’s deficiency, held&para;<br>that Porter had not been prejudiced by the failure to in&para;<br>troduce any of that evidence. Record 1203, 1206. He&para;<br>found that Porter had failed to establish any statutory&para;<br>mitigating circumstances, id., at 1207, and that the non&para;<br>statutory mitigating evidence would not have made a&para;<br>difference in the outcome of the case, id., at 1210. He&para;<br>discounted the evidence of Porter’s alcohol abuse because&para;<br>it was inconsistent and discounted the evidence of Porter’s&para;<br>abusive childhood because he was 54 years old at the time&para;<br>of the trial. He also concluded that Porter’s periods of&para;<br>being AWOL would have reduced the impact of Porter’s&para;<br>military service to “inconsequential proportions.” Id., at&para;<br>1212. Finally, he held that even considering all three&para;<br>categories of evidence together, the “trial judge and jury&para;<br>still would have imposed death.” Id., at 1214.&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court affirmed. It first accepted&para;<br>the trial court’s finding that Porter could not have estab&para;<br>lished any statutory mitigating circumstances, based on&para;<br>the trial court’s acceptance of the State’s experts’ conclu&para;<br>sions in that regard. Porter v. State, 788 So. 2d 917, 923&para;<br>(2001) (per curiam). It then held the trial court was cor&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>State presented two experts, Dr. Riebsame and Dr. Kirkland.&para;<br>Neither of the State’s experts had examined Porter, but each testified&para;<br>that based upon their review of the record, Porter met neither statutory&para;<br>mitigating circumstance.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>rect to find “the additional nonstatutory mitigation to be&para;<br>lacking in weight because of the specific facts presented.”&para;<br>Id., at 925. Like the postconviction court, the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court reserved judgment regarding counsel’s&para;<br>deficiency. Ibid.6 Two justices dissented, reasoning that&para;<br>counsel’s failure to investigate and present mitigating&para;<br>evidence was “especially harmful” because of the divided&para;<br>vote affirming the sentence on direct appeal—“even with&para;<br>out the substantial mitigation that we now know ex&para;<br>isted”—and because of the reversal of the heinous, atro&para;<br>cious, and cruel aggravating factor. Id., at 937 (Anstead,&para;<br>J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>Porter thereafter filed his federal habeas petition. The&para;<br>District Court held Porter’s penalty-phase counsel had&para;<br>been ineffective. It first determined that counsel’s per&para;<br>formance had been deficient because “penalty-phase coun&para;<br>sel did little, if any investigation . . . and failed to effec&para;<br>tively advocate on behalf of his client before the jury.”&para;<br>Porter v. Crosby, No. 6:03–cv–1465–Orl–31KRS, 2007 WL&para;<br>1747316, *23 (MD Fla., June 18, 2007). It then deter&para;<br>mined that counsel’s deficient performance was prejudi&para;<br>cial, finding that the state court’s decision was contrary to&para;<br>clearly established law in part because the state court&para;<br>failed to consider the entirety of the evidence when re&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The postconviction court stated defense counsel “was not ineffective&para;<br>for failing to pursue mental health evaluations and . . . [Porter] has&para;<br>thus failed to show sufficient evidence that any statutory mitigators&para;<br>could have been presented.” Record 1210. It is not at all clear whether&para;<br>this stray comment addressed counsel’s deficiency. If it did, then it was&para;<br>at most dicta, because the court expressly “decline[d] to make a deter&para;<br>mination regarding whether or not Defense Counsel was in fact defi&para;<br>cient here.” Id., at 1206. The Florida Supreme Court simply para&para;<br>phrased the postconviction court when it stated “trial counsel’s decision&para;<br>not to pursue mental evaluations did not exceed the bounds for compe&para;<br>tent counsel.” Porter v. State, 788 So. 2d 917, 923–924 (2001) (per&para;<br>curiam). But that court also expressly declined to answer the question&para;<br>of deficiency. Id., at 925.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>weighing the evidence in mitigation, including the trial&para;<br>evidence suggesting that “this was a crime of passion, that&para;<br>[Porter] was drinking heavily just hours before the mur&para;<br>ders, or that [Porter] had a good relationship with his&para;<br>son.” Id., at *30.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit reversed. It held the District&para;<br>Court had failed to appropriately defer to the state court’s&para;<br>factual findings with respect to Porter’s alcohol abuse and&para;<br>his mental health. 552 F. 3d 1260, 1274, 1275 (2008) (per&para;<br>curiam). The Court of Appeals then separately considered&para;<br>each category of mitigating evidence and held it was not&para;<br>unreasonable for the state court to discount each category&para;<br>as it did. Id., at 1274. Porter petitioned for a writ of&para;<br>certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse with respect&para;<br>to the Court of Appeals’ disposition of Porter’s ineffectiveassistance claim.&para;<br>II&para;<br>To prevail under Strickland, Porter must show that his&para;<br>counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him. To estab&para;<br>lish deficiency, Porter must show his “counsel’s represen&para;<br>tation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.”&para;<br>466 U. S., at 688. To establish prejudice, he “must show&para;<br>that there is a reasonable probability that, but for coun&para;<br>sel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding&para;<br>would have been different.” Id., at 694. Finally, Porter is&para;<br>entitled to relief only if the state court’s rejection of his&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was “contrary to,&para;<br>or involved an unreasonable application of” Strickland, or&para;<br>it rested “on an unreasonable determination of the facts in&para;<br>light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed&para;<br>ing.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d).&para;<br>Because the state court did not decide whether Porter’s&para;<br>counsel was deficient, we review this element of Porter’s&para;<br>Strickland claim de novo. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S.&para;<br>374, 390 (2005). It is unquestioned that under the prevail&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>ing professional norms at the time of Porter’s trial, counsel&para;<br>had an “obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of&para;<br>the defendant’s background.” Williams v. Taylor, 529&para;<br>U. S. 362, 396 (2000). The investigation conducted by&para;<br>Porter’s counsel clearly did not satisfy those norms.&para;<br>Although Porter had initially elected to represent him&para;<br>self, his standby counsel became his counsel for the pen&para;<br>alty phase a little over a month prior to the sentencing&para;<br>proceeding before the jury. It was the first time this law&para;<br>yer had represented a defendant during a penalty-phase&para;<br>proceeding. At the postconviction hearing, he testified&para;<br>that he had only one short meeting with Porter regarding&para;<br>the penalty phase. He did not obtain any of Porter’s&para;<br>school, medical, or military service records or interview&para;<br>any members of Porter’s family. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539&para;<br>U. S. 510, 524, 525 (2003), we held counsel “fell short of&para;<br>. . . professional standards” for not expanding their inves&para;<br>tigation beyond the presentence investigation report and&para;<br>one set of records they obtained, particularly “in light of&para;<br>what counsel actually discovered” in the records. Here,&para;<br>counsel did not even take the first step of interviewing&para;<br>witnesses or requesting records. Cf. Bobby v. Van Hook,&para;<br>ante, at 6–8 (holding performance not deficient when&para;<br>counsel gathered a substantial amount of information and&para;<br>then made a reasonable decision not to pursue additional&para;<br>sources); Strickland, 466 U. S., at 699 (“[Counsel’s] deci&para;<br>sion not to seek more character or psychological evidence&para;<br>than was already in hand was . . . reasonable”). Beyond&para;<br>that, like the counsel in Wiggins, he ignored pertinent&para;<br>avenues for investigation of which he should have been&para;<br>aware. The court-ordered competency evaluations, for&para;<br>example, collectively reported Porter’s very few years of&para;<br>regular school, his military service and wounds sustained&para;<br>in combat, and his father’s “over-disciplin[e].” Record&para;<br>902–906. As an explanation, counsel described Porter as&para;<br>fatalistic and uncooperative. But he acknowledged that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>although Porter instructed him not to speak with Porter’s&para;<br>ex-wife or son, Porter did not give him any other instruc&para;<br>tions limiting the witnesses he could interview.&para;<br>Counsel thus failed to uncover and present any evidence&para;<br>of Porter’s mental health or mental impairment, his family&para;<br>background, or his military service. The decision not to&para;<br>investigate did not reflect reasonable professional judg&para;<br>ment. Wiggins, supra, at 534. Porter may have been&para;<br>fatalistic or uncooperative, but that does not obviate the&para;<br>need for defense counsel to conduct some sort of mitigation&para;<br>investigation. See Rompilla, supra, at 381–382.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Because we find Porter’s counsel deficient, we must&para;<br>determine whether the Florida Supreme Court unrea&para;<br>sonably applied Strickland in holding Porter was not&para;<br>prejudiced by that deficiency. Under Strickland, a defen&para;<br>dant is prejudiced by his counsel’s deficient performance if&para;<br>“there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s&para;<br>unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would&para;<br>have been different.” 466 U. S., at 694. In Florida, the&para;<br>sentencing judge makes the determination as to the exis&para;<br>tence and weight of aggravating and mitigating circum&para;<br>stances and the punishment, Fla. Stat. §921.141(3), but he&para;<br>must give the jury verdict of life or death “great weight,”&para;<br>Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (per cu&para;<br>riam). Porter must show that but for his counsel’s defi&para;<br>ciency, there is a reasonable probability he would have&para;<br>received a different sentence. To assess that probability,&para;<br>we consider “the totality of the available mitigation evi&para;<br>dence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence ad&para;<br>duced in the habeas proceeding”—and “reweig[h] it&para;<br>against the evidence in aggravation.” Williams, supra, at&para;<br>397–398.&para;<br>This is not a case in which the new evidence “would&para;<br>barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sentencing judge.” Strickland, supra, at 700. The judge&para;<br>and jury at Porter’s original sentencing heard almost&para;<br>nothing that would humanize Porter or allow them to&para;<br>accurately gauge his moral culpability. They learned&para;<br>about Porter’s turbulent relationship with Williams, his&para;<br>crimes, and almost nothing else. Had Porter’s counsel&para;<br>been effective, the judge and jury would have learned of&para;<br>the “kind of troubled history we have declared relevant to&para;<br>assessing a defendant’s moral culpability.” Wiggins, su&para;<br>pra, at 535. They would have heard about (1) Porter’s&para;<br>heroic military service in two of the most critical—and&para;<br>horrific—battles of the Korean War, (2) his struggles to&para;<br>regain normality upon his return from war, (3) his child&para;<br>hood history of physical abuse, and (4) his brain abnormal&para;<br>ity, difficulty reading and writing, and limited schooling.&para;<br>See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 219 (1989)&para;<br>(“ ‘[E]vidence about the defendant’s background and char&para;<br>acter is relevant because of the belief, long held by this&para;<br>society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are&para;<br>attributable to a disadvantaged background . . . may be&para;<br>less culpable’ ”). Instead, they heard absolutely none of&para;<br>that evidence, evidence which “might well have influenced&para;<br>the jury’s appraisal of [Porter’s] moral culpability.” Wil&para;<br>liams, 529 U. S., at 398.&para;<br>On the other side of the ledger, the weight of evidence in&para;<br>aggravation is not as substantial as the sentencing judge&para;<br>thought. As noted, the sentencing judge accepted the&para;<br>jury’s recommendation of a death sentence for the murder&para;<br>of Williams but rejected the jury’s death-sentence recom&para;<br>mendation for the murder of Burrows. The sentencing&para;<br>judge believed that there were four aggravating circum&para;<br>stances related to the Williams murder but only two for&para;<br>the Burrows murder. Accordingly, the judge must have&para;<br>reasoned that the two aggravating circumstances that&para;<br>were present in both cases were insufficient to warrant a&para;<br>death sentence but that the two additional aggravating&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>circumstances present with respect to the Williams mur&para;<br>der were sufficient to tip the balance in favor of a death&para;<br>sentence. But the Florida Supreme Court rejected one of&para;<br>these additional aggravating circumstances, i.e., that&para;<br>Williams’ murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or&para;<br>cruel, finding the murder “consistent with . . . a crime of&para;<br>passion” even though premeditated to a heightened de&para;<br>gree. 564 So. 2d, at 1063–1064. Had the judge and jury&para;<br>been able to place Porter’s life history “on the mitigating&para;<br>side of the scale,” and appropriately reduced the ballast on&para;<br>the aggravating side of the scale, there is clearly a reason&para;<br>able probability that the advisory jury—and the sentenc&para;<br>ing judge—“would have struck a different balance,” Wig&para;<br>gins, 539 U. S., at 537, and it is unreasonable to conclude&para;<br>otherwise.&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court’s decision that Porter was&para;<br>not prejudiced by his counsel’s failure to conduct a thor&para;<br>ough—or even cursory—investigation is unreasonable.&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court either did not consider or&para;<br>unreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence adduced&para;<br>in the postconviction hearing. Under Florida law, mental&para;<br>health evidence that does not rise to the level of establish&para;<br>ing a statutory mitigating circumstance may nonetheless&para;<br>be considered by the sentencing judge and jury as mitigat&para;<br>ing. See, e.g., Hoskins v. State, 965 So. 2d 1, 17–18 (Fla.&para;<br>2007) (per curiam). Indeed, the Constitution requires that&para;<br>“the sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to con&para;<br>sider any relevant mitigating factor.” Eddings v. Okla&para;<br>homa, 455 U. S. 104, 112 (1982). Yet neither the postcon&para;<br>viction trial court nor the Florida Supreme Court gave any&para;<br>consideration for the purpose of nonstatutory mitigation to&para;<br>Dr. Dee’s testimony regarding the existence of a brain&para;<br>abnormality and cognitive defects.7 While the State’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged that Porter had pre&para;<br>sented evidence of “statutory and nonstatutory mental mitigation,” 788&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PORTER v. MCCOLLUM&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>experts identified perceived problems with the tests that&para;<br>Dr. Dee used and the conclusions that he drew from them,&para;<br>it was not reasonable to discount entirely the effect that&para;<br>his testimony might have had on the jury or the sentenc&para;<br>ing judge.&para;<br>Furthermore, the Florida Supreme Court, following the&para;<br>state postconviction court, unreasonably discounted the&para;<br>evidence of Porter’s childhood abuse and military service.&para;<br>It is unreasonable to discount to irrelevance the evidence&para;<br>of Porter’s abusive childhood, especially when that kind of&para;<br>history may have particular salience for a jury evaluating&para;<br>Porter’s behavior in his relationship with Williams. It is&para;<br>also unreasonable to conclude that Porter’s military ser&para;<br>vice would be reduced to “inconsequential proportions,”&para;<br>788 So. 2d, at 925, simply because the jury would also&para;<br>have learned that Porter went AWOL on more than one&para;<br>occasion. Our Nation has a long tradition of according&para;<br>leniency to veterans in recognition of their service, espe&para;<br>cially for those who fought on the front lines as Porter&para;<br>did.8 Moreover, the relevance of Porter’s extensive combat&para;<br>experience is not only that he served honorably under&para;<br>extreme hardship and gruesome conditions, but also that&para;<br>the jury might find mitigating the intense stress and&para;<br>mental and emotional toll that combat took on Porter.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>So. 2d, at 921, but it did not consider Porter’s mental health evidence in&para;<br>its discussion of nonstatutory mitigating evidence, id., at 924.&para;<br>8 See Abbott, The Civil War and the Crime Wave of 1865–70, 1 Soc.&para;<br>Serv.
