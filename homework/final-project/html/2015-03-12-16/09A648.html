We&para;<br>resolve that question without expressing any view on&para;<br>whether such trials should be broadcast. We instead&para;<br>determine that the broadcast in this case should be stayed&para;<br>because it appears the courts below did not follow the&para;<br>appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before&para;<br>changing their rules to allow such broadcasting. Courts&para;<br>enforce the requirement of procedural regularity on oth&para;<br>ers, and must follow those requirements themselves.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>This lawsuit, still in a preliminary stage, involves an&para;<br>action challenging what the parties refer to as Proposition&para;<br>8, a California ballot proposition adopted by the electorate.&para;<br>Proposition 8 amended the State Constitution by adding a&para;<br>new section providing that “[o]nly marriage between a&para;<br>man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”&para;<br>Cal. Const. Art. I, §7.5. The plaintiffs contend that Propo&para;<br>sition 8 violates the United States Constitution. A bench&para;<br>trial in the case began on Monday, January 11, 2010, in&para;<br>the United States District Court for the Northern District&para;<br>of California.&para;<br>The District Court has issued an order permitting the&para;<br>trial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to&para;<br>a number of federal courthouses around the country. The&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>order was issued pursuant to a purported amendment to a&para;<br>local Rule of the District Court. That Rule had previously&para;<br>forbidden the broadcasting of trials outside the courthouse&para;<br>in which a trial takes place. The District Court effected its&para;<br>amendment via several postings on the District Court’s&para;<br>Web site in the days immediately before the trial in this&para;<br>case was to begin.&para;<br>Applicants here are defendant-intervenors in the law&para;<br>suit. They object to the District Court’s order, arguing&para;<br>that the District Court violated a federal statute by prom&para;<br>ulgating the amendment to its local Rule without suffi&para;<br>cient opportunity for notice and comment and that the&para;<br>public broadcast would violate their due process rights to a&para;<br>fair and impartial trial. Applicants seek a stay of the&para;<br>order pending the filing of petitions for writs of certiorari&para;<br>and mandamus. We granted a temporary stay to consider&para;<br>the issue further. Post, p. ___. Concluding that the appli&para;<br>cants have made a sufficient showing of entitlement to&para;<br>relief, we now grant a stay.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Proposition 8 was passed by California voters in No&para;<br>vember 2008. It was a ballot proposition designed to&para;<br>overturn a ruling by the California Supreme Court that&para;<br>had given same-sex couples a right to marry. Proposition&para;<br>8 was and is the subject of public debate throughout the&para;<br>State and, indeed, nationwide. Its advocates claim that&para;<br>they have been subject to harassment as a result of public&para;<br>disclosure of their support.

Schwarzenegger, No. 3:09–cv–02292 (ND Cal.)&para;<br>(hereinafter Defendant-Intervenors’ Motion).&para;<br>Respondents filed suit in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Northern District of California, seeking to&para;<br>invalidate Proposition 8. They contend that the amend&para;<br>ment to the State’s Constitution violates the Equal Protec&para;<br>tion and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ment of the United States Constitution. The State of&para;<br>California declined to defend Proposition 8, and the defen&para;<br>dant-intervenors (who are the applicants here) entered the&para;<br>suit to defend its constitutionality. A bench trial began on&para;<br>Monday, January 11, 2010, before the Chief Judge of the&para;<br>District Court, the Honorable Vaughn R. Walker.&para;<br>On September 25, 2009, the District Court informed the&para;<br>parties at a hearing that there was interest in the possibil&para;<br>ity that the trial would be broadcast. Respondents indi&para;<br>cated their support for the idea, while applicants opposed&para;<br>it. The court noted that “[t]here are, of course, Judicial&para;<br>Conference positions on this,” but also that “[t]his is all in&para;<br>flux.” Exh. 9, p. 72, App. to Pet. for Mandamus in No. 10–&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>70063 (CA9) (hereinafter App. to Pet.).&para;<br>One month later, Chief Judge Kozinski of the United&para;<br>States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appointed a&para;<br>three-judge committee to evaluate the possibility of adopt&para;<br>ing a Ninth Circuit Rule regarding the recording and&para;<br>transmission of district court proceedings. The committee&para;<br>(of which Chief Judge Walker was a member) recom&para;<br>mended to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council that district&para;<br>courts be permitted to experiment with broadcasting court&para;<br>proceedings on a trial basis. Chief Judge Walker later&para;<br>acknowledged that while the committee was considering&para;<br>the pilot program, “this case was very much in mind at&para;<br>that time because it had come to prominence then and was&para;<br>thought to be an ideal candidate for consideration.” Id.,&para;<br>Exh. 2, at 42. The committee did not publicly disclose its&para;<br>consideration of the proposal, nor did it solicit or receive&para;<br>public comments on the proposal.&para;<br>On December 17, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council&para;<br>issued a news release indicating that it had approved a&para;<br>pilot program for “the limited use of cameras in federal&para;<br>district courts within the circuit.” Id., Exh. 13, at 1. The&para;<br>release explained that the Council’s decision “amend[ed] a&para;<br>1996 Ninth Circuit policy” that had banned the photo&para;<br>graphing, as well as radio and television coverage, of court&para;<br>proceedings. Ibid. The release further indicated that&para;<br>cases would be selected for participation in the program&para;<br>“by the chief judge of the district court in consultation&para;<br>with the chief circuit judge.” Ibid. No further guidelines&para;<br>for participation in the pilot program have since been&para;<br>issued.&para;<br>On December 21, a coalition of media companies re&para;<br>quested permission from the District Court to televise the&para;<br>trial challenging Proposition 8. Two days later, the court&para;<br>indicated on its Web site that it had amended Civil Local&para;<br>Rule 77–3, which had previously banned the recording or&para;<br>broadcast of court proceedings. The revised version of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Rule 77–3 created an exception to this general prohibition&para;<br>to allow “for participation in a pilot or other project au&para;<br>thorized by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.” Id.,&para;<br>Exh. 14. Applicants objected to the revision, arguing that&para;<br>any change to Ninth Circuit or local rules would require a&para;<br>sufficient notice and comment period.&para;<br>On December 31, the District Court revised its Web site&para;<br>to remove the previous announcement about the change to&para;<br>Rule 77–3. A new announcement was posted indicating a&para;<br>“proposed revision of Civil Local Rule 77–3,” which had&para;<br>been “approved for public comment.” Id., Exh. 17. The&para;<br>proposed revision was the same as the previously an&para;<br>nounced amendment. Comments on the proposed revision&para;<br>were to be submitted by Friday, January 8, 2010.&para;<br>On January 4, 2010, the District Court again revised its&para;<br>Web site. The announcement regarding the proposed&para;<br>revision of Rule 77–3 was removed and replaced with a&para;<br>third version of the announcement. This third version&para;<br>stated that the revised Rule was “effective December 22,&para;<br>2009,” and that “[t]he revised rule was adopted pursuant&para;<br>to the ‘immediate need’ provision of Title 28 Section&para;<br>2071(e).” Id., Exh. 19, at 3.&para;<br>On January 6, 2010, the District Court held a hearing&para;<br>regarding the recording and broadcasting of the upcoming&para;<br>trial. The court announced that an audio and video feed of&para;<br>trial proceedings would be streamed live to certain court&para;<br>houses in other cities. It also announced that, pending&para;<br>approval of the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, the trial&para;<br>would be recorded and then broadcast on the Internet. A&para;<br>court technician explained that the proceedings would be&para;<br>recorded by three cameras, and then the resulting broad&para;<br>cast would be uploaded for posting on the Internet, with a&para;<br>delay due to processing requirements.&para;<br>On January 7, 2010, the District Court filed an order&para;<br>formally requesting that Chief Judge Kozinski approve&para;<br>“inclusion of the trial in the pilot project on the terms and&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>conditions discussed at the January 6, 2010, hearing and&para;<br>subject to resolution of certain technical issues.” Id., Exh.&para;<br>1, at 2. Applicants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus&para;<br>in the Court of Appeals, seeking to prohibit or stay the&para;<br>District Court from enforcing its order. The following day,&para;<br>a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals denied the&para;<br>petition.&para;<br>On January 8, 2010, Chief Judge Kozinski issued an&para;<br>order approving the District Court’s decision to allow real&para;<br>time streaming of the trial to certain federal courthouses&para;<br>listed in a simultaneously issued press release. Five&para;<br>locations had been selected: federal courthouses in San&para;<br>Francisco, Pasadena, Seattle, Portland, and Brooklyn.&para;<br>The press release also indicated that “[a]dditional sites&para;<br>may be announced.” Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote&para;<br>Viewing&para;<br>of&para;<br>Proposition&para;<br>8&para;<br>Trial,&para;<br>online&para;<br>at&para;<br>http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/&para;<br>Prop8_Remote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13,&para;<br>2010, and available in the Clerk of Court’s case file).&para;<br>Chief Judge Kozinski’s January 8 order noted that the&para;<br>request to broadcast the trial on the Internet was “still&para;<br>pending” before him. In a later letter to Chief Judge&para;<br>Walker, he explained that the request was not yet “ripe for&para;<br>approval” because “the technical staff encountered some&para;<br>unexpected difficulties preparing a satisfactory video&para;<br>suitable for on-line posting.” Letter of Jan. 9, 2010 (avail&para;<br>able in Clerk of Court’s case file). A final decision whether&para;<br>to permit online publication would be made when techni&para;<br>cal difficulties were resolved.&para;<br>On January 9, 2010, applicants filed in this Court an&para;<br>application for a stay of the District Court’s order. Their&para;<br>petition seeks a stay pending resolution of forthcoming&para;<br>petitions for the writs of certiorari and mandamus.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The question whether courtroom proceedings should be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>broadcast has prompted considerable national debate.&para;<br>Reasonable minds differ on the proper resolution of that&para;<br>debate and on the restrictions, circumstances, and proce&para;<br>dures under which such broadcasts should occur. We do&para;<br>not here express any views on the propriety of broadcast&para;<br>ing court proceedings generally.&para;<br>Instead, our review is confined to a narrow legal issue:&para;<br>whether the District Court’s amendment of its local rules&para;<br>to broadcast this trial complied with federal law. We&para;<br>conclude that it likely did not and that applicants have&para;<br>demonstrated that irreparable harm would likely result&para;<br>from the District Court’s actions. We therefore stay the&para;<br>court’s January 7, 2010, order to the extent that it permits&para;<br>the live streaming of court proceedings to other federal&para;<br>courthouses. We do not address other aspects of that&para;<br>order, such as those related to the broadcast of court pro&para;<br>ceedings on the Internet, as this may be premature.&para;<br>A&para;<br>To obtain a stay pending the filing and disposition of a&para;<br>petition for a writ of certiorari, an applicant must show&para;<br>(1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider&para;<br>the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a&para;<br>fair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to&para;<br>reverse the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that&para;<br>irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay. In&para;<br>close cases the Circuit Justice or the Court will balance&para;<br>the equities and weigh the relative harms to the applicant&para;<br>and to the respondent. Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S.&para;<br>1301, 1304 (1988) (KENNEDY, J., in chambers); Rostker v.&para;<br>Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in&para;<br>chambers). To obtain a stay pending the filing and dispo&para;<br>sition of a petition for a writ of mandamus, an applicant&para;<br>must show a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will&para;<br>vote to grant mandamus and a likelihood that irreparable&para;<br>harm will result from the denial of a stay. Before a writ of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>mandamus may issue, a party must establish that (1) “no&para;<br>other adequate means [exist] to attain the relief he de&para;<br>sires,” (2) the party’s “right to issuance of the writ is ‘clear&para;<br>and indisputable,’ ” and (3) “the writ is appropriate under&para;<br>the circumstances.” Cheney v. United States Dist. Court&para;<br>for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380–381 (2004) (some internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). This Court will issue the writ&para;<br>of mandamus directly to a federal district court “only&para;<br>where a question of public importance is involved, or&para;<br>where the question is of such a nature that it is peculiarly&para;<br>appropriate that such action by this court should be&para;<br>taken.” Ex parte United States, 287 U. S. 241, 248–249&para;<br>(1932). These familiar standards are followed here, where&para;<br>applicants claim that the District Court’s order was based&para;<br>on a local rule adopted in violation of federal law.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Given the importance of the issues at stake, and our&para;<br>conclusion that the District Court likely violated a federal&para;<br>statute in revising its local rules, applicants have shown a&para;<br>fair prospect that a majority of this Court will either grant&para;<br>a petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the order&para;<br>below or will grant a petition for a writ of mandamus.&para;<br>A district court has discretion to adopt local rules.&para;<br>Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S. 641, 645 (1987) (citing 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2071; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83). Those rules have&para;<br>“the force of law.” Weil v. Neary, 278 U. S. 160, 169&para;<br>(1929). Federal law, however, requires a district court to&para;<br>follow certain procedures to adopt or amend a local rule.&para;<br>Local rules typically may not be amended unless the&para;<br>district court “giv[es] appropriate public notice and an&para;<br>opportunity for comment.” 28 U. S. C. §2071(b); see also&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83(a). A limited exception permits&para;<br>dispensing with this notice-and-comment requirement&para;<br>only where “there is an immediate need for a rule.”&para;<br>§2071(e). Even where a rule is amended based on imme&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>diate need, however, the issuing court must “promptly&para;<br>thereafter afford . . . notice and opportunity for comment.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Before late December, the court’s Local Rule 77–3 ex&para;<br>plicitly banned the broadcast of court proceedings:&para;<br>“Unless allowed by a Judge or a Magistrate Judge&para;<br>with respect to his or her own chambers or assigned&para;<br>courtroom for ceremonial purposes, the taking of pho&para;<br>tographs, public broadcasting or televising, or re&para;<br>cording for those purposes in the courtroom or its en&para;<br>virons, in connection with any judicial proceeding, is&para;<br>prohibited. Electronic transmittal of courtroom pro&para;<br>ceedings and presentation of evidence within the con&para;<br>fines of the courthouse is permitted, if authorized by&para;<br>the Judge or Magistrate Judge. The term ‘environs,’&para;<br>as used in this rule, means all floors on which cham&para;<br>bers, courtrooms or on which Offices of the Clerk are&para;<br>located, with the exception of any space specifically&para;<br>designated as a Press Room. Nothing in this rule is&para;<br>intended to restrict the use of electronic means to re&para;<br>ceive or present evidence during Court proceedings.”&para;<br>Notably, the Rule excepted from its general ban the trans&para;<br>mittal of certain proceedings—but it limited that exception&para;<br>to transmissions “within the confines of the courthouse.”&para;<br>The negative inference of this exception, of course, is that&para;<br>the Rule would have prohibited the streaming of trans&para;<br>missions, or other broadcasting or televising, beyond “the&para;<br>confines of the courthouse.”&para;<br>Respondents do not dispute that this version of Rule 77–&para;<br>3 would have prohibited streaming video of the trial&para;<br>around the country. But they assert that this is not the&para;<br>operative version of Rule 77–3. In a series of postings on&para;<br>its Web site, the District Court purported to revise or&para;<br>propose revisions to Local Rule 77–3. This amendment&para;<br>would have created an additional exception to Rule 77–3’s&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>general ban on the broadcasting of court proceedings “for&para;<br>participation in a pilot or other project authorized by the&para;<br>Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.” Exh. 14, App. to&para;<br>Pet. Respondents rely on this amended version of the&para;<br>Rule.&para;<br>The amended version of Rule 77–3 appears to be invalid.&para;<br>In amending this rule, it appears that the District Court&para;<br>failed to “giv[e] appropriate public notice and an opportu&para;<br>nity for comment,” as required by federal law. 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2071(b). The first time the District Court asked for pub&para;<br>lic comments was on the afternoon of New Year’s Eve.&para;<br>The court stated that it would leave the comment period&para;<br>open until January 8. At most, the District Court there&para;<br>fore allowed a comment period spanning five business&para;<br>days. There is substantial merit to the argument that this&para;<br>was not “appropriate” notice and an opportunity for com&para;<br>ment. Administrative agencies, for instance, “usually”&para;<br>provide a comment period of “thirty days or more.” River&para;<br>bend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 958 F. 2d 1479, 1484 (CA9&para;<br>1992); see Petry v. Block, 737 F. 2d 1193, 1201 (CADC&para;<br>1984) (“[T]he shortest period in which parties can mean&para;<br>ingfully review a proposed rule and file informed re&para;<br>sponses is thirty days”).&para;<br>To be sure, the possibility that some aspects of the trial&para;<br>might be broadcast was first raised to the parties by the&para;<br>District Court at an in-court hearing on September 25,&para;<br>some three months before the Rule was changed. The&para;<br>broadcasting, however, was prohibited under both Circuit&para;<br>and local rules at that time. The first public indication&para;<br>that the District Court intended to adopt a rule of general&para;<br>applicability came in its Web site posting on December 23.&para;<br>And even if Chief Judge Walker’s in-court allusion to the&para;<br>possibility that the Proposition 8 trial might be broadcast&para;<br>could be considered as providing notice to the parties in&para;<br>this case—his statement that “[t]his is all in flux” notwith&para;<br>standing—the disclosure falls far short of the “appropriate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>public notice and an opportunity for comment” required by&para;<br>§2071(b). Indeed, there was no proposed policy on which&para;<br>to comment.&para;<br>The need for a meaningful comment period was particu&para;<br>larly acute in this case. Both courts and legislatures have&para;<br>proceeded with appropriate caution in addressing this&para;<br>question. In 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United&para;<br>States adopted a policy opposing the public broadcast of&para;<br>court proceedings. This policy was adopted after a multi&para;<br>year study of the issue by the Federal Judicial Center&para;<br>which drew on data from six district and two appellate&para;<br>courts, as well as state-court data. In light of the study’s&para;<br>findings, the Judicial Conference concluded that “the&para;<br>intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and&para;<br>jurors [is] cause for concern.” Report of the Proceedings of&para;<br>the Judicial Conference of the United States 47 (Sept. 20,&para;<br>1994).&para;<br>In more than a decade since its adoption the Judicial&para;<br>Conference has continued to adhere to its position on the&para;<br>broadcast of court proceedings. While the policy conclu&para;<br>sions of the Judicial Conference may not be binding on the&para;<br>lower courts, they are “at the very least entitled to respect&para;<br>ful consideration.” In re Sony BMG Music Entertainment,&para;<br>564 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2009). Before abandoning its own&para;<br>policy—one consistent with the Judicial Conference’s&para;<br>longstanding views—it was incumbent on the District&para;<br>Court to adopt a proposed rule only after notice and an&para;<br>adequate period for public comment.&para;<br>In dispensing with public notice and comment the Dis&para;<br>trict Court invoked the “immediate need” exception. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2071(e). It did so through a Web site posting on&para;<br>January 4—prior to the expiration of the comment pe&para;<br>riod—indicating that Rule 77–3 had been revised to per&para;<br>mit participation in the Ninth Circuit’s pilot program.&para;<br>These postings gave no explanation for invoking the ex&para;<br>ception. At trial the District Court explained that the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>immediate need here was to allow this case to be broad&para;<br>cast pursuant to the Ninth Circuit’s new pilot program.&para;<br>See Exh. 1, p. 11, Supp. App. to Response for Perry et al.&para;<br>This does not qualify as an immediate need that justi&para;<br>fies dispensing with the notice and comment procedures&para;<br>required by federal law. While respondents (the plaintiffs&para;<br>in the District Court) had indicated their approval of the&para;<br>plan, no party alleged that it would be imminently harmed&para;<br>if the trial were not broadcast. Had an administrative&para;<br>agency acted as the District Court did here, the immediate&para;<br>need exception would likely not have been available. See&para;<br>5 U. S. C. §553(b)(B) (administrative agencies cannot&para;<br>invoke an exception to affording notice-and-comment&para;<br>before rulemaking unless the notice-and-comment proce&para;<br>dures would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to&para;<br>the public interest”). In issuing its order the District&para;<br>Court relied on the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council’s pilot&para;<br>program. Yet nothing in that program—which was not&para;<br>adopted after notice and comment procedures, cf. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §332(d)(1)—required any “immediate” revision in&para;<br>local rules. The Ninth Circuit Judicial Council did not&para;<br>purport to modify or abrogate the District Court’s local&para;<br>Rule. Nor could it, as the Judicial Council only has the&para;<br>power to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with&para;<br>federal law. See §332(d)(4) (permitting a circuit court&para;<br>council to modify a local rule that is “found inconsistent”&para;<br>with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court). No fed&para;<br>eral law requires that the District Court broadcast some of&para;<br>its cases. The District Court’s local Rule, in addition, was&para;<br>not a conforming amendment to Ninth Circuit policy,&para;<br>because that policy does not require district courts to&para;<br>broadcast proceedings.&para;<br>Applicants also have shown that irreparable harm will&para;<br>likely result from the denial of the stay. Without a stay,&para;<br>the District Court will broadcast the trial. It would be&para;<br>difficult—if not impossible—to reverse the harm from&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>those broadcasts. The trial will involve various witnesses,&para;<br>including members of same-sex couples; academics, who&para;<br>apparently will discuss gender issues and gender equality,&para;<br>as well as family structures; and those who participated in&para;<br>the campaign leading to the adoption of Proposition 8.&para;<br>This Court has recognized that witness testimony may be&para;<br>chilled if broadcast. See Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 547&para;<br>(1965); id., at 591 (Harlan, J., concurring). Some of appli&para;<br>cants’ witnesses have already said that they will not tes&para;<br>tify if the trial is broadcast, and they have substantiated&para;<br>their concerns by citing incidents of past harassment. See,&para;<br>e.g., Exh. K to Defendant-Intervenors’ Motion (71 news&para;<br>articles detailing incidents of harassment related to people&para;<br>who supported Proposition 8). These concerns are not&para;<br>diminished by the fact that some of applicants’ witnesses&para;<br>are compensated expert witnesses. There are qualitative&para;<br>differences between making public appearances regarding&para;<br>an issue and having one’s testimony broadcast throughout&para;<br>the country. Applicants may not be able to obtain ade&para;<br>quate relief through an appeal. The trial will have already&para;<br>been broadcast. It is difficult to demonstrate or analyze&para;<br>whether a witness would have testified differently if his or&para;<br>her testimony had not been broadcast. And witnesses&para;<br>subject to harassment as a result of broadcast of their&para;<br>testimony might be less likely to cooperate in any future&para;<br>proceedings.&para;<br>The balance of equities favors applicants. While appli&para;<br>cants have demonstrated the threat of harm they face if&para;<br>the trial is broadcast, respondents have not alleged any&para;<br>harm if the trial is not broadcast. The issue, moreover,&para;<br>must be resolved at this stage, for the injury likely cannot&para;<br>be undone once the broadcast takes place.&para;<br>This Court also has a significant interest in supervising&para;<br>the administration of the judicial system. See this Court’s&para;<br>Rule 10(a) (the Court will consider whether the courts&para;<br>below have “so far departed from the accepted and usual&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an exercise&para;<br>of this Court’s supervisory power”). The Court may use its&para;<br>supervisory authority to invalidate local rules that were&para;<br>promulgated in violation of an Act of Congress. See Fra&para;<br>zier, 482 U. S., at 645–646; id., at 652, 654 (Rehnquist,&para;<br>C. J., dissenting). The Court’s interest in ensuring com&para;<br>pliance with proper rules of judicial administration is&para;<br>particularly acute when those rules relate to the integrity&para;<br>of judicial processes. The District Court here attempted to&para;<br>revise its rules in haste, contrary to federal statutes and&para;<br>the policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States.&para;<br>It did so to allow broadcasting of this high-profile trial&para;<br>without any considered standards or guidelines in place.&para;<br>The arguments in favor of developing procedures and rules&para;<br>to allow broadcast of certain cases have considerable&para;<br>merit, and reasonable minds can surely differ over the&para;<br>general and specific terms of rules and standards adopted&para;<br>for that purpose. Here, however, the order in question&para;<br>complied neither with existing rules or policies nor the&para;<br>required procedures for amending them.&para;<br>By insisting that courts comply with the law, parties&para;<br>vindicate not only the rights they assert but also the law’s&para;<br>own insistence on neutrality and fidelity to principle.&para;<br>Those systematic interests are all the more evident here,&para;<br>where the lack of a regular rule with proper standards to&para;<br>determine the guidelines for broadcasting could compro&para;<br>mise the orderly, decorous, rational traditions that courts&para;<br>rely upon to ensure the integrity of their own judgments.&para;<br>These considerations, too, are part of the reasons leading&para;<br>to the decision to grant extraordinary relief.&para;<br>In addressing a discrete instance authorizing a closed&para;<br>circuit broadcast of a trial, Congress has illustrated the&para;<br>need for careful guidelines and standards. The trial of the&para;<br>two defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case had&para;<br>been transferred to the United States District Court for&para;<br>the District of Colorado, so it was set to take place in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Denver. That meant the families of deceased and surviv&para;<br>ing victims in and around Oklahoma City would not have&para;<br>the opportunity to observe the trial. Congress passed a&para;<br>statute that allowed victims’ families to watch the trial on&para;<br>closed-circuit television. 42 U. S. C. §10608. The statute&para;<br>was drawn with care to provide precise and detailed guid&para;<br>ance with respect to the wide range of issues implicated by&para;<br>the broadcast. See §10608(a) (the statute only applies “in&para;<br>cases where the venue of the trial is changed” to a city&para;<br>that is “out of the State” and “more than 350 miles from&para;<br>the location in which those proceedings originally would&para;<br>have taken place”); §§10608(a)–(b) (standards for who can&para;<br>view such trials); §10608(c) (restrictions on transmission).&para;<br>And the statute gave the Judicial Conference of the United&para;<br>States rulemaking authority “to effectuate the policy&para;<br>addressed by this section.” §10608(g). In the present case,&para;<br>by contrast, over a span of three weeks the District Court&para;<br>and Ninth Circuit Judicial Council issued, retracted, and&para;<br>reissued a series of Web site postings and news releases.&para;<br>These purport to amend rules and policies at the heart of&para;<br>an ongoing consideration of broadcasting federal trials.&para;<br>And they have done so to make sure that one particular&para;<br>trial may be broadcast. Congress’ requirement of a notice&para;<br>and comment procedure prevents just such arbitrary&para;<br>changes of court rules. Instead, courts must use the pro&para;<br>cedures prescribed by statute to amend their rules, 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2071.&para;<br>If Local Rule 77–3 had been validly revised, questions&para;<br>would still remain about the District Court’s decision to&para;<br>allow broadcasting of this particular trial, in which several&para;<br>of the witnesses have stated concerns for their own secu&para;<br>rity. Even districts that allow trials to be broadcast, see&para;<br>Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule 1.8 (EDNY 2009),&para;<br>recognize that a district judge’s discretion to broadcast a&para;<br>trial is limited, see, e.g., Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, 942&para;<br>F. Supp. 136, 138 (EDNY 1996) (broadcast forbidden&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>unless “there is no interference with the due process, the&para;<br>dignity of litigants, jurors and witnesses, or with other&para;<br>appropriate aspects of the administration of justice”).&para;<br>Consequently, courts in those districts have allowed the&para;<br>broadcast of their proceedings on the basis that those&para;<br>cases were not high profile, E*Trade Financial Corp. v.&para;<br>Deutsche Bank AG, 582 F. Supp. 2d 528, 535 (SDNY&para;<br>2008), or did not involve witnesses, Marisol A. v. Giuliani,&para;<br>929 F. Supp. 660, 661 (SDNY 1996); Katzman v. Victoria’s&para;<br>Secret Catalogue, 923 F. Supp. 580, 586–587 (SDNY 1996).&para;<br>Indeed, one District Court did not allow the broadcasting&para;<br>of its proceedings because the case “involv[ed] very sensi&para;<br>tive issues.” Schoeps v. Museum of Modern Art, 599&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 532, 534 (SDNY 2009). This case, too, in&para;<br>volves issues subject to intense debate in our society. The&para;<br>District Court intends not only to broadcast the attorneys’&para;<br>arguments but also witness testimony. See Sony BMG,&para;<br>564 F. 3d, at 11 (Lipez, J., concurring) (distinguishing&para;<br>broadcast of attorneys’ arguments from other parts of the&para;<br>trial). This case is therefore not a good one for a pilot&para;<br>program. Even the studies that have been conducted thus&para;<br>far have not analyzed the effect of broadcasting in high&para;<br>profile, divisive cases. See Application for Stay 17 (warn&para;<br>ing by Judge Edward R. Becker that in “ ‘truly high-profile&para;<br>cases,’ ” one can “ ‘[j]ust imagine what the findings would&para;<br>be’ ” (quoting Exh. 21, at 2, App. to Pet.)).&para;<br>III&para;<br>The District Court attempted to change its rules at the&para;<br>eleventh hour to treat this case differently than other&para;<br>trials in the district. Not only did it ignore the federal&para;<br>statute that establishes the procedures by which its rules&para;<br>may be amended, its express purpose was to broadcast a&para;<br>high-profile trial that would include witness testimony&para;<br>about a contentious issue. If courts are to require that&para;<br>others follow regular procedures, courts must do so as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 588 U.

This case, in my view, does not&para;<br>satisfy a single one of these standards, let alone all of&para;<br>them. Consequently, I must dissent.&para;<br>First, consider the merits of the legal issue: The United&para;<br>States Code, in a chapter entitled “Rules of Courts,” states&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that “[a]ny rule . . . shall be prescribed only after giving&para;<br>appropriate public notice and an opportunity for com&para;<br>ment.” 28 U. S. C. §2071(b). The question here is whether&para;<br>the District Court accompanied the modification of its&para;<br>antivideo rule with “appropriate public notice and an&para;<br>opportunity for comment.”&para;<br>Certainly the parties themselves had more than ade&para;<br>quate notice and opportunity to comment before the Rule&para;<br>was changed. On September 25, 2009, the trial judge,&para;<br>Chief Judge Vaughn Walker, discussed the possibility of&para;<br>broadcasting trial proceedings both within the courthouse&para;<br>and beyond, and asked for the parties’ views. No party&para;<br>objected to the presence of cameras in the courtroom for&para;<br>transmissions within the courthouse, Exh. 9, p. 70, App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Mandamus in No. 10–70063 (CA9) (hereinafter&para;<br>App. to Pet.). (“No objection. None at all”), and both sides&para;<br>made written submissions to the court regarding their&para;<br>views on other transmissions. The court again raised the&para;<br>issue at a hearing on December 16.&para;<br>Nor, in practice, did other members of the Judiciary lack&para;<br>information about the issue. In May 1996 the Circuit&para;<br>Council adopted a policy permitting video in connection&para;<br>with appellate proceedings, but prohibiting its use in the&para;<br>district court. Subsequently, appellate court panels have&para;<br>frequently permitted electronic coverage. Judges, the&para;<br>press, lawyers, and others have discussed the matter. In&para;<br>2007 the lawyers and judges present at the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>Judicial Conference considered a resolution that favored&para;<br>the use of cameras in district court civil nonjury proceed&para;<br>ings. And, voting separately, both lawyers and judges&para;<br>“approved the resolution by resounding margins.” Letter&para;<br>from Chief Judge Kozinski to Judge Anthony Scirica (Jan.&para;<br>10, 2010), Exh. 8, p. 4, Supp. App. to Response for Perry&para;<br>et al. (hereinafter Supp. App. to Response). Subsequently,&para;<br>a committee of judges was created to study the matter.&para;<br>And on December 17, 2009, the Circuit Council voted to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

And it&para;<br>issued a press release. News Release, Ninth Circuit Judi&para;<br>cial Council Approves Experimental Use of Cameras in&para;<br>District Courts (Dec. 17, 2009), Exh, 13. App. to Pet.&para;<br>In this context the United States District Court for the&para;<br>Northern District of California amended its local rules on&para;<br>December 22, 2009 to bring them into conformity with&para;<br>Ninth Circuit policy. In particular, the court amended the&para;<br>local Rule forbidding the public broadcasting or televising&para;<br>of court proceedings by creating an exception “for partici&para;<br>pation in a pilot or other project authorized by the Judicial&para;<br>Council of the Ninth Circuit.” Public Notice Concerning&para;<br>Revisions of Civil Local Rule 77–3, id., Exh. 14. The court&para;<br>initially relied on a provision in the United States Code&para;<br>that permits District Courts to prescribe rules “without&para;<br>public notice and opportunity for comment” “[i]f the pre&para;<br>scribing court determines that there is an immediate need&para;<br>for a rule,” and if the court “promptly thereafter afford[s]&para;<br>such notice and opportunity for comment,” 28 U. S. C. §&para;<br>2071(e). See Exh. 1, at 11, Supp. App. to Response. Then,&para;<br>on December 31, the court revised its public notice to ask&para;<br>for comments directly. By January 8, 2010, the court had&para;<br>received 138,574 comments, all but 32 of which favored&para;<br>transmitting the proceedings. Id., at 12.&para;<br>Viewed in light of this history, the court satisfied the&para;<br>statute’s insistence that “notice” be “appropriate.” Cf. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §§2071(b), (e). The parties, the judges, and the&para;<br>interested public were aware of the proposals to change&para;<br>Ninth Circuit policy that culminated in the “pilot pro&para;<br>gram” well before the change in the local rules that en&para;<br>abled participation in the project. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>issued a press release in mid-December explaining its new&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“pilot program.” Then, once the District Court amended&para;<br>its local rule, it issued its own notice nearly three weeks&para;<br>before the transmissions that the rule change authorized&para;<br>were to begin. And the rule change itself is simply a&para;<br>change that conforms local rule to Circuit policy—a con&para;<br>formity that the law may well require. (The Judicial&para;<br>Council had long before voted to make its video policy&para;<br>“binding on all courts within the Ninth Circuit,” Letter&para;<br>from Chief Judge Hug to All Ninth Circuit Judges (June&para;<br>21, 1996) (available in Clerk of Court’s case file); it an&para;<br>nounced its new “pilot program” policy in December 2009,&para;<br>App. to Application, Exh. 13, App. to Pet.; and federal&para;<br>statutes render district court rules void insofar as they&para;<br>have been “modified or abrogated” by the Council, see&para;<br>§2071(c)(1). Compare ante, at 11 (“Council only has the&para;<br>power to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with&para;<br>federal law”), with 28 U. S. C. §332(d)(1) (“[C]ouncil shall&para;<br>make all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective&para;<br>and expeditious administration of justice within its cir&para;<br>cuit”).) The applicants point to no interested person un&para;<br>aware of the change. How can the Majority reasonably&para;<br>demand yet more notice in respect to a local rule modifica&para;<br>tion that a statute likely requires regardless?&para;<br>There was also sufficient “opportunity for comment.”&para;<br>The parties, the intervenors, other judges, the public—all&para;<br>had an opportunity to comment. The parties were specifi&para;<br>cally invited by Chief Judge Walker to comment on the&para;<br>possibility of broadcast as early as September. And the&para;<br>entire public was invited by the District Court to submit&para;<br>comments after the rule change was announced, right up&para;<br>to the eve of trial. As I said, the court received 138,574&para;<br>comments during that time. How much more “opportunity&para;<br>for comment” does the Court believe necessary, particu&para;<br>larly when the statutes themselves authorize the local&para;<br>court to put a new rule into effect “without” receiving any&para;<br>“comments” before doing so when that local “court deter&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>mines that there is an immediate need” to do so (and to&para;<br>receive comments later)? And more importantly, what is&para;<br>the legal source of the Court’s demand for additional&para;<br>comment time in respect to a rule change to conform to&para;<br>Judicial Council policy?&para;<br>Second, this legal question is not the kind of legal ques&para;<br>tion that this Court would normally grant certiorari to&para;<br>consider. There is no conflict among the state or federal&para;<br>courts regarding the procedures by which a district court&para;<br>changes its local rules. Cf. this Court’s Rules 10(a)–(b).&para;<br>The technical validity of the procedures followed below&para;<br>does not implicate an open “important question of federal&para;<br>law.” Cf. Rule 10(c). Nor do the procedures below clearly&para;<br>conflict with any precedent from this Court. Cf. ibid.&para;<br>It is particularly inadvisable for this Court to consider&para;<br>this kind of question because it involves local rules and&para;<br>local judicial administration. Here, for example, the Court&para;<br>decides just how a district court should modify its own&para;<br>local rules; in a word, this Court micromanages district&para;<br>court administrative procedures in the most detailed way.&para;<br>And, without briefing, the Court imposes limitations on&para;<br>the Judicial Councils’ ability to implement policy deci&para;<br>sions, ante, at 11–12 (suggesting Council policy does not&para;<br>abrogate local rules), with consequences we cannot pre&para;<br>dict. The District Councils, the Circuit Councils, the&para;<br>Judicial Conference of the United States, and the Chief&para;<br>Justice bear responsibility for judicial administration, not&para;<br>this Court. See 28 U. S. C. §§331–332. And those bodies&para;<br>have adequate authority to resolve disagreements about&para;<br>how to promulgate and apply local rules, and, particularly,&para;<br>about the use of cameras in the courtroom.&para;<br>For the past 80 years, local judicial administration has&para;<br>been left to the exclusive province of the Circuit Judicial&para;<br>Councils, and this Court lacks their institutional experi&para;<br>ence. See generally P. Fish, The Politics of Federal Judi&para;<br>cial Administration 152–153 (1973) (From their creation,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“[t]he councils constituted . . . a mechanism through which&para;<br>there could be a concentration of responsibility in the&para;<br>various Circuits—immediate responsibility for the work of&para;<br>the courts, with power and authority . . . to insure compe&para;<br>tence in th[eir] work . . .”). For that reason it is inappro&para;<br>priate as well as unnecessary for this Court to intervene in&para;<br>the procedural aspects of local judicial administration.&para;<br>Perhaps that is why I have not been able to find any other&para;<br>case in which this Court has previously done so, through&para;<br>emergency relief or otherwise. Cf. Bank of Nova Scotia v.&para;<br>United States, 487 U. S. 250, 264 (1988) (SCALIA, J., con&para;<br>curring) (“I do not see the basis for any direct authority to&para;<br>supervise lower courts” (citing Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S.&para;<br>641, 651–652 (1987) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting))). Nor&para;<br>am I aware of any instance in which this Court has pre&para;<br>emptively sought to micromanage district court proceed&para;<br>ings as it does today.&para;<br>I recognize that the Court may see this matter not as&para;<br>one of promulgating and applying a local rule but, rather,&para;<br>as presenting the larger question of the place of cameras&para;<br>in the courtroom. But the wisdom of a camera policy is&para;<br>primarily a matter for the proper administrative bodies to&para;<br>determine. See 28 U. S. C. §332. This Court has no legal&para;<br>authority to address that larger policy question except&para;<br>insofar as it implicates a question of law. The relevant&para;<br>question of law here concerns the procedure for amending&para;<br>local rules. And the only relevant legal principles that&para;<br>allow us here to take account of the immediate subject&para;<br>matter of that local rule, namely cameras, are those legal&para;<br>principles that permit us—indeed require us—to look to&para;<br>the nature of the harm at issue and to balance equities,&para;<br>including the public interest. I consequently turn to those&para;<br>two matters.&para;<br>Third, consider the harm: I can find no basis for the&para;<br>Court’s conclusion that, were the transmissions to other&para;<br>courtrooms to take place, the applicants would suffer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>irreparable harm. Certainly there is no evidence that&para;<br>such harm could arise in this nonjury civil case from the&para;<br>simple fact of transmission itself. By my count, 42 States&para;<br>and two Federal District Courts currently give judges the&para;<br>discretion to broadcast civil nonjury trials. See Media&para;<br>Privacy and Related Law 2009–10 (2009) (collecting state&para;<br>statutes and rules); Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule&para;<br>1.8 (EDNY 2009). Neither the applicants nor anyone else&para;<br>“has been able to present empirical data sufficient to&para;<br>establish that the mere presence of the broadcast media&para;<br>inherently has an adverse effect on [the judicial] process,”&para;<br>Chandler v. Florida, 449 U. S. 560, 578–579 (1981). Cf. M.&para;<br>Cohn &amp; D. Dow, Cameras in the Courtroom: Television&para;<br>and the Pursuit of Justice 62–64 (1998) (canvassing stud&para;<br>ies, none of which found harm, and one of which found&para;<br>that witnesses “who faced an obvious camera, provided&para;<br>answers that were more correct, lengthier and more de&para;<br>tailed”). And, in any event, any harm to the parties, in&para;<br>cluding the applicants, is reparable through appeal. Cf.&para;<br>Chandler, supra, at 581.&para;<br>The applicants also claim that the transmission will&para;<br>irreparably harm the witnesses themselves, presumably&para;<br>by increasing the public’s awareness of who those wit&para;<br>nesses are. And they claim that some members of the&para;<br>public might harass those witnesses. But the witnesses,&para;<br>although capable of doing so, have not asked this Court to&para;<br>set aside the District Court’s order. Cf. Miller v. Albright,&para;<br>523 U. S. 420, 445 (1998) (O’Connor, J., joined by&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Powers v. Ohio,&para;<br>499 U. S. 400, 411 (1991). And that is not surprising. All&para;<br>of the witnesses supporting the applicants are already&para;<br>publicly identified with their cause. They are all experts&para;<br>or advocates who have either already appeared on televi&para;<br>sion or Internet broadcasts, already toured the State&para;<br>advocating a “yes” vote on Proposition 8, or already en&para;<br>gaged in extensive public commentary far more likely to&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>make them well known than a closed-circuit broadcast to&para;<br>another federal courthouse.&para;<br>The likelihood of any “irreparable” harm is further&para;<br>diminished by the fact that the court order before us&para;<br>would simply increase the trial’s viewing audience from&para;<br>the occupants of one courtroom in one courthouse to the&para;<br>occupants of five other courtrooms in five other court&para;<br>houses (in all of which taking pictures or retransmissions&para;<br>have been forbidden). By way of comparison literally&para;<br>hundreds of national and international newspapers are&para;<br>already covering this trial and reporting in detail the&para;<br>names and testimony of all of the witnesses. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Leff, Woman Recalls Emotional Ordeal of Gay Marriage&para;<br>Ban, Associated Press, Jan. 11, 2010. I see no reason why&para;<br>the incremental increase in exposure caused by transmit&para;<br>ting these proceedings to five additional courtrooms would&para;<br>create any further risk of harm, as the Court apparently&para;<br>believes. See ante, at 13. Moreover, if in respect to any&para;<br>particular witness this transmission threatens harm, the&para;<br>District Court can prevent that harm. Chief Judge&para;<br>Walker has already said that he would keep the broadcast&para;<br>“completely under the Court’s control, to permit the Court&para;<br>to stop it if [it] proves to be a problem, if it proves to be a&para;<br>distraction, [or] if it proves to create problems with wit&para;<br>nesses.” See Exh. 2, at 45, App. to Pet. The Circuit Coun&para;<br>cil confirmed in a press release that the District Court&para;<br>“will fully control the process” and that “Judge Walker has&para;<br>reserved the right to terminate any part of the audio&para;<br>or video, or both, for any duration” or to terminate par&para;<br>ticipation in the pilot program “at any time.” News&para;<br>Release, Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote Viewing&para;<br>of Pro-position 8 Trial (Jan. 8, 2010), http://www.&para;<br>ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/Prop8_&para;<br>Remote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13, 2010,&para;<br>and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Surely such&para;<br>firm control, exercised by an able district court judge with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>20 years of trial-management experience, will be sufficient&para;<br>to address any possible harm, either to the witnesses or to&para;<br>the integrity of the trial.&para;<br>Fourth, no fair balancing of the equities (including harm&para;<br>to the public interest) could support issuance of the stay.&para;<br>See Times-Picayune Publishing Corp. v. Schulingkamp,&para;<br>419 U. S. 1301, 1305 (1974) (Powell, J. in Chambers)&para;<br>(recognizing “significant public and private interests&para;<br>balanced on both sides” when “present[ed with] a funda&para;<br>mental confrontation between the competing values of free&para;<br>press and fair trial”). As I have just explained, the appli&para;<br>cants’ equities consist of potential harm to witnesses—&para;<br>harm that is either nonexistent or that can be cured&para;<br>through protective measures by the District Court as the&para;<br>circumstances warrant. The competing equities consist of&para;<br>not only respondents’ interest in obtaining the courthouse&para;<br>to-courthouse transmission that they desire, but also the&para;<br>public’s interest in observing trial proceedings to learn&para;<br>about this case and about how courts work. See Nebraska&para;<br>Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 587 (1976) (Brennan,&para;<br>J., concurring in judgment); see also Exh. 2, at 42, App. to&para;<br>Pet. (statement of Chief Judge Walker) (“[I]f the public&para;<br>could see how the judicial process works, they would take&para;<br>a somewhat different view of it.” “I think the only time&para;<br>that you’re going to draw sufficient interest in the legal&para;<br>process is when you have an issue such as the issues here,&para;<br>that people think about, talk about, debate about and&para;<br>consider”). With these considerations in the balance, the&para;<br>scales tip heavily against, not in favor, of issuing the stay.&para;<br>The majority’s action today is unusual. It grants a stay&para;<br>in order to consider a mandamus petition, with a view to&para;<br>intervening in a matter of local court administration that&para;<br>it would not (and should not) consider. It cites no prece&para;<br>dent for doing so. It identifies no real harm, let alone&para;<br>“irreparable harm,” to justify its issuance of this stay.&para;<br>And the public interest weighs in favor of providing access&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to the courts. To justify this extraordinary intervention,&para;<br>the majority insists that courts must “enforce the re&para;<br>quirement of procedural regularity on others, and must&para;<br>follow those requirements themselves.” Ante, at 1. And so&para;<br>too I believe this Court should adhere to its institutional&para;<br>competence, its historical practice, and its governing&para;<br>precedent—all of which counsel strongly against the issu&para;<br>ance of this stay.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
