STEVEN FRANK JACKSON&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10–797.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided March 21, 2011 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>A California jury convicted respondent Steven Frank&para;<br>Jackson of numerous sexual offenses stemming from his&para;<br>attack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his apartment&para;<br>complex. Jackson raised a Batson claim, asserting that&para;<br>the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude&para;<br>black prospective jurors on the basis of their race. See&para;<br>Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). Two of three&para;<br>black jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury.&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 49–50.&para;<br>Jackson’s counsel did not object when the prosecutor&para;<br>struck the first of the black jurors, Juror S. Counsel later&para;<br>explained that he did not make a “motion at that time”&para;<br>because he thought the excusal of Juror S “was a close&para;<br>call.” After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second&para;<br>juror, Juror J, Jackson’s counsel made the Batson motion&para;<br>challenging both strikes. Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB&para;<br>(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 76–77 (hereinaf&para;<br>ter Document 7).&para;<br>The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for&para;<br>striking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages&para;<br>of 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by Cali&para;<br>fornia police officers because—in his view—of his race and&para;<br>age. As the prosecutor put it, “Whether or not he still&para;<br>harbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll&para;<br>the dice with.” Id., at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB&para;<br>(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57–58, 98–100&para;<br>(hereinafter Document 10).&para;<br>The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FELKNER v. JACKSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>she had a master’s degree in social work, and had interned&para;<br>at the county jail, “probably in the psych unit as a sociolo&para;<br>gist of some sort.” The prosecutor explained that he dis&para;<br>missed her “based on her educational background,” stating&para;<br>that he does not “like to keep social workers.” Document&para;<br>7, at 78–79; Document 10, at 188–189; App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 49.&para;<br>Jackson’s counsel expressly disagreed only with the&para;<br>prosecutor’s explanation for the strike of Juror J, see App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 22–23, 47, arguing that removing her on&para;<br>the basis of her educational background was “itself invidi&para;<br>ous discrimination.” The prosecutor responded that he&para;<br>was not aware that social workers were a “protected&para;<br>class.” As for Juror S, Jackson’s counsel explained that he&para;<br>“let [Juror S] slide” because he anticipated the prosecutor’s&para;<br>response and, in any event, he “only need[ed] one to estab&para;<br>lish the grounds for” a Batson motion. After listening to&para;<br>each side’s arguments, the trial court denied Jackson’s&para;<br>motion. Document 7, at 78–80.&para;<br>Jackson renewed his Batson claim on direct appeal,&para;<br>arguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed that&para;<br>the prosecutor’s explanations were pretextual.&para;<br>With&para;<br>respect to Juror S, Jackson argued that a non-black ju&para;<br>ror—Juror 8—also had negative experiences with law&para;<br>enforcement but remained on the jury. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 47–48. Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he&para;<br>had been stopped while driving in Illinois several years&para;<br>earlier as part of what he believed to be a “scam” by Illi&para;<br>nois police targeting drivers with California license plates.&para;<br>Juror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by&para;<br>the failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the&para;<br>burglary of his car. Document 10, at 26–27, 56–57, 95–97.&para;<br>With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that the prose&para;<br>cutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors&para;<br>when he was concerned about their educational back&para;<br>grounds, but struck Juror J without asking her any ques&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>tions about her degree in social work. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 49.&para;<br>The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s&para;<br>denial of the Batson motion and affirmed Jackson’s convic&para;<br>tions. The appellate court explained that “[t]he trial&para;<br>court’s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial&para;<br>evidence,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted), which the California courts have charac&para;<br>terized as equivalent to the “clear error” standard em&para;<br>ployed by federal courts, see, e.g., People v. Alvarez, 14&para;<br>Cal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P. 2d 365, 389 (1996). With respect&para;<br>to whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were pretex&para;<br>tual, the court explained that it “give[s] great deference to&para;<br>the trial court’s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons&para;<br>from sham excuses.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.&para;<br>After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded&para;<br>that “Juror 8’s negative experience out of state and the car&para;<br>burglary is not comparable to [Juror S’s] 14 years of per&para;<br>ceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on&para;<br>race.” Id., at 48. As for Juror J, the court recognized that&para;<br>the prosecutor’s dismissal was based on her social services&para;<br>background—“a proper race-neutral reason”—and that&para;<br>this explained his different treatment of jurors with&para;<br>“backgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental&para;<br>engineering.” The court also noted that the “prosecutor&para;<br>focused on [Juror J’s] internship experience” at the county&para;<br>jail. Id., at 49.&para;<br>After the California Supreme Court denied Jackson’s&para;<br>petition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas relief.&para;<br>The Federal District Court properly recognized that re&para;<br>view of Jackson’s claim was governed by the Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That&para;<br>law provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief&para;<br>may not be granted unless the state court adjudication&para;<br>“resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable&para;<br>determination of the facts in light of the evidence pre&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FELKNER v. JACKSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(2). After considering the state Court of Appeal&para;<br>decision and reviewing the record evidence, the District&para;<br>Court held that the California Court of Appeal’s findings&para;<br>were not unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The&para;<br>District Court therefore denied Jackson’s petition.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a&para;<br>three-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion. 389&para;<br>Fed. Appx. 640 (2010). In so doing, the court did not&para;<br>discuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the&para;<br>other three courts that had rejected Jackson’s claim.&para;<br>Instead, after setting forth the basic background legal&para;<br>principles in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its&para;<br>decision:&para;<br>“The prosecutor’s proffered race-neutral bases for&para;<br>peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors&para;<br>were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purpose&para;<br>ful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of&para;<br>three prospective African-American jurors were&para;<br>stricken, and the record reflected different treatment&para;<br>of comparably situated jurors.” Id., at 641.&para;<br>That decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained. It is&para;<br>reversed.&para;<br>The Batson issue before us turns largely on an “evalua&para;<br>tion of credibility.” 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21. The trial&para;<br>court’s determination is entitled to “great deference,” ibid.,&para;<br>and “must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous,”&para;<br>Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472, 477 (2008).&para;<br>That is the standard on direct review. On federal ha&para;<br>beas review, AEDPA “imposes a highly deferential stan&para;<br>dard for evaluating state-court rulings” and “demands&para;<br>that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the&para;<br>doubt.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here the trial&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>court credited the prosecutor’s race-neutral explanations,&para;<br>and the California Court of Appeal carefully reviewed the&para;<br>record at some length in upholding the trial court’s find&para;<br>ings. The state appellate court’s decision was plainly not&para;<br>unreasonable. There was simply no basis for the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit to reach the opposite conclusion, particularly in&para;<br>such a dismissive manner.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
