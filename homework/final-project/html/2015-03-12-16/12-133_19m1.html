Petitioners moved to compel individual arbitration under the Federal&para;<br>Arbitration Act (FAA), but respondents countered that the cost of expert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust claims would greatly&para;<br>exceed the maximum recovery for an individual plaintiff. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Second Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that because of the prohibitive costs respondents would face if they had to arbitrate, the&para;<br>class-action waiver was unenforceable and arbitration could not proceed. The Circuit stood by its reversal when this Court remanded in&para;<br>light of Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., 559&para;<br>U.

And&para;<br>consistent with that text, courts must “rigorously enforce”&para;<br>arbitration agreements according to their terms, Dean&para;<br>Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985),&para;<br>including terms that “specify with whom [the parties]&para;<br>choose to arbitrate their disputes,” Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at&para;<br>683, and “the rules under which that arbitration will be&para;<br>conducted,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.

That holds true for claims that allege a violation of a federal statute, unless the FAA’s mandate has&para;<br>been “ ‘overridden by a contrary congressional command.’ ”&para;<br>CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood, 565 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2012) (slip op., at 2–3) (quoting Shearson/American&para;<br>Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987)).&para;<br>III&para;<br>No contrary congressional command requires us to&para;<br>reject the waiver of class arbitration here. Respondents argue&para;<br>that requiring them to litigate their claims individually—&para;<br>as they contracted to do—would contravene the policies&para;<br>of the antitrust laws. But the antitrust laws do not&para;<br>guarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindication of every claim. Congress has taken some measures&para;<br>to facilitate the litigation of antitrust claims—for example,&para;<br>it enacted a multiplied-damages remedy. See 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§15 (treble damages). In enacting such measures, Congress has told us that it is willing to go, in certain respects, beyond the normal limits of law in advancing its&para;<br>goals of deterring and remedying unlawful trade practice.&para;<br>But to say that Congress must have intended whatever&para;<br>departures from those normal limits advance antitrust&para;<br>goals is simply irrational. “[N]o legislation pursues its&para;<br>purposes at all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480&para;<br>U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam).&para;<br>The antitrust laws do not “evinc[e] an intention to preclude a waiver” of class-action procedure. Mitsubishi&para;<br>Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.&para;<br>614, 628 (1985). The Sherman and Clayton Acts make no&para;<br>mention of class actions. In fact, they were enacted decades before the advent of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure&para;<br>23, which was “designed to allow an exception to the usual&para;<br>rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the&para;<br>individual named parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>442 U. S. 682, 700–701 (1979). The parties here agreed to&para;<br>arbitrate pursuant to that “usual rule,” and it would be&para;<br>remarkable for a court to erase that expectation.&para;<br>Nor does congressional approval of Rule 23 establish an&para;<br>entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of&para;<br>statutory rights. To begin with, it is likely that such an&para;<br>entitlement, invalidating private arbitration agreements&para;<br>denying class adjudication, would be an “abridg[ment]” or&para;<br>modif[ication]” of a “substantive right” forbidden to the&para;<br>Rules, see 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). But there is no evidence of&para;<br>such an entitlement in any event. The Rule imposes&para;<br>stringent requirements for certification that in practice&para;<br>exclude most claims. And we have specifically rejected the&para;<br>assertion that one of those requirements (the class-notice&para;<br>requirement) must be dispensed with because the “prohibitively high cost” of compliance would “frustrate [plaintiff ’s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the&para;<br>antitrust” laws. Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 417 U. S.&para;<br>156, 166–168, 175–176 (1974). One might respond, perhaps, that federal law secures a nonwaivable opportunity&para;<br>to vindicate federal policies by satisfying the procedural&para;<br>strictures of Rule 23 or invoking some other informal class&para;<br>mechanism in arbitration. But we have already rejected&para;<br>that proposition in AT&amp;T Mobility, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 9).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Our finding of no “contrary congressional command”&para;<br>does not end the case. Respondents invoke a judge-made&para;<br>exception to the FAA which, they say, serves to harmonize&para;<br>competing federal policies by allowing courts to invalidate&para;<br>agreements that prevent the “effective vindication” of a&para;<br>federal statutory right. Enforcing the waiver of class&para;<br>arbitration bars effective vindication, respondents contend, because they have no economic incentive to pursue&para;<br>their antitrust claims individually in arbitration.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>The “effective vindication” exception to which respondents allude originated as dictum in Mitsubishi Motors,&para;<br>where we expressed a willingness to invalidate, on “public&para;<br>policy” grounds, arbitration agreements that “operat[e] . . .&para;<br>as a prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory remedies.” 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Dismissing concerns that the arbitral forum was inadequate, we said that “so long as the prospective litigant&para;<br>effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in&para;<br>the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both&para;<br>its remedial and deterrent function.” Id., at 637. Subsequent cases have similarly asserted the existence of an&para;<br>“effective vindication” exception, see, e.g., 14 Penn Plaza&para;<br>LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 273–274 (2009); Gilmer v.&para;<br>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991),&para;<br>but have similarly declined to apply it to invalidate the&para;<br>arbitration agreement at issue.2&para;<br>And we do so again here. As we have described, the&para;<br>exception finds its origin in the desire to prevent “prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory remedies,” Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 637, n. 19 (emphasis&para;<br>added). That would certainly cover a provision in an&para;<br>arbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain&para;<br>statutory rights. And it would perhaps cover filing and&para;<br>administrative fees attached to arbitration that are so&para;<br>high as to make access to the forum impracticable. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Contrary&para;<br>&para;<br>to the dissent’s claim, post, at 8–9, and n. 3 (opinion of&para;<br>KAGAN, J.), the Court in Mitsubishi Motors did not hold that federal&para;<br>statutory claims are subject to arbitration so long as the claimant may&para;<br>effectively vindicate his rights in the arbitral forum. The Court expressly stated that, “at this stage in the proceedings,” it had “no occasion to speculate” on whether the arbitration agreement’s potential&para;<br>deprivation of a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render&para;<br>that agreement unenforceable. 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. Even the Court&para;<br>of Appeals in this case recognized the relevant language in Mitsubishi&para;<br>Motors as dicta. In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 667&para;<br>F. 3d 204, 214 (CA2 2012).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79,&para;<br>90 (2000) (“It may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant . . . from effectively&para;<br>vindicating her federal statutory rights”). But the fact&para;<br>that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a&para;<br>statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of&para;<br>the right to pursue that remedy. See 681 F. 3d, at 147&para;<br>(Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en&para;<br>banc).3 The class-action waiver merely limits arbitration&para;<br>to the two contracting parties. It no more eliminates those&para;<br>parties’ right to pursue their statutory remedy than did&para;<br>federal law before its adoption of the class action for legal&para;<br>relief in 1938, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C.,&para;<br>p. 864 (1938 ed., Supp V); 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M.&para;<br>Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §1752, p. 18 (3d ed.&para;<br>2005). Or, to put it differently, the individual suit that&para;<br>was considered adequate to assure “effective vindication”&para;<br>of a federal right before adoption of class-action procedures did not suddenly become “ineffective vindication”&para;<br>upon their adoption.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent contends that a class-action waiver may deny a party’s&para;<br>right to pursue statutory remedies in the same way as a clause that&para;<br>bars a party from presenting economic testimony. See post, at 3, 9.&para;<br>That is a false comparison for several reasons: To begin with, it is not a&para;<br>given that such a clause would constitute an impermissible waiver; we&para;<br>have never considered the point. But more importantly, such a clause,&para;<br>assuming it makes vindication of the claim impossible, makes it impossible not just as a class action but even as an individual claim.&para;<br>4 Who can disagree with the dissent’s assertion that “the effectivevindication rule asks about the world today, not the world as it might&para;<br>have looked when Congress passed a given statute”? Post, at 12. But&para;<br>time does not change the meaning of effectiveness, making ineffective&para;<br>vindication today what was effective vindication in the past. The&para;<br>dissent also says that the agreement bars other forms of cost sharing—&para;<br>existing before the Sherman Act—that could provide effective vindication. See post, at 11–12, and n. 5. Petitioners denied that, and that is&para;<br>not what the Court of Appeals decision under review here held. It held&para;<br>that, because other forms of cost sharing were not economically feasible&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A pair of our cases brings home the point. In Gilmer,&para;<br>supra, we had no qualms in enforcing a class waiver in an&para;<br>arbitration agreement even though the federal statute at&para;<br>issue, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, expressly permitted collective actions. We said that statutory&para;<br>permission did “ ‘not mean that individual attempts at&para;<br>conciliation were intended to be barred.’ ” Id., at 32. And&para;<br>in Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer,&para;<br>515 U. S. 528 (1995), we held that requiring arbitration in&para;<br>a foreign country was compatible with the federal Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. That legislation prohibited any&para;<br>agreement “ ‘relieving’ ” or “ ‘lessening’ ” the liability of a&para;<br>carrier for damaged goods, id., at 530, 534 (quoting 46&para;<br>U. S. C. App. §1303(8) (1988 ed.))—which is close to codification of an “effective vindication” exception. The Court&para;<br>rejected the argument that the “inconvenience and costs of&para;<br>proceeding” abroad “lessen[ed]” the defendants’ liability,&para;<br>stating that “[i]t would be unwieldy and unsupported by&para;<br>the terms or policy of the statute to require courts to proceed case by case to tally the costs and burdens to particular plaintiffs in light of their means, the size of their&para;<br>claims, and the relative burden on the carrier.” 515 U. S.,&para;<br>at 532, 536. Such a “tally[ing] [of] the costs and burdens”&para;<br>is precisely what the dissent would impose upon federal&para;<br>courts here.&para;<br>Truth to tell, our decision in AT&amp;T Mobility all but&para;<br>resolves this case. There we invalidated a law conditioning enforcement of arbitration on the availability of class&para;<br>procedure because that law “interfere[d] with fundamental&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>(“the only economically feasible means for . . . enforcing [respondents’] &para;<br>&para;<br>statutory rights is via a class action”), the class-action waiver was&para;<br>&para;<br>unenforceable. 667 F. 3d, at 218 (emphasis added). (The dissent’s&para;<br>&para;<br>assertion to the contrary cites not the opinion on appeal here, but an&para;<br>&para;<br>earlier opinion that was vacated. See In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d 300 (CA2 2009), vacated and remanded,&para;<br>&para;<br>559 U. S. 1103 (2010).)

In this case, Italian Colors makes two arguments&para;<br>to support its conclusion that the arbitration agreement&para;<br>should not be enforced. First, it contends that enforcing&para;<br>the arbitration agreement “would contravene the policies&para;<br>of the antitrust laws.” Ante, at 4.

Because Italian Colors&para;<br>has not furnished “grounds . . . for the revocation of any&para;<br>contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, the arbitration agreement must&para;<br>be enforced. Italian Colors voluntarily entered into a contract containing a bilateral arbitration provision.

The owner of a small&para;<br>restaurant (Italian Colors) thinks that American Express&para;<br>(Amex) has used its monopoly power to force merchants to&para;<br>accept a form contract violating the antitrust laws. The&para;<br>restaurateur wants to challenge the allegedly unlawful&para;<br>provision (imposing a tying arrangement), but the same&para;<br>contract’s arbitration clause prevents him from doing so.&para;<br>That term imposes a variety of procedural bars that would&para;<br>make pursuit of the antitrust claim a fool’s errand. So if&para;<br>the arbitration clause is enforceable, Amex has insulated&para;<br>itself from antitrust liability—even if it has in fact violated&para;<br>the law. The monopolist gets to use its monopoly power to&para;<br>insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all&para;<br>legal recourse.&para;<br>And here is the nutshell version of today’s opinion,&para;<br>admirably flaunted rather than camouflaged: Too darn&para;<br>bad.&para;<br>That answer is a betrayal of our precedents, and of&para;<br>federal statutes like the antitrust laws. Our decisions&para;<br>have developed a mechanism—called the effectivevindication rule—to prevent arbitration clauses from&para;<br>choking off a plaintiff ’s ability to enforce congressionally&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS &para;<br>&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>created rights. That doctrine bars applying such a clause&para;<br>when (but only when) it operates to confer immunity from&para;<br>potentially meritorious federal claims. In so doing, the&para;<br>rule reconciles the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) with all&para;<br>the rest of federal law—and indeed, promotes the most&para;<br>fundamental purposes of the FAA itself. As applied here,&para;<br>the rule would ensure that Amex’s arbitration clause does&para;<br>not foreclose Italian Colors from vindicating its right to&para;<br>redress antitrust harm.&para;<br>The majority barely tries to explain why it reaches a&para;<br>contrary result. It notes that we have not decided this&para;<br>exact case before—neglecting that the principle we have&para;<br>established fits this case hand in glove. And it concocts a&para;<br>special exemption for class-arbitration waivers—ignoring&para;<br>that this case concerns much more than that. Throughout, the majority disregards our decisions’ central tenet:&para;<br>An arbitration clause may not thwart federal law, irrespective of exactly how it does so. Because the Court&para;<br>today prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory&para;<br>rights, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Start with an uncontroversial proposition: We would&para;<br>refuse to enforce an exculpatory clause insulating a company from antitrust liability—say, “Merchants may bring&para;<br>no Sherman Act claims”—even if that clause were contained in an arbitration agreement. See ante, at 6. Congress created the Sherman Act’s private cause of action&para;<br>not solely to compensate individuals, but to promote “the&para;<br>public interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust&para;<br>laws.” Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S.&para;<br>322, 329 (1955). Accordingly, courts will not enforce a&para;<br>prospective waiver of the right to gain redress for an&para;<br>antitrust injury, whether in an arbitration agreement or&para;<br>any other contract. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler&para;<br>Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637, and n. 19&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(1985). The same rule applies to other important federal&para;<br>statutory rights. See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556&para;<br>U. S. 247, 273 (2009) (Age Discrimination in Employment&para;<br>Act); Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O’Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 704&para;<br>(1945) (Fair Labor Standards Act). But its necessity is&para;<br>nowhere more evident than in the antitrust context.&para;<br>Without the rule, a company could use its monopoly power&para;<br>to protect its monopoly power, by coercing agreement to&para;<br>contractual terms eliminating its antitrust liability.&para;<br>If the rule were limited to baldly exculpatory provisions, however, a monopolist could devise numerous ways&para;<br>around it. Consider several alternatives that a party&para;<br>drafting an arbitration agreement could adopt to avoid&para;<br>antitrust liability, each of which would have the identical&para;<br>effect. On the front end: The agreement might set outlandish filing fees or establish an absurd (e.g., one-day)&para;<br>statute of limitations, thus preventing a claimant from&para;<br>gaining access to the arbitral forum. On the back end: The&para;<br>agreement might remove the arbitrator’s authority to&para;<br>grant meaningful relief, so that a judgment gets the&para;<br>claimant nothing worthwhile. And in the middle: The&para;<br>agreement might block the claimant from presenting the&para;<br>kind of proof that is necessary to establish the defendant’s&para;<br>liability—say, by prohibiting any economic testimony&para;<br>(good luck proving an antitrust claim without that!). Or&para;<br>else the agreement might appoint as an arbitrator an&para;<br>obviously biased person—say, the CEO of Amex. The&para;<br>possibilities are endless—all less direct than an express&para;<br>exculpatory clause, but no less fatal. So the rule against&para;<br>prospective waivers of federal rights can work only if it&para;<br>applies not just to a contract clause explicitly barring a&para;<br>claim, but to others that operate to do so.&para;<br>And sure enough, our cases establish this proposition:&para;<br>An arbitration clause will not be enforced if it prevents the&para;<br>effective vindication of federal statutory rights, however it&para;<br>achieves that result. The rule originated in Mitsubishi,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS &para;<br>&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>where we held that claims brought under the Sherman Act&para;<br>and other federal laws are generally subject to arbitration.&para;<br>473 U. S., at 628. By agreeing to arbitrate such a claim,&para;<br>we explained, “a party does not forgo the substantive&para;<br>rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their&para;<br>resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.”&para;<br>Ibid. But crucial to our decision was a limiting principle,&para;<br>designed to safeguard federal rights: An arbitration clause&para;<br>will be enforced only “so long as the prospective litigant&para;<br>effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in&para;<br>the arbitral forum.” Id., at 637. If an arbitration provision “operated . . . as a prospective waiver of a party’s&para;<br>right to pursue statutory remedies,” we emphasized, we&para;<br>would “condemn[ ]” it. Id., at 637, n. 19. Similarly, we&para;<br>stated that such a clause should be “set[] aside” if “proceedings in the contractual forum will be so gravely difficult” that the claimant “will for all practical purposes be&para;<br>deprived of his day in court.” Id., at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted). And in the decades since Mitsubishi,&para;<br>we have repeated its admonition time and again, instructing courts not to enforce an arbitration agreement that&para;<br>effectively (even if not explicitly) forecloses a plaintiff from&para;<br>remedying the violation of a federal statutory right. See&para;<br>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28&para;<br>(1991); Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky&para;<br>Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 540 (1995); 14 Penn Plaza, 556 U. S.,&para;<br>at 266, 273–274.&para;<br>Our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79 (2000), confirmed that this principle&para;<br>applies when an agreement thwarts federal law by making&para;<br>arbitration prohibitively expensive. The plaintiff there&para;<br>(seeking relief under the Truth in Lending Act) argued&para;<br>that an arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it “create[d] a risk” that she would have to “bear&para;<br>prohibitive arbitration costs” in the form of high filing and&para;<br>administrative fees. Id., at 90 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>omitted). We rejected that contention, but not because we&para;<br>doubted that such fees could prevent the effective vindication of statutory rights. To the contrary, we invoked our&para;<br>rule from Mitsubishi, making clear that it applied to the&para;<br>case before us. See 538 U. S., at 90. Indeed, we added a&para;<br>burden of proof: “[W]here, as here,” we held, a party asserting a federal right “seeks to invalidate an arbitration&para;<br>agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing&para;<br>the likelihood of incurring such costs.” Id., at 92. Randolph, we found, had failed to meet that burden: The&para;<br>evidence she offered was “too speculative.” Id., at 91. But&para;<br>even as we dismissed Randolph’s suit, we reminded courts&para;<br>to protect against arbitration agreements that make federal claims too costly to bring.&para;<br>Applied as our precedents direct, the effectivevindication rule furthers the purposes not just of laws like&para;<br>the Sherman Act, but of the FAA itself. That statute&para;<br>reflects a federal policy favoring actual arbitration—that&para;<br>is, arbitration as a streamlined “method of resolving disputes,” not as a foolproof way of killing off valid claims.&para;<br>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,&para;<br>490 U. S. 477, 481 (1989). Put otherwise: What the FAA&para;<br>prefers to litigation is arbitration, not de facto immunity.&para;<br>The effective-vindication rule furthers the statute’s goals&para;<br>by ensuring that arbitration remains a real, not faux,&para;<br>method of dispute resolution. With the rule, companies&para;<br>have good reason to adopt arbitral procedures that facilitate efficient and accurate handling of complaints. Without it, companies have every incentive to draft their&para;<br>agreements to extract backdoor waivers of statutory&para;<br>rights, making arbitration unavailable or pointless. So&para;<br>down one road: More arbitration, better enforcement of&para;<br>federal statutes. And down the other: Less arbitration,&para;<br>poorer enforcement of federal statutes. Which would you&para;<br>prefer? Or still more aptly: Which do you think Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would?&para;<br>The answer becomes all the more obvious given the&para;<br>limits we have placed on the rule, which ensure that it&para;<br>does not diminish arbitration’s benefits. The rule comes&para;<br>into play only when an agreement “operate[s] . . . as a&para;<br>prospective waiver”—that is, forecloses (not diminishes) a&para;<br>plaintiff ’s opportunity to gain relief for a statutory violation. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. So, for example,&para;<br>Randolph assessed whether fees in arbitration would be&para;<br>“prohibitive” (not high, excessive, or extravagant). 531&para;<br>U. S., at 90. Moreover, the plaintiff must make that showing through concrete proof: “[S]peculative” risks, “unfounded assumptions,” and “unsupported statements” will&para;<br>not suffice. Id., at 90–91, and n. 6. With the inquiry that&para;<br>confined and the evidentiary requirements that high,&para;<br>courts have had no trouble assessing the matters the rule&para;<br>makes relevant. And for almost three decades, courts&para;<br>have followed our edict that arbitration clauses must&para;<br>usually prevail, declining to enforce them in only rare&para;<br>cases. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26–&para;<br>27. The effective-vindication rule has thus operated year&para;<br>in and year out without undermining, much less “destroy[ing],” the prospect of speedy dispute resolution that&para;<br>arbitration secures. Ante, at 9.&para;<br>And this is just the kind of case the rule was meant to&para;<br>address. Italian Colors, as I have noted, alleges that&para;<br>Amex used its market power to impose a tying arrangement in violation of the Sherman Act. The antitrust laws,&para;<br>all parties agree, provide the restaurant with a cause of&para;<br>action and give it the chance to recover treble damages.&para;<br>Here, that would mean Italian Colors could take home up&para;<br>to $38,549. But a problem looms. As this case comes to&para;<br>us, the evidence shows that Italian Colors cannot prevail&para;<br>in arbitration without an economic analysis defining the&para;<br>relevant markets, establishing Amex’s monopoly power,&para;<br>showing anticompetitive effects, and measuring damages.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>And that expert report would cost between several hundred thousand and one million dollars.1 So the expense&para;<br>involved in proving the claim in arbitration is ten times&para;<br>what Italian Colors could hope to gain, even in a best-case&para;<br>scenario. That counts as a “prohibitive” cost, in Randolph’s terminology, if anything does. No rational actor&para;<br>would bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars&para;<br>if doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of&para;<br>thousands.&para;<br>An arbitration agreement could manage such a mismatch in many ways, but Amex’s disdains them all. As&para;<br>the Court makes clear, the contract expressly prohibits&para;<br>class arbitration. But that is only part of the problem.2&para;<br>The agreement also disallows any kind of joinder or consolidation of claims or parties. And more: Its confidentiality provision prevents Italian Colors from informally&para;<br>arranging with other merchants to produce a common&para;<br>expert report. And still more: The agreement precludes&para;<br>any shifting of costs to Amex, even if Italian Colors prevails. And beyond all that: Amex refused to enter into any&para;<br>stipulations that would obviate or mitigate the need for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The evidence relating to these costs comes from an affidavit submitted by an economist experienced in proving similar antitrust claims.&para;<br>The Second Circuit found that Amex “ha[d] brought no serious challenge” to that factual showing. See, e.g., 667 F. 3d 204, 210 (2012).&para;<br>And in this Court, Amex conceded that Italian Colors would need an&para;<br>expert economic report to prevail in arbitration. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>15. Perhaps that is not really true. A hallmark of arbitration is its use&para;<br>of procedures tailored to the type of dispute and amount in controversy;&para;<br>so arbitrators might properly decline to demand such a rigorous evidentiary showing in small antitrust cases. But that possibility cannot&para;<br>disturb the factual premise on which this case comes to us, and which&para;<br>the majority accepts: that Italian Colors’s tying claim is an ordinary&para;<br>kind of antitrust claim; and that it is worth about a tenth the cost of&para;<br>arbitration.&para;<br>2 The majority contends that the class-action waiver is the only part&para;<br>we should consider. See ante, at 7–8, n. 4. I explain below why that&para;<br>assertion is wrong. See infra, at 11–12.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS &para;<br>&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the economic analysis. In short, the agreement as applied&para;<br>in this case cuts off not just class arbitration, but any&para;<br>avenue for sharing, shifting, or shrinking necessary costs.&para;<br>Amex has put Italian Colors to this choice: Spend way,&para;<br>way, way more money than your claim is worth, or relinquish your Sherman Act rights.&para;<br>So contra the majority, the court below got this case&para;<br>right. Italian Colors proved what the plaintiff in Randolph could not—that a standard-form agreement, taken&para;<br>as a whole, renders arbitration of a claim “prohibitively&para;<br>expensive.” 531 U. S., at 92. The restaurant thus established that the contract “operate[s] . . . as a prospective&para;<br>waiver,” and prevents the “effective[ ] . . . vindicat[ion]” of&para;<br>Sherman Act rights. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, and&para;<br>n. 19. I would follow our precedents and decline to compel&para;<br>arbitration.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The majority is quite sure that the effective-vindication&para;<br>rule does not apply here, but has precious little to say&para;<br>about why. It starts by disparaging the rule as having&para;<br>“originated as dictum.” Ante, at 6. But it does not rest on&para;<br>that swipe, and for good reason. As I have explained, see&para;<br>supra, at 3–4, the rule began as a core part of Mitsubishi:&para;<br>We held there that federal statutory claims are subject to&para;<br>arbitration “so long as” the claimant “effectively may&para;<br>vindicate its [rights] in the arbitral forum.” 473 U. S., at&para;<br>637 (emphasis added). The rule thus served as an essential condition of the decision’s holding.3 And in Randolph,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The majority is dead wrong when it says that Mitsubishi reserved&para;<br>judgment on “whether the arbitration agreement’s potential deprivation of a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render that&para;<br>agreement unenforceable.” Ante, at 6, n. 2. What the Mitsubishi Court&para;<br>had “no occasion to speculate on” was whether a particular agreement&para;<br>in fact eliminated the claimant’s federal rights. 473 U. S., at 673, n. 19.&para;<br>But we stated expressly that if the agreement did so (as Amex’s does),&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>we provided a standard for applying the rule when a&para;<br>claimant alleges “prohibitive costs” (“Where, as here,” etc.,&para;<br>see supra, at 5), and we then applied that standard to the&para;<br>parties before us. So whatever else the majority might&para;<br>think of the effective-vindication rule, it is not dictum.&para;<br>The next paragraph of the Court’s decision (the third of&para;<br>Part IV) is the key: It contains almost the whole of the&para;<br>majority’s effort to explain why the effective-vindication&para;<br>rule does not stop Amex from compelling arbitration. The&para;<br>majority’s first move is to describe Mitsubishi and Randolph as covering only discrete situations: The rule, the&para;<br>majority asserts, applies to arbitration agreements that&para;<br>eliminate the “right to pursue statutory remedies” by&para;<br>“forbidding the assertion” of the right (as addressed in&para;<br>Mitsubishi) or imposing filing and administrative fees “so&para;<br>high as to make access to the forum impracticable” (as&para;<br>addressed in Randolph). Ante, at 6 (emphasis deleted;&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted). Those cases are not&para;<br>this case, the majority says: Here, the agreement’s provisions went to the possibility of “proving a statutory remedy.” Ante, at 7.&para;<br>But the distinction the majority proffers, which excludes&para;<br>problems of proof, is one Mitsubishi and Randolph (and&para;<br>our decisions reaffirming them) foreclose. Those decisions&para;<br>establish what in some quarters is known as a principle:&para;<br>When an arbitration agreement prevents the effective&para;<br>vindication of federal rights, a party may go to court.&para;<br>That principle, by its nature, operates in diverse circumstances—not just the ones that happened to come before the&para;<br>Court. See supra, at 3–4. It doubtless covers the baldly&para;<br>exculpatory clause and prohibitive fees that the majority&para;<br>acknowledges would preclude an arbitration agreement’s&para;<br>enforcement. But so too it covers the world of other provisions a clever drafter might devise to scuttle even the most&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>we would invalidate it. Ibid.; see supra, at 4. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS &para;<br>&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>meritorious federal claims. Those provisions might deny&para;<br>entry to the forum in the first instance. Or they might&para;<br>deprive the claimant of any remedy. Or they might prevent the claimant from offering the necessary proof to&para;<br>prevail, as in my “no economic testimony” hypothetical—&para;<br>and in the actual circumstances of this case. See supra, at&para;<br>3. The variations matter not at all. Whatever the precise&para;<br>mechanism, each “operate[s] . . . as a prospective waiver of&para;<br>a party’s [federal] right[s]”—and so confers immunity on a&para;<br>wrongdoer. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. And that&para;<br>is what counts under our decisions.4&para;<br>Nor can the majority escape the principle we have established by observing, as it does at one point, that Amex’s&para;<br>agreement merely made arbitration “not worth the expense.” Ante, at 7. That suggestion, after all, runs smack&para;<br>into Randolph, which likewise involved an allegation that&para;<br>arbitration, as specified in a contract, “would be prohibitively expensive.” 531 U. S., at 92. Our decision there&para;<br>made clear that a provision raising a plaintiff ’s costs could&para;<br>foreclose consideration of federal claims, and so run afoul&para;<br>of the effective-vindication rule. The expense at issue in&para;<br>Randolph came from a filing fee combined with a per-diem&para;<br>payment for the arbitrator. But nothing about those&para;<br>particular costs is distinctive; and indeed, a rule confined&para;<br>to them would be weirdly idiosyncratic. Not surprisingly,&para;<br>then, Randolph gave no hint of distinguishing among the&para;<br>different ways an arbitration agreement can make a claim&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Gilmer and Vimar Seguros, which the majority relies on, see ante, at&para;<br>8, fail to advance its argument. The plaintiffs there did not claim, as&para;<br>Italian Colors does, that an arbitration clause altogether precluded&para;<br>them from vindicating their federal rights. They averred only that&para;<br>arbitration would be less convenient or effective than a proceeding in&para;<br>court. See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 31–&para;<br>32 (1991); Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515&para;<br>U. S. 528, 533 (1995). As I have explained, that kind of showing does&para;<br>not meet the effective-vindication rule’s high bar. See supra, at 6.&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Its rationale applies whenever an&para;<br>agreement makes the vindication of federal claims impossibly expensive—whether by imposing fees or proscribing&para;<br>cost-sharing or adopting some other device.&para;<br>That leaves the three last sentences in the majority’s&para;<br>core paragraph. Here, the majority conjures a special&para;<br>reason to exclude “class-action waiver[s]” from the effectivevindication rule’s compass. Ante, at 7–8, and n. 4.&para;<br>Rule 23, the majority notes, became law only in 1938—&para;<br>decades after the Sherman Act. The majority’s conclusion:&para;<br>If federal law in the interim decades did not eliminate a&para;<br>plaintiff ’s rights under that Act, then neither does this&para;<br>agreement.&para;<br>But that notion, first of all, rests on a false premise: that&para;<br>this case is only about a class-action waiver. See ante, at&para;<br>7, n. 4 (confining the case to that issue). It is not, and&para;<br>indeed could not sensibly be. The effective-vindication&para;<br>rule asks whether an arbitration agreement as a whole&para;<br>precludes a claimant from enforcing federal statutory&para;<br>rights. No single provision is properly viewed in isolation,&para;<br>because an agreement can close off one avenue to pursue a&para;<br>claim while leaving others open. In this case, for example,&para;<br>the agreement could have prohibited class arbitration&para;<br>without offending the effective-vindication rule if it had&para;<br>provided an alternative mechanism to share, shift, or&para;<br>reduce the necessary costs. The agreement’s problem is&para;<br>that it bars not just class actions, but also all mechanisms—many existing long before the Sherman Act, if that&para;<br>matters—for joinder or consolidation of claims, informal&para;<br>coordination among individual claimants, or amelioration&para;<br>of arbitral expenses. See supra, at 7. And contrary to the&para;<br>majority’s assertion, the Second Circuit well understood&para;<br>that point: It considered, for example, whether Italian&para;<br>Colors could shift expert expenses to Amex if its claim&para;<br>prevailed (no) or could join with merchants bringing similar claims to produce a common expert report (no again).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS &para;<br>&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>See 554 F. 3d 300, 318 (2009). It is only in this Court that&para;<br>the case has become strangely narrow, as the majority&para;<br>stares at a single provision rather than considering, in the&para;<br>way the effective-vindication rule demands, how the entire&para;<br>contract operates.5&para;<br>In any event, the age of the relevant procedural mechanisms (whether class actions or any other) does not matter, because the effective-vindication rule asks about the&para;<br>world today, not the world as it might have looked when&para;<br>Congress passed a given statute. Whether a particular&para;<br>procedural device preceded or post-dated a particular&para;<br>statute, the question remains the same: Does the arbitration agreement foreclose a party—right now—from&para;<br>effectively vindicating the substantive rights the statute&para;<br>provides? This case exhibits a whole raft of changes since&para;<br>Congress passed the Sherman Act, affecting both parties&para;<br>to the dispute—not just new procedural rules (like Rule&para;<br>23), but also new evidentiary requirements (like the&para;<br>demand here for an expert report) and new contract provisions affecting arbitration (like this agreement’s confidentiality clause). But what has stayed the same is this:&para;<br>Congress’s intent that antitrust plaintiffs should be able to&para;<br>enforce their rights free of any prior waiver. See supra, at&para;<br>2–3; Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. The effectivevindication rule carries out that purpose by ensuring that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 In defense of this focus, the majority quotes the Second Circuit as&para;<br>concluding that “the only economically feasible means” for Italian&para;<br>Colors to enforce its statutory rights “is via a class action.” Ante, at 7–&para;<br>8, n. 4 (quoting 667 F. 3d, at 218; internal quotation marks omitted;&para;<br>emphasis added by the Court). But the Court of Appeals reached that&para;<br>conclusion only after finding that the agreement prohibited all other&para;<br>forms of cost-sharing and cost-shifting. See 554 F. 3d 300, 318 (2009).&para;<br>(That opinion was vacated on other grounds, but its analysis continued&para;<br>to inform—indeed, was essential to—the Second Circuit’s final decision&para;<br>in the case. See 667 F. 3d, at 218.) The Second Circuit therefore did&para;<br>exactly what the majority refuses to do—look to the agreement as a&para;<br>whole to determine whether it permits the vindication of federal rights.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>any arbitration agreement operating as such a waiver is&para;<br>unenforceable. And that requires courts to determine in&para;<br>the here and now—rather than in ye olde glory days—&para;<br>whether an agreement’s provisions foreclose even meritorious antitrust claims.&para;<br>Still, the majority takes one last stab: “Truth to tell,” it&para;<br>claims, AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2011), “all but resolves this case.” Ante, at 8. In that&para;<br>decision, the majority recounts, this Court held that the&para;<br>FAA preempted a state “law conditioning enforcement of&para;<br>arbitration on the availability of class procedure.” Ibid.;&para;<br>see 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). According to the majority, that decision controls here because “[w]e specifically&para;<br>rejected the argument that class arbitration was necessary.” Ante, at 9.&para;<br>Where to begin? Well, maybe where I just left off:&para;<br>Italian Colors is not claiming that a class action is&para;<br>necessary—only that it have some means of vindicating a&para;<br>meritorious claim. And as I have shown, non-class options&para;<br>abound. See supra, at 11. The idea that AT&amp;T Mobility&para;<br>controls here depends entirely on the majority’s view that&para;<br>this case is “class action or bust.” Were the majority to&para;<br>drop that pretense, it could make no claim for AT&amp;T&para;<br>Mobility’s relevance.&para;<br>And just as this case is not about class actions, AT&amp;T&para;<br>Mobility was not—and could not have been—about the&para;<br>effective-vindication rule. Here is a tip-off: AT&amp;T Mobility&para;<br>nowhere cited our effective-vindication precedents. That&para;<br>was so for two reasons. To begin with, the state law in&para;<br>question made class-action waivers unenforceable even&para;<br>when a party could feasibly vindicate her claim in an&para;<br>individual arbitration. The state rule was designed to&para;<br>preserve the broad-scale “deterrent effects of class actions,” not merely to protect a particular plaintiff ’s right&para;<br>to assert her own claim. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).&para;<br>Indeed, the Court emphasized that the complaint in that&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS &para;<br>&para;<br>RESTAURANT&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>case was “most unlikely to go unresolved” because AT&amp;T’s&para;<br>agreement contained a host of features ensuring that&para;<br>“aggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially&para;<br>guaranteed to be made whole.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>17–18) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).&para;<br>So the Court professed that AT&amp;T Mobility did not implicate the only thing (a party’s ability to vindicate a meritorious claim) this case involves.&para;<br>And if that is not enough, AT&amp;T Mobility involved a&para;<br>state law, and therefore could not possibly implicate the&para;<br>effective-vindication rule. When a state rule allegedly&para;<br>conflicts with the FAA, we apply standard preemption&para;<br>principles, asking whether the state law frustrates the&para;<br>FAA’s purposes and objectives. If the state rule does so—&para;<br>as the Court found in AT&amp;T Mobility—the Supremacy&para;<br>Clause requires its invalidation. We have no earthly&para;<br>interest (quite the contrary) in vindicating that law. Our&para;<br>effective-vindication rule comes into play only when the&para;<br>FAA is alleged to conflict with another federal law, like&para;<br>the Sherman Act here. In that all-federal context, one law&para;<br>does not automatically bow to the other, and the effectivevindication rule serves as a way to reconcile any tension&para;<br>between them. Again, then, AT&amp;T Mobility had no occasion to address the issue in this case. The relevant decisions are instead Mitsubishi and Randolph.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Court today mistakes what this case is about. To a&para;<br>hammer, everything looks like a nail. And to a Court bent&para;<br>on diminishing the usefulness of Rule 23, everything looks&para;<br>like a class action, ready to be dismantled. So the Court&para;<br>does not consider that Amex’s agreement bars not just&para;<br>class actions, but “other forms of cost-sharing . . . that&para;<br>could provide effective vindication.” Ante, at 7, n. 4. In&para;<br>short, the Court does not consider—and does not decide—&para;<br>Italian Colors’s (and similarly situated litigants’) actual&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>argument about why the effective-vindication rule precludes this agreement’s enforcement.&para;<br>As a result, Amex’s contract will succeed in depriving&para;<br>Italian Colors of any effective opportunity to challenge&para;<br>monopolistic conduct allegedly in violation of the Sherman&para;<br>Act. The FAA, the majority says, so requires. Do not be&para;<br>fooled. Only the Court so requires; the FAA was never&para;<br>meant to produce this outcome. The FAA conceived of&para;<br>arbitration as a “method of resolving disputes”—a way of&para;<br>using tailored and streamlined procedures to facilitate&para;<br>redress of injuries. Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U. S., at 481&para;<br>(emphasis added). In the hands of today’s majority, arbitration threatens to become more nearly the opposite—a&para;<br>mechanism easily made to block the vindication of meritorious federal claims and insulate wrongdoers from liability. The Court thus undermines the FAA no less than it&para;<br>does the Sherman Act and other federal statutes providing&para;<br>rights of action. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
