RICHTER&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–587.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 12, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1994, deputies called to drug dealer Johnson’s California home found&para;<br>Johnson wounded and Klein fatally wounded. Johnson claimed that&para;<br>he was shot in his bedroom by respondent Richter’s codefendant,&para;<br>Branscombe; that he found Klein on the living room couch; and that&para;<br>his gun safe, a pistol, and cash were missing. His account was cor&para;<br>roborated by evidence at the scene, including, relevant here, spent&para;<br>shell casings, blood spatters, and blood pooled in the bedroom door&para;<br>way. Investigators took a blood sample from a wall near the bedroom&para;<br>door, but not from the blood pool. A search of Richter’s home turned&para;<br>up the safe and ammunition matching evidence at the scene. After&para;<br>his arrest on murder and other charges, Richter initially denied his&para;<br>involvement, but later admitted disposing of Johnson’s and&para;<br>Branscombe’s guns. The prosecution initially built its case on John&para;<br>son’s testimony and the circumstantial evidence, but it adjusted its&para;<br>approach after Richter’s counsel, in his opening statement, outlined&para;<br>the theory that Branscombe shot Johnson in self-defense and that&para;<br>Klein was killed in the crossfire in the bedroom doorway, and&para;<br>stressed the lack of forensic support for the prosecution’s case. The&para;<br>prosecution then decided to call an expert in blood pattern evidence,&para;<br>who testified that it was unlikely that Klein had been shot outside&para;<br>the living room and then moved to the couch, and a serologist, who&para;<br>testified that the blood sample taken near the blood pool could be&para;<br>Johnson’s but not Klein’s. Under cross-examination, she conceded&para;<br>that she had not tested the sample for cross-contamination and that&para;<br>a degraded sample would make it difficult to tell if it had blood of&para;<br>Klein’s type. Defense counsel called Richter to tell his conflicting&para;<br>version of events and called other witnesses to corroborate Richter’s&para;<br>version. Richter was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>He later sought habeas relief from the California Supreme Court, as&para;<br>serting, inter alia, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance,&para;<br>see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, when he failed to pre&para;<br>sent expert testimony on blood evidence, because it could have dis&para;<br>closed the blood pool’s source and bolstered Richter’s theory. He also&para;<br>offered affidavits from forensics experts to support his claim. The&para;<br>court denied the petition in a one-sentence summary order. Subse&para;<br>quently, he reasserted his state claims in a federal habeas petition.&para;<br>The District Court denied his petition. A Ninth Circuit panel af&para;<br>firmed, but the en banc court reversed. Initially it questioned&para;<br>whether 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)—which, as amended by the Antiterror&para;<br>ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), limits the&para;<br>availability of federal habeas relief for claims previously “adjudicated&para;<br>on the merits” in state court—applied to Richter’s petition, since the&para;<br>State Supreme Court issued only a summary denial. But it found the&para;<br>state-court decision unreasonable anyway. In its view, trial counsel&para;<br>was deficient in failing to consult blood evidence experts in planning&para;<br>a trial strategy and in preparing to rebut expert evidence the prose&para;<br>cution might—and later did—offer.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Section 2254(d) applies to Richter’s petition, even though the&para;<br>state court’s order was unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the&para;<br>court’s reasoning. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(a) By its terms, §2254(d) bars relitigation of a claim “adjudicated&para;<br>on the merits” in state court unless, among other exceptions, the ear&para;<br>lier state-court “decision” involved “an unreasonable application” of&para;<br>“clearly established Federal law, as determined by” this Court,&para;<br>§2254(d)(1). Nothing in its text—which refers only to a “decision” re&para;<br>sulting “from an adjudication”—requires a statement of reasons.&para;<br>Where the state-court decision has no explanation, the habeas peti&para;<br>tioner must still show there was no reasonable basis for the state&para;<br>court to deny relief. There is no merit to the assertion that applying&para;<br>§2254(d) when state courts issue summary rulings will encourage&para;<br>those courts to withhold explanations. The issuance of summary dis&para;<br>positions can enable state judiciaries to concentrate resources where&para;<br>most needed. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) Nor is there merit to Richter’s argument that §2254(d) does&para;<br>not apply because the California Supreme Court did not say it was&para;<br>adjudicating his claim “on the merits.” When a state court has de&para;<br>nied relief, adjudication on the merits can be presumed absent any&para;<br>contrary indication or state-law procedural principles. The presump&para;<br>tion may be overcome by a more likely explanation for the state&para;<br>court’s decision, but Richter does not make that showing here. Pp. 9–&para;<br>10.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>2. Richter was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit. Pp. 10–24.&para;<br>(a) That court failed to accord the required deference to the deci&para;<br>sion of a state court adjudicating the same claims later presented in&para;<br>the federal habeas petition. Its opinion shows an improper under&para;<br>standing of §2254(d)’s unreasonableness standard and operation in&para;<br>the context of a Strickland claim. Asking whether the state court’s&para;<br>application of Strickland’s standard was unreasonable is different&para;<br>from asking whether defense counsel’s performance fell below that&para;<br>standard. Under AEDPA, a state court must be granted a deference&para;<br>and latitude that are not in operation in a case involving direct re&para;<br>view under Strickland. A state court’s determination that a claim&para;<br>lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as “fair-minded ju&para;<br>rists could disagree” on the correctness of that decision. Yarborough&para;<br>v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664. And the more general the rule being&para;<br>considered, “the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in&para;<br>case-by-case determinations.” Ibid. The Ninth Circuit explicitly con&para;<br>ducted a de novo review and found a Strickland violation; it then de&para;<br>clared without further explanation that the state court’s contrary de&para;<br>cision was unreasonable. But §2254(d) requires a habeas court to&para;<br>determine what arguments or theories supported, or could have sup&para;<br>ported, the state-court decision; and then to ask whether it is possible&para;<br>fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories&para;<br>are inconsistent with a prior decision of this Court. AEDPA’s unrea&para;<br>sonableness standard is not a test of the confidence of a federal ha&para;<br>beas court in the conclusion it would reach as a de novo matter. Even&para;<br>a strong case for relief does not make the state court’s contrary con&para;<br>clusion unreasonable. Section 2254(d) is designed to confirm that&para;<br>state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal&para;<br>lenges to state convictions. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(b) The Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that Richter demon&para;<br>strated an unreasonable application of Strickland by the state court.&para;<br>Pp. 14–23.&para;<br>(1) Richter could have secured relief in state court only by&para;<br>showing both that his counsel provided deficient assistance and that&para;<br>prejudice resulted. To be deficient, counsel’s representation must&para;<br>have fallen “below an objective standard of reasonableness,” Strick&para;<br>land, 466 U. S., at 688; and there is a “strong presumption” that&para;<br>counsel’s representation is within the “wide range” of reasonable pro&para;<br>fessional assistance, id., at 689. The question is whether counsel&para;<br>made errors so fundamental that counsel was not functioning as the&para;<br>counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Prejudice requires&para;<br>demonstrating “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unpro&para;<br>fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ent.” Id., at 694. “Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never . . .&para;<br>easy.” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S.___, ___. Strickland can func&para;<br>tion as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture. The question is&para;<br>whether an attorney’s representation amounted to incompetence un&para;<br>der prevailing professional norms, not whether it deviated from best&para;<br>practices or most common custom. Establishing that a state court’s&para;<br>application of Strickland was unreasonable under §2254(d) is even&para;<br>more difficult, since both standards are “highly deferential,” 466 U. S,&para;<br>at 689, and since Strickland’s general standard has a substantial&para;<br>range of reasonable applications. The question under §2254(d) is not&para;<br>whether counsel’s actions were reasonable, but whether there is any&para;<br>reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential&para;<br>standard. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(2) The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that because Richter’s&para;<br>attorney had not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced ex&para;<br>pert evidence, the State Supreme Court could not reasonably have&para;<br>concluded counsel provided adequate representation.&para;<br>A state court could reasonably conclude that a competent attorney&para;<br>could elect a strategy that did not require using blood evidence ex&para;<br>perts. Rare are the situations in which the latitude counsel enjoys&para;<br>will be limited to any one technique or approach. There were any&para;<br>number of experts whose insight might have been useful to the de&para;<br>fense. Counsel is entitled to balance limited resources in accord with&para;<br>effective trial tactics and strategies. In finding otherwise the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit failed to “reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s chal&para;<br>lenged conduct” and “evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective&para;<br>at the time.” Strickland, supra, at 689. Given the many factual dif&para;<br>ferences between the prosecution and defense versions of events, it&para;<br>was far from evident at the time of trial that the blood source was&para;<br>central to Richter’s case. And relying on “the harsh light of hind&para;<br>sight” to cast doubt on a trial that took place over 15 years ago is pre&para;<br>cisely what Strickland and AEDPA seek to prevent. See Bell v. Cone,&para;<br>535 U. S. 685, 702. Even had the value of expert testimony been ap&para;<br>parent, it would be reasonable to conclude that a competent attorney&para;<br>might elect not to use it here, where counsel had reason to question&para;<br>the truth of his client’s account. Making blood evidence a central is&para;<br>sue could also have led the prosecution to produce its own expert&para;<br>analysis, possibly destroying Richter’s case, or distracted the jury&para;<br>with esoteric questions of forensic science. Defense counsel’s opening&para;<br>statement may have inspired the prosecution to present forensic evi&para;<br>dence, but that shows only that the defense strategy did not work out&para;<br>as well as hoped. In light of the record here there was no basis to&para;<br>rule that the state court’s determination was unreasonable.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing such concern as an inac&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>curate account of counsel’s actual thinking, since Strickland exam&para;<br>ined only the objective reasonableness of counsel’s actions. As to&para;<br>whether counsel was constitutionally deficient for not preparing ex&para;<br>pert testimony as a response to the prosecution’s, an attorney may&para;<br>not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight or&para;<br>for failing to prepare for remote possibilities. Here, even if counsel&para;<br>was mistaken, the prosecution itself did not expect to present forensic&para;<br>testimony until the eve of trial. Thus, it is at least debatable whether&para;<br>counsel’s error was so fundamental as to call the trial’s fairness into&para;<br>doubt. Even if counsel should have foreseen the prosecution’s tactic,&para;<br>Richter would still need to show it was indisputable that Strickland&para;<br>required his attorney to rely on a rebuttal witness rather than on&para;<br>cross-examination to discredit the witnesses, but Strickland imposes&para;<br>no such requirement. And while it is possible an isolated error can&para;<br>constitute ineffective assistance if it is sufficiently egregious, it is dif&para;<br>ficult to establish ineffective assistance where counsel’s overall per&para;<br>formance reflects active and capable advocacy. Pp. 16–22.&para;<br>(3) The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that Richter had&para;<br>established prejudice under Strickland, which asks whether it is&para;<br>“reasonably likely” the verdict would have been different, 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 696, not whether a court can be certain counsel’s performance had&para;<br>no effect on the outcome or that reasonable doubt might have been&para;<br>established had counsel acted differently. There must be a substan&para;<br>tial likelihood of a different result. The State Supreme Court could&para;<br>have reasonably concluded that Richter’s prejudice evidence fell short&para;<br>of this standard. His expert serology evidence established only a&para;<br>theoretical possibility of Klein’s blood being in the blood pool; and at&para;<br>trial, defense counsel extracted a similar concession from the prose&para;<br>cution’s expert. It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab&para;<br>lished prejudice given that he offered no evidence challenging other&para;<br>conclusions of the prosecution’s experts, e.g., that the blood sample&para;<br>matched Johnson’s blood type. There was, furthermore, sufficient&para;<br>conventional circumstantial evidence pointing to Richter’s guilt, in&para;<br>cluding, e.g., the items found at his home.

Judges&para;<br>must be vigilant and independent in reviewing petitions&para;<br>for the writ, a commitment that entails substantial judi&para;<br>cial resources. Those resources are diminished and mis&para;<br>spent, however, and confidence in the writ and the law it&para;<br>vindicates undermined, if there is judicial disregard for&para;<br>the sound and established principles that inform its&para;<br>proper issuance. That judicial disregard is inherent in the&para;<br>opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit here&para;<br>under review. The Court of Appeals, in disagreement with&para;<br>the contrary conclusions of the Supreme Court of the State&para;<br>of California and of a United States District Court, or&para;<br>dered habeas corpus relief granted to set aside the convic&para;<br>tion of Joshua Richter, respondent here. This was clear&para;<br>error.&para;<br>Under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), the availability of federal&para;<br>habeas relief is limited with respect to claims previously&para;<br>“adjudicated on the merits” in state-court proceedings.&para;<br>The first inquiry this case presents is whether that pro&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vision applies when state-court relief is denied without&para;<br>an accompanying statement of reasons. If it does, the&para;<br>question is whether the Court of Appeals adhered to the&para;<br>statute’s terms, in this case as it relates to ineffective&para;<br>assistance claims judged by the standard set forth in&para;<br>Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). A second&para;<br>case decided today, Premo v. Moore, post, p. ___, presents&para;<br>similar issues. Here, as in that case, it is necessary to&para;<br>reverse the Court of Appeals for failing to accord required&para;<br>deference to the decision of a state court.&para;<br>I&para;<br>It is necessary to begin by discussing the details of a&para;<br>crime committed more than a decade and a half ago.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Sometime after midnight on December 20, 1994, sher&para;<br>iff’s deputies in Sacramento County, California, arrived at&para;<br>the home of a drug dealer named Joshua Johnson. Hours&para;<br>before, Johnson had been smoking marijuana in the com&para;<br>pany of Richter and two other men, Christian Branscombe&para;<br>and Patrick Klein. When the deputies arrived, however,&para;<br>they found only Johnson and Klein. Johnson was hysteri&para;<br>cal and covered in blood. Klein was lying on a couch in&para;<br>Johnson’s living room, unconscious and bleeding. Klein&para;<br>and Johnson each had been shot twice. Johnson recov&para;<br>ered; Klein died of his wounds.&para;<br>Johnson gave investigators this account: After falling&para;<br>asleep, he awoke to find Richter and Branscombe in his&para;<br>bedroom, at which point Branscombe shot him. Johnson&para;<br>heard more gunfire in the living room and the sound of his&para;<br>assailants leaving. He got up, found Klein bleeding on the&para;<br>living room couch, and called 911. A gun safe, a pistol,&para;<br>and $6,000 cash, all of which had been in the bedroom,&para;<br>were missing.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Evidence at the scene corroborated Johnson’s account.&para;<br>Investigators found spent shell casings in the bedroom&para;<br>(where Johnson said he had been shot) and in the living&para;<br>room (where Johnson indicated Klein had been shot). In&para;<br>the living room there were two casings, a .32 caliber and a&para;<br>.22 caliber. One of the bullets recovered from Klein’s body&para;<br>was a .32 and the other was a .22. In the bedroom there&para;<br>were two more casings, both .32 caliber. In addition detec&para;<br>tives found blood spatter near the living room couch and&para;<br>bloodstains in the bedroom. Pools of blood had collected in&para;<br>the kitchen and the doorway to Johnson’s bedroom. Inves&para;<br>tigators took only a few blood samples from the crime&para;<br>scene. One was from a blood splash on the wall near&para;<br>the bedroom doorway, but no sample was taken from the&para;<br>doorway blood pool itself.&para;<br>Investigators searched Richter’s residence and found&para;<br>Johnson’s gun safe, two boxes of .22-caliber ammunition,&para;<br>and a gun magazine loaded with cartridges of the same&para;<br>brand and type as the boxes. A ballistics expert later&para;<br>concluded the .22-caliber bullet that struck Klein and&para;<br>the .22-caliber shell found in the living room matched the&para;<br>ammunition found in Richter’s home and bore markings&para;<br>consistent with the model of gun for which the magazine&para;<br>was designed.&para;<br>Richter and Branscombe were arrested. At first Richter&para;<br>denied involvement. He would later admit taking John&para;<br>son’s pistol and disposing of it and of the .32-caliber&para;<br>weapon Branscombe used to shoot Johnson and Klein.&para;<br>Richter’s counsel produced Johnson’s missing pistol, but&para;<br>neither of the guns used to shoot Johnson and Klein was&para;<br>found.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Branscombe and Richter were tried together on charges&para;<br>of murder, attempted murder, burglary, and robbery.&para;<br>Only Richter’s case is presented here.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The prosecution built its case on Johnson’s testimony&para;<br>and on circumstantial evidence. Its opening statement&para;<br>took note of the shell casings found at the crime scene and&para;<br>the ammunition and gun safe found at Richter’s residence.&para;<br>Defense counsel offered explanations for the circumstan&para;<br>tial evidence and derided Johnson as a drug dealer, a&para;<br>paranoid, and a trigger-happy gun fanatic who had drawn&para;<br>a pistol on Branscombe and Richter the last time he had&para;<br>seen them. And there were inconsistencies in Johnson’s&para;<br>story. In his 911 call, for instance, Johnson first said&para;<br>there were four or five men who had broken into his&para;<br>house, not two; and in the call he did not identify Richter&para;<br>and Branscombe among the intruders.&para;<br>Blood evidence does not appear to have been part of the&para;<br>prosecution’s planned case prior to trial, and investigators&para;<br>had not analyzed the few blood samples taken from the&para;<br>crime scene. But the opening statement from the defense&para;<br>led the prosecution to alter its approach. Richter’s attor&para;<br>ney outlined the theory that Branscombe had fired on&para;<br>Johnson in self-defense and that Klein had been killed not&para;<br>on the living room couch but in the crossfire in the bed&para;<br>room doorway. Defense counsel stressed deficiencies in&para;<br>the investigation, including the absence of forensic support&para;<br>for the prosecution’s version of events.&para;<br>The prosecution took steps to adjust to the counterat&para;<br>tack now disclosed. Without advance notice and over the&para;<br>objection of Richter’s attorney, one of the detectives who&para;<br>investigated the shootings testified for the prosecution as&para;<br>an expert in blood pattern evidence. He concluded it was&para;<br>unlikely Klein had been shot outside the living room and&para;<br>then moved to the couch, given the patterns of blood on&para;<br>Klein’s face, as well as other evidence including “high&para;<br>velocity” blood spatter near the couch consistent with the&para;<br>location of a shooting. The prosecution also offered testi&para;<br>mony from a serologist. She testified the blood sample&para;<br>taken near the pool by the bedroom door could be John&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>son’s but not Klein’s.&para;<br>Defense counsel’s cross-examination probed weaknesses&para;<br>in the testimony of these two witnesses. The detective&para;<br>who testified on blood patterns acknowledged that his&para;<br>inferences were imprecise, that it was unlikely Klein had&para;<br>been lying down on the couch when shot, and that he could&para;<br>not say the blood in the living room was from either of&para;<br>Klein’s wounds. Defense counsel elicited from the serolo&para;<br>gist a concession that she had not tested the bedroom&para;<br>blood sample for cross-contamination. She said that if the&para;<br>year-old sample had degraded, it would be difficult to tell&para;<br>whether blood of Klein’s type was also present in the&para;<br>sample.&para;<br>For the defense, Richter’s attorney called seven wit&para;<br>nesses. Prominent among these was Richter himself.&para;<br>Richter testified he and Branscombe returned to Johnson’s&para;<br>house just before the shootings in order to deliver some&para;<br>thing to one of Johnson’s roommates. By Richter’s ac&para;<br>count, Branscombe entered the house alone while Richter&para;<br>waited in the driveway; but after hearing screams and&para;<br>gunshots, Richter followed inside. There he saw Klein&para;<br>lying not on the couch but in the bedroom doorway, with&para;<br>Johnson on the bed and Branscombe standing in the&para;<br>middle of the room. According to Richter, Branscombe&para;<br>said he shot at Johnson and Klein after they attacked him.&para;<br>Other defense witnesses provided some corroboration for&para;<br>Richter’s story. His former girlfriend, for instance, said&para;<br>she saw the gun safe at Richter’s house shortly before the&para;<br>shootings.&para;<br>The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.&para;<br>Richter was sentenced to life without parole. On appeal,&para;<br>his conviction was affirmed. People v. Branscombe, 72&para;<br>Cal. Rptr. 2d 773 (Cal.

He asserted a number of&para;<br>grounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of coun&para;<br>sel. As relevant here, he claimed his counsel was deficient&para;<br>for failing to present expert testimony on serology, pathol&para;<br>ogy, and blood spatter patterns, testimony that, he argued,&para;<br>would disclose the source of the blood pool in the bedroom&para;<br>doorway. This, he contended, would bolster his theory&para;<br>that Johnson had moved Klein to the couch.&para;<br>He offered affidavits from three types of forensic ex&para;<br>perts. First, he provided statements from two blood se&para;<br>rologists who said there was a possibility Klein’s blood was&para;<br>intermixed with blood of Johnson’s type in the sample&para;<br>taken from near the pool in the bedroom doorway. Second,&para;<br>he provided a statement from a pathologist who said the&para;<br>blood pool was too large to have come from Johnson given&para;<br>the nature of his wounds and his own account of his ac&para;<br>tions while waiting for the police. Third, he provided a&para;<br>statement from an expert in bloodstain analysis who said&para;<br>the absence of “a large number of satellite droplets” in&para;<br>photographs of the area around the blood in the bedroom&para;<br>doorway was inconsistent with the blood pool coming from&para;<br>Johnson as he stood in the doorway. App. 118. Richter&para;<br>argued this evidence established the possibility that the&para;<br>blood in the bedroom doorway came from Klein, not John&para;<br>son. If that were true, he argued, it would confirm his&para;<br>account, not Johnson’s. The California Supreme Court&para;<br>denied Richter’s petition in a one-sentence summary&para;<br>order.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>order denying relief, Richter filed a petition for habeas&para;<br>corpus in United States District Court for the Eastern&para;<br>District of California. He reasserted the claims in his&para;<br>state petition. The District Court denied his petition, and&para;<br>a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed. See Richter v. Hickman, 521 F. 3d 1222&para;<br>(2008). The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc&para;<br>and reversed the District Court’s decision. See Richter v.&para;<br>Hickman, 578 F. 3d 944 (2009).&para;<br>As a preliminary matter, the Court of Appeals ques&para;<br>tioned whether 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) was applicable to&para;<br>Richter’s petition, since the California Supreme Court&para;<br>issued only a summary denial when it rejected his Strick&para;<br>land claims; but it determined the California decision was&para;<br>unreasonable in any event and that Richter was entitled&para;<br>to relief. The court held Richter’s trial counsel was defi&para;<br>cient for failing to consult experts on blood evidence in&para;<br>determining and pursuing a trial strategy and in prepar&para;<br>ing to rebut expert evidence the prosecution might—and&para;<br>later did—offer. Four judges dissented from the en banc&para;<br>decision.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas&para;<br>corpus relief for persons in state custody is provided by 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of&para;<br>§2254(d) states:&para;<br>“An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf&para;<br>of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a&para;<br>State court shall not be granted with respect to any&para;<br>claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State&para;<br>court proceedings unless the adjudication of the&para;<br>claim—&para;<br>“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States; or&para;<br>“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un&para;<br>reasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>As an initial matter, it is necessary to decide whether&para;<br>§2254(d) applies when a state court’s order is unaccompa&para;<br>nied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been&para;<br>denied.&para;<br>By its terms §2254(d) bars relitigation of any claim&para;<br>“adjudicated on the merits” in state court, subject only to&para;<br>the exceptions in §§2254(d)(1) and (d)(2). There is no text&para;<br>in the statute requiring a statement of reasons. The&para;<br>statute refers only to a “decision,” which resulted from an&para;<br>“adjudication.” As every Court of Appeals to consider the&para;<br>issue has recognized, determining whether a state court’s&para;<br>decision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual&para;<br>conclusion does not require that there be an opinion from&para;<br>the state court explaining the state court’s reasoning. See&para;<br>Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605–606 (CA3 2002);&para;<br>Wright v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 278 F. 3d&para;<br>1245, 1253–1254 (CA11 2002); Sellan v. Kuhlman, 261&para;<br>F. 3d 303, 311–312 (CA2 2001); Bell v. Jarvis, 236 F. 3d&para;<br>149, 158–162 (CA4 2000) (en banc); Harris v. Stovall, 212&para;<br>F. 3d 940, 943, n. 1 (CA6 2000); Aycox v. Lytle, 196 F. 3d&para;<br>1174, 1177–1178 (CA10 1999); James v. Bowersox, 187&para;<br>F. 3d 866, 869 (CA8 1999). And as this Court has ob&para;<br>served, a state court need not cite or even be aware of our&para;<br>cases under §2254(d). Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8&para;<br>(2002) (per curiam). Where a state court’s decision is&para;<br>unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner’s&para;<br>burden still must be met by showing there was no reason&para;<br>able basis for the state court to deny relief. This is so&para;<br>whether or not the state court reveals which of the ele&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ments in a multipart claim it found insufficient, for&para;<br>§2254(d) applies when a “claim,” not a component of one,&para;<br>has been adjudicated.&para;<br>There is no merit to the assertion that compliance with&para;<br>§2254(d) should be excused when state courts issue sum&para;<br>mary rulings because applying §2254(d) in those cases will&para;<br>encourage state courts to withhold explanations for their&para;<br>decisions. Opinion-writing practices in state courts are&para;<br>influenced by considerations other than avoiding scrutiny&para;<br>by collateral attack in federal court. Cf. In re Robbins, 18&para;<br>Cal. 4th 770, 778, n. 1, 959 P. 2d 311, 316, n. 1 (1998)&para;<br>(state procedures limiting habeas are “a means of protect&para;<br>ing the integrity of our own appeal and habeas corpus&para;<br>process,” rather than a device for “insulating our judg&para;<br>ments from federal court review” (emphasis deleted)). At&para;<br>the same time, requiring a statement of reasons could&para;<br>undercut state practices designed to preserve the integrity&para;<br>of the case-law tradition. The issuance of summary dispo&para;<br>sitions in many collateral attack cases can enable a state&para;<br>judiciary to concentrate its resources on the cases where&para;<br>opinions are most needed. See Brief for California Attor&para;<br>neys for Criminal Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (noting&para;<br>that the California Supreme Court disposes of close to&para;<br>10,000 cases a year, including more than 3,400 original&para;<br>habeas corpus petitions).&para;<br>There is no merit either in Richter’s argument that&para;<br>§2254(d) is inapplicable because the California Supreme&para;<br>Court did not say it was adjudicating his claim “on the&para;<br>merits.” The state court did not say it was denying the&para;<br>claim for any other reason. When a federal claim has been&para;<br>presented to a state court and the state court has denied&para;<br>relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated&para;<br>the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or&para;<br>state-law procedural principles to the contrary. Cf. Harris&para;<br>v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 265 (1989) (presumption of a merits&para;<br>determination when it is unclear whether a decision ap&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pearing to rest on federal grounds was decided on another&para;<br>basis).&para;<br>The presumption may be overcome when there is reason&para;<br>to think some other explanation for the state court’s deci&para;<br>sion is more likely. See, e.g., Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501&para;<br>U. S. 797, 803 (1991). Richter, however, does not make&para;<br>that showing. He mentions the theoretical possibility that&para;<br>the members of the California Supreme Court may not&para;<br>have agreed on the reasons for denying his petition. It is&para;<br>pure speculation, however, to suppose that happened in&para;<br>this case. And Richter’s assertion that the mere possibil&para;<br>ity of a lack of agreement prevents any attribution of&para;<br>reasons to the state court’s decision is foreclosed by prece&para;<br>dent. See ibid.&para;<br>As has been noted before, the California courts or Legis&para;<br>lature can alter the State’s practices or elaborate more&para;<br>fully on their import. See Evans v. Chavis, 546 U. S. 189,&para;<br>197, 199 (2006). But that has not occurred here. This&para;<br>Court now holds and reconfirms that §2254(d) does not&para;<br>require a state court to give reasons before its decision can&para;<br>be deemed to have been “adjudicated on the merits.”&para;<br>Richter has failed to show that the California Supreme&para;<br>Court’s decision did not involve a determination of the&para;<br>merits of his claim. Section 2254(d) applies to his petition.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Federal habeas relief may not be granted for claims&para;<br>subject to §2254(d) unless it is shown that the earlier state&para;<br>court’s decision “was contrary to” federal law then clearly&para;<br>established in the holdings of this Court, §2254(d)(1);&para;<br>Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000); or that&para;<br>it “involved an unreasonable application of” such law,&para;<br>§2254(d)(1); or that it “was based on an unreasonable&para;<br>determination of the facts” in light of the record before the&para;<br>state court, §2254(d)(2).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals relied on the second of these ex&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ceptions to §2254(d)’s relitigation bar, the exception in&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) permitting relitigation where the earlier state&para;<br>decision resulted from an “unreasonable application of”&para;<br>clearly established federal law. In the view of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, the California Supreme Court’s decision on Rich&para;<br>ter’s ineffective-assistance claim unreasonably applied the&para;<br>holding in Strickland. The Court of Appeals’ lengthy&para;<br>opinion, however, discloses an improper understanding of&para;<br>§2254(d)’s unreasonableness standard and of its operation&para;<br>in the context of a Strickland claim.&para;<br>The pivotal question is whether the state court’s appli&para;<br>cation of the Strickland standard was unreasonable. This&para;<br>is different from asking whether defense counsel’s per&para;<br>formance fell below Strickland’s standard. Were that the&para;<br>inquiry, the analysis would be no different than if, for&para;<br>example, this Court were adjudicating a Strickland claim&para;<br>on direct review of a criminal conviction in a United States&para;<br>district court. Under AEDPA, though, it is a necessary&para;<br>premise that the two questions are different. For purposes&para;<br>of §2254(d)(1), “an unreasonable application of federal law&para;<br>is different from an incorrect application of federal law.”&para;<br>Williams, supra, at 410. A state court must be granted a&para;<br>deference and latitude that are not in operation when the&para;<br>case involves review under the Strickland standard itself.&para;<br>A state court’s determination that a claim lacks merit&para;<br>precludes federal habeas relief so long as “fairminded&para;<br>jurists could disagree” on the correctness of the state&para;<br>court’s decision. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,&para;<br>664 (2004).&para;<br>And as this Court has explained,&para;<br>“[E]valuating whether a rule application was unreason&para;<br>able requires considering the rule’s specificity. The more&para;<br>general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching&para;<br>outcomes in case-by-case determinations.” Ibid. “[I]t is&para;<br>not an unreasonable application of clearly established&para;<br>Federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific&para;<br>legal rule that has not been squarely established by this&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 9–10) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Here it is not apparent how the Court of Appeals’ analy&para;<br>sis would have been any different without AEDPA. The&para;<br>court explicitly conducted a de novo review, 578 F. 3d, at&para;<br>952; and after finding a Strickland violation, it declared,&para;<br>without further explanation, that the “state court’s deci&para;<br>sion to the contrary constituted an unreasonable applica&para;<br>tion of Strickland.” 578 F. 3d, at 969. AEDPA demands&para;<br>more. Under §2254(d), a habeas court must determine&para;<br>what arguments or theories supported or, as here, could&para;<br>have supported, the state court’s decision; and then it&para;<br>must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could&para;<br>disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent&para;<br>with the holding in a prior decision of this Court. The&para;<br>opinion of the Court of Appeals all but ignored “the only&para;<br>question that matters under §2254(d)(1).” Lockyer v.&para;<br>Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71 (2003).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals appears to have treated the un&para;<br>reasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the&para;<br>result it would reach under de novo review: Because the&para;<br>Court of Appeals had little doubt that Richter’s Strickland&para;<br>claim had merit, the Court of Appeals concluded the state&para;<br>court must have been unreasonable in rejecting it. This&para;<br>analysis overlooks arguments that would otherwise justify&para;<br>the state court’s result and ignores further limitations of&para;<br>§2254(d), including its requirement that the state court’s&para;<br>decision be evaluated according to the precedents of this&para;<br>Court. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 11–12). It bears repeating that even a strong case&para;<br>for relief does not mean the state court’s contrary conclu&para;<br>sion was unreasonable. See Lockyer, supra, at 75.&para;<br>If this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it&para;<br>was meant to be. As amended by AEDPA, §2254(d) stops&para;<br>short of imposing a complete bar on federal court relitiga&para;<br>tion of claims already rejected in state proceedings. Cf.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996) (discussing&para;<br>AEDPA’s “modified res judicata rule” under §2244). It&para;<br>preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there&para;<br>is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the&para;<br>state court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s prece&para;<br>dents. It goes no farther. Section 2254(d) reflects the view&para;<br>that habeas corpus is a “guard against extreme malfunc&para;<br>tions in the state criminal justice systems,” not a substi&para;<br>tute for ordinary error correction through appeal. Jackson&para;<br>v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332, n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment). As a condition for obtaining&para;<br>habeas corpus from a federal court, a state prisoner must&para;<br>show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being pre&para;<br>sented in federal court was so lacking in justification that&para;<br>there was an error well understood and comprehended in&para;<br>existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded dis&para;<br>agreement.&para;<br>The reasons for this approach are familiar. “Federal&para;<br>habeas review of state convictions frustrates both the&para;<br>States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their&para;<br>good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.”&para;<br>Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555–556 (1998)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). It “disturbs the&para;<br>State’s significant interest in repose for concluded litiga&para;<br>tion, denies society the right to punish some admitted&para;<br>offenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree&para;<br>matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.”&para;<br>Reed, 489 U. S., at 282 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Section 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal&para;<br>habeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts&para;<br>are the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal&para;<br>lenges to state convictions. Under the exhaustion re&para;<br>quirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state convic&para;<br>tion must first attempt to present his claim in state court.&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2254(b). If the state court rejects the claim on&para;<br>procedural grounds, the claim is barred in federal court&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unless one of the exceptions to the doctrine of Wainwright&para;<br>v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82–84 (1977), applies. And if the&para;<br>state court denies the claim on the merits, the claim is&para;<br>barred in federal court unless one of the exceptions to&para;<br>§2254(d) set out in §§2254(d)(1) and (2) applies. Section&para;<br>2254(d) thus complements the exhaustion requirement&para;<br>and the doctrine of procedural bar to ensure that state&para;<br>proceedings are the central process, not just a preliminary&para;<br>step for a later federal habeas proceeding, see id., at 90.&para;<br>Here, however, the Court of Appeals gave §2254(d) no&para;<br>operation or function in its reasoning. Its analysis illus&para;<br>trates a lack of deference to the state court’s determina&para;<br>tion and an improper intervention in state criminal proc&para;<br>esses, contrary to the purpose and mandate of AEDPA and&para;<br>to the now well-settled meaning and function of habeas&para;<br>corpus in the federal system.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Richter&para;<br>demonstrated an unreasonable application by the state&para;<br>court of the Strickland standard now must be discussed.&para;<br>To have been entitled to relief from the California Su&para;<br>preme Court, Richter had to show both that his counsel&para;<br>provided deficient assistance and that there was prejudice&para;<br>as a result.&para;<br>To establish deficient performance, a person challenging&para;<br>a conviction must show that “counsel’s representation fell&para;<br>below an objective standard of reasonableness.” 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 688. A court considering a claim of ineffective assis&para;<br>tance must apply a “strong presumption” that counsel’s&para;<br>representation was within the “wide range” of reasonable&para;<br>professional assistance. Id., at 689. The challenger’s&para;<br>burden is to show “that counsel made errors so serious&para;<br>that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaran&para;<br>teed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.” Id., at 687.&para;<br>With respect to prejudice, a challenger must demon&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>strate “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s&para;<br>unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would&para;<br>have been different. A reasonable probability is a prob&para;<br>ability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”&para;<br>Id., at 694. It is not enough “to show that the errors had&para;<br>some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.”&para;<br>Id., at 693. Counsel’s errors must be “so serious as to&para;<br>deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is&para;<br>reliable.” Id., at 687.&para;<br>“Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy&para;<br>task.” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim can function as&para;<br>a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise&para;<br>issues not presented at trial, and so the Strickland stan&para;<br>dard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest “intrusive&para;<br>post-trial inquiry” threaten the integrity of the very ad&para;<br>versary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.&para;<br>Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689–690. Even under de novo&para;<br>review, the standard for judging counsel’s representation&para;<br>is a most deferential one. Unlike a later reviewing court,&para;<br>the attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of&para;<br>materials outside the record, and interacted with the&para;<br>client, with opposing counsel, and with the judge. It is “all&para;<br>too tempting” to “second-guess counsel’s assistance after&para;<br>conviction or adverse sentence.” Id., at 689; see also Bell&para;<br>v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell,&para;<br>506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an&para;<br>attorney’s representation amounted to incompetence&para;<br>under “prevailing professional norms,” not whether it&para;<br>deviated from best practices or most common custom.&para;<br>Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.&para;<br>Establishing that a state court’s application of Strick&para;<br>land was unreasonable under §2254(d) is all the more&para;<br>difficult.&para;<br>The standards created by Strickland and&para;<br>§2254(d) are both “highly deferential,” id., at 689; Lindh v.&para;<br>Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and when the two&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>apply in tandem, review is “doubly” so, Knowles, 556 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strickland standard is a gen&para;<br>eral one, so the range of reasonable applications is sub&para;<br>stantial. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Federal habeas&para;<br>courts must guard against the danger of equating unrea&para;<br>sonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness&para;<br>under §2254(d). When §2254(d) applies, the question is&para;<br>not whether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The ques&para;<br>tion is whether there is any reasonable argument that&para;<br>counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.&para;<br>A&para;<br>With respect to defense counsel’s performance, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals held that because Richter’s attorney had&para;<br>not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced expert&para;<br>evidence, the California Supreme Court could not rea&para;<br>sonably have concluded counsel provided adequate repre&para;<br>sentation. This conclusion was erroneous.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Court of Appeals first held that Richter’s attorney&para;<br>rendered constitutionally deficient service because he did&para;<br>not consult blood evidence experts in developing the basic&para;<br>strategy for Richter’s defense or offer their testimony as&para;<br>part of the principal case for the defense. Strickland,&para;<br>however, permits counsel to “make a reasonable decision&para;<br>that makes particular investigations unnecessary.” 466&para;<br>U. S., at 691. It was at least arguable that a reasonable&para;<br>attorney could decide to forgo inquiry into the blood evi&para;<br>dence in the circumstances here.&para;<br>Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable and&para;<br>available defense strategy requires consultation with&para;<br>experts or introduction of expert evidence, whether pre&para;<br>trial, at trial, or both. There are, however, “countless&para;<br>ways to provide effective assistance in any given case.&para;<br>Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a particular client in the same way.” Id., at 689. Rare are&para;<br>the situations in which the “wide latitude counsel must&para;<br>have in making tactical decisions” will be limited to any&para;<br>one technique or approach. Ibid. It can be assumed that&para;<br>in some cases counsel would be deemed ineffective for&para;<br>failing to consult or rely on experts, but even that formula&para;<br>tion is sufficiently general that state courts would have&para;<br>wide latitude in applying it. Here it would be well within&para;<br>the bounds of a reasonable judicial determination for the&para;<br>state court to conclude that defense counsel could follow a&para;<br>strategy that did not require the use of experts regarding&para;<br>the pool in the doorway to Johnson’s bedroom.&para;<br>From the perspective of Richter’s defense counsel when&para;<br>he was preparing Richter’s defense, there were any num&para;<br>ber of hypothetical experts—specialists in psychiatry,&para;<br>psychology, ballistics, fingerprints, tire treads, physiology,&para;<br>or numerous other disciplines and subdisciplines—whose&para;<br>insight might possibly have been useful. An attorney can&para;<br>avoid activities that appear “distractive from more impor&para;<br>tant duties.” Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(per curiam) (slip op., at 8). Counsel was entitled to for&para;<br>mulate a strategy that was reasonable at the time and to&para;<br>balance limited resources in accord with effective trial&para;<br>tactics and strategies. See Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 14–15); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 383 (2005);&para;<br>Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 525 (2003); Strickland,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 699.&para;<br>In concluding otherwise the Court of Appeals failed to&para;<br>“reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged&para;<br>conduct” and “evaluate the conduct from counsel’s per&para;<br>spective at the time.” Id., at 689. In its view Klein’s&para;<br>location was “the single most critical issue in the case”&para;<br>given the differing theories of the prosecution and the&para;<br>defense, and the source of the blood in the doorway was&para;<br>therefore of central concern. 578 F. 3d, at 953–954. But it&para;<br>was far from a necessary conclusion that this was evident&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at the time of the trial. There were many factual differ&para;<br>ences between prosecution and defense versions of the&para;<br>events on the night of the shootings. It is only because&para;<br>forensic evidence has emerged concerning the source of the&para;<br>blood pool that the issue could with any plausibility be&para;<br>said to stand apart. Reliance on “the harsh light of hind&para;<br>sight” to cast doubt on a trial that took place now more&para;<br>than 15 years ago is precisely what Strickland and&para;<br>AEDPA seek to prevent. Cone, 535 U. S., at 702; see also&para;<br>Lockhart, 506 U. S., at 372.&para;<br>Even if it had been apparent that expert blood testi&para;<br>mony could support Richter’s defense, it would be reason&para;<br>able to conclude that a competent attorney might elect not&para;<br>to use it. The Court of Appeals opinion for the en banc&para;<br>majority rests in large part on a hypothesis that reasona&para;<br>bly could have been rejected. The hypothesis is that with&para;<br>out jeopardizing Richter’s defense, an expert could have&para;<br>testified that the blood in Johnson’s doorway could not&para;<br>have come from Johnson and could have come from Klein,&para;<br>thus suggesting that Richter’s version of the shooting was&para;<br>correct and Johnson’s a fabrication. This theory overlooks&para;<br>the fact that concentrating on the blood pool carried its&para;<br>own serious risks. If serological analysis or other forensic&para;<br>evidence demonstrated that the blood came from Johnson&para;<br>alone, Richter’s story would be exposed as an invention.&para;<br>An attorney need not pursue an investigation that would&para;<br>be fruitless, much less one that might be harmful to the&para;<br>defense. Strickland, supra, at 691. Here Richter’s attor&para;<br>ney had reason to question the truth of his client’s ac&para;<br>count, given, for instance, Richter’s initial denial of&para;<br>involvement and the subsequent production of Johnson’s&para;<br>missing pistol.&para;<br>It would have been altogether reasonable to conclude&para;<br>that this concern justified the course Richter’s counsel&para;<br>pursued. Indeed, the Court of Appeals recognized this risk&para;<br>insofar as it pertained to the suggestion that counsel&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>should have had the blood evidence tested. 578 F. 3d, at&para;<br>956, n. 9. But the court failed to recognize that making a&para;<br>central issue out of blood evidence would have increased&para;<br>the likelihood of the prosecution’s producing its own evi&para;<br>dence on the blood pool’s origins and composition; and&para;<br>once matters proceeded on this course, there was a serious&para;<br>risk that expert evidence could destroy Richter’s case.&para;<br>Even apart from this danger, there was the possibility&para;<br>that expert testimony could shift attention to esoteric&para;<br>matters of forensic science, distract the jury from whether&para;<br>Johnson was telling the truth, or transform the case into a&para;<br>battle of the experts. Accord, Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F. 3d&para;<br>815, 836 (CA9 1995).&para;<br>True, it appears that defense counsel’s opening state&para;<br>ment itself inspired the prosecution to introduce expert&para;<br>forensic evidence. But the prosecution’s evidence may&para;<br>well have been weakened by the fact that it was assem&para;<br>bled late in the process; and in any event the prosecution’s&para;<br>response shows merely that the defense strategy did not&para;<br>work out as well as counsel had hoped, not that counsel&para;<br>was incompetent.&para;<br>To support a defense argument that the prosecution has&para;<br>not proved its case it sometimes is better to try to cast&para;<br>pervasive suspicion of doubt than to strive to prove a&para;<br>certainty that exonerates. All that happened here is that&para;<br>counsel pursued a course that conformed to the first op&para;<br>tion. If this case presented a de novo review of Strickland,&para;<br>the foregoing might well suffice to reject the claim of&para;<br>inadequate counsel, but that is an unnecessary step. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals must be reversed if there was a reason&para;<br>able justification for the state court’s decision. In light of&para;<br>the record here there was no basis to rule that the state&para;<br>court’s determination was unreasonable.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing strategic&para;<br>considerations like these as an inaccurate account of&para;<br>counsel’s actual thinking. Although courts may not in&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dulge “post hoc rationalization” for counsel’s decisionmak&para;<br>ing that contradicts the available evidence of counsel’s&para;<br>actions, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 526–527, neither may they&para;<br>insist counsel confirm every aspect of the strategic basis&para;<br>for his or her actions. There is a “strong presumption”&para;<br>that counsel’s attention to certain issues to the exclusion&para;<br>of others reflects trial tactics rather than “sheer neglect.”&para;<br>Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 8 (2003) (per curiam).&para;<br>After an adverse verdict at trial even the most experienced&para;<br>counsel may find it difficult to resist asking whether a&para;<br>different strategy might have been better, and, in the&para;<br>course of that reflection, to magnify their own responsibil&para;<br>ity for an unfavorable outcome. Strickland, however, calls&para;<br>for an inquiry into the objective reasonableness of coun&para;<br>sel’s performance, not counsel’s subjective state of mind.&para;<br>466 U. S., at 688.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also found that Richter’s attorney&para;<br>was constitutionally deficient because he had not expected&para;<br>the prosecution to offer expert testimony and therefore&para;<br>was unable to offer expert testimony of his own in re&para;<br>sponse.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals erred in suggesting counsel had&para;<br>to be prepared for “any contingency,” 578 F. 3d, at 946&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Strickland does&para;<br>not guarantee perfect representation, only a “ ‘reasonably&para;<br>competent attorney.’ ” 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann&para;<br>v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 770 (1970)); see also Gentry,&para;<br>supra, at 7. Representation is constitutionally ineffective&para;<br>only if it “so undermined the proper functioning of the&para;<br>adversarial process” that the defendant was denied a fair&para;<br>trial. Strickland, supra, at 686. Just as there is no expec&para;<br>tation that competent counsel will be a flawless strategist&para;<br>or tactician, an attorney may not be faulted for a reason&para;<br>able miscalculation or lack of foresight or for failing to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>prepare for what appear to be remote possibilities.&para;<br>Here, Richter’s attorney was mistaken in thinking the&para;<br>prosecution would not present forensic testimony. But the&para;<br>prosecution itself did not expect to make that presentation and had made no preparations for doing so on the eve&para;<br>of trial. For this reason alone, it is at least debatable&para;<br>whether counsel’s error was so fundamental as to call the&para;<br>fairness of the trial into doubt.&para;<br>Even if counsel should have foreseen that the prosecu&para;<br>tion would offer expert evidence, Richter would still need&para;<br>to show it was indisputable that Strickland required his&para;<br>attorney to act upon that knowledge. Attempting to estab&para;<br>lish this, the Court of Appeals held that defense counsel&para;<br>should have offered expert testimony to rebut the evidence&para;<br>from the prosecution. But Strickland does not enact New&para;<br>ton’s third law for the presentation of evidence, requiring&para;<br>for every prosecution expert an equal and opposite expert&para;<br>from the defense.&para;<br>In many instances cross-examination will be sufficient&para;<br>to expose defects in an expert’s presentation. When de&para;<br>fense counsel does not have a solid case, the best strategy&para;<br>can be to say that there is too much doubt about the&para;<br>State’s theory for a jury to convict. And while in some&para;<br>instances “even an isolated error” can support an ineffec&para;<br>tive-assistance claim if it is “sufficiently egregious and&para;<br>prejudicial,” Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496 (1986),&para;<br>it is difficult to establish ineffective assistance when coun&para;<br>sel’s overall performance indicates active and capable&para;<br>advocacy. Here Richter’s attorney represented him with&para;<br>vigor and conducted a skillful cross-examination. As&para;<br>noted, defense counsel elicited concessions from the State’s&para;<br>experts and was able to draw attention to weaknesses in&para;<br>their conclusions stemming from the fact that their analy&para;<br>ses were conducted long after investigators had left the&para;<br>crime scene. For all of these reasons, it would have been&para;<br>reasonable to find that Richter had not shown his attorney&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v. RICHTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was deficient under Strickland.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court of Appeals further concluded that Richter had&para;<br>established prejudice under Strickland given the expert&para;<br>evidence his attorney could have introduced. It held that&para;<br>the California Supreme Court would have been unreason&para;<br>able in concluding otherwise. This too was error.&para;<br>In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is&para;<br>not whether a court can be certain counsel’s performance&para;<br>had no effect on the outcome or whether it is possible a&para;<br>reasonable doubt might have been established if counsel&para;<br>acted differently. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13); Strickland, 466&para;<br>U. S., at 693. Instead, Strickland asks whether it is “rea&para;<br>sonably likely” the result would have been different. Id.,&para;<br>at 696. This does not require a showing that counsel’s&para;<br>actions “more likely than not altered the outcome,” but the&para;<br>difference between Strickland’s prejudice standard and a&para;<br>more-probable-than-not standard is slight and matters&para;<br>“only in the rarest case.” Id., at 693, 697. The likelihood&para;<br>of a different result must be substantial, not just conceiv&para;<br>able. Id., at 693.&para;<br>It would not have been unreasonable for the California&para;<br>Supreme Court to conclude Richter’s evidence of prejudice&para;<br>fell short of this standard. His expert serology evidence&para;<br>established nothing more than a theoretical possibility&para;<br>that, in addition to blood of Johnson’s type, Klein’s blood&para;<br>may also have been present in a blood sample taken near&para;<br>the bedroom doorway pool. At trial, defense counsel ex&para;<br>tracted a concession along these lines from the prosecu&para;<br>tion’s expert. The pathology expert’s claim about the size&para;<br>of the blood pool could be taken to suggest only that the&para;<br>wounded and hysterical Johnson erred in his assessment&para;<br>of time or that he bled more profusely than estimated.&para;<br>And the analysis of the purported blood pattern expert&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>indicated no more than that Johnson was not standing up&para;<br>when the blood pool formed.&para;<br>It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab&para;<br>lished prejudice given that he offered no evidence directly&para;<br>challenging other conclusions reached by the prosecution’s&para;<br>experts. For example, there was no dispute that the blood&para;<br>sample taken near the doorway pool matched Johnson’s&para;<br>blood type. The California Supreme Court reasonably&para;<br>could have concluded that testimony about patterns that&para;<br>form when blood drips to the floor or about the rate at&para;<br>which Johnson was bleeding did not undermine the re&para;<br>sults of chemical tests indicating blood type. Nor did&para;<br>Richter provide any direct refutation of the State’s expert&para;<br>testimony describing how blood spatter near the couch&para;<br>suggested a shooting in the living room and how the blood&para;<br>patterns on Klein’s face were inconsistent with Richter’s&para;<br>theory that Klein had been killed in the bedroom doorway&para;<br>and moved to the couch.&para;<br>There was, furthermore, sufficient conventional circum&para;<br>stantial evidence pointing to Richter’s guilt. It included&para;<br>the gun safe and ammunition found at his home; his flight&para;<br>from the crime scene; his disposal of the .32-caliber gun&para;<br>and of Johnson’s pistol; his shifting story concerning his&para;<br>involvement; the disappearance prior to the arrival of the&para;<br>law enforcement officers of the .22-caliber weapon that&para;<br>killed Klein; the improbability of Branscombe’s not being&para;<br>wounded in the shootout that resulted in a combined four&para;<br>bullet wounds to Johnson and Klein; and the difficulties&para;<br>the intoxicated and twice-shot Johnson would have had in&para;<br>carrying the body of a dying man from bedroom doorway&para;<br>to living room couch, not to mention the lack of any obvi&para;<br>ous reason for him to do so. There was ample basis for the&para;<br>California Supreme Court to think any real possibility of&para;<br>Richter’s being acquitted was eclipsed by the remaining&para;<br>evidence pointing to guilt.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>HARRINGTON v.
