UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–9540. Argued January 7, 2013—Decided June 20, 2013&para;<br>The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) increases the sentences of certain federal defendants who have three prior convictions “for a violent felony,” including “burglary, arson, or extortion.” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(e). To determine whether a past conviction is for one of those&para;<br>crimes, courts use a “categorical approach”: They compare the statutory elements of a prior conviction with the elements of the “generic”&para;<br>crime―i.e., the offense as commonly understood. If the statute’s elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense,&para;<br>the prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. When a prior&para;<br>conviction is for violating a “divisible statute”—one that sets out one&para;<br>or more of the elements in the alternative, e.g., burglary involving entry into a building or an automobile—a “modified categorical approach” is used. That approach permits sentencing courts to consult&para;<br>a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative element formed the basis of the&para;<br>defendant’s prior conviction.&para;<br>Petitioner Descamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of&para;<br>a firearm. The Government sought an ACCA sentence enhancement,&para;<br>pointing to Descamps’ three prior convictions, including one for burglary under California Penal Code Ann. §459, which provides that a&para;<br>“person who enters” certain locations “with intent to commit grand or&para;<br>petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.” In imposing an enhanced sentence, the District Court rejected Descamps’ argument&para;<br>that his §459 conviction cannot serve as an ACCA predicate because&para;<br>§459 goes beyond the “generic” definition of burglary. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that its decision in United States v. AguilaMontes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915, permits the application of the modified&para;<br>categorical approach to a prior conviction under a statute that is&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“categorically broader than the generic offense.” It found that&para;<br>Descamps’ §459 conviction, as revealed in the plea colloquy, rested on&para;<br>facts satisfying the elements of generic burglary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes like&para;<br>§459 that contain a single, indivisible set of elements. Pp. 5−23.&para;<br>(a) This Court’s caselaw all but resolves this case. In Taylor v.&para;<br>United States, 495 U. S. 575, and Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S.&para;<br>13, the Court approved the use of a modified categorical approach in&para;<br>a “narrow range of cases” in which a divisible statute, listing potential offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which element played a part in the defendant’s conviction. Because a sentencing court cannot tell, simply by looking at a divisible statute, which&para;<br>version of the offense a defendant was convicted of, the court is permitted to consult extra-statutory documents—but only to assess&para;<br>whether the defendant was convicted of the particular “statutory definition” that corresponds to the generic offense. Nijhawan v. Holder,&para;<br>557 U. S. 29, and Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, also emphasized this elements-based rationale for the modified categorical&para;<br>approach. That approach plays no role here, where the dispute does&para;<br>not concern alternative elements but a simple discrepancy between&para;<br>generic burglary and §459. Pp. 5−10.&para;<br>(b) The Ninth Circuit’s Aguila-Montes approach turns an elementsbased inquiry into an evidence-based one, asking not whether “statutory definitions” necessarily require an adjudicator to find the generic&para;<br>offense, but whether the prosecutor’s case realistically led the adjudicator to find certain facts. Aguila-Montes has no roots in this Court’s&para;<br>precedents. In fact, it subverts those decisions, conflicting with each&para;<br>of the rationales supporting the categorical approach and threatening&para;<br>to undo all its benefits. Pp. 10–19.&para;<br>(1) Taylor’s elements-centric categorical approach comports with&para;<br>ACCA’s text and history, avoids Sixth Amendment concerns that&para;<br>would arise from sentencing courts’ making factual findings that&para;<br>properly belong to juries, and averts “the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach.” 495 U. S., at 601.&para;<br>ACCA’s language shows that Congress intended sentencing courts&para;<br>“to look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of&para;<br>crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.” Id., at 600. The Ninth Circuit’s approach&para;<br>runs headlong into that congressional choice. Instead of reviewing&para;<br>extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative element was the basis for the conviction, the Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the defendant actually did.&para;<br>Under ACCA, the sentencing court’s finding of a predicate offense&para;<br>indisputably increases the maximum penalty. Accordingly, that find-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ing would (at least) raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns if it&para;<br>went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction. That is why&para;<br>Shepard refused to permit sentencing courts to make a disputed determination about what facts must have supported a defendant’s&para;<br>conviction. 544 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion). Yet the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>flouts this Court’s reasoning by authorizing judicial factfinding that&para;<br>goes far beyond the recognition of a prior conviction.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit’s decision also creates the same “daunting” difficulties and inequities that first encouraged the adoption of the categorical approach. Sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would&para;<br>have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant admitted, or a prosecutor showed, facts that,&para;<br>although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfied an element&para;<br>of the relevant generic offense. And the Aguila-Montes approach&para;<br>would also deprive many defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea deals. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(2) In defending Aguila-Montes, the Ninth Circuit denied any&para;<br>real distinction between divisible and indivisible statutes extending&para;<br>further than the generic offense. But the Circuit’s efforts to imaginatively reconceive all indivisible statutes as divisible ones are unavailing. Only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude&para;<br>that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of&para;<br>every element of the generic crime. Pp. 16−19.&para;<br>(c) The Government offers a slightly different argument: It contends that the modified categorical approach should apply where, as&para;<br>here, the mismatch of elements between the crime of conviction and&para;<br>the generic offense results not from a missing element but from an&para;<br>element’s overbreadth. But that distinction is malleable and manipulable. And in any event, it is a distinction without a difference.&para;<br>Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing element, the problem is the same: Because of the mismatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the&para;<br>generic crime. Pp. 19−22.&para;<br>(d) Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alternative element of, §459, a conviction under that statute is never for&para;<br>generic burglary. Descamps’ ACCA enhancement was therefore improper. Pp. 22–23.&para;<br>466 Fed. Appx. 563, reversed.&para;<br>KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

S. C. §924(e), increases the sentences of certain federal&para;<br>defendants who have three prior convictions “for a violent&para;<br>felony,” including “burglary, arson, or extortion.” To determine whether a past conviction is for one of those&para;<br>crimes, courts use what has become known as the “categorical approach”: They compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant’s conviction with&para;<br>the elements of the “generic” crime—i.e., the offense as&para;<br>commonly understood. The prior conviction qualifies as&para;<br>an ACCA predicate only if the statute’s elements are the&para;<br>same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.&para;<br>We have previously approved a variant of this method—&para;<br>labeled (not very inventively) the “modified categorical&para;<br>approach”—when a prior conviction is for violating a socalled “divisible statute.” That kind of statute sets out one&para;<br>or more elements of the offense in the alternative—for&para;<br>example, stating that burglary involves entry into a building or an automobile. If one alternative (say, a building)&para;<br>matches an element in the generic offense, but the other&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(say, an automobile) does not, the modified categorical&para;<br>approach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited&para;<br>class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of&para;<br>the defendant’s prior conviction. The court can then do&para;<br>what the categorical approach demands: compare the&para;<br>elements of the crime of conviction (including the alternative element used in the case) with the elements of the&para;<br>generic crime.&para;<br>This case presents the question whether sentencing&para;<br>courts may also consult those additional documents when&para;<br>a defendant was convicted under an “indivisible” statute—&para;<br>i.e., one not containing alternative elements—that criminalizes a broader swath of conduct than the relevant&para;<br>generic offense. That would enable a court to decide,&para;<br>based on information about a case’s underlying facts, that&para;<br>the defendant’s prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA&para;<br>predicate even though the elements of the crime fail to&para;<br>satisfy our categorical test. Because that result would&para;<br>contravene our prior decisions and the principles underlying them, we hold that sentencing courts may not apply&para;<br>the modified categorical approach when the crime of which&para;<br>the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of&para;<br>elements.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Matthew Descamps was convicted of being a&para;<br>felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§922(g). That unadorned offense carries a maximum&para;<br>penalty of 10 years in prison. The Government, however,&para;<br>sought an enhanced sentence under ACCA, based on&para;<br>Descamps’ prior state convictions for burglary, robbery,&para;<br>and felony harassment.&para;<br>ACCA prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15&para;<br>years for a person who violates §922(g) and “has three&para;<br>previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>drug offense.” §924(e)(1). The Act defines a “violent felony”&para;<br>to mean any felony, whether state or federal, that “has&para;<br>as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of&para;<br>physical force against the person of another,” or that “is&para;<br>burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or&para;<br>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B).&para;<br>Descamps argued that his prior burglary conviction&para;<br>could not count as an ACCA predicate offense under our&para;<br>categorical approach. He had pleaded guilty to violating&para;<br>California Penal Code Ann. §459 (West 2010), which provides that a “person who enters” certain locations “with&para;<br>intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is&para;<br>guilty of burglary.” That statute does not require the&para;<br>entry to have been unlawful in the way most burglary&para;<br>laws do. Whereas burglary statutes generally demand&para;<br>breaking and entering or similar conduct, California’s does&para;<br>not: It covers, for example, a shoplifter who enters a store,&para;<br>like any customer, during normal business hours. See&para;<br>People v. Barry, 94 Cal. 481, 483–484, 29 P. 1026, 1026–&para;<br>1027 (1892). In sweeping so widely, the state law goes&para;<br>beyond the normal, “generic” definition of burglary. According to Descamps, that asymmetry of offense elements&para;<br>precluded his conviction under §459 from serving as an&para;<br>ACCA predicate, whether or not his own burglary involved&para;<br>an unlawful entry that could have satisfied the requirements of the generic crime.&para;<br>The District Court disagreed. According to the court,&para;<br>our modified categorical approach permitted it to examine&para;<br>certain documents, including the record of the plea colloquy, to discover whether Descamps had “admitted the&para;<br>elements of a generic burglary” when entering his plea.&para;<br>App. 50a. And that transcript, the court ruled, showed&para;<br>that Descamps had done so. At the plea hearing, the&para;<br>prosecutor proffered that the crime “ ‘ involve[d] the breaking and entering of a grocery store,’ ” and Descamps failed&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to object to that statement. Ibid. The plea proceedings, the District Court thought, thus established that&para;<br>Descamps’ prior conviction qualified as a generic burglary&para;<br>(and so as a “violent felony”) under ACCA. Applying the&para;<br>requisite penalty enhancement, the court sentenced&para;<br>Descamps to 262 months in prison—more than twice the&para;<br>term he would otherwise have received.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed,&para;<br>relying on its recently issued decision in United States v.&para;<br>Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915 (2011) (en banc) (per&para;<br>curiam). There, a divided en banc court took much the&para;<br>same view of the modified categorical approach as had&para;<br>the District Court in this case. The en banc court held&para;<br>that when a sentencing court considers a conviction under&para;<br>§459—or any other statute that is “categorically broader&para;<br>than the generic offense”—the court may scrutinize certain documents to determine the factual basis of the conviction. See id., at 940. Applying that approach, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals here found that Descamps’ plea, as revealed in the colloquy, “rested on facts that satisfy the&para;<br>elements of the generic definition of burglary.” 466 Fed.&para;<br>Appx. 563, 565 (2012).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a&para;<br>Circuit split on whether the modified categorical approach&para;<br>applies to statutes like §459 that contain a single, “indivisible” set of elements sweeping more broadly than the&para;<br>corresponding generic offense.1 We hold that it does not,&para;<br>and so reverse.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Compare, e.g., 466 Fed. Appx. 563, 565 (CA9 2012) (case below)&para;<br>(applying the modified categorical approach to §459); United States v.&para;<br>Armstead, 467 F. 3d 943, 947–950 (CA6 2006) (applying that approach&para;<br>to a similar, indivisible statute), with, e.g., United States v. Beardsley,&para;<br>691 F. 3d 252, 268–274 (CA2 2012) (holding that the modified categorical approach applies only to divisible statutes); United States v. Giggey,&para;<br>551 F. 3d 27, 40 (CA1 2008) (en banc) (same).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>Our caselaw explaining the categorical approach and its&para;<br>“modified” counterpart all but resolves this case. In those&para;<br>decisions, as shown below, the modified approach serves a&para;<br>limited function: It helps effectuate the categorical analysis when a divisible statute, listing potential offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which element&para;<br>played a part in the defendant’s conviction. So understood, the modified approach cannot convert Descamps’&para;<br>conviction under §459 into an ACCA predicate, because&para;<br>that state law defines burglary not alternatively, but only&para;<br>more broadly than the generic offense.&para;<br>We begin with Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575&para;<br>(1990), which established the rule for determining when&para;<br>a defendant’s prior conviction counts as one of ACCA’s&para;<br>enumerated predicate offenses (e.g., burglary). Taylor&para;<br>adopted a “formal categorical approach”: Sentencing&para;<br>courts may “look only to the statutory definitions”—i.e.,&para;<br>the elements—of a defendant’s prior offenses, and not “to&para;<br>the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Id., at&para;<br>600. If the relevant statute has the same elements as the&para;<br>“generic” ACCA crime, then the prior conviction can serve&para;<br>as an ACCA predicate; so too if the statute defines the&para;<br>crime more narrowly, because anyone convicted under&para;<br>that law is “necessarily . . . guilty of all the [generic&para;<br>crime’s] elements.” Id., at 599. But if the statute sweeps&para;<br>more broadly than the generic crime, a conviction under&para;<br>that law cannot count as an ACCA predicate, even if the&para;<br>defendant actually committed the offense in its generic&para;<br>form. The key, we emphasized, is elements, not facts. So,&para;<br>for example, we held that a defendant can receive an&para;<br>ACCA enhancement for burglary only if he was convicted&para;<br>of a crime having “the basic elements” of generic burglary—&para;<br>i.e., “unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining&para;<br>in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.”&para;<br>Ibid. And indeed, we indicated that the very statute at&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issue here, §459, does not fit that bill because “California&para;<br>defines ‘burglary’ so broadly as to include shoplifting.” Id.,&para;<br>at 591.&para;<br>At the same time, Taylor recognized a “narrow range of&para;<br>cases” in which sentencing courts—applying what we&para;<br>would later dub the “modified categorical approach”—may&para;<br>look beyond the statutory elements to “the charging paper&para;<br>and jury instructions” used in a case. Id., at 602. To&para;<br>explain when courts should resort to that approach, we&para;<br>hypothesized a statute with alternative elements—more&para;<br>particularly, a burglary statute (otherwise conforming to&para;<br>the generic crime) that prohibits “entry of an automobile&para;<br>as well as a building.” Ibid. One of those alternatives (a&para;<br>building) corresponds to an element in generic burglary,&para;<br>whereas the other (an automobile) does not. In a typical&para;<br>case brought under the statute, the prosecutor charges one&para;<br>of those two alternatives, and the judge instructs the jury&para;<br>accordingly. So if the case involves entry into a building,&para;<br>the jury is “actually required to find all the elements of&para;<br>generic burglary,” as the categorical approach demands.&para;<br>Ibid. But the statute alone does not disclose whether&para;<br>that has occurred. Because the statute is “divisible”—i.e.,&para;<br>comprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime—a&para;<br>later sentencing court cannot tell, without reviewing&para;<br>something more, if the defendant’s conviction was for the&para;<br>generic (building) or non-generic (automobile) form of&para;<br>burglary. Hence Taylor permitted sentencing courts, as a&para;<br>tool for implementing the categorical approach, to examine&para;<br>a limited class of documents to determine which of a statute’s alternative elements formed the basis of the defendant’s prior conviction.&para;<br>In Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005), the&para;<br>hypothetical we posited in Taylor became real: We confronted a Massachusetts burglary statute covering entries&para;<br>into “boats and cars” as well as buildings. 544 U. S., at 17.&para;<br>The defendant there pleaded guilty to violating the stat-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ute, and we first confirmed that Taylor’s categorical approach applies not just to jury verdicts, but also to plea&para;<br>agreements. That meant, we held, that a conviction based&para;<br>on a guilty plea can qualify as an ACCA predicate only if&para;<br>the defendant “necessarily admitted [the] elements of the&para;<br>generic offense.” Id., at 26. But as we had anticipated in&para;<br>Taylor, the divisible nature of the Massachusetts burglary&para;<br>statute confounded that inquiry: No one could know, just&para;<br>from looking at the statute, which version of the offense&para;<br>Shepard was convicted of. Accordingly, we again authorized sentencing courts to scrutinize a restricted set of&para;<br>materials—here, “the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant”—to determine if the defendant had pleaded guilty to entering a&para;<br>building or, alternatively, a car or boat. Ibid. Yet we&para;<br>again underscored the narrow scope of that review: It was&para;<br>not to determine “what the defendant and state judge&para;<br>must have understood as the factual basis of the prior&para;<br>plea,” but only to assess whether the plea was to the version of the crime in the Massachusetts statute (burglary of&para;<br>a building) corresponding to the generic offense. Id., at&para;<br>25–26 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Two more recent decisions have further emphasized&para;<br>the elements-based rationale—applicable only to divisible&para;<br>statutes—for examining documents like an indictment or&para;<br>plea agreement. In Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29&para;<br>(2009), we discussed another Massachusetts statute, this&para;<br>one prohibiting “ ‘Breaking and Entering at Night’ ” in any&para;<br>of four alternative places: a “building, ship, vessel, or&para;<br>vehicle.” Id., at 35. We recognized that when a statute so&para;<br>“refer[s] to several different crimes,” not all of which qualify&para;<br>as an ACCA predicate, a court must determine which&para;<br>crime formed the basis of the defendant’s conviction. Ibid.&para;<br>That is why, we explained, Taylor and Shepard developed&para;<br>the modified categorical approach. By reviewing the&para;<br>extra-statutory materials approved in those cases, courts&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>could discover “which statutory phrase,” contained within&para;<br>a statute listing “several different” crimes, “covered a prior&para;<br>conviction.” 557 U. S., at 41. And a year later, we repeated&para;<br>that understanding of when and why courts can resort&para;<br>to those documents: “[T]he ‘modified categorical approach’&para;<br>that we have approved permits a court to determine which&para;<br>statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction.” Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 144 (2010) (citation&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Applied in that way—which is the only way we have&para;<br>ever allowed—the modified approach merely helps implement the categorical approach when a defendant was&para;<br>convicted of violating a divisible statute. The modified&para;<br>approach thus acts not as an exception, but instead as a&para;<br>tool. It retains the categorical approach’s central feature:&para;<br>a focus on the elements, rather than the facts, of a crime.&para;<br>And it preserves the categorical approach’s basic method:&para;<br>comparing those elements with the generic offense’s. All&para;<br>the modified approach adds is a mechanism for making&para;<br>that comparison when a statute lists multiple, alternative&para;<br>elements, and so effectively creates “several different . . .&para;<br>crimes.” Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 41. If at least one, but&para;<br>not all of those crimes matches the generic version, a court&para;<br>needs a way to find out which the defendant was convicted&para;<br>of. That is the job, as we have always understood it, of the&para;<br>modified approach: to identify, from among several alternatives, the crime of conviction so that the court can compare it to the generic offense.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent delves into the nuances of various States’ laws in an&para;<br>effort to cast doubt on this understanding of our prior holdings, arguing&para;<br>that we used the modified categorical approach in cases like Taylor,&para;<br>Shepard, and Johnson “in relation to statutes that may not have been&para;<br>divisible” in the way that we have just described. Post, at 5 (ALITO, J.).&para;<br>But if, as the dissent claims, the state laws at issue in those cases set&para;<br>out “merely alternative means, not alternative elements” of an offense,&para;<br>post, at 7, that is news to us. And more important, it would have been&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The modified approach thus has no role to play in this&para;<br>case. The dispute here does not concern any list of alternative elements. Rather, it involves a simple discrepancy&para;<br>between generic burglary and the crime established in&para;<br>§459. The former requires an unlawful entry along the&para;<br>lines of breaking and entering. See 3 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §21.1(a) (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter&para;<br>LaFave). The latter does not, and indeed covers simple&para;<br>shoplifting, as even the Government acknowledges. See&para;<br>Brief for United States 38; Barry, 94 Cal., at 483–484, 29&para;<br>P., at 1026–1027. In Taylor’s words, then, §459 “define[s]&para;<br>burglary more broadly” than the generic offense. 495&para;<br>U. S., at 599. And because that is true—because California, to get a conviction, need not prove that Descamps&para;<br>broke and entered—a §459 violation cannot serve as an&para;<br>ACCA predicate. Whether Descamps did break and enter&para;<br>makes no difference. And likewise, whether he ever admitted to breaking and entering is irrelevant. Our decisions authorize review of the plea colloquy or other&para;<br>approved extra-statutory documents only when a statute&para;<br>defines burglary not (as here) overbroadly, but instead&para;<br>alternatively, with one statutory phrase corresponding to&para;<br>the generic crime and another not. In that circumstance,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>news to the Taylor, Shepard, and Johnson Courts: All those decisions&para;<br>rested on the explicit premise that the laws “contain[ed] statutory&para;<br>phrases that cover several different . . . crimes,” not several different&para;<br>methods of committing one offense. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 144 (citing&para;<br>Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 41). And if the dissent’s real point is that&para;<br>distinguishing between “alternative elements” and “alternative means”&para;<br>is difficult, we can see no real-world reason to worry. Whatever a&para;<br>statute lists (whether elements or means), the documents we approved&para;<br>in Taylor and Shepard—i.e., indictment, jury instructions, plea colloquy, and plea agreement—would reflect the crime’s elements. So a&para;<br>court need not parse state law in the way the dissent suggests: When a&para;<br>state law is drafted in the alternative, the court merely resorts to the&para;<br>approved documents and compares the elements revealed there to those&para;<br>of the generic offense.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a court may look to the additional documents to determine&para;<br>which of the statutory offenses (generic or non-generic)&para;<br>formed the basis of the defendant’s conviction. But here&para;<br>no uncertainty of that kind exists, and so the categorical&para;<br>approach needs no help from its modified partner. We&para;<br>know Descamps’ crime of conviction, and it does not correspond to the relevant generic offense. Under our prior&para;<br>decisions, the inquiry is over.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court of Appeals took a different view. Dismissing&para;<br>everything we have said on the subject as “lack[ing] conclusive weight,” the Ninth Circuit held in Aguila-Montes&para;<br>that the modified categorical approach could turn a conviction under any statute into an ACCA predicate offense.&para;<br>655 F. 3d, at 931. The statute, like §459, could contain a&para;<br>single, indivisible set of elements covering far more conduct than the generic crime—and still, a sentencing court&para;<br>could “conside[r] to some degree the factual basis for the&para;<br>defendant’s conviction” or, otherwise stated, “the particular acts the defendant committed.” Id., at 935–936. More&para;<br>specifically, the court could look to reliable materials (the&para;<br>charging document, jury instructions, plea colloquy, and so&para;<br>forth) to determine “what facts” can “confident[ly]” be&para;<br>thought to underlie the defendant’s conviction in light of&para;<br>the “prosecutorial theory of the case” and the “facts put&para;<br>forward by the government.” Id., at 936–937. It makes no&para;<br>difference, in the Ninth Circuit’s view, whether “specific&para;<br>words in the statute” of conviction “ ‘ actually required’ ”&para;<br>the jury (or judge accepting a plea) “to find a particular&para;<br>generic element.” Id., at 936 (quoting Taylor, 495 U. S., at&para;<br>602; internal quotation marks omitted).3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent, as we understand it, takes the same view as the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit; accordingly, each of the reasons—statutory, constitutional, and&para;<br>practical—that leads us to reject Aguila-Montes proves fatal to the&para;<br>dissent’s position as well. The dissent several times obscures its call to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

It asks not whether “statutory&para;<br>definitions” necessarily require an adjudicator to find the&para;<br>generic offense, but instead whether the prosecutor’s case&para;<br>realistically led the adjudicator to make that determination. And it makes examination of extra-statutory documents not a tool used in a “narrow range of cases” to&para;<br>identify the relevant element from a statute with multiple&para;<br>alternatives, but rather a device employed in every case to&para;<br>evaluate the facts that the judge or jury found. By this&para;<br>point, it should be clear that the Ninth Circuit’s new way of&para;<br>identifying ACCA predicates has no roots in our precedents.&para;<br>But more: Aguila-Montes subverts those decisions, conflict——————&para;<br>explore facts with language from our categorical cases, asking whether&para;<br>“the relevant portions of the state record clearly show that the jury&para;<br>necessarily found, or the defendant necessarily admitted, the elements&para;<br>of [the] generic [offense].” Post, at 14; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 24 (plurality opinion) (reiterating Taylor’s “demanding requirement that . . . a&para;<br>prior conviction ‘necessarily’ involve[]” a jury finding on each element&para;<br>of the generic offense) (emphasis added). But the dissent nowhere&para;<br>explains how a factfinder can have “necessarily found” a non-element—&para;<br>that is, a fact that by definition is not necessary to support a conviction.&para;<br>The dissent’s fundamental view is that a sentencing court should be&para;<br>able to make reasonable “inference[s]” about what the factfinder really&para;<br>(even though not necessarily) found. See post, at 15. That position&para;<br>accords with our dissenting colleague’s previously expressed skepticism&para;<br>about the categorical approach. See Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (“I would hold that the&para;<br>categorical approach is not controlling where the state conviction at&para;<br>issue was based on a state statute that encompasses both a substantial&para;<br>number of cases that qualify under the federal standard and a substantial number that do not. In such situations, it is appropriate to look&para;<br>beyond the elements of the state offense and to rely as well on facts&para;<br>that were admitted in state court or that, taking a realistic view, were&para;<br>clearly proved”). But there are several decades of water over that dam,&para;<br>and the dissent offers no newly persuasive reasons for revisiting our&para;<br>precedents.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing with each of the rationales supporting the categorical&para;<br>approach and threatening to undo all its benefits.&para;<br>A&para;<br>This Court offered three grounds for establishing our&para;<br>elements-centric, “formal categorical approach.” Taylor,&para;<br>495 U. S., at 600. First, it comports with ACCA’s text and&para;<br>history. Second, it avoids the Sixth Amendment concerns&para;<br>that would arise from sentencing courts’ making findings&para;<br>of fact that properly belong to juries. And third, it averts&para;<br>“the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a&para;<br>factual approach.” Id., at 601. When assessed in light of&para;<br>those three reasons, the Ninth Circuit’s ruling strikes out&para;<br>swinging.&para;<br>Start with the statutory text and history. As we have&para;<br>long recognized, ACCA increases the sentence of a defendant who has three “previous convictions” for a violent&para;<br>felony—not a defendant who has thrice committed such a&para;<br>crime. 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(1); see Taylor, 495 U. S., at 600.&para;<br>That language shows, as Taylor explained, that “Congress&para;<br>intended the sentencing court to look only to the fact that&para;<br>the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within&para;<br>certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the&para;<br>prior convictions.” Ibid.; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 19. If&para;<br>Congress had wanted to increase a sentence based on the&para;<br>facts of a prior offense, it presumably would have said so;&para;<br>other statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.&para;<br>See Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 36 (construing an immigration&para;<br>statute as requiring a “ ‘circumstance-specific,’ not a ‘categorical,’ ” approach). But in ACCA, Taylor found, Congress&para;<br>made a deliberate decision to treat every conviction of a&para;<br>crime in the same manner: During the lengthy debate&para;<br>preceding the statute’s enactment, “no one suggested that&para;<br>a particular crime might sometimes count towards enhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of&para;<br>the case.” 495 U. S., at 601. Congress instead meant&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ACCA to function as an on-off switch, directing that a&para;<br>prior crime would qualify as a predicate offense in all&para;<br>cases or in none.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit’s approach runs headlong into that&para;<br>congressional choice. Instead of reviewing documents like&para;<br>an indictment or plea colloquy only to determine “which&para;<br>statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,” the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the&para;<br>defendant actually did. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 144. This&para;<br>case demonstrates the point. Descamps was not convicted&para;<br>of generic burglary, because (as the Government agrees)&para;<br>§459 does not contain that crime’s required unlawful-entry&para;<br>element. See Brief for United States 38, 43–44. At most,&para;<br>the colloquy showed that Descamps committed generic&para;<br>burglary, and so hypothetically could have been convicted&para;<br>under a law criminalizing that conduct. But that is just&para;<br>what we said, in Taylor and elsewhere, is not enough. See&para;<br>495 U. S., at 600; Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11) (rejecting such a “ ‘ hypothetical approach’ ” given a similar statute’s directive to “look&para;<br>to the conviction itself,” rather than “to what might have&para;<br>or could have been charged”). And the necessary result of&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit’s method is exactly the differential&para;<br>treatment we thought Congress, in enacting ACCA, took&para;<br>care to prevent. In the two years since Aguila-Montes, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit has treated some, but not other, convictions&para;<br>under §459 as ACCA predicates, based on minor variations in the cases’ plea documents. Compare, e.g., 466&para;<br>Fed. Appx., at 565 (Descamps’ §459 conviction counts as&para;<br>generic burglary), with 655 F. 3d, at 946 (Aguila-Montes’&para;<br>does not).&para;<br>Similarly, consider (though Aguila-Montes did not) the&para;<br>categorical approach’s Sixth Amendment underpinnings.&para;<br>We have held that “[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond&para;<br>the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Apprendi v.&para;<br>New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Under ACCA, the&para;<br>court’s finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases&para;<br>the maximum penalty. Accordingly, that finding would&para;<br>(at the least) raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns if it&para;<br>went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction. Those&para;<br>concerns, we recognized in Shepard, counsel against allowing a sentencing court to “make a disputed” determination&para;<br>“about what the defendant and state judge must have&para;<br>understood as the factual basis of the prior plea,” or what&para;<br>the jury in a prior trial must have accepted as the theory&para;<br>of the crime. 544 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion); see id., at&para;<br>28 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (stating that such a finding would “giv[e] rise to&para;<br>constitutional error, not doubt”). Hence our insistence on&para;<br>the categorical approach.&para;<br>Yet again, the Ninth Circuit’s ruling flouts our reasoning—&para;<br>here, by extending judicial factfinding beyond the recognition of a prior conviction. Our modified categorical&para;<br>approach merely assists the sentencing court in identifying the defendant’s crime of conviction, as we have held&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment permits. But the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>reworking authorizes the court to try to discern what a&para;<br>trial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the&para;<br>defendant’s underlying conduct. See Aguila-Montes, 655&para;<br>F. 3d, at 937. And there’s the constitutional rub. The&para;<br>Sixth Amendment contemplates that a jury—not a sentencing court—will find such facts, unanimously and&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt. And the only facts the court&para;<br>can be sure the jury so found are those constituting elements of the offense—as distinct from amplifying but&para;<br>legally extraneous circumstances. See, e.g., Richardson v.&para;<br>United States, 526 U. S. 813, 817 (1999). Similarly, as&para;<br>Shepard indicated, when a defendant pleads guilty to a&para;<br>crime, he waives his right to a jury determination of only&para;<br>that offense’s elements; whatever he says, or fails to say,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>about superfluous facts cannot license a later sentencing&para;<br>court to impose extra punishment. See 544 U. S., at 24–26&para;<br>(plurality opinion). So when the District Court here enhanced Descamps’ sentence, based on his supposed acquiescence to a prosecutorial statement (that he “broke and&para;<br>entered”) irrelevant to the crime charged, the court did&para;<br>just what we have said it cannot: rely on its own finding&para;<br>about a non-elemental fact to increase a defendant’s maximum sentence.&para;<br>Finally, the Ninth Circuit’s decision creates the same&para;<br>“daunting” difficulties and inequities that first encouraged&para;<br>us to adopt the categorical approach. Taylor, 495 U. S., at&para;<br>601–602. In case after case, sentencing courts following&para;<br>Aguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining&para;<br>(often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant&para;<br>admitted in a plea colloquy, or a prosecutor showed at&para;<br>trial, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of&para;<br>conviction, satisfy an element of the relevant generic&para;<br>offense. The meaning of those documents will often be&para;<br>uncertain. And the statements of fact in them may be&para;<br>downright wrong. A defendant, after all, often has little&para;<br>incentive to contest facts that are not elements of the&para;<br>charged offense—and may have good reason not to. At&para;<br>trial, extraneous facts and arguments may confuse the&para;<br>jury. (Indeed, the court may prohibit them for that reason.) And during plea hearings, the defendant may not&para;<br>wish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling about&para;<br>superfluous factual allegations. In this case, for example,&para;<br>Descamps may have let the prosecutor’s statement go by&para;<br>because it was irrelevant to the proceedings. He likely&para;<br>was not thinking about the possibility that his silence&para;<br>could come back to haunt him in an ACCA sentencing 30&para;<br>years in the future. (Actually, he could not have been&para;<br>thinking that thought: ACCA was not even on the books at&para;<br>the time of Descamps’ burglary conviction.)&para;<br>Still worse, the Aguila-Montes approach will deprive&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>some defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea&para;<br>deals. Assume (as happens every day) that a defendant&para;<br>surrenders his right to trial in exchange for the government’s agreement that he plead guilty to a less serious&para;<br>crime, whose elements do not match an ACCA offense.&para;<br>Under the Ninth Circuit’s view, a later sentencing court&para;<br>could still treat the defendant as though he had pleaded to&para;<br>an ACCA predicate, based on legally extraneous statements found in the old record. Taylor recognized the&para;<br>problem: “[I]f a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense&para;<br>was the result of a plea bargain,” the Court stated, “it&para;<br>would seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if&para;<br>the defendant had pleaded guilty” to generic burglary.&para;<br>495 U. S., at 601–602. That way of proceeding, on top of&para;<br>everything else, would allow a later sentencing court to&para;<br>rewrite the parties’ bargain.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit defended its (excessively) modified&para;<br>approach by denying any real distinction between divisible&para;<br>and indivisible statutes extending further than the generic&para;<br>offense. “The only conceptual difference,” the court reasoned, “is that [a divisible statute] creates an explicitly&para;<br>finite list of possible means of commission, while [an&para;<br>indivisible one] creates an implied list of every means of&para;<br>commission that otherwise fits the definition of a given&para;<br>crime.” Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927. For example,&para;<br>an indivisible statute “requir[ing] use of a ‘weapon’ is not&para;<br>meaningfully different”—or so says the Ninth Circuit—&para;<br>“from a statute that simply lists every kind of weapon in&para;<br>existence . . . (‘gun, axe, sword, baton, slingshot, knife,&para;<br>machete, bat,’ and so on).” Ibid. In a similar way, every&para;<br>indivisible statute can be imaginatively reconstructed as a&para;<br>divisible one. And if that is true, the Ninth Circuit asks,&para;<br>why limit the modified categorical approach only to explicitly divisible statutes?&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The simple answer is: Because only divisible statutes&para;<br>enable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge&para;<br>at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every&para;<br>element of the generic crime. A prosecutor charging a&para;<br>violation of a divisible statute must generally select the&para;<br>relevant element from its list of alternatives. See, e.g.,&para;<br>The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 104 (1874) (“[A]n&para;<br>indictment or a criminal information which charges the&para;<br>person accused, in the disjunctive, with being guilty of one&para;<br>or of another of several offences, would be destitute of the&para;<br>necessary certainty, and would be wholly insufficient”).4&para;<br>And the jury, as instructions in the case will make clear,&para;<br>must then find that element, unanimously and beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt. So assume, along the lines of the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s example, that a statute criminalizes assault with&para;<br>any of eight specified weapons; and suppose further, as the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit did, that only assault with a gun counts as&para;<br>an ACCA offense. A later sentencing court need only&para;<br>check the charging documents and instructions (“Do they&para;<br>refer to a gun or something else?”) to determine whether&para;<br>in convicting a defendant under that divisible statute, the&para;<br>jury necessarily found that he committed the ACCAqualifying crime.&para;<br>None of that is true of an overbroad, indivisible statute. A sentencing court, to be sure, can hypothetically&para;<br>reconceive such a statute in divisible terms. So, as AguilaMontes reveals, a court blessed with sufficient time and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See also 1 C. Wright &amp; A.

But the thing&para;<br>about hypothetical lists is that they are, well, hypothetical.&para;<br>As long as the statute itself requires only an indeterminate&para;<br>“weapon,” that is all the indictment must (or is likely to)&para;<br>allege and all the jury instructions must (or are likely to)&para;<br>mention.

The jurors need not all&para;<br>agree on whether the defendant used a gun or a knife or a&para;<br>tire iron (or any other particular weapon that might appear in an imagined divisible statute), because the actual&para;<br>statute requires the jury to find only a “weapon.” And&para;<br>even if in many cases, the jury could have readily reached&para;<br>consensus on the weapon used, a later sentencing court&para;<br>cannot supply that missing judgment. Whatever the underlying facts or the evidence presented, the defendant&para;<br>still would not have been convicted, in the deliberate and&para;<br>considered way the Constitution guarantees, of an offense&para;<br>with the same (or narrower) elements as the supposed&para;<br>generic crime (assault with a gun).&para;<br>Indeed, accepting the Ninth Circuit’s contrary reasoning&para;<br>would altogether collapse the distinction between a categorical and a fact-specific approach. After all, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s “weapons” example is just the tip of the iceberg:&para;<br>Courts can go much further in reconceiving indivisible&para;<br>statutes as impliedly divisible ones. In fact, every element&para;<br>of every statute can be imaginatively transformed as the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit suggests—so that every crime is seen as&para;<br>containing an infinite number of sub-crimes corresponding&para;<br>to “all the possible ways an individual can commit” it.&para;<br>Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927. (Think: Professor Plum,&para;<br>in the ballroom, with the candlestick?; Colonel Mustard, in&para;<br>the conservatory, with the rope, on a snowy day, to cover&para;<br>up his affair with Mrs. Peacock?)

At that point, the court is merely&para;<br>asking whether a particular set of facts leading to a conviction conforms to a generic ACCA offense. And that is&para;<br>what we have expressly and repeatedly forbidden. Courts&para;<br>may modify the categorical approach to accommodate&para;<br>alternative “statutory definitions.” Ibid.; cf. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph&para;<br>Co., 512 U. S. 218, 225 (1994) (“ ‘ [T]o modify’ means to&para;<br>change moderately or in minor fashion”). They may not,&para;<br>by pretending that every fact pattern is an “implied”&para;<br>statutory definition, Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927,&para;<br>convert that approach into its opposite.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Government tries to distance itself from the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit by offering a purportedly narrower theory—that&para;<br>although an indivisible statute that is “truly missing” an&para;<br>element of the generic offense cannot give rise to an ACCA&para;<br>conviction, California’s burglary law can do so because it&para;<br>merely “contains a broader version of the [generic] element of unlawfulness of entry.” Brief for United States&para;<br>11–12. The Government’s argument proceeds in three&para;<br>steps. It begins from the premise that sentencing courts&para;<br>applying ACCA should consider not only the statute defining a prior crime but also any judicial interpretations of it.&para;<br>Next, the Government points to a California decision&para;<br>holding (not surprisingly) that a defendant cannot “burglariz[e] his own home”; the case’s reasoning, the Government notes, is that §459 (though not saying so explicitly)&para;<br>requires “an entry which invades a possessory right.”&para;<br>People v. Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d 709, 713–716, 542 P. 2d 1365,&para;<br>1367–1368 (1975). Given that precedent, the Government&para;<br>contends, §459 includes a kind of “unlawful entry” ele-&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, although it is broader than the generic crime’s&para;<br>analogous requirement. Finally, the Government asserts&para;<br>that sentencing courts may use the modified approach “to&para;<br>determine whether a particular defendant’s conviction&para;<br>under” such an overbroad statute actually “was for [the]&para;<br>generic” crime. Brief for United States 11.&para;<br>Although elaborately developed in the Government’s&para;<br>brief, this argument’s first two steps turn out to be sideshows. We may reserve the question whether, in determining a crime’s elements, a sentencing court should take&para;<br>account not only of the relevant statute’s text, but of judicial rulings interpreting it. And we may assume, as the&para;<br>Government insists, that California caselaw treats §459 as&para;<br>including an element of entry “invading a possessory&para;<br>right”—although, truth be told, we find the state decisions&para;<br>on that score contradictory and confusing.5 Even on those&para;<br>assumptions, §459’s elements do not come into line with&para;<br>generic burglary’s. As the Government concedes, almost&para;<br>every entry onto another’s property with intent to steal—&para;<br>including, for example, a shoplifter’s walking into an open&para;<br>store—“invades a possessory right” under §459. See Brief&para;<br>for United States 38; Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d, at 714, 542 P. 2d,&para;<br>at 1367. By contrast, generic burglary’s unlawful-entry&para;<br>element excludes any case in which a person enters premises open to the public, no matter his intent; the generic&para;<br>crime requires breaking and entering or similar unlawful&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Several&para;<br>&para;<br>decisions treat “invasion of a possessory right” as an aspect&para;<br>of §459’s entry element, see, e.g., People v.

Most overbroad statutes can also be characterized as missing an element; and most statutes missing&para;<br>an element can also be labeled overbroad. Here is the only&para;<br>conclusion in Aguila-Montes we agree with: “[I]t is difficult, if not impossible” to determine which is which. 655&para;<br>F. 3d, at 925. The example that court gave was as follows:&para;<br>A statute of conviction punishes possession of pornography, but a federal law carries a sentence enhancement for&para;<br>possession of child pornography. Is the statute of conviction overbroad because it includes both adult and child&para;<br>pornography; or is that law instead missing the element of&para;<br>involvement of minors? The same name game can be&para;<br>played with §459. The Government labors mightily to&para;<br>turn what it fears looks like a missing-element statute&para;<br>into an overbroad statute through the incorporation of&para;<br>judicial decisions. But even putting those decisions aside,&para;<br>the Government might have described §459 as merely&para;<br>having an overbroad element because “entry” includes&para;<br>both the lawful and the unlawful kind. And conversely,&para;<br>Descamps could claim that even as judicially interpreted, §459 is entirely missing generic burglary’s element of breaking and entering or similar unlawful conduct.&para;<br>All is in the eye of the beholder, and prone to endless&para;<br>manipulation.&para;<br>In any event, and more fundamentally, we see no reason&para;<br>why the Government’s distinction should matter. Whether&para;<br>the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing&para;<br>element, the problem is the same: Because of the mismatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute&para;<br>is never convicted of the generic crime. In this case, for&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>example, Descamps was not convicted of generic burglary&para;<br>because §459, whether viewed as missing an element or&para;<br>containing an overbroad one, does not require breaking&para;<br>and entering. So every reason we have given—textual,&para;<br>constitutional, and practical—for rejecting the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s proposed approach applies to the Government’s&para;<br>as well. See supra, at 12–16. At bottom, the Government&para;<br>wants the same thing as the Ninth Circuit (if nominally in&para;<br>a few fewer cases): It too wishes a sentencing court to look&para;<br>beyond the elements to the evidence or, otherwise said, to&para;<br>explore whether a person convicted of one crime could also&para;<br>have been convicted of another, more serious offense. But&para;<br>that circumstance-specific review is just what the categorical approach precludes. And as we have explained, we&para;<br>adopted the modified approach to help implement the&para;<br>categorical inquiry, not to undermine it.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Descamps may (or may not) have broken and entered,&para;<br>and so committed generic burglary. But §459—the crime&para;<br>of which he was convicted—does not require the factfinder&para;<br>(whether jury or judge) to make that determination.&para;<br>Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an&para;<br>alternative element, of §459, a conviction under that&para;<br>statute is never for generic burglary. And that decides&para;<br>this case in Descamps’ favor; the District Court should not&para;<br>have enhanced his sentence under ACCA.6 That court and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The Government here forfeited an alternative argument that §459&para;<br>qualifies as a predicate offense under ACCA’s “residual clause,” which&para;<br>covers statutes “involv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential&para;<br>risk of physical injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We&para;<br>express no view on that argument’s merits. Compare United States v.&para;<br>Mayer, 560 F. 3d 948, 960–963 (CA9 2009) (holding that Oregon’s&para;<br>burglary statute falls within the residual clause, even though it does&para;<br>not include all of generic burglary’s elements), with id., at 951&para;<br>(Kozinski, C.

The District Court, however, applied an Armed&para;<br>Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement with a mandatory minimum of 15 years based in part on Descamps’&para;<br>earlier California conviction for burglary. See §924(e).&para;<br>The California law says that any “person who enters” any&para;<br>of a number of structures “with intent to commit grand or&para;<br>petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.” California Penal Code Ann. §459 (West 2010). That law does&para;<br>not, on its face, require the jury to determine whether the&para;<br>entry itself was unlawful, a required element of the socalled “generic” offense of burglary that qualifies as an&para;<br>ACCA predicate. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S.&para;<br>575, 599 (1990). The majority holds that a court may not&para;<br>review the underlying facts of Descamps’ state crime to&para;<br>determine whether he entered the building unlawfully&para;<br>and, thus, that his burglary conviction may not be used as&para;<br>a predicate offense under ACCA. While I agree with the&para;<br>Court’s conclusion, I disagree with its reasoning.&para;<br>I have previously explained that ACCA runs afoul of&para;<br>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.

United&para;<br>States, 550 U. S. 192, 231 (2007) (dissenting opinion)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the logic of&para;<br>Apprendi, a court may not find facts about a prior conviction when such findings increase the statutory maximum.&para;<br>This is so whether a court is determining whether a&para;<br>prior conviction was entered, see 530 U. S., at 520–521&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring), or attempting to discern what&para;<br>facts were necessary to a prior conviction. See James, supra, at 231–232 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). In either case,&para;<br>the court is inappropriately finding a fact that must be&para;<br>submitted to the jury because it “increases the penalty for&para;<br>a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.”&para;<br>Apprendi, supra, at 490.&para;<br>In light of the foregoing, it does not matter whether a&para;<br>statute is “divisible” or “indivisible,” see ante, at 1–2, and&para;<br>courts should not have to struggle with the contours of&para;<br>the so-called “modified categorical” approach. Ibid. The&para;<br>only reason Descamps’ ACCA enhancement is before us is&para;<br>“because this Court has not yet reconsidered AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U.

United States, 544 U. S. 13, 27 (2005)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Regardless of the framework adopted, judicial&para;<br>factfinding increases the statutory maximum in violation&para;<br>of the Sixth Amendment.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>he had already compiled a criminal record that included&para;<br>convictions in Washington State for assault and threatening to kill a judge, and convictions in California for robbery and burglary. See App. 11a–12a; 466 Fed. Appx. 563,&para;<br>565 (CA9 2012). After his release from custody for these&para;<br>earlier crimes, petitioner fired a gun in the direction of a&para;<br>man who supposedly owed him money for methamphetamine, and as a result, he was charged in federal court with&para;<br>possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of&para;<br>§922(g)(1). A jury found him guilty, and the District Court&para;<br>imposed an enhanced sentence under ACCA because he&para;<br>had the requisite number of previous convictions for “a&para;<br>violent felony or a serious drug offense.” §924(e). ACCA&para;<br>defines a “violent felony” to include a “burglary” that is&para;<br>“punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one&para;<br>year,” §924(e)(2)(B), and both the District Court and the&para;<br>Court of Appeals found that petitioner’s California burglary conviction fit this definition.&para;<br>While the concept of a conviction for burglary might&para;<br>seem simple, things have not worked out that way under&para;<br>our case law. In Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,&para;<br>599 (1990), we held that “burglary” under ACCA means&para;<br>what we called “generic burglary,” that is, the “unlawful or&para;<br>unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or&para;<br>structure, with intent to commit a crime.” Determining&para;<br>whether a burglary conviction qualifies under this definition is easy if the elements set out in the state statute are&para;<br>the same as or narrower than the elements of generic&para;<br>burglary, see ibid., but what if the state offense is broader?&para;<br>In that event, we have held, a federal court may sometimes&para;<br>apply what we have termed the “modified categorical&para;<br>approach,” that is, it may examine some items in the&para;<br>state-court record, including charging documents, jury&para;<br>instructions, and statements made at guilty plea proceedings, to determine if the defendant was actually found to&para;<br>have committed the elements of the generic offense. See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 20 (2005); Taylor,&para;<br>supra, at 602.&para;<br>Petitioner argues that his 1978 conviction for burglary&para;<br>under California Penal Code §459 does not qualify as a&para;<br>burglary conviction for ACCA purposes because of the&para;<br>particular way in which this provision is worded. Section&para;<br>459 provides that a “person who enters” certain locations&para;<br>“with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony&para;<br>is guilty of burglary.” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §459 (West&para;<br>2010). This provision is broader than generic burglary in&para;<br>two respects.&para;<br>The first, which does not preclude application of the&para;<br>modified categorical approach, concerns the place burglarized. While generic burglary applies only to offenses&para;<br>involving the entry of a building, the California provision&para;<br>also reaches offenses involving the entry of some other&para;<br>locations, see ibid. Under our cases, however, a federal&para;<br>court considering whether to apply ACCA may determine,&para;<br>based on an examination of certain relevant documents,&para;<br>whether the conviction was actually based on the entry of&para;<br>a building and, if it was, may impose an increased sentence. See Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 144&para;<br>(2010); Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29, 35 (2009); Shepard, supra, at 26.&para;<br>The second variation is more consequential. Whereas&para;<br>generic burglary requires an entry that is unlawful or&para;<br>unprivileged, the California statute refers without qualification to “[e]very person who enters.” §459. Petitioner&para;<br>argues, and the Court agrees, that this discrepancy renders the modified categorical approach inapplicable to his&para;<br>California burglary conviction.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court holds that “sentencing courts may not apply&para;<br>the modified categorical approach when the crime of which&para;<br>the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>elements.” Ante, at 2. Because the Court’s holding is&para;<br>based on the distinction between “divisible” and “indivisible” statutes, it is important to identify precisely what this&para;<br>taxonomy means.&para;<br>My understanding is that a statute is divisible, in the&para;<br>sense used by the Court, only if the offense in question&para;<br>includes as separate elements all of the elements of the&para;<br>generic offense. By an element, I understand the Court to&para;<br>mean something on which a jury must agree by the vote&para;<br>required to convict under the law of the applicable jurisdiction. See ante, at 14 (citing Richardson v. United&para;<br>States, 526 U. S. 813, 817 (1999)). And although the Court&para;<br>reserves decision on the question whether a sentencing&para;<br>court may take authoritative judicial decisions into account in identifying the elements of a statute, see ante, at&para;<br>20, I will assume that a sentencing court may do so. While&para;<br>the elements of a criminal offense are generally set out in&para;<br>the statutory text, courts sometimes find that unmentioned elements are implicit. See, e.g., Neder v. United&para;<br>States, 527 U. S. 1, 20 (1999) (holding that federal mail&para;<br>fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes require proof of&para;<br>materiality even though that element is not mentioned in&para;<br>the statutory text). I cannot think of any reason why an&para;<br>authoritative decision of this sort should be ignored, and&para;<br>the Court has certainly not provided any. I therefore&para;<br>proceed on the assumption that a statute is divisible if the&para;<br>offense, as properly construed, has the requisite elements.&para;<br>The Court’s holding that the modified categorical approach may be used only when a statute is divisible in this&para;<br>sense is not required by ACCA or by our prior cases and&para;<br>will cause serious practical problems.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Nothing in the text of ACCA mandates the Court’s&para;<br>exclusive focus on the elements of an offense. ACCA&para;<br>increases the sentence of a defendant who has “three&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

In drafting that&para;<br>provision, Congress did not say “any crime that has the&para;<br>elements of burglary.” Indeed, the fact that Congress&para;<br>referred to “elements” elsewhere in the same subparagraph, see §924(e)(2)(B)(i) (defining “violent felony” to&para;<br>mean any crime that “has as an element the use, attempted&para;<br>use, or threatened use of physical force against the&para;<br>person of another” (emphasis added)), but omitted any&para;<br>reference to elements from §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) suggests, if&para;<br>anything, that it did not intend to focus exclusively on&para;<br>elements.

Suppose that a defendant in Massachusetts was&para;<br>charged with breaking into a structure like the Lozman&para;<br>floating home. In order to convict, would it be necessary&para;<br>for the jury to agree whether this structure was a “building” or a “vessel”? If some jurors insisted it was a building&para;<br>and others were convinced it was a vessel, would the jury&para;<br>be hung? The Court’s answer is “yes.” According to the&para;<br>Court, if a defendant had been charged with burglarizing&para;<br>the Lozman floating home and this Court had been sitting&para;<br>as the jury, the defendant would have escaped conviction&para;<br>for burglary, no matter how strong the evidence, because&para;<br>the “jury” could not agree on whether he burglarized a&para;<br>building or a vessel.&para;<br>I have not found a Massachusetts decision squarely on&para;<br>point, but there is surely an argument that the Massachusetts Legislature did not want to demand juror agreement&para;<br>on this question. In other words, there is a strong argument that entry of a “building” and entry of a “vessel” are&para;<br>merely alternative means, not alternative elements. And&para;<br>if that is so, the reasoning in Shepard undermines the&para;<br>Court’s argument that the modified categorical approach&para;<br>focuses solely on elements and not on conduct.&para;<br>Johnson, like Shepard, involved a statute that may have&para;<br>set out alternative means, rather than alternative elements. Under the Florida statute involved in that case, a&para;<br>battery occurs when a person either “1. [a]ctually and&para;<br>intentionally touches or strikes another person against the&para;<br>will of the other; or 2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm&para;<br>to another person.” Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(a) (2010). It is a&para;<br>distinct possibility (one not foreclosed by any Florida&para;<br>decision of which I am aware) that a conviction under this&para;<br>provision does not require juror agreement as to whether a&para;<br>defendant firmly touched or lightly struck the victim.&para;<br>Nevertheless, in Johnson, we had no difficulty concluding&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that the modified categorical approach could be applied.1&para;<br>See 559 U. S., at 137.2&para;<br>Far from mandating the Court’s approach, these decisions support a practical understanding of the modified&para;<br>categorical approach. Thus, in Shepard, we observed that&para;<br>the factual circumstances of a defendant’s prior conviction&para;<br>may be relevant to determining whether it qualifies as a&para;<br>violent felony under ACCA. See 544 U. S., at 20–21&para;<br>(“With such material in a pleaded case, a later court could&para;<br>generally tell whether the plea had ‘necessarily’ rested on&para;<br>the fact identifying the burglary as generic, just as the&para;<br>details of instructions could support that conclusion in the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 However, because the Shepard documents did not reveal whether&para;<br>Johnson had been found to have touched or struck, we had to determine&para;<br>whether the relatively innocuous phrase—“[a]ctually and intentionally&para;<br>touch[ing]” another person—constituted physical force for purposes of&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i). See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 137.&para;<br>2 The remaining case, Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990),&para;<br>may also have involved a statute that was not divisible, but the situation is less clear. There, the defendant had several Missouri burglary&para;<br>convictions, and Missouri had several different burglary provisions in&para;<br>effect at the time in question. See id., at 578, n. 1. The particular&para;<br>provision involved in each of those cases was not certain. Ibid. At least&para;<br>one of those provisions, however, may not have been divisible. That&para;<br>provision, Mo. Rev. Stat. §560.070 (1969) (repealed), applied not only to&para;<br>buildings but also to “any booth or tent,” “any boat or vessel,” or a&para;<br>“railroad car.” It is not entirely clear whether a Missouri court would&para;<br>have required jurors to agree on a particular choice from this list. In&para;<br>State v. Vandergriff, 403 S. W. 2d 579, 581 (Mo. 1966), the Missouri&para;<br>Supreme Court held that an information was deficient because it&para;<br>“omitted a description of the type of building that might be burglarized&para;<br>as defined by §560.070, and thereby omitted an essential element of the&para;<br>offense of burglary in the second degree.” Because an information must&para;<br>generally include factual details that go beyond the elements of an&para;<br>offense, see 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal&para;<br>Procedure §19.3(b), p. 276 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave), it is&para;<br>possible that the Missouri court did not mean to say that the type of&para;<br>building was an element in the sense in which I understand the Court&para;<br>to use the term here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>jury case, or the details of a generically limited charging&para;<br>document would do in any sort of case” (emphasis added;&para;<br>citation omitted)); id., at 24 (plurality opinion) (“Developments in the law since Taylor . . . provide a further reason&para;<br>to adhere to the demanding requirement that . . . a prior&para;<br>conviction ‘necessarily’ involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts equating to generic burglary” (emphasis added)); id., at 25 (noting that, in the context of a&para;<br>nongeneric burglary statute, unless the charging documents “narro[w] the charge to generic limits, the only&para;<br>certainty of a generic finding lies in jury instructions, or&para;<br>bench-trial findings and rulings, or (in a pleaded case) in&para;<br>the defendant’s own admissions or accepted findings of&para;<br>fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea” (emphasis added)). And in Nijhawan, we departed from the&para;<br>categorical approach altogether and instead applied a&para;<br>“circumstance-specific” approach. See 557 U. S., at 36,&para;<br>38. If anything, then, Nijhawan undermines the majority’s position that rigid adherence to elements is always&para;<br>required.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Court fears that application of the modified categorical approach to statutes such as §459 would be unfair to&para;<br>defendants, who “often ha[ve] little incentive to contest&para;<br>facts that are not elements of the charged offense” and&para;<br>“may not wish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling&para;<br>about superfluous factual allegations.” Ante, at 15. This&para;<br>argument attributes to criminal defendants and their&para;<br>attorneys a degree of timidity that may not be realistic.&para;<br>But in any event, even if a defendant does not think it&para;<br>worthwhile to “squabbl[e]” about insignificant factual&para;<br>allegations, a defendant clearly has an incentive to dispute&para;<br>allegations that may have a bearing on his sentence. And&para;<br>that will often be the case when alternative elements or&para;<br>means suggest different degrees of culpability. Cf. Cal.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Penal Code Ann. §460 (providing that burglary of certain&para;<br>inhabited locations enumerated in §459 is punishable in&para;<br>the first degree, and that burglary of all other locations is&para;<br>punishable in the second degree).&para;<br>D&para;<br>The Court’s approach, I must concede, does have one&para;<br>benefit: It provides an extra measure of assurance that a&para;<br>burglary conviction will not be counted as an ACCA predicate unless the defendant, if he went to trial, was actually&para;<br>found by a jury to have committed the elements of the&para;<br>generic offense. But this extra bit of assurance will generally be quite modest at best.&para;<br>To see why this is so, compare what would happen&para;<br>under an indivisible burglary statute that simply requires&para;<br>entry invading a possessory right, and a divisible statute&para;<br>that has the following two alternative elements: (1) entry&para;<br>by trespass and (2) entry by invitation but with an undisclosed criminal intent. Under the former statute, the jury&para;<br>would be required to agree only that the defendant invaded&para;<br>a possessory right when entering the place in question,&para;<br>and therefore it would be possible for the jury to convict&para;<br>even if some jurors thought that the defendant entered by&para;<br>trespassing while others thought that he entered by invitation but with an undisclosed criminal intent. Under the&para;<br>latter statute, by contrast, the jury would have to agree&para;<br>either that he trespassed or that he entered by invitation&para;<br>but with an undisclosed criminal intent.&para;<br>This requirement of unanimity would be of some practical value only if the evidence in a case pointed to both&para;<br>possibilities, and in a great many cases that will not be so.&para;<br>In cases prosecuted under the California burglary statute,&para;<br>I suspect, the evidence generally points either to a trespassory entry, typically involving breaking into a building&para;<br>or other covered place, or to an entry by invitation but&para;<br>with an undisclosed criminal intent (in many cases, shop-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lifting). Cases in which the evidence suggests that the&para;<br>defendant might have done either are probably not common. And in cases where there is evidence supporting&para;<br>both theories, the presence of a divisible statute containing alternative elements will not solve the problem: A&para;<br>guilty verdict will not reveal the alternative on which the&para;<br>jury agreed unless the jury was asked to return a special&para;<br>verdict, something that is not generally favored in criminal cases. See 6 LaFave §24.10(a), at 543–544.&para;<br>In cases that end with a guilty plea—and most do—the&para;<br>benefit of divisibility is even less. A judge who accepts a&para;<br>guilty plea is typically required to confirm that there is a&para;<br>factual basis for the plea, see 5 id., §21.4(f), at 835–840 (3d&para;<br>ed. 2007 and Supp. 2011–2012), and the proffer of a factual&para;<br>basis will generally focus exclusively on one of the&para;<br>alternative elements.&para;<br>The Court nevertheless suggests that the extra modicum of assurance provided in cases involving divisible&para;<br>statutes is needed to prevent violations of the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment jury trial right, ante, at 13–15, but I disagree.&para;<br>So long as a judge applying ACCA is determining, not&para;<br>what the defendant did when the burglary in question was&para;<br>committed, but what the jury in that case necessarily&para;<br>found or what the defendant, in pleading guilty, necessarily&para;<br>admitted, the jury trial right is not infringed. See&para;<br>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998).&para;<br>When the modified categorical approach is used to decide&para;<br>whether “a jury was actually required to find all the elements of [a] generic [offense],” the defendant has already&para;<br>enjoyed his Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination of those elements. Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602.&para;<br>III&para;<br>While producing very modest benefits at most, the&para;<br>Court’s holding will create several serious problems.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Determining whether a statute is divisible will often be&para;<br>harder than the Court acknowledges. What I have said&para;<br>about the statutes involved in Shepard and Johnson illustrates this point. The Court assumes that those statutes&para;<br>were divisible, but as I have explained, it is possible that&para;<br>they were not. See supra, at 5–7.&para;<br>To determine whether a statute contains alternative&para;<br>elements, as opposed to merely alternative means of satisfying an element, a court called upon to apply ACCA will&para;<br>be required to look beyond the text of the statute, which&para;<br>may be deceptive. Take, for example, Michigan Compiled&para;<br>Laws Annotated §750.82(1) (West 2004), which criminalizes assault with “a gun, revolver, pistol, knife, iron bar,&para;<br>club, brass knuckles, or other dangerous weapon.” The&para;<br>Court seems to assume that a statute like this enumerates&para;<br>alternative elements, ante, at 17–18, but the Michigan&para;<br>courts have held otherwise. Under Michigan law, the&para;<br>elements of §750.82(1) are “(1) an assault, (2) with a dangerous weapon, and (3) with the intent to injure or place&para;<br>the victim in reasonable apprehension of an immediate&para;<br>battery.” People v. Avant, 235 Mich. App. 499, 505, 597&para;<br>N. W. 2d 864, 869 (1999). Although the statute lists numerous types of weapons, the particular type of weapon is&para;<br>not itself an element that the prosecution must prove&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the list of weapons in&para;<br>the statute merely enumerates alternative means of committing the crime.3&para;<br>Even if a federal court applying ACCA discovers a state——————&para;<br>3 The board game Clue, to which the Court refers, see ante, at 18,&para;<br>does not provide sound legal guidance. In that game, it matters whether&para;<br>Colonel Mustard bashed in the victim’s head with a candlestick,&para;<br>wrench, or lead pipe. But in real life, the colonel would almost certainly&para;<br>not escape conviction simply because the jury was unable to agree on&para;<br>the particular type of blunt instrument that he used to commit the&para;<br>murder.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Charging documents must generally include factual&para;<br>allegations that go beyond the bare elements of the&para;<br>crime—specifically, at least enough detail to permit the&para;<br>defendant to mount a defense. See 5 LaFave §19.3(b), at&para;<br>276. And some jurisdictions require fairly specific factual&para;<br>allegations. See, e.g., N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law Ann. §200.50&para;<br>(West 2007) (enumerating detailed requirements for indictment); People v. Swanson, 308 Ill. App. 3d 708, 712,&para;<br>721 N. E. 2d 630, 633 (1999) (vacating conviction for disorderly conduct for submitting a false police report because information “d[id] not describe with particularity&para;<br>the time, date, or location of the alleged domestic battery&para;<br>and the acts comprising the battery . . . [or] the statement&para;<br>that was falsely reported”); Edwards v. State, 379 So. 2d&para;<br>336, 338 (Ala. Crim.

Thus, the mere fact that state law requires a&para;<br>particular fact to be alleged in a charging document does&para;<br>not mean that this fact must be found by a jury or admitted by the defendant.&para;<br>The only way to be sure whether particular items are&para;<br>alternative elements or simply alternative means of satisfying an element may be to find cases concerning the&para;<br>correctness of jury instructions that treat the items one way&para;<br>or the other. And such cases may not arise frequently.&para;<br>One of the Court’s reasons for adopting the modified categorical approach was to simplify the work of ACCA&para;<br>courts, see Shepard, 544 U.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ACCA objectives. We have repeatedly recognized that&para;<br>Congress enacted ACCA to ensure (1) that violent, dangerous recidivists would be subject to enhanced penalties&para;<br>and (2) that those enhanced penalties would be applied&para;<br>uniformly, regardless of state-law variations. See, e.g., id.,&para;<br>at 587–589. See also id., at 582 (“ ‘[I]n terms of fundamental fairness, the Act should ensure, to the extent that it is&para;<br>consistent with the prerogatives of the States in defining&para;<br>their own offenses, that the same type of conduct is punishable on the Federal level in all cases’ ” (quoting S.

Defendants convicted of the elements of generic burglary in California will not be subject&para;<br>to ACCA, but defendants who engage in exactly the same&para;<br>behavior in, say, Virginia, will fall within ACCA’s reach.&para;<br>See Va.

When the trial court inquired into the&para;<br>factual basis for petitioner’s plea, the prosecutor stated&para;<br>that petitioner’s crime involved “the breaking and entering&para;<br>of a grocery store.” Id., at 25a. Neither petitioner nor his&para;<br>attorney voiced any objection.4 Ibid. In order to accept&para;<br>petitioner’s plea, the trial court was required under California law to ensure that the plea had a factual basis, see&para;<br>Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1192.5 (1978); App. 26a, and we&para;<br>must presume that the plea proceedings were conducted in&para;<br>a regular manner, see Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29–30&para;<br>(1992). The unmistakable inference arising from the plea&para;<br>transcript is that the trial judge—quite reasonably—&para;<br>understood petitioner and his attorney to assent to the&para;<br>factual basis provided by the prosecutor. Both the District&para;<br>Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner&para;<br>had admitted and, as a practical matter, was convicted for&para;<br>having committed the elements of generic burglary, and&para;<br>we did not agree to review that fact-bound determination,&para;<br>see 567 U.

United&para;<br>States v. Hernandez-Hernandez, 431 F. 3d 1212, 1219 (2005).

Nor would an admission to merely “entering”&para;<br>the store have permitted the judge to assess whether&para;<br>petitioner entered with the intent to commit a crime;&para;<br>petitioner’s admission to “breaking” was therefore critical&para;<br>to that element, as well. Cf. Black’s Law Dictionary 236&para;<br>(rev. 4th ed. 1968) (“Breaking” denotes the “tearing away&para;<br>or removal of any part of a house or of the locks, latches,&para;<br>or other fastenings intended to secure it, or otherwise&para;<br>exerting force to gain an entrance, with the intent to&para;<br>commit a felony”).&para;<br>We have explained that burglary under §924(e) means&para;<br>“an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a&para;<br>building or other structure, with intent to commit a&para;<br>crime.” Taylor, 495 U.
