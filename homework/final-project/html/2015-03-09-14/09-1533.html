UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1533. Argued February 28, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011&para;<br>In 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers of illicit drugs—in&para;<br>particular, the new phenomenon of crack cocaine—prompted Con&para;<br>gress to revise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine&para;<br>related substances. Following several hearings, Congress enacted&para;<br>the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA). The statute provides a&para;<br>mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses in&para;<br>volving “(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing&para;<br>a detectable amount of . . . (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric&para;<br>isomers, and salts of isomers, [or] (iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture&para;<br>or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.” 21&para;<br>U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A). The statute similarly provides a 5-year sen&para;<br>tence for offenses involving 500 grams of a substance enumerated in&para;<br>clause (ii) or 5 grams of one outlined in clause (iii). §841(b)(1)(B).&para;<br>In 2005, petitioner DePierre was indicted for distribution of 50&para;<br>grams or more of cocaine base under §§841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).&para;<br>The District Court declined DePierre’s request that the jury be in&para;<br>structed that, in order to find DePierre guilty of distribution of “co&para;<br>caine base,” it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.&para;<br>DePierre was convicted, and the court sentenced him to the 120&para;<br>months in prison mandated by the statute. The First Circuit af&para;<br>firmed, rejecting DePierre’s argument that §841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should&para;<br>be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine. Instead, it&para;<br>adhered to its precedent holding that “cocaine base” refers to all&para;<br>forms of cocaine base.&para;<br>Held: “[C]ocaine base,” as used in §841(b)(1), means not just “crack co&para;<br>caine,” but cocaine in its chemically basic form. Pp. 7–18.&para;<br>(a) The most natural reading of “cocaine base” in clause (iii) is co&para;<br>caine in its chemically basic form—i.e., the molecule found in crack&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cocaine, freebase, and coca paste. On its plain terms, then, “cocaine&para;<br>base” reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine. In arguing to the&para;<br>contrary, DePierre urges the Court to stray far from the statute’s&para;<br>text, which nowhere contains the term “crack cocaine.” The Govern&para;<br>ment’s reading, on the other hand, follows the words Congress chose&para;<br>to use. DePierre is correct that “cocaine base” is technically redun&para;<br>dant—chemically speaking, cocaine is a base. But Congress had good&para;<br>reason to use “cocaine base”—to make clear that clause (iii) does not&para;<br>apply to offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride (i.e., powder co&para;<br>caine) or other nonbasic cocaine-related substances. At the time the&para;<br>statute was enacted, “cocaine” was commonly used to refer to powder&para;<br>cocaine, and the scientific and medical literature often uses “cocaine”&para;<br>to refer to all cocaine-related substances, including ones that are not&para;<br>chemically basic. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(b) This reading of “cocaine base” is also consistent with&para;<br>§841(b)(1)’s somewhat confusing structure. Subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii)(II)&para;<br>lists “cocaine,” along with “its salts, optical and geometric isomers,&para;<br>and salts of isomers,” as elements subject to clause (ii)’s higher quan&para;<br>tity threshold. DePierre is correct that, because “cocaine” and “co&para;<br>caine base” both refer to chemically basic cocaine, offenses involving&para;<br>a substance containing such cocaine will always be penalized accord&para;<br>ing to the lower quantity threshold of clause (iii), and never the&para;<br>higher threshold clause (ii) establishes for mixtures and substances&para;<br>containing “cocaine.” But the Court does not agree that the term “co&para;<br>caine” in clause (ii) is therefore superfluous—in light of the structure&para;<br>of subclause (II), “cocaine” is needed as the reference point for “salts”&para;<br>and “isomers,” which would otherwise be meaningless.&para;<br>The term “cocaine” in clause (ii) also performs another critical func&para;<br>tion. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance&para;<br>“described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.” Thus, clause&para;<br>(ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related sub&para;<br>stances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for a sub&para;<br>set of those substances—the ones that “contai[n] cocaine base.” For&para;<br>this structure to work, however, §841(b)(1) must “describ[e] in clause&para;<br>(ii)” substances containing chemically basic cocaine, which then com&para;<br>prise the subset described in clause (iii). Congress thus had good&para;<br>reason to include the term “cocaine” in clause (ii), and the slight in&para;<br>consistency created by its use of “cocaine base” in clause (iii) is insuf&para;<br>ficient reason to adopt DePierre’s interpretation. Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(c) DePierre’s additional arguments are unpersuasive. First, the&para;<br>records of the 1986 congressional hearings do not support his conten&para;<br>tion that Congress was exclusively concerned with offenses involving&para;<br>crack cocaine. Second, reading “cocaine base” to mean chemically ba&para;<br>sic cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, does not lead to an absurd re&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sult. Third, the fact that “cocaine base” in the Federal Sentencing&para;<br>Guidelines is defined as “crack” does not require that the statutory&para;<br>term be interpreted the same way. Fourth, the statute is sufficiently&para;<br>clear that the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierre’s favor.&para;<br>Pp. 13–18.&para;<br>599 F. 3d 25, affirmed.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

An alkaloid is a base—&para;<br>that is, a compound capable of reacting with an acid to&para;<br>form a salt.1 Id., at 54, 180; see also Brief for Individual&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 There&para;<br>&para;<br>are more detailed theories of how acids and bases interact.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Physicians and Scientists as Amici Curiae 2–3 (herein&para;<br>after Physicians Brief). Cocaine is derived from the coca&para;<br>plant native to South America. The leaves of the coca&para;<br>plant can be processed with water, kerosene, sodium car&para;<br>bonate, and sulphuric acid to produce a paste-like sub&para;<br>stance. R. Weiss, S. Mirin, &amp; R. Bartel, Cocaine 10 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1994). When dried, the resulting “coca paste” can be&para;<br>vaporized (through the application of heat) and inhaled,&para;<br>i.e., “smoked.” See United States Sentencing Commission,&para;<br>Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal&para;<br>Sentencing Policy 11–12 (1995) (hereinafter Commission&para;<br>Report). Coca paste contains C17H21NO4—that is, cocaine&para;<br>in its base form.&para;<br>Dissolving coca paste in water and hydrochloric acid&para;<br>produces (after several intermediate steps) cocaine hydro&para;<br>chloride, which is a salt with the molecular formula&para;<br>C17H22NO4+Cl-. Id., at 12; Physicians Brief 3. Cocaine&para;<br>hydrochloride, therefore, is not a base. It generally comes&para;<br>in powder form, which we will refer to as “powder cocaine.”&para;<br>It is usually insufflated (breathed in through the nose),&para;<br>though it can also be ingested or diluted in water and&para;<br>injected. Because cocaine hydrochloride vaporizes at a&para;<br>much higher temperature than chemically basic cocaine&para;<br>(at which point the cocaine molecule tends to decompose),&para;<br>it is generally not smoked. See Commission Report 11,&para;<br>n. 15, 12–13.&para;<br>Cocaine hydrochloride can be converted into cocaine in&para;<br>its base form by combining powder cocaine with water and&para;<br>a base, like sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking&para;<br>soda).

This substance&para;<br>is commonly known as “crack” or “crack cocaine.”2 Alter&para;<br>natively, powder cocaine can be dissolved in water and&para;<br>ammonia (also a base); with the addition of ether, a solid&para;<br>substance—known as “freebase”—separates from the solu&para;<br>tion, and can be smoked. Id., at 13.

On the other hand, cocaine in its&para;<br>base form and in its salt form (i.e., cocaine hydrochloride)&para;<br>are chemically different, though they have the same active&para;<br>ingredient and produce the same physiological and psy&para;<br>chotropic effects. See id., at 14–22. The key difference&para;<br>between them is the method by which they generally enter&para;<br>the body; smoking cocaine in its base form—whether as&para;<br>coca paste, freebase, or crack cocaine—allows the body to&para;<br>absorb the active ingredient quickly, thereby producing a&para;<br>shorter, more intense high than obtained from insufflating&para;<br>cocaine hydrochloride.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vision for mandatory minimum sentences. See, e.g.,&para;<br>§841(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III). After holding several&para;<br>hearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack&para;<br>cocaine, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of&para;<br>1986 (ADAA), 100 Stat. 3207, which provided mandatory&para;<br>minimum sentences for controlled-substance offenses in&para;<br>volving specific quantities of drugs.&para;<br>As relevant here, the ADAA provided a mandatory 10&para;<br>year sentence for certain drug offenses involving 5 kilo&para;<br>grams or more of “a mixture or substance containing a&para;<br>detectable amount of ” various cocaine-related elements,&para;<br>including coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts; it also&para;<br>called for the same sentence for offenses involving only&para;<br>50 grams or more of “a mixture or substance . . . which&para;<br>contains cocaine base.” ADAA, §1002, 100 Stat. 3207–2&para;<br>(amending §§841(b)(1)(A)(ii)–(iii)) (emphasis added). The&para;<br>ADAA also stipulated a mandatory 5-year sentence for&para;<br>offenses involving 500 grams of a mixture or substance&para;<br>containing coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts, or 5&para;<br>grams of a mixture or substance containing “cocaine base.”&para;<br>Id., at 3207–3 (amending §§841(b)(1)(B)(ii)–(iii)).&para;<br>Thus, the ADAA established a 100-to-1 ratio for the&para;<br>threshold quantities of cocaine-related substances that&para;<br>triggered the statute’s mandatory minimum penalties.&para;<br>That is, 5 grams or more of “a mixture or substance . . .&para;<br>which contains cocaine base” was penalized as severely as&para;<br>100 times that amount of the other cocaine-related ele&para;<br>ments enumerated in the statute.

A police officer testified&para;<br>that the substance in question was “off-white [and]&para;<br>chunky.” Id., at 455.&para;<br>DePierre asked the District Court to instruct the jury&para;<br>that, in order to find him guilty of distribution of cocaine&para;<br>base, it must find that his offense involved “the form&para;<br>of cocaine base known as crack cocaine.” App. in No. 08–&para;<br>2101 (CA1), p. 43. His proposed jury instruction defined&para;<br>“crack” identically to the Guidelines definition. See id., at&para;<br>43–44; see also USSG §2D1.1(c), n. (D). In addition, DePierre asked the court to instruct the jury that “[c]hemi&para;<br>cal analysis cannot establish a substance as crack because&para;<br>crack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base,&para;<br>although it can reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate,&para;<br>which is usually used in the processing of crack.” App. in&para;<br>No. 08–2101, at 44.&para;<br>The court, however, instructed the jury that “the statute&para;<br>that’s relevant asks about cocaine base.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>scribed in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.”7&para;<br>We agree with the Government that the most natural&para;<br>reading of the term “cocaine base” is “cocaine in its base&para;<br>form”—i.e., C17H21NO4, the molecule found in crack co&para;<br>caine, freebase, and coca paste. On its plain terms, then,&para;<br>“cocaine base” reaches more broadly than just crack co&para;<br>caine. In arguing to the contrary, DePierre asks us to&para;<br>stray far from the statute’s text, as the term “crack co&para;<br>caine” appears nowhere in the ADAA (or the United States&para;<br>Code, for that matter). While the Government’s reading is&para;<br>not without its problems,8 that reading follows from the&para;<br>words Congress chose to include in the text. See United&para;<br>States v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377, 384 (2008) (eschewing&para;<br>an interpretation that was “not faithful to the statutory&para;<br>text”). In short, the term “cocaine base” is more plausibly&para;<br>read to mean the “chemically basic form of cocaine,” Brief&para;<br>for United States 15, than it is “crack cocaine,” Brief for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 As noted earlier, §841(b)(1)(B) calls for a mandatory minimum 5&para;<br>year sentence for offenses involving exactly the same substances; the&para;<br>only difference in subparagraph (B) is that the threshold quantity in&para;<br>clause (ii) is 500 grams, and in clause (iii) it is 5 grams. Because the&para;<br>100-to-1 ratio is a feature of both §§841(b)(1)(A) and (B), and those&para;<br>subparagraphs are identical in all other respects, throughout this&para;<br>opinion we use the terms “clause (ii)” and “clause (iii)” to refer to those&para;<br>clauses as present in either subparagraph.&para;<br>8 The Government urges us to give “cocaine base” its “settled, unam&para;<br>biguous scientific meaning,” i.e., “the form of cocaine classified chemi&para;<br>cally as a base, with the chemical formula C17H21NO4 and a particular&para;<br>molecular structure.” Brief for United States 20; cf. McDermott Int’l,&para;<br>Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U.

But&para;<br>Congress had good reason to use “cocaine base” in the&para;<br>ADAA—to distinguish the substances covered by clause&para;<br>(iii) from other cocaine-related substances. For example,&para;<br>at the time Congress enacted the statute, the word “co&para;<br>caine” was commonly used to refer to cocaine hydrochlo&para;<br>ride, i.e., powder cocaine.

Lewis, Hawley’s Condensed Chemical Dic&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The statute itself gives us good reason to reject DePierre’s reading.&para;<br>Substituting “crack cocaine” for “cocaine base” would mean that clause&para;<br>(iii) only applies to a “mixture or substance . . . which contains [crack&para;<br>cocaine].” But crack cocaine is itself a “substance” involved in drug&para;<br>offenses; it is the end product that is bought, sold, and consumed. We&para;<br>are aware of no substance that “contains” crack cocaine.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tionary 317 (15th ed. 2007). Accordingly, Congress’ choice&para;<br>to use the admittedly redundant term “cocaine base” to&para;<br>refer to chemically basic cocaine is best understood as an&para;<br>effort to make clear that clause (iii) does not apply to&para;<br>offenses involving powder cocaine or other nonbasic&para;<br>cocaine-related substances.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Notwithstanding DePierre’s arguments to the contrary,&para;<br>reading “cocaine base” to mean chemically basic cocaine is&para;<br>also consistent with §841(b)(1)’s somewhat confounding&para;<br>structure. DePierre is correct that the interpretation we&para;<br>adopt today raises the question why Congress included the&para;<br>word “cocaine” in subclause (II) of clause (ii). That sub&para;<br>clause lists “cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric iso&para;<br>mers, and salts of isomers” as elements subject to clause&para;<br>(ii)’s higher quantity threshold.&para;<br>§§841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II),&para;<br>(B)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). If, as we conclude, the terms&para;<br>“cocaine” and “cocaine base” both mean chemically basic&para;<br>cocaine, offenses involving a mixture or substance which&para;<br>contains such cocaine will always be penalized according&para;<br>to the lower quantity thresholds of clause (iii), and never&para;<br>the higher quantity thresholds clause (ii) establishes for&para;<br>mixtures and substances containing “cocaine.”10&para;<br>While this much is true, we do not agree with DePierre&para;<br>that the word “cocaine” in subclause (II) is therefore su&para;<br>perfluous. For without the word “cocaine” subclause (II)&para;<br>makes no sense: It would provide a minimum sentence for&para;<br>offenses involving a specified quantity of simply “its salts,&para;<br>optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.” In&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 DePierre makes a similar argument with respect to coca leaves:&para;<br>Because they contain chemically basic cocaine, he contends, under the&para;<br>Government’s interpretation offenses involving coca leaves will never&para;<br>be subject to the lower quantity threshold associated with subclause (I),&para;<br>rendering that provision superfluous. For reasons discussed later, see&para;<br>infra, at 15–16, we are not convinced.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>light of the structure of the subclause, the word “cocaine”&para;<br>is needed as the reference point for “salts” and “isomers.”&para;<br>The word “cocaine” in subclause (II) also performs an&para;<br>other critical function. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses&para;<br>involving “a mixture or substance described in clause (ii)&para;<br>which contains cocaine base.” §§841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii)&para;<br>(emphasis added). In other words, clause (ii) imposes a&para;<br>penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances&para;<br>generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for&para;<br>a subset of those substances—the ones that “contai[n]&para;<br>cocaine base.” For this structure to work, however,&para;<br>§841(b)(1) must “describ[e] in clause (ii)” substances con&para;<br>taining chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the&para;<br>subset described in clause (iii). If such substances were&para;<br>not present in clause (ii), clause (iii) would only apply to&para;<br>substances that contain both chemically basic cocaine and&para;<br>one of the other elements enumerated in clause (ii). Pre&para;<br>sumably, the result would be that clause (iii) would not&para;<br>apply to crack cocaine, freebase, or coca paste offenses, as&para;<br>there is no indication that, in addition to “cocaine base”&para;<br>(i.e., C17H21NO4), those substances contain cocaine “salts”&para;<br>(e.g., cocaine hydrochloride), ecgonine, or any of the other&para;<br>elements enumerated in clause (ii). In short, the exclusion&para;<br>of “cocaine” from clause (ii) would result in clause (iii)&para;<br>effectively describing a null set, which obviously was not&para;<br>Congress’ intent.&para;<br>Of course, this redundancy could have been avoided by&para;<br>simply drafting clause (iii) to penalize offenses involving&para;<br>“a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,”&para;<br>without reference to clause (ii)—that is, Congress could&para;<br>have drafted clause (iii) to specify a separate set of cocaine&para;<br>related substances, not a subset of those in clause (ii).&para;<br>That we may rue inartful legislative drafting, however,&para;<br>does not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v.

As is evident from the pre&para;<br>ceding discussion, this position is not supported by the&para;<br>statutory text. To be sure, the records of the contempora&para;<br>neous congressional hearings suggest that Congress was&para;<br>most concerned with the particular dangers posed by the&para;<br>advent of crack cocaine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing&para;<br>1 (statement of Chairman Roth) (“[We] mee[t] today to&para;<br>examine a frightening and dangerous new twist in the&para;<br>drug abuse problem—the growing availability and use of a&para;<br>cheap, highly addictive, and deadly form of cocaine known&para;<br>on the streets as ‘crack’ ”); see generally Commission Re&para;<br>port 116–118; Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 95–96.&para;<br>It does not necessarily follow, however, that in passing&para;<br>the ADAA Congress meant for clause (iii)’s lower quantity&para;<br>thresholds to apply exclusively to crack cocaine offenses.&para;<br>Numerous witnesses at the hearings testified that the&para;<br>primary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous was&para;<br>because—contrary to powder cocaine—cocaine in its base&para;<br>form is smoked, which was understood to produce a faster,&para;<br>more intense, and more addictive high than powder co&para;<br>caine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 20 (statement of&para;<br>Dr. Robert Byck, Yale University School of Medicine)&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v.

This is not,&para;<br>however, a feature unique to crack cocaine, and freebase&para;<br>and coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous,&para;<br>smokeable forms of cocaine. See, e.g., id., at 70 (prepared&para;<br>statement of Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Director, National&para;<br>Institute on Drug Abuse) (reporting on the shift from&para;<br>snorting powder cocaine to “newer more dangerous routes&para;<br>of administration, such as freebase smoking”); id., at 19–&para;<br>20 (statement of Dr. Byck) (describing the damaging ef&para;<br>fects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru).&para;<br>Moreover, the testimony of witnesses before Congress&para;<br>did not clearly distinguish between these base forms of&para;<br>cocaine; witnesses repeatedly used terms like “cocaine&para;<br>base,” “freebase,” or “cocaine freebase” in a manner that&para;<br>grouped crack cocaine with other substances containing&para;<br>chemically basic forms of cocaine. See, e.g., Trafficking&para;<br>and Abuse of “Crack” in New York City, House Select&para;<br>Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, 99th Cong.,&para;<br>2d Sess., 258 (1986) (statement of Robert M.

In the absence of any&para;<br>indication in the statutory text that Congress intended&para;<br>only to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal&para;<br>ties, we cannot adopt DePierre’s narrow construction. See&para;<br>Lewis v. Chicago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9)&para;<br>(“It is not for us to rewrite [a] statute so that it covers only&para;<br>what we think is necessary to achieve what we think&para;<br>Congress really intended”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>DePierre also argues that we should read the term “co&para;<br>caine base” to mean “crack cocaine,” rather than chemi&para;<br>cally basic cocaine, because the latter definition leads to&para;<br>an absurd result. Cf. EEOC v. Commercial Office Prod&para;<br>ucts Co., 486 U. S. 107, 120 (1988) (plurality opinion). He&para;<br>contends that, because coca leaves themselves contain&para;<br>cocaine, under the Government’s approach an offense&para;<br>involving 5 grams of coca leaves will be subject to the 5&para;<br>year minimum sentence in §841(b)(1)(B)(iii), even though&para;<br>those leaves would produce only .05 grams of smokeable&para;<br>cocaine. See Brief for Petitioner 41–42. While we agree that&para;<br>it would be questionable to treat 5 grams of coca leaves as&para;<br>equivalent to 500 grams of powder cocaine for minimum&para;<br>sentence purposes, we are not persuaded that such a&para;<br>result would actually obtain in light of our decision today.&para;<br>To begin with, it is a matter of dispute between the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>parties whether coca leaves in their natural, unprocessed&para;<br>form actually contain chemically basic cocaine. Compare&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 15, 17, n. 10, with Brief for United&para;<br>States 43. Even assuming that DePierre is correct as a&para;<br>matter of chemistry that coca leaves contain cocaine in its&para;<br>base form,12 see Physicians Brief 2, 11, the Government&para;<br>has averred that it “would not be able to make that show&para;<br>ing in court,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and that “coca leaves&para;<br>should not be treated as containing ‘cocaine base’ for&para;<br>purposes of Clause (iii),” Brief for United States 45.&para;<br>It is unsurprising, therefore, that the Government in its&para;<br>brief disclaimed awareness of any prosecution in which&para;<br>it had sought, or the defendant had received, a statutory&para;<br>minimum sentence enhanced under clause (iii) for an of&para;<br>fense involving coca leaves. Id., at 44. And although&para;<br>this question is not before us today, we note that Congress’&para;<br>deliberate choice to enumerate “coca leaves” in clause (ii)&para;<br>strongly indicates its intent that offenses involving such&para;<br>leaves be subject to the higher quantity thresholds of that&para;<br>clause. Accordingly, there is little danger that the statute&para;<br>will be read in the “absurd” manner DePierre fears.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In addition, DePierre suggests that because the Sen&para;<br>tencing Commission has, since 1993, defined “cocaine&para;<br>base” to mean “crack” for the purposes of the Federal&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines, we should do the same with re&para;<br>spect to §841(b)(1). We do not agree. We have never held&para;<br>that, when interpreting a term in a criminal statute,&para;<br>deference is warranted to the Sentencing Commission’s&para;<br>definition of the same term in the Guidelines. Cf. Neal v.&para;<br>United States, 516 U. S. 284, 290–296 (1996). And we&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 It&para;<br>&para;<br>appears that Congress itself is of the view that coca leaves con&para;<br>tain “cocaine,” as subclause (I) exempts offenses involving “coca leaves&para;<br>from which cocaine . . . ha[s] been removed.” §§841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I),&para;<br>(B)(ii)(I).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

See USSG §2D1.1(c), n. (D) (“ ‘Co&para;<br>caine base,’ for the purposes of this guideline, means&para;<br>‘crack’ ” (emphasis added)).13&para;<br>We recognize that, because the definition of “cocaine&para;<br>base” in clause (iii) differs from the Guidelines definition,&para;<br>certain sentencing anomalies may result. For example, an&para;<br>offense involving 5 grams of crack cocaine and one involv&para;<br>ing 5 grams of coca paste both trigger a minimum 5&para;<br>year sentence under §841(b)(1)(B)(iii). But defendants&para;<br>convicted of offenses involving only 4 grams of each sub&para;<br>stance—which do not trigger the statutory minimums—&para;<br>would likely receive different sentences, because of the&para;<br>Guidelines’ differential treatment of those substances with&para;<br>respect to offense level.14 Compare USSG §2D1.1(c)(9)&para;<br>(providing an offense level of 22 for at least 4 grams of&para;<br>“cocaine base,” i.e., “crack”) with §2D1.1(c)(14) (providing&para;<br>an offense level of 12 for less than 25 grams of “cocaine,”&para;<br>which, under the Guidelines, includes coca paste). As we&para;<br>have noted in previous opinions, however, such disparities&para;<br>are the inevitable result of the dissimilar operation of the&para;<br>fixed minimum sentences Congress has provided by stat——————&para;<br>13 We&para;<br>&para;<br>also disagree with DePierre’s contention that Congress’ failure&para;<br>to reject the Guidelines definition of “cocaine base” means that it has&para;<br>effectively adopted that interpretation with respect to the statute. See&para;<br>Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 106 (2007) (“Ordinarily, we&para;<br>resist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction”).&para;<br>14 In defining “cocaine base” as “crack,” the Commission explained&para;<br>that “forms of cocaine base other than crack” are treated as “cocaine”&para;<br>for purposes of the Guidelines. USSG App. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov.&para;<br>1, 1993). This includes coca paste, which the Commission described as&para;<br>“an intermediate step in the processing of coca leaves into cocaine&para;<br>hydrochloride.” Ibid. As we have explained, however, coca paste is a&para;<br>smokeable form of cocaine in its own right, and we see no reason why,&para;<br>as a statutory matter, it should be subject to lesser penalties than crack&para;<br>or freebase.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPIERRE v.

Accordingly, we reject DePierre’s suggestion that the term “cocaine base” as used in&para;<br>clause (iii) must be given the same definition as it has&para;<br>under the Guidelines.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Finally, DePierre argues that, because §841(b)(1) is at&para;<br>the very least ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to&para;<br>interpret the statute in his favor.

United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks and alterations omitted). Applying the&para;<br>normal rules of statutory construction in this case, it is&para;<br>clear that Congress used the term “cocaine base” in clause&para;<br>(iii) to penalize more severely not only offenses involving&para;<br>“crack cocaine,” but those involving substances containing&para;<br>chemically basic cocaine more generally. There is no per&para;<br>suasive justification for reading the statute otherwise.&para;<br>Because the statutory text allows us to make far more&para;<br>than “a guess as to what Congress intended,” Reno v.&para;<br>Koray, 515 U.
