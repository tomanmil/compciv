He nonetheless filed a proposed class action in New Jersey Superior Court, alleging that Oxford failed to fully and promptly pay him and other&para;<br>physicians with similar Oxford contracts. On Oxford’s motion, the&para;<br>court compelled arbitration. The parties agreed that the arbitrator&para;<br>should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration,&para;<br>and he concluded that it did. Oxford filed a motion in federal court to&para;<br>vacate the arbitrator’s decision, claiming that he had “exceeded [his]&para;<br>powers” under §10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9&para;<br>U.

S., at 671. Because the&para;<br>parties “bargained for the arbitrator’s construction of their agreement,” an arbitral decision “even arguably construing or applying the&para;<br>contract” must stand, regardless of a court’s view of its (de)merits.&para;<br>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.

SUTTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Thus, the sole question on judicial review is whether the arbitrator&para;<br>interpreted the parties’ contract, not whether he construed it correctly. Here, the arbitrator twice did what the parties asked: He considered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to&para;<br>permit class proceedings. That suffices to show that he did not exceed his powers under §10(a)(4). Pp. 4−6.&para;<br>(b) Stolt-Neilsen does not support Oxford’s contrary view. There,&para;<br>the parties stipulated that they had not reached an agreement on&para;<br>class arbitration, so the arbitrators did not construe the contract, and&para;<br>did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings. This&para;<br>Court thus found not that they had misinterpreted the contract but&para;<br>that they had abandoned their interpretive role. Here, in stark contrast, the arbitrator did construe the contract, and did find an&para;<br>agreement to permit class arbitration. So to overturn his decision,&para;<br>this Court would have to find that he misapprehended the parties’ intent. But §10(a)(4) bars that course: It permits courts to vacate an&para;<br>arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated&para;<br>task of interpreting a contract, not when he performed that task&para;<br>poorly.

See Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds&para;<br>Int’l Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 684 (2010). In this case, an&para;<br>arbitrator found that the parties’ contract provided for&para;<br>class arbitration. The question presented is whether in&para;<br>doing so he “exceeded [his] powers” under §10(a)(4) of the&para;<br>Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq.&para;<br>We conclude that the arbitrator’s decision survives the&para;<br>limited judicial review §10(a)(4) allows.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent John Sutter, a pediatrician, entered into a&para;<br>contract with petitioner Oxford Health Plans, a health insurance company. Sutter agreed to provide medical care&para;<br>to members of Oxford’s network, and Oxford agreed to pay&para;<br>for those services at prescribed rates. Several years later,&para;<br>Sutter filed suit against Oxford in New Jersey Superior&para;<br>Court on behalf of himself and a proposed class of other&para;<br>New Jersey physicians under contract with Oxford.

SUTTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>prompt payment to the doctors, in violation of their agreements and various state laws.&para;<br>Oxford moved to compel arbitration of Sutter’s claims,&para;<br>relying on the following clause in their contract:&para;<br>“No civil action concerning any dispute arising under&para;<br>this Agreement shall be instituted before any court,&para;<br>and all such disputes shall be submitted to final and&para;<br>binding arbitration in New Jersey, pursuant to the&para;<br>rules of the American Arbitration Association with&para;<br>one arbitrator.” App. 15–16.&para;<br>The state court granted Oxford’s motion, thus referring&para;<br>the suit to arbitration.&para;<br>The parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide&para;<br>whether their contract authorized class arbitration, and&para;<br>he determined that it did. Noting that the question&para;<br>turned on “construction of the parties’ agreement,” the&para;<br>arbitrator focused on the text of the arbitration clause&para;<br>quoted above. Id., at 30. He reasoned that the clause sent&para;<br>to arbitration “the same universal class of disputes” that it&para;<br>barred the parties from bringing “as civil actions” in court:&para;<br>The “intent of the clause” was “to vest in the arbitration&para;<br>process everything that is prohibited from the court process.” Id., at 31. And a class action, the arbitrator continued, “is plainly one of the possible forms of civil action that&para;<br>could be brought in a court” absent the agreement. Ibid.&para;<br>Accordingly, he concluded that “on its face, the arbitration&para;<br>clause . . . expresses the parties’ intent that class arbitration can be maintained.” Id., at 32.&para;<br>Oxford filed a motion in federal court to vacate the&para;<br>arbitrator’s decision on the ground that he had “exceeded&para;<br>[his] powers” under §10(a)(4) of the FAA. The District&para;<br>Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Third Circuit affirmed. See 05–CV–2198, 2005 WL&para;<br>6795061 (D NJ, Oct. 31, 2005), aff ’d, 227 Fed. Appx. 135&para;<br>(2007).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>While the arbitration proceeded, this Court held in&para;<br>Stolt-Nielsen that “a party may not be compelled under&para;<br>the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a&para;<br>contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to&para;<br>do so.” 559 U. S., at 684. The parties in Stolt-Nielsen&para;<br>had stipulated that they had never reached an agreement&para;<br>on class arbitration. Relying on §10(a)(4), we vacated the&para;<br>arbitrators’ decision approving class proceedings because,&para;<br>in the absence of such an agreement, the arbitrators had&para;<br>“simply . . . imposed [their] own view of sound policy.” Id.,&para;<br>at 672.&para;<br>Oxford immediately asked the arbitrator to reconsider&para;<br>his decision on class arbitration in light of Stolt-Nielsen.&para;<br>The arbitrator issued a new opinion holding that StoltNielsen had no effect on the case because this agreement&para;<br>authorized class arbitration. Unlike in Stolt-Nielsen, the&para;<br>arbitrator explained, the parties here disputed the meaning of their contract; he had therefore been required “to&para;<br>construe the arbitration clause in the ordinary way to&para;<br>glean the parties’ intent.” App. 72. And in performing&para;<br>that task, the arbitrator continued, he had “found that&para;<br>the arbitration clause unambiguously evinced an intention&para;<br>to allow class arbitration.” Id., at 70. The arbitrator concluded by reconfirming his reasons for so construing the&para;<br>clause.&para;<br>Oxford then returned to federal court, renewing its&para;<br>effort to vacate the arbitrator’s decision under §10(a)(4).&para;<br>Once again, the District Court denied the motion, and the&para;<br>Third Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals first underscored the limited scope of judicial review that §10(a)(4)&para;<br>allows: So long as an arbitrator “makes a good faith attempt” to interpret a contract, “even serious errors of law&para;<br>or fact will not subject his award to vacatur.” 675 F. 3d&para;<br>215, 220 (2012). Oxford could not prevail under that&para;<br>standard, the court held, because the arbitrator had “endeavored to give effect to the parties’ intent” and “articu-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>late[d] a contractual basis for his decision.” Id., at&para;<br>223–224. Oxford’s objections to the ruling were “simply&para;<br>dressed-up arguments that the arbitrator interpreted its&para;<br>agreement erroneously.” Id., at 224.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to address&para;<br>a circuit split on whether §10(a)(4) allows a court to vacate&para;<br>an arbitral award in similar circumstances.1 Holding that&para;<br>it does not, we affirm the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Under the FAA, courts may vacate an arbitrator’s decision “only in very unusual circumstances.” First Options&para;<br>of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 942 (1995).&para;<br>That limited judicial review, we have explained, “maintain[s] arbitration’s essential virtue of resolving disputes&para;<br>straightaway.” Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel,&para;<br>Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 588 (2008). If parties could take&para;<br>“full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals,” arbitration would&para;<br>become “merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and timeconsuming judicial review process.” Ibid.&para;<br>Here, Oxford invokes §10(a)(4) of the Act, which authorizes a federal court to set aside an arbitral award “where&para;<br>the arbitrator[] exceeded [his] powers.” A party seeking&para;<br>relief under that provision bears a heavy burden. “It is&para;<br>not enough . . . to show that the [arbitrator] committed an&para;<br>error—or even a serious error.” Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S.,&para;<br>at 671. Because the parties “bargained for the arbitrator’s construction of their agreement,” an arbitral decision&para;<br>“even arguably construing or applying the contract” must&para;<br>stand, regardless of a court’s view of its (de)merits.

Only if “the arbitrator act[s] outside the scope&para;<br>of his contractually delegated authority”—issuing an&para;<br>award that “simply reflect[s] [his] own notions of [economic]&para;<br>justice” rather than “draw[ing] its essence from the contract”—may a court overturn his determination. Eastern&para;<br>Associated Coal, 531 U. S., at 62 (quoting Misco, 484 U. S.,&para;<br>at 38). So the sole question for us is whether the arbitrator (even arguably) interpreted the parties’ contract, not&para;<br>whether he got its meaning right or wrong.2&para;<br>And we have already all but answered that question just&para;<br>by summarizing the arbitrator’s decisions, see supra, at 2–&para;<br>3; they are, through and through, interpretations of the&para;<br>parties’ agreement. The arbitrator’s first ruling recited&para;<br>the “question of construction” the parties had submitted&para;<br>to him: “whether [their] Agreement allows for class action&para;<br>arbitration.” App. 29–30. To resolve that matter, the&para;<br>arbitrator focused on the arbitration clause’s text, analyz——————&para;<br>2 We would face a different issue if Oxford had argued below that the&para;<br>availability of class arbitration is a so-called “question of arbitrability.”&para;<br>Those questions—which “include certain gateway matters, such as&para;<br>whether parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether&para;<br>a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of&para;<br>controversy”—are presumptively for courts to decide. Green Tree&para;<br>Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>A court may therefore review an arbitrator’s determination of such a&para;<br>matter de novo absent “clear[] and unmistakabl[e]” evidence that the&para;<br>parties wanted an arbitrator to resolve the dispute. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986). StoltNielsen made clear that this Court has not yet decided whether the&para;<br>availability of class arbitration is a question of arbitrability. See 559&para;<br>U. S., at 680. But this case gives us no opportunity to do so because&para;<br>Oxford agreed that the arbitrator should determine whether its contract with Sutter authorized class procedures. See Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>38, n. 9 (conceding this point). Indeed, Oxford submitted that issue to&para;<br>the arbitrator not once, but twice—and the second time after StoltNielsen flagged that it might be a question of arbitrability.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing (whether correctly or not makes no difference) the&para;<br>scope of both what it barred from court and what it sent&para;<br>to arbitration. The arbitrator concluded, based on that&para;<br>textual exegesis, that the clause “on its face . . . expresses&para;<br>the parties’ intent that class action arbitration can be&para;<br>maintained.” Id., at 32. When Oxford requested reconsideration in light of Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator explained&para;<br>that his prior decision was “concerned solely with the parties’ intent as evidenced by the words of the arbitration&para;<br>clause itself.” App. 69. He then ran through his textual&para;<br>analysis again, and reiterated his conclusion: “[T]he text of&para;<br>the clause itself authorizes” class arbitration. Id., at 73.&para;<br>Twice, then, the arbitrator did what the parties had asked:&para;<br>He considered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to permit class proceedings. That&para;<br>suffices to show that the arbitrator did not “exceed[ ] [his]&para;<br>powers.” §10(a)(4).&para;<br>Oxford’s contrary view relies principally on StoltNielsen. As noted earlier, we found there that an arbitration panel exceeded its powers under §10(a)(4) when it&para;<br>ordered a party to submit to class arbitration. See supra,&para;<br>at 3. Oxford takes that decision to mean that “even the&para;<br>‘high hurdle’ of Section 10(a)(4) review is overcome when&para;<br>an arbitrator imposes class arbitration without a sufficient&para;<br>contractual basis.” Reply Brief 5 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen,&para;<br>559 U. S., at 671). Under Stolt-Nielson, Oxford asserts, a&para;<br>court may thus vacate “as ultra vires” an arbitral decision&para;<br>like this one for misconstruing a contract to approve class&para;<br>proceedings. Reply Brief 7.&para;<br>But Oxford misreads Stolt-Nielsen: We overturned the&para;<br>arbitral decision there because it lacked any contractual&para;<br>basis for ordering class procedures, not because it lacked,&para;<br>in Oxford’s terminology, a “sufficient” one. The parties in&para;<br>Stolt-Nielsen had entered into an unusual stipulation that&para;<br>they had never reached an agreement on class arbitration.&para;<br>See 559 U. S., at 668–669, 673. In that circumstance, we&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>noted, the panel’s decision was not—indeed, could not&para;<br>have been—“based on a determination regarding the&para;<br>parties’ intent.” Id., at 673, n. 4; see id., at 676 (“Th[e]&para;<br>stipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties’ intent”). Nor, we continued, did the panel attempt to&para;<br>ascertain whether federal or state law established a “default rule” to take effect absent an agreement. Id., at 673.&para;<br>Instead, “the panel simply imposed its own conception of&para;<br>sound policy” when it ordered class proceedings. Id., at&para;<br>675. But “the task of an arbitrator,” we stated, “is to&para;<br>interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy.”&para;<br>Id., at 672. In “impos[ing] its own policy choice,” the&para;<br>panel “thus exceeded its powers.” Id., at 677.&para;<br>The contrast with this case is stark. In Stolt-Nielsen,&para;<br>the arbitrators did not construe the parties’ contract, and&para;<br>did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings. So in setting aside the arbitrators’ decision, we&para;<br>found not that they had misinterpreted the contract, but&para;<br>that they had abandoned their interpretive role. Here, the&para;<br>arbitrator did construe the contract (focusing, per usual,&para;<br>on its language), and did find an agreement to permit&para;<br>class arbitration. So to overturn his decision, we would&para;<br>have to rely on a finding that he misapprehended the parties’ intent. But §10(a)(4) bars that course: It permits&para;<br>courts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated task of interpreting a&para;<br>contract, not when he performed that task poorly. StoltNielsen and this case thus fall on opposite sides of the line&para;<br>that §10(a)(4) draws to delimit judicial review of arbitral&para;<br>decisions.&para;<br>The remainder of Oxford’s argument addresses merely&para;<br>the merits: The arbitrator, Oxford contends at length,&para;<br>badly misunderstood the contract’s arbitration clause. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 21–28. The key text, again, goes as&para;<br>follows: “No civil action concerning any dispute arising&para;<br>under this Agreement shall be instituted before any court,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and all such disputes shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.” App. 15–16. The arbitrator thought that&para;<br>clause sent to arbitration all “civil action[s]” barred from&para;<br>court, and viewed class actions as falling within that&para;<br>category. See supra, at 2. But Oxford points out that the&para;<br>provision submits to arbitration not any “civil action[s],”&para;<br>but instead any “dispute arising under” the agreement.&para;<br>And in any event, Oxford claims, a class action is not a&para;<br>form of “civil action,” as the arbitrator thought, but merely&para;<br>a procedural device that may be available in a court. At&para;<br>bottom, Oxford maintains, this is a garden-variety arbitration clause, lacking any of the terms or features that&para;<br>would indicate an agreement to use class procedures.&para;<br>We reject this argument because, and only because, it is&para;<br>not properly addressed to a court. Nothing we say in this&para;<br>opinion should be taken to reflect any agreement with the&para;<br>arbitrator’s contract interpretation, or any quarrel with&para;<br>Oxford’s contrary reading. All we say is that convincing a&para;<br>court of an arbitrator’s error—even his grave error—is not&para;<br>enough. So long as the arbitrator was “arguably construing” the contract—which this one was—a court may not&para;<br>correct his mistakes under §10(a)(4). Eastern Associated&para;<br>Coal, 531 U. S., at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The potential for those mistakes is the price of agreeing&para;<br>to arbitration. As we have held before, we hold again: “It&para;<br>is the arbitrator’s construction [of the contract] which was&para;<br>bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator’s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no&para;<br>business overruling him because their interpretation of&para;<br>the contract is different from his.” Enterprise Wheel, 363&para;<br>U. S. at 599. The arbitrator’s construction holds, however&para;<br>good, bad, or ugly.&para;<br>In sum, Oxford chose arbitration, and it must now live&para;<br>with that choice. Oxford agreed with Sutter that an arbitrator should determine what their contract meant, including whether its terms approved class arbitration. The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

His interpretation went against Oxford, maybe&para;<br>mistakenly so. But still, Oxford does not get to rerun&para;<br>the matter in a court. Under §10(a)(4), the question for a&para;<br>judge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties’&para;<br>contract correctly, but whether he construed it at all.&para;<br>Because he did, and therefore did not “exceed his powers,”&para;<br>we cannot give Oxford the relief it wants.
