YOUSUF ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1555. Argued March 3, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010&para;<br>Respondents, who were persecuted by the Somali government during&para;<br>the 1980’s, filed a damages action alleging that petitioner, who then&para;<br>held high level government positions, exercised command and control&para;<br>over the military forces committing the abuses; that he knew or&para;<br>should have known of these acts; and that he aided and abetted in&para;<br>their commission. The District Court concluded that it lacked sub&para;<br>ject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner’s motion to dismiss the&para;<br>suit, resting its decision on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of&para;<br>1976 (FSIA or Act), which provides that a “foreign state shall be im&para;<br>mune from the jurisdiction” of both federal and state courts except as&para;<br>provided in the Act, 28 U. S. C. §1604. The Fourth Circuit reversed,&para;<br>holding that the FSIA does not apply to officials of a foreign state.&para;<br>Held: The FSIA does not govern petitioner’s claim of immunity. Pp. 4–&para;<br>20.&para;<br>(a) Under the common-law doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity,&para;<br>see Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, if the State De&para;<br>partment granted a sovereign’s diplomatic request for a “suggestion&para;<br>of immunity,” the district court surrendered its jurisdiction, Ex parte&para;<br>Peru, 318 U. S. 573, 581, 587. If the State Department refused, the&para;<br>court could decide the immunity issue itself. Id., at 587. In 1952, the&para;<br>State Department moved from a policy of requesting immunity in&para;<br>most actions against friendly sovereigns to a “restrictive” theory that&para;<br>confined immunity “to suits involving the foreign sovereign’s public&para;<br>acts.” Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 487.&para;<br>Inconsistent application of sovereign immunity followed, leading to&para;<br>the FSIA, whose primary purposes are (1) to endorse and codify the&para;<br>restrictive theory, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for decid&para;<br>ing “claims of foreign states to immunity” from the State Department&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to the courts. §1602. This Act now governs the determination&para;<br>whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest that&para;<br>“foreign state” should be read to include an official acting on behalf of&para;<br>that state. The Act specifies that a foreign state “includes a political&para;<br>subdivision . . . or an agency or instrumentality” of that state,&para;<br>§1603(a), and specifically delimits what counts as an “agency or in&para;<br>strumentality,” §1603(b). Textual clues in the “agency or instrumen&para;<br>tality” definition—“any entity” matching three specified characteris&para;<br>tics, ibid.—cut against reading it to include a foreign official.&para;<br>“Entity” typically refers to an organization; and the required statu&para;<br>tory characteristics—e.g., “separate legal person,” §1603(b)(1)—apply&para;<br>awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. Section 1603(a)’s “foreign state”&para;<br>definition is also inapplicable. The list set out there, even if illustra&para;<br>tive rather than exclusive, does not suggest that officials are in&para;<br>cluded, since the listed defendants are all entities. The Court’s con&para;<br>clusion is also supported by the fact that Congress expressly&para;<br>mentioned officials elsewhere in the FSIA when it wished to count&para;<br>their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state. Moreover, other&para;<br>FSIA provisions—e.g., §1608(a)—point away from reading “foreign&para;<br>state” to include foreign officials. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(c) The FSIA’s history and purposes also do not support petitioner’s&para;<br>argument that the Act governs his immunity claim. There is little&para;<br>reason to presume that when Congress codified state immunity, it in&para;<br>tended to codify, sub silentio, official immunity. The canon of con&para;<br>struction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the&para;<br>common law does not help decide the question whether, when a stat&para;<br>ute’s coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended it to govern a par&para;<br>ticular field. State and official immunities may not be coextensive,&para;<br>and historically, the Government has suggested common-law immu&para;<br>nity for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qual&para;<br>ify. Though a foreign state’s immunity may, in some circumstances,&para;<br>extend to an individual for official acts, it does not follow that Con&para;<br>gress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA. Official immu&para;<br>nity was simply not the problem that Congress was addressing when&para;<br>enacting that Act. The Court’s construction of the Act should not be&para;<br>affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt&para;<br>to select between application of the FSIA or the common law. This&para;<br>case, where respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity&para;<br>and seek damages from his own pockets, is governed by the common&para;<br>law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as defined by the&para;<br>FSIA.

S. C. §1604,&para;<br>and the District Court noted that none of the parties had&para;<br>argued that any exception was applicable, App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 46a–47a. Although characterizing the statute as&para;<br>silent on its applicability to the officials of a foreign state,&para;<br>the District Court followed appellate decisions holding&para;<br>that a foreign state’s sovereign immunity under the Act&para;<br>extends to “ ‘an individual acting in his official capacity on&para;<br>behalf of a foreign state,’ ” but not to “ ‘an official who acts&para;<br>beyond the scope of his authority.’ ” Id., at 47a (quoting&para;<br>Velasco v. Government of Indonesia, 370 F. 3d 392, 398,&para;<br>399 (CA4 2004)). The court rejected respondents’ argu&para;<br>ment that petitioner was necessarily acting beyond the&para;<br>scope of his authority because he allegedly violated inter&para;<br>national law.3&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District&para;<br>Court’s ruling that the FSIA governs petitioner’s immu&para;<br>nity from suit. It acknowledged “the majority view”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Petitioner&para;<br>&para;<br>argued that, in addition to his immunity under the FSIA,&para;<br>the complaint should be dismissed on a number of other grounds, which&para;<br>the District Court did not reach. See id., at 45a, n. 11.&para;<br>3 Because we hold that the FSIA does not govern whether an individ&para;<br>ual foreign official enjoys immunity from suit, we need not reach&para;<br>respondents’ argument that an official is not immune under the FSIA&para;<br>for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. See Brief for Respondents&para;<br>51–53. We note that in determining petitioner had not acted beyond&para;<br>the scope of his authority, the District Court afforded great weight to&para;<br>letters from the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to the&para;<br>State Department, App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a, in which the TFG sup&para;<br>ported petitioner’s claim of immunity and stated “the actions attributed&para;<br>to [petitioner] in the lawsuit . . . would have been taken by [petitioner]&para;<br>in his official capacities,” App. 104. Although the District Court de&para;<br>scribed the TFG as “recognized by the United States as the governing&para;<br>body in Somalia,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a, the United States does not&para;<br>recognize the TFG (or any other entity) as the government of Somalia,&para;<br>see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v.

See 552 F. 3d, at 381–383. Because we agree with the Court of&para;<br>Appeals on its broader ground that individual officials are not covered&para;<br>by the FSIA, petitioner’s status as a former official is irrelevant to our&para;<br>analysis.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>foreign sovereigns.” The Court’s specific holding in Schoo&para;<br>ner Exchange was that a federal court lacked jurisdiction&para;<br>over “a national armed vessel . . . of the emperor of&para;<br>France,” id., at 146, but the opinion was interpreted as&para;<br>extending virtually absolute immunity to foreign sover&para;<br>eigns as “a matter of grace and comity,” Verlinden, 461&para;<br>U. S., at 486.&para;<br>Following Schooner Exchange, a two-step procedure&para;<br>developed for resolving a foreign state’s claim of sovereign&para;<br>immunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels.&para;<br>See, e.g., Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34–&para;<br>36 (1945); Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 587–589 (1943);&para;<br>Compania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A. v. The&para;<br>Navemar, 303 U.

Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 581. If the request&para;<br>was granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdic&para;<br>tion. Id., at 588; see also Hoffman, 324 U. S., at 34. But&para;<br>“in the absence of recognition of the immunity by the&para;<br>Department of State,” a district court “had authority to&para;<br>decide for itself whether all the requisites for such immu&para;<br>nity existed.” Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 587; see also&para;<br>Compania Espanola, 303 U. S., at 75 (approving judicial&para;<br>inquiry into sovereign immunity when the “Department of&para;<br>State . . . declined to act”); Heaney v. Government of Spain,&para;<br>445 F. 2d 501, 503, and n. 2 (CA2 1971) (evaluating sov&para;<br>ereign immunity when the State Department had not&para;<br>responded to a request for its views). In making that&para;<br>decision, a district court inquired “whether the ground of&para;<br>immunity is one which it is the established policy of the&para;<br>[State Department] to recognize.” Hoffman, 324 U. S., at&para;<br>36. Although cases involving individual foreign officials as&para;<br>defendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was&para;<br>typically followed when a foreign official asserted immu&para;<br>nity. See, e.g., Heaney, 445 F. 2d, at 504–505; Waltier v.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Thomson, 189 F. Supp. 319 (SDNY 1960).6&para;<br>Prior to 1952, the State Department followed a general&para;<br>practice of requesting immunity in all actions against&para;<br>friendly sovereigns, but in that year the Department&para;<br>announced its adoption of the “restrictive” theory of sover&para;<br>eign immunity. Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486–487; see also&para;<br>Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Depart&para;<br>ment of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B.&para;<br>Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull.&para;<br>984–985 (1952). Under this theory, “immunity is confined&para;<br>to suits involving the foreign sovereign’s public acts, and&para;<br>does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state’s&para;<br>strictly commercial acts.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487.&para;<br>This change threw “immunity determinations into some&para;<br>disarray,” because “political considerations sometimes led&para;<br>the Department to file ‘suggestions of immunity in cases&para;<br>where immunity would not have been available under the&para;<br>restrictive theory.’ ” Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541&para;<br>U. S. 677, 690 (2004) (quoting Verlinden, 461 U.

S., at 690–691; see also Verlinden, 461&para;<br>U. S., at 487–488. Section 1602 describes the Act’s two&para;<br>primary purposes: (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive&para;<br>theory of sovereign immunity, and (2) to transfer primary&para;<br>responsibility for deciding “claims of foreign states to&para;<br>immunity” from the State Department to the courts.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Diplomatic&para;<br>&para;<br>and consular officers could also claim the “specialized&para;<br>immunities” accorded those officials, Restatement (Second) of Foreign&para;<br>Relations Law of the United States §66, Comment b (1964–1965)&para;<br>(hereinafter Restatement), and officials qualifying as the “head of state”&para;<br>could claim immunity on that basis, see Schooner Exchange v. McFad&para;<br>don, 7 Cranch 116, 137 (1812) (describing “the exemption of the person&para;<br>of the sovereign” from “a jurisdiction incompatible with his dignity”).&para;<br>7 The full text of §1602, entitled “Findings and declaration of pur&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

See, e.g., Re&para;<br>statement §4 (defining “state” as “an entity that has a&para;<br>defined territory and population under the control of a&para;<br>government and that engages in foreign relations”). In&para;<br>§1603(a), however, the Act establishes that “foreign state”&para;<br>has a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the&para;<br>state’s political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentali&para;<br>ties. Then, in §1603(b), the Act specifically delimits what&para;<br>counts as an agency or instrumentality. Petitioner argues&para;<br>that either “foreign state,” §1603(a), or “agency or instru&para;<br>mentality,” §1603(b), could be read to include a foreign&para;<br>official. Although we agree that petitioner’s interpretation&para;<br>is literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory&para;<br>text persuades us that petitioner’s reading is not the&para;<br>meaning that Congress enacted.&para;<br>We turn first to the term “agency or instrumentality of a&para;<br>foreign state,” §1603(b).

But Congress&para;<br>has specifically defined “agency or instrumentality” in the&para;<br>FSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut&para;<br>against such a broad construction.&para;<br>First, the statute specifies that “ ‘agency or instrumen&para;<br>tality . . .’ means any entity” matching three specified&para;<br>characteristics, §1603(b) (emphasis added), and “entity”&para;<br>typically refers to an organization, rather than an individ&para;<br>ual. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009).&para;<br>Furthermore, several of the required characteristics apply&para;<br>awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. The phrase “separate&para;<br>legal person, corporate or otherwise,” §1603(b)(1), could&para;<br>conceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of&para;<br>the word “person.” But the phrase “separate legal person”&para;<br>typically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to&para;<br>hold personhood separate from the natural persons who&para;<br>are its shareholders or officers. Cf. First Nat. City Bank v.&para;<br>Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611,&para;<br>625 (1983) (“Separate legal personality has been described&para;<br>as ‘an almost indispensable aspect of the public corpora&para;<br>tion’ ”). It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an&para;<br>“organ” of the foreign state. See §1603(b)(2). And the&para;<br>third part of the definition could not be applied at all to a&para;<br>natural person. A natural person cannot be a citizen of a&para;<br>State “as defined in section 1332(c) and (e),” §1603(b)(3),&para;<br>because those subsections refer to the citizenship of corpo&para;<br>rations and estates. Nor can a natural person be “created&para;<br>under the laws of any third country.” Ibid.8 Thus, the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Petitioner&para;<br>&para;<br>points out that §1603(b)(3) describes only which defen&para;<br>dants cannot be agencies or instrumentalities. He suggests that it&para;<br>therefore tells us nothing about which defendants can be covered by&para;<br>that term. Brief for Petitioner 46. Even if so, reading §1603(b) as&para;<br>petitioner suggests would leave us with the odd result that a corpora&para;<br>tion that is the citizen of a state is excluded from the definition under&para;<br>§1603(b)(3), and thus not immune, whereas a natural person who is the&para;<br>citizen of a state is not excluded, and thus retains his immunity.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v.

See Brief for Petitioner 22–23. It is true that use of&para;<br>the word “include” can signal that the list that follows is&para;<br>meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.10 And, to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Nor does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress&para;<br>intended the term “agency or instrumentality” to include individuals.&para;<br>On the contrary, the legislative history, like the statute, speaks in&para;<br>terms of entities.

But even if the list in §1603(a)&para;<br>is merely illustrative, it still suggests that “foreign state”&para;<br>does not encompass officials, because the types of defen&para;<br>dants listed are all entities. See Russell Motor Car Co. v.&para;<br>United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923) (“[A] word may be&para;<br>known by the company it keeps”).&para;<br>Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly&para;<br>mentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as&para;<br>equivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests&para;<br>that officials are not included within the unadorned term&para;<br>“foreign state.” Cf. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.&para;<br>85, 103 (2007) (“Drawing meaning from silence is particu&para;<br>larly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it&para;<br>knows how to [address an issue] in express terms”). For&para;<br>example, Congress provided an exception from the general&para;<br>grant of immunity for cases in which “money damages are&para;<br>sought against a foreign state” for an injury in the United&para;<br>States “caused by the tortious act or omission of that&para;<br>foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign&para;<br>state while acting within the scope of his office.”&para;<br>§1605(a)(5) (emphasis added). The same reference to&para;<br>officials is made in a similar, later enacted exception. See&para;<br>28 U. S. C. A. §1605A(a)(1) (Supp. 2009) (eliminating&para;<br>immunity for suits “in which money damages are sought&para;<br>against a foreign state” for certain acts “engaged in by an&para;<br>official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while&para;<br>acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or&para;<br>agency”); see also §1605A(c) (creating a cause of action&para;<br>against the “foreign state” and “any official, employee, or&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>§47.7, p. 305 (7th ed. 2007) (“[T]he word ‘includes’ is usually a term of &para;<br>&para;<br>enlargement, and not of limitation” (some internal quotation marks&para;<br>&para;<br>omitted)). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v.

S., at 476–477 (“[W]e should not construe the&para;<br>statute in a manner that is strained and, at the same&para;<br>time, would render a statutory term superfluous”).&para;<br>Other provisions of the statute also point away from&para;<br>reading “foreign state” to include foreign officials. Con&para;<br>gress made no express mention of service of process on&para;<br>individuals in §1608(a), which governs service upon a&para;<br>foreign state or political subdivision. Although some of the&para;<br>methods listed could be used to serve individuals—for&para;<br>example, by delivery “in accordance with an applicable&para;<br>international convention,” §1608(a)(2)—the methods&para;<br>specified are at best very roundabout ways of serving an&para;<br>individual official. Furthermore, Congress made specific&para;<br>remedial choices for different types of defendants. See&para;<br>§1606 (allowing punitive damages for an agency or in&para;<br>strumentality but not for a foreign state); §1610 (affording&para;<br>a plaintiff greater rights to attach the property of an&para;<br>agency or instrumentality as compared to the property of a&para;<br>foreign state). By adopting petitioner’s reading of “foreign&para;<br>state,” we would subject claims against officials to the&para;<br>more limited remedies available in suits against states,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Petitioner argues that §1605A abrogates immunity for certain acts&para;<br>by individual officials, which would be superfluous if the officials were&para;<br>not otherwise immune. See Brief for Petitioner 41–43. But the import&para;<br>of §1605A is precisely the opposite. First, §1605A(a)(1) eliminates the&para;<br>immunity of the state for certain acts of its officers; it says a “foreign&para;<br>state shall not be immune” in a suit “in which money damages are&para;<br>sought against a foreign state.” As it does not expressly refer to the&para;<br>immunity of individual officers, it adds nothing to petitioner’s argu&para;<br>ment. Second, the creation of a cause of action against both the “for&para;<br>eign state” and “any official, employee, or agent” thereof, §1605A(c),&para;<br>reinforces the idea that “foreign state” does not by definition include&para;<br>foreign officials.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>without so much as a whisper from Congress on the sub&para;<br>ject. (And if we were instead to adopt petitioner’s other&para;<br>textual argument, we would subject those claims to the&para;<br>different, more expansive, remedial scheme for agencies).&para;<br>The Act’s careful calibration of remedies among the listed&para;<br>types of defendants suggests that Congress did not mean&para;<br>to cover other types of defendants never mentioned in the&para;<br>text.&para;<br>In sum, “[w]e do not . . . construe statutory phrases in&para;<br>isolation; we read statutes as a whole.” United States v.&para;<br>Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984). Reading the FSIA as a&para;<br>whole, there is nothing to suggest we should read “foreign&para;<br>state” in §1603(a) to include an official acting on behalf of&para;<br>the foreign state, and much to indicate that this meaning&para;<br>was not what Congress enacted.12 The text does not ex&para;<br>pressly foreclose petitioner’s reading, but it supports the&para;<br>view of respondents and the United States that the Act&para;<br>does not address an official’s claim to immunity.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Petitioner argues that the FSIA is best read to cover his&para;<br>claim to immunity because of its history and purpose. As&para;<br>discussed at the outset, one of the primary purposes of the&para;<br>FSIA was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign&para;<br>immunity, which Congress recognized as consistent with&para;<br>extant international law. See §1602. We have observed&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Nor&para;<br>&para;<br>is it the case that the FSIA’s “legislative history does not even&para;<br>hint of an intent to exclude individual officials,” Chuidian, 912 F. 2d, at&para;<br>1101. The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend&para;<br>the FSIA to address position-based individual immunities such as&para;<br>diplomatic and consular immunity. H. R. Rep., at 12 (“The bill is not&para;<br>intended . . . . to affect either diplomatic or consular immunity”). It also&para;<br>suggests that general “official immunity” is something separate from&para;<br>the subject of the bill. See id., at 23 (“The bill does not attempt to deal&para;<br>with questions of discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a&para;<br>diplomat in the United States or a high-ranking official of a foreign&para;<br>government, diplomatic and official immunity would apply”).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v.

Because of this relationship&para;<br>between the Act and the common law that it codified,&para;<br>petitioner argues that we should construe the FSIA con&para;<br>sistently with the common law regarding individual im&para;<br>munity, which—in petitioner’s view—was coextensive with&para;<br>the law of state immunity and always immunized a for&para;<br>eign official for acts taken on behalf of the foreign state.&para;<br>Even reading the Act in light of Congress’ purpose of&para;<br>codifying state sovereign immunity, however, we do not&para;<br>think that the Act codified the common law with respect to&para;<br>the immunity of individual officials.&para;<br>The canon of construction that statutes should be inter&para;<br>preted consistently with the common law helps us inter&para;<br>pret a statute that clearly covers a field formerly governed&para;<br>by the common law.13 But the canon does not help us to&para;<br>decide the antecedent question whether, when a statute’s&para;<br>coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended the statute to&para;<br>govern a particular field—in this case, whether Congress&para;<br>intended the FSIA to supersede the common law of official&para;<br>immunity.14&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Congress “is understood to legislate against a background of com&para;<br>mon-law . . . principles,” Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino,&para;<br>501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991), and when a statute covers an issue previ&para;<br>ously governed by the common law, we interpret the statute with the&para;<br>presumption that Congress intended to retain the substance of the&para;<br>common law. See Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952)&para;<br>(“Statutes which invade the common law . . . are to be read with a&para;<br>presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar&para;<br>principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident”).&para;<br>14 We find similarly inapposite petitioner’s invocation of the canon&para;<br>that a statute should be interpreted in compliance with international&para;<br>law, see Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804),&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner argues that because state and official immu&para;<br>nities are coextensive, Congress must have codified official&para;<br>immunity when it codified state immunity. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 26–30. But the relationship between a state’s&para;<br>immunity and an official’s immunity is more complicated&para;<br>than petitioner suggests, although we need not and do not&para;<br>resolve the dispute among the parties as to the precise&para;<br>scope of an official’s immunity at common law. The very&para;<br>authority to which petitioner points us, and which we have&para;<br>previously found instructive, see, e.g., Permanent Mission,&para;<br>551 U. S., at 200, states that the immunity of individual&para;<br>officials is subject to a caveat not applicable to any of the&para;<br>other entities or persons15 to which the foreign state’s&para;<br>immunity extends. The Restatement provides that the&para;<br>“immunity of a foreign state . . . extends to . . . any other&para;<br>public minister, official, or agent of the state with respect&para;<br>to acts performed in his official capacity if the effect of&para;<br>exercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law&para;<br>against the state.” Restatement §66 (emphasis added).16&para;<br>——————&para;<br>and his argument that foreign relations and the reciprocal protection of&para;<br>United States officials abroad would be undermined if we do not adopt&para;<br>his reading of the Act. Because we are not deciding that the FSIA bars&para;<br>petitioner’s immunity but rather that the Act does not address the&para;<br>question, we need not determine whether declining to afford immunity&para;<br>to petitioner would be consistent with international law.&para;<br>15 The Restatement does not apply this caveat to the head of state,&para;<br>head of government, or foreign minister. See Restatement §66.&para;<br>Whether petitioner may be entitled to head of state immunity, or any&para;<br>other immunity, under the common law is a question we leave open for&para;<br>remand. See 552 F. 3d 371, 383 (CA4 2009). We express no view on&para;<br>whether Restatement §66 correctly sets out the scope of the common&para;<br>law immunity applicable to current or former foreign officials.&para;<br>16 Respondents contend that this caveat refers to “the compulsive&para;<br>effect of the judgment on the state,” Brief for Respondents 42, but&para;<br>petitioner disputes that meaning, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17–18. We&para;<br>need not resolve their dispute, as it is enough for present purposes that&para;<br>the Restatement indicates a foreign official’s immunity may turn upon&para;<br>a requirement not applicable to any other type of defendant.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>And historically, the Government sometimes suggested&para;<br>immunity under the common law for individual officials&para;<br>even when the foreign state did not qualify. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Greenspan v. Crosbie, No. 74 Civ. 4734 (GLG), 1976 WL&para;<br>841 (SDNY, Nov. 23, 1976). There is therefore little rea&para;<br>son to presume that when Congress set out to codify state&para;<br>immunity, it must also have, sub silentio, intended to&para;<br>codify official immunity.&para;<br>Petitioner urges that a suit against an official must&para;<br>always be equivalent to a suit against the state because&para;<br>acts taken by a state official on behalf of a state are acts of&para;<br>the state. See Brief for Petitioner 26. We have recog&para;<br>nized, in the context of the act of state doctrine, that an&para;<br>official’s acts can be considered the acts of the foreign&para;<br>state, and that “the courts of one country will not sit in&para;<br>judgment” of those acts when done within the territory of&para;<br>the foreign state. See Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U. S.&para;<br>250, 252, 254 (1897). Although the act of state doctrine is&para;<br>distinct from immunity, and instead “provides foreign&para;<br>states with a substantive defense on the merits,” Altmann,&para;<br>541 U. S., at 700, we do not doubt that in some circum&para;<br>stances the immunity of the foreign state extends to an&para;<br>individual for acts taken in his official capacity. But it&para;<br>does not follow from this premise that Congress intended&para;<br>to codify that immunity in the FSIA. It hardly furthers&para;<br>Congress’ purpose of “clarifying the rules that judges&para;<br>should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims,” id.,&para;<br>at 699, to lump individual officials in with foreign states&para;<br>without so much as a word spelling out how and when&para;<br>individual officials are covered.17&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 The courts of appeals have had to develop, in the complete absence&para;<br>of any statutory text, rules governing when an official is entitled to&para;<br>immunity under the FSIA. For example, Courts of Appeals have&para;<br>applied the rule that foreign sovereign immunity extends to an individ&para;<br>ual official “for acts committed in his official capacity” but not to “an&para;<br>official who acts beyond the scope of his authority.” Chuidian, 912&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

But to the extent Congress contem&para;<br>plated the Act’s effect upon officials at all, the evidence&para;<br>points in the opposite direction. As we have already men&para;<br>tioned, the legislative history points toward an intent to&para;<br>leave official immunity outside the scope of the Act. See&para;<br>n. 12, supra. And although questions of official immunity&para;<br>did arise in the pre-FSIA period, they were few and far&para;<br>between.18 The immunity of officials simply was not the&para;<br>particular problem to which Congress was responding&para;<br>when it enacted the FSIA. The FSIA was adopted, rather,&para;<br>to address “a modern world where foreign state enter&para;<br>prises are every day participants in commercial activities,”&para;<br>and to assure litigants that decisions regarding claims&para;<br>against states and their enterprises “are made on purely&para;<br>legal grounds.” H. R. Rep., at 7. We have been given no&para;<br>reason to believe that Congress saw as a problem, or&para;<br>wanted to eliminate, the State Department’s role in de&para;<br>terminations regarding individual official immunity.19&para;<br>——————&para;<br>F. 2d, at 1103, 1106. That may be correct as a matter of common-law&para;<br>principles, but it does not derive from any clarification or codification&para;<br>by Congress. Furthermore, if Congress intended the FSIA to reach&para;<br>individuals, one would expect the Act to have addressed whether former&para;<br>officials are covered, an issue it settled with respect to instrumentali&para;<br>ties, see Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.

See Republic of&para;<br>Philippines v. Pimentel, 553 U. S. 851, 867 (2008)&para;<br>(“[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims&para;<br>of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action&para;<br>must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to&para;<br>the interests of the absent sovereign”). Or it may be the&para;<br>case that some actions against an official in his official&para;<br>capacity should be treated as actions against the foreign&para;<br>state itself, as the state is the real party in interest. Cf.&para;<br>Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 166 (1985) (“[A]n&para;<br>official-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to&para;<br>be treated as a suit against the entity. It is not a suit&para;<br>against the official personally, for the real party in inter&para;<br>est is the entity” (citation omitted)).&para;<br>We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the&para;<br>statute’s text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs&para;<br>may use artful pleading to attempt to select between&para;<br>application of the FSIA or the common law. And we think&para;<br>this case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his&para;<br>personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets,&para;<br>is properly governed by the common law because it is not a&para;<br>claim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term.&para;<br>Although Congress clearly intended to supersede the&para;<br>common-law regime for claims against foreign states, we&para;<br>find nothing in the statute’s origin or aims to indicate that&para;<br>Congress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign&para;<br>official immunity.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>V&para;<br>&para;<br>Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA&para;<br>leads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals cor&para;<br>rectly held the FSIA does not govern petitioner’s claim of&para;<br>immunity. The Act therefore did not deprive the District&para;<br>Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. We emphasize, how&para;<br>ever, the narrowness of our holding. Whether petitioner&para;<br>may be entitled to immunity under the common law, and&para;<br>whether he may have other valid defenses to the grave&para;<br>charges against him, are matters to be addressed in the&para;<br>first instance by the District Court on remand. The judg&para;<br>ment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §1604, does not include foreign offi&para;<br>cials. Yet the Court insists on adding legislative history to&para;<br>its analysis. I could understand that (though not agree&para;<br>with it) if, in the absence of supposed legislative-history&para;<br>support, the Court would reach a different result. Or even&para;<br>if there was something in the legislative history that&para;<br>clearly contradicted the Court’s result, and had to be&para;<br>explained away. That is not the situation here (or at least&para;<br>the Court’s opinion does not think it to be so). The Court&para;<br>assures us, however (if this could be thought assurance),&para;<br>that legislative history is “ ‘not generally so misleading’ ”&para;<br>that it should “ ‘never’ ” be used. Ante, at 10, n. 9 (quoting&para;<br>Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597,&para;<br>611–612, n. 4 (1991)). Surely that is damning by faint&para;<br>praise. And the Court’s mention of the past practice of&para;<br>using legislative history, ante, at 10, n. 9, does not support&para;<br>the Court’s use of it today. The past practice was “not the&para;<br>practice of using legislative history for the purpose of&para;<br>giving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory&para;<br>text,” Mortier, supra, at 622 (SCALIA, J., concurring in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>judgment).&para;<br>The Court’s introduction of legislative history serves no&para;<br>purpose except needlessly to inject into the opinion a mode&para;<br>of analysis that not all of the Justices consider valid. And&para;<br>it does so, to boot, in a fashion that does not isolate the&para;<br>superfluous legislative history in a section that those of us&para;<br>who disagree categorically with its use, or at least dis&para;<br>agree with its superfluous use, can decline to join. I there&para;<br>fore do not join the opinion, and concur only in the result.&para;<br>The Court relies on legislative history to support three&para;<br>of its positions. First, after explaining why the phrase&para;<br>“agency or instrumentality” in the definition of “foreign&para;<br>state,” see §1603(a), (b), does not refer to natural persons,&para;<br>ante, at 9–10, the Court says “[n]or does anything in the&para;<br>legislative history suggest that Congress intended the&para;<br>term ‘agency or instrumentality’ to include individuals,”&para;<br>ante, at 10, n. 9. According to the Court, “the legislative&para;<br>history, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities.” Ibid.&para;<br>Apparently, the legislative history must be consulted, not&para;<br>to show that it supports the Court’s textual analysis, or&para;<br>even to explain why its seeming contradiction of the&para;<br>Court’s analysis is inconsequential, but to show nothing&para;<br>more than that it contains the same ambiguous language&para;<br>as the text. This is beyond all reason.&para;<br>Second, after concluding its review of the statute’s text,&para;<br>the Court states that the “legislative history makes clear&para;<br>that Congress did not intend the [Foreign Sovereign Im&para;<br>munities Act of 1976] to address position-based individual&para;<br>immunities such as diplomatic and consular immunity,”&para;<br>ante, at 13, n. 12. See also ante, at 17. It cites for this&para;<br>proposition a House Committee Report that we have no&para;<br>reason to believe was read (much less approved) by the&para;<br>Senate—or, indeed, by the Members of the House who&para;<br>were not on the Committee—or even, for that matter, by&para;<br>the members of the Committee, who never voted on the&para;<br>Report. In any case, the quoted excerpt does not address&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>“position-based individual immunities” in general but only&para;<br>“consular and diplomatic immunity,” which is not at issue&para;<br>here. Unless consular and diplomatic immunity, on the&para;<br>one hand, and, on the other hand, what is at issue here—&para;<br>state-agent immunity—are always treated the same&para;<br>(which I doubt and the Court does not attempt to estab&para;<br>lish), the passage contributes nothing to analysis of the&para;<br>present case.&para;<br>The same footnote also quotes a portion of the same&para;<br>House Report as follows:&para;<br>“ ‘The bill does not attempt to deal with questions of&para;<br>discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a diplo&para;<br>mat in the United States or a high-ranking official of&para;<br>a foreign government, diplomatic and official immu&para;<br>nity would apply.’ ” Ante, at 13, n. 12.&para;<br>If anything, this passage cuts against the Court’s result.&para;<br>The two sentences omitted from the above quotation read&para;<br>as follows:&para;<br>“Existing law appears to be adequate in this area. For&para;<br>example, if a private plaintiff sought the production of&para;<br>sensitive governmental documents of a foreign state,&para;<br>concepts of governmental privilege would apply.”&para;<br>H. R. Rep. No. 94–1487, p. 23 (1976).&para;<br>Thus, the House Report makes it clear that the bill’s&para;<br>failure to deal with discovery applies to both discovery&para;<br>against sovereigns and discovery against foreign officials.&para;<br>But the latter would have been unnecessary if the bill&para;<br>dealt only with sovereigns. The implication (if any) is that&para;<br>the bill’s provisions regarding immunity from suit apply to&para;<br>both sovereigns and foreign officials.&para;<br>Third, and finally, the Court points to legislative history&para;<br>to establish the purpose of the statute. See ante, at 17,&para;<br>and n. 19. This is particularly puzzling, because the en&para;<br>acted statutory text itself includes findings and a declara&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tion of purpose—the very same purpose (surprise!) that&para;<br>the Court finds evidenced in the legislative history. See&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1602. To make matters worse, the Court&para;<br>itself notes this statutory declaration of purpose twice&para;<br>earlier, in the body of its opinion, see ante, at 6, 13. If&para;<br>those textual references to the statute itself were deleted,&para;<br>the footnoted citation of legislative history would at least&para;<br>perform some function. As it is, however, it adds nothing&para;<br>except the demonstration of assiduous law-clerk research.&para;<br>It should be no cause for wonder that, upon careful&para;<br>examination, all of the opinion’s excerpts from legislative&para;<br>history turn out to be, at best, nonprobative or entirely&para;<br>duplicative of text. After all, legislative history is almost&para;<br>never the real reason for the Court’s decision—and make&para;<br>weights do not deserve a lot of the Court’s time.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
