SHATZER&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND&para;<br>No. 08–680.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 5, 2009—Decided February 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>In 2003, a police detective tried to question respondent Shatzer, who&para;<br>was incarcerated at a Maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction,&para;<br>about allegations that he had sexually abused his son. Shatzer in&para;<br>voked his Miranda right to have counsel present during interroga&para;<br>tion, so the detective terminated the interview. Shatzer was released&para;<br>back into the general prison population, and the investigation was&para;<br>closed. Another detective reopened the investigation in 2006 and at&para;<br>tempted to interrogate Shatzer, who was still incarcerated. Shatzer&para;<br>waived his Miranda rights and made inculpatory statements. The&para;<br>trial court refused to suppress those statements, reasoning that Ed&para;<br>wards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, did not apply because Shatzer had&para;<br>experienced a break in Miranda custody prior to the 2006 interroga&para;<br>tion. Shatzer was convicted of sexual child abuse. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals of Maryland reversed, holding that the mere passage of time&para;<br>does not end the Edwards protections, and that, assuming, arguendo,&para;<br>a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed, Shatzer’s release&para;<br>back into the general prison population did not constitute such a&para;<br>break.&para;<br>Held: Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting&para;<br>more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at inter&para;<br>rogation, Edwards does not mandate suppression of his 2006 state&para;<br>ments. Pp. 4–18.&para;<br>(a) Edwards created a presumption that once a suspect invokes the&para;<br>Miranda right to the presence of counsel, any waiver of that right in&para;<br>response to a subsequent police attempt at custodial interrogation is&para;<br>involuntary. Edwards’ fundamental purpose is to “[p]reserv[e] the&para;<br>integrity of an accused’s choice to communicate with police only&para;<br>through counsel,” Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291, by “pre&para;<br>vent[ing] police from badgering [him] into waiving his previously as&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>serted Miranda rights,” Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350. It is&para;<br>easy to believe that a suspect’s later waiver was coerced or badgered&para;<br>when he has been held in uninterrupted Miranda custody since his&para;<br>first refusal to waive. He remains cut off from his normal life and&para;<br>isolated in a “police-dominated atmosphere,” Miranda v. Arizona, 384&para;<br>U. S. 436, 456, where his captors “appear to control [his] fate,” Illi&para;<br>nois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297. But where a suspect has been re&para;<br>leased from custody and returned to his normal life for some time be&para;<br>fore the later attempted interrogation, there is little reason to think&para;<br>that his change of heart has been coerced. Because the Edwards pre&para;<br>sumption has been established by opinion of this Court, it is appro&para;<br>priate for this Court to specify the period of release from custody that&para;<br>will terminate its application. See County of Riverside v. McLaugh&para;<br>lin, 500 U. S. 44. The Court concludes that the appropriate period is&para;<br>14 days, which provides ample time for the suspect to get reaccli&para;<br>mated to his normal life, consult with friends and counsel, and shake&para;<br>off any residual coercive effects of prior custody. Pp. 4–13.&para;<br>(b) Shatzer’s release back into the general prison population consti&para;<br>tutes a break in Miranda custody. Lawful imprisonment imposed&para;<br>upon conviction does not create the coercive pressures produced by&para;<br>investigative custody that justify Edwards. When previously incar&para;<br>cerated suspects are released back into the general prison population,&para;<br>they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routine—&para;<br>they regain the degree of control they had over their lives before the&para;<br>attempted interrogation. Their continued detention is relatively dis&para;<br>connected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investiga&para;<br>tion. The “inherently compelling pressures” of custodial interrogation&para;<br>ended when Shatzer returned to his normal life.

MICHAEL BLAINE&para;<br>&para;<br>SHATZER, SR. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND&para;<br>&para;<br>[February 24, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>We consider whether a break in custody ends the pre­&para;<br>sumption of involuntariness established in Edwards v.&para;<br>Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981).&para;<br>I&para;<br>In August 2003, a social worker assigned to the Child&para;<br>Advocacy Center in the Criminal Investigation Division of&para;<br>the Hagerstown Police Department referred to the de­&para;<br>partment allegations that respondent Michael Shatzer,&para;<br>Sr., had sexually abused his 3-year-old son. At that time,&para;<br>Shatzer was incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional&para;<br>Institution-Hagerstown, serving a sentence for an unre­&para;<br>lated child-sexual-abuse offense. Detective Shane Blank­&para;<br>enship was assigned to the investigation and interviewed&para;<br>Shatzer at the correctional institution on August 7, 2003.&para;<br>Before asking any questions, Blankenship reviewed&para;<br>Shatzer’s Miranda rights with him, and obtained a writ­&para;<br>ten waiver of those rights. When Blankenship explained&para;<br>that he was there to question Shatzer about sexually&para;<br>abusing his son, Shatzer expressed confusion—he had&para;<br>thought Blankenship was an attorney there to discuss the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>prior crime for which he was incarcerated. Blankenship&para;<br>clarified the purpose of his visit, and Shatzer declined to&para;<br>speak without an attorney. Accordingly, Blankenship&para;<br>ended the interview, and Shatzer was released back into&para;<br>the general prison population.&para;<br>Shortly thereafter,&para;<br>Blankenship closed the investigation.&para;<br>Two years and six months later, the same social worker&para;<br>referred more specific allegations to the department about&para;<br>the same incident involving Shatzer. Detective Paul&para;<br>Hoover, from the same division, was assigned to the inves­&para;<br>tigation. He and the social worker interviewed the victim,&para;<br>then eight years old, who described the incident in more&para;<br>detail. With this new information in hand, on March 2,&para;<br>2006, they went to the Roxbury Correctional Institute, to&para;<br>which Shatzer had since been transferred, and inter­&para;<br>viewed Shatzer in a maintenance room outfitted with a&para;<br>desk and three chairs. Hoover explained that he wanted&para;<br>to ask Shatzer about the alleged incident involving&para;<br>Shatzer’s son. Shatzer was surprised because he thought&para;<br>that the investigation had been closed, but Hoover ex­&para;<br>plained they had opened a new file. Hoover then read&para;<br>Shatzer his Miranda rights and obtained a written waiver&para;<br>on a standard department form.&para;<br>Hoover interrogated Shatzer about the incident for&para;<br>approximately 30 minutes. Shatzer denied ordering his&para;<br>son to perform fellatio on him, but admitted to masturbat­&para;<br>ing in front of his son from a distance of less than three&para;<br>feet. Before the interview ended, Shatzer agreed to Hoo­&para;<br>ver’s request that he submit to a polygraph examination.&para;<br>At no point during the interrogation did Shatzer request&para;<br>to speak with an attorney or refer to his prior refusal to&para;<br>answer questions without one.&para;<br>Five days later, on March 7, 2006, Hoover and another&para;<br>detective met with Shatzer at the correctional facility to&para;<br>administer the polygraph examination. After reading&para;<br>Shatzer his Miranda rights and obtaining a written&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>waiver, the other detective administered the test and&para;<br>concluded that Shatzer had failed. When the detectives&para;<br>then questioned Shatzer, he became upset, started to cry,&para;<br>and incriminated himself by saying, “ ‘I didn’t force him. I&para;<br>didn’t force him.’ ” 405 Md. 585, 590, 954 A. 2d 1118, 1121&para;<br>(2008). After making this inculpatory statement, Shatzer&para;<br>requested an attorney, and Hoover promptly ended the&para;<br>interrogation.&para;<br>The State’s Attorney for Washington County charged&para;<br>Shatzer with second-degree sexual offense, sexual child&para;<br>abuse, second-degree assault, and contributing to condi­&para;<br>tions rendering a child in need of assistance. Shatzer&para;<br>moved to suppress his March 2006 statements pursuant to&para;<br>Edwards. The trial court held a suppression hearing and&para;<br>later denied Shatzer’s motion. The Edwards protections&para;<br>did not apply, it reasoned, because Shatzer had experi­&para;<br>enced a break in custody for Miranda purposes between&para;<br>the 2003 and 2006 interrogations. No. 21–K–06–37799&para;<br>(Cir. Ct. Washington Cty., Md., Sept. 14, 2006), App. 55.&para;<br>Shatzer pleaded not guilty, waived his right to a jury trial,&para;<br>and proceeded to a bench trial based on an agreed state­&para;<br>ment of facts. In accordance with the agreement, the&para;<br>State described the interview with the victim and&para;<br>Shatzer’s 2006 statements to the detectives. Based on the&para;<br>proffered testimony of the victim and the “admission of the&para;<br>defendant as to the act of masturbation,” the trial court&para;<br>found Shatzer guilty of sexual child abuse of his son.1 No.&para;<br>21–K–06–37799 (Cir. Ct. Washington Cty., Md., Sept. 21,&para;<br>2006), id., at 70, 79.&para;<br>Over the dissent of two judges, the Court of Appeals of&para;<br>Maryland reversed and remanded. The court held that&para;<br>“the passage of time alone is insufficient to [end] the pro­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The State filed a nolle prosequi to the second-degree sexual offense&para;<br>charge, and consented to dismissal of the misdemeanor charges as&para;<br>barred by the statute of limitations.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tections afforded by Edwards,” and that, assuming, ar&para;<br>guendo, a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed,&para;<br>Shatzer’s release back into the general prison population&para;<br>between interrogations did not constitute a break in cus­&para;<br>tody. 405 Md., at 606–607, 954 A. 2d, at 1131. We&para;<br>granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Fifth Amendment, which applies to the States by&para;<br>virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan,&para;<br>378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964), provides that “[n]o person . . . shall&para;<br>be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against&para;<br>himself.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. In Miranda v. Arizona,&para;<br>384 U. S. 436 (1966), the Court adopted a set of prophylac­&para;<br>tic measures to protect a suspect’s Fifth Amendment right&para;<br>from the “inherently compelling pressures” of custodial&para;<br>interrogation. Id., at 467. The Court observed that “in­&para;<br>communicado interrogation” in an “unfamiliar,” “police­&para;<br>dominated atmosphere,” id., at 456–457, involves psycho­&para;<br>logical pressures “which work to undermine the individ­&para;<br>ual’s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he&para;<br>would not otherwise do so freely,” id., at 467. Conse­&para;<br>quently, it reasoned, “[u]nless adequate protective devices&para;<br>are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custo­&para;<br>dial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defen­&para;<br>dant can truly be the product of his free choice.” Id., at&para;<br>458.&para;<br>To counteract the coercive pressure, Miranda an­&para;<br>nounced that police officers must warn a suspect prior to&para;<br>questioning that he has a right to remain silent, and a&para;<br>right to the presence of an attorney. Id., at 444. After the&para;<br>warnings are given, if the suspect indicates that he wishes&para;<br>to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. Id., at&para;<br>473–474. Similarly, if the suspect states that he wants an&para;<br>attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is&para;<br>present. Id., at 474. Critically, however, a suspect can&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>waive these rights. Id., at 475. To establish a valid&para;<br>waiver, the State must show that the waiver was knowing,&para;<br>intelligent, and voluntary under the “high standar[d] of&para;<br>proof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set forth in]&para;<br>Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938).” Id., at 475.&para;<br>In Edwards, the Court determined that Zerbst’s tradi­&para;<br>tional standard for waiver was not sufficient to protect a&para;<br>suspect’s right to have counsel present at a subsequent&para;<br>interrogation if he had previously requested counsel;&para;<br>“additional safeguards” were necessary. 451 U. S., at 484.&para;<br>The Court therefore superimposed a “second layer of&para;<br>prophylaxis,” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176&para;<br>(1991). Edwards held:&para;<br>“[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have&para;<br>counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid&para;<br>waiver of that right cannot be established by showing&para;<br>only that he responded to further police-initiated cus­&para;<br>todial interrogation even if he has been advised of his&para;<br>rights. . . . [He] is not subject to further interrogation&para;<br>by the authorities until counsel has been made avail­&para;<br>able to him, unless the accused himself initiates fur­&para;<br>ther communication, exchanges, or conversations with&para;<br>the police.” 451 U. S., at 484–485.&para;<br>The rationale of Edwards is that once a suspect indicates&para;<br>that “he is not capable of undergoing [custodial] question­&para;<br>ing without advice of counsel,” “any subsequent waiver&para;<br>that has come at the authorities’ behest, and not at the&para;<br>suspect’s own instigation, is itself the product of the ‘in­&para;<br>herently compelling pressures’ and not the purely volun­&para;<br>tary choice of the suspect.” Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.&para;<br>675, 681 (1988). Under this rule, a voluntary Miranda&para;<br>waiver is sufficient at the time of an initial attempted&para;<br>interrogation to protect a suspect’s right to have counsel&para;<br>present, but it is not sufficient at the time of subsequent&para;<br>attempts if the suspect initially requested the presence of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>counsel. The implicit assumption, of course, is that the&para;<br>subsequent requests for interrogation pose a significantly&para;<br>greater risk of coercion. That increased risk results not&para;<br>only from the police’s persistence in trying to get the sus­&para;<br>pect to talk, but also from the continued pressure that&para;<br>begins when the individual is taken into custody as a&para;<br>suspect and sought to be interrogated—pressure likely to&para;<br>“increase as custody is prolonged,” Minnick v. Mississippi,&para;<br>498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990). The Edwards presumption of&para;<br>involuntariness ensures that police will not take advan­&para;<br>tage of the mounting coercive pressures of “prolonged&para;<br>police custody,” Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686, by repeatedly&para;<br>attempting to question a suspect who previously requested&para;<br>counsel until the suspect is “badgered into submission,”&para;<br>id., at 690 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).&para;<br>We have frequently emphasized that the Edwards rule&para;<br>is not a constitutional mandate, but judicially prescribed&para;<br>prophylaxis. See, e.g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2009) (slip op., at 7–8); Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S.&para;<br>344, 349 (1990); Solem v. Stumes, 465 U. S. 638, 644, n. 4&para;<br>(1984). Because Edwards is “our rule, not a constitutional&para;<br>command,” “it is our obligation to justify its expansion.”&para;<br>Roberson, supra, at 688 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Lower&para;<br>courts have uniformly held that a break in custody ends&para;<br>the Edwards presumption, see, e.g., People v. Storm, 28&para;<br>Cal. 4th 1007, 1023–1024, and n. 6, 52 P. 3d 52, 61–62,&para;<br>and n. 6 (2002) (collecting state and federal cases), but we&para;<br>have previously addressed the issue only in dicta, see&para;<br>McNeil, supra, at 177 (Edwards applies “assuming there&para;<br>has been no break in custody”).&para;<br>A judicially crafted rule is “justified only by reference to&para;<br>its prophylactic purpose,” Davis v. United States, 512 U. S.&para;<br>452, 458 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), and&para;<br>applies only where its benefits outweigh its costs, Montejo,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). We begin with the benefits.&para;<br>Edwards’ presumption of involuntariness has the inciden­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tal effect of “conserv[ing] judicial resources which would&para;<br>otherwise be expended in making difficult determinations&para;<br>of voluntariness.” Minnick, supra, at 151. Its fundamen­&para;<br>tal purpose, however, is to “[p]reserv[e] the integrity of an&para;<br>accused’s choice to communicate with police only through&para;<br>counsel,” Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988), by&para;<br>“prevent[ing] police from badgering a defendant into waiv­&para;<br>ing his previously asserted Miranda rights,” Harvey,&para;<br>supra, at 350. Thus, the benefits of the rule are measured&para;<br>by the number of coerced confessions it suppresses that&para;<br>otherwise would have been admitted. See Montejo, supra,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 14).&para;<br>It is easy to believe that a suspect may be coerced or&para;<br>badgered into abandoning his earlier refusal to be ques­&para;<br>tioned without counsel in the paradigm Edwards case.&para;<br>That is a case in which the suspect has been arrested for a&para;<br>particular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial&para;<br>custody while that crime is being actively investigated.&para;<br>After the initial interrogation, and up to and including the&para;<br>second one, he remains cut off from his normal life and&para;<br>companions, “thrust into” and isolated in an “unfamiliar,”&para;<br>“police-dominated atmosphere,” Miranda, 384 U. S., at&para;<br>456–457, where his captors “appear to control [his] fate,”&para;<br>Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297 (1990). That was the&para;<br>situation confronted by the suspects in Edwards,&para;<br>Roberson, and Minnick, the three cases in which we have&para;<br>held the Edwards rule applicable. Edwards was arrested&para;<br>pursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station, where&para;<br>he was interrogated until he requested counsel. Edwards,&para;<br>451 U. S., at 478–479. The officer ended the interrogation&para;<br>and took him to the county jail,2 but at 9:15 the next&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Jail&para;<br>&para;<br>is a “local government’s detention center where persons await­&para;<br>ing trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.” Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 910 (9th ed. 2009). Prison, by contrast, is a “state or federal&para;<br>facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp. felons.” Id., at 1314.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>morning, two of the officer’s colleagues reinterrogated&para;<br>Edwards at the jail. Id., at 479. Roberson was arrested&para;<br>“at the scene of a just-completed burglary” and interro­&para;<br>gated there until he requested a lawyer. Roberson, 486&para;<br>U. S., at 678. A different officer interrogated him three&para;<br>days later while he “was still in custody pursuant to the&para;<br>arrest.” Ibid. Minnick was arrested by local police and&para;<br>taken to the San Diego jail, where two FBI agents interro­&para;<br>gated him the next morning until he requested counsel.&para;<br>Minnick, 498 U. S., at 148–149. Two days later a Missis­&para;<br>sippi Deputy Sheriff reinterrogated him at the jail. Id., at&para;<br>149. None of these suspects regained a sense of control or&para;<br>normalcy after they were initially taken into custody for&para;<br>the crime under investigation.&para;<br>When, unlike what happened in these three cases, a&para;<br>suspect has been released from his pretrial custody and&para;<br>has returned to his normal life for some time before the&para;<br>later attempted interrogation, there is little reason to&para;<br>think that his change of heart regarding interrogation&para;<br>without counsel has been coerced. He has no longer been&para;<br>isolated. He has likely been able to seek advice from an&para;<br>attorney, family members, and friends.3 And he knows&para;<br>from his earlier experience that he need only demand&para;<br>counsel to bring the interrogation to a halt; and that in­&para;<br>vestigative custody does not last indefinitely. In these&para;<br>circumstances, it is far fetched to think that a police offi­&para;<br>cer’s asking the suspect whether he would like to waive&para;<br>his Miranda rights will any more “wear down the ac­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS points out, post, at 7 (opinion concurring in judg­&para;<br>ment), that in Minnick, actual pre-reinterrogation consultation with an&para;<br>attorney during continued custody did not suffice to avoid application of&para;<br>Edwards. That does not mean that the ability to consult freely with&para;<br>attorneys and others does not reduce the level of coercion at all, or that&para;<br>it is “only questionably relevant,” post, at 7, to whether termination of&para;<br>custody reduces the coercive pressure that is the basis for Edwards’&para;<br>super-prophylactic rule.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

S. 91, 98 (1984) (per cu&para;<br>riam), than did the first such request at the original at­&para;<br>tempted interrogation—which is of course not deemed&para;<br>coercive. His change of heart is less likely attributable to&para;<br>“badgering” than it is to the fact that further deliberation&para;<br>in familiar surroundings has caused him to believe&para;<br>(rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with the investiga­&para;<br>tion is in his interest. Uncritical extension of Edwards to&para;<br>this situation would not significantly increase the number&para;<br>of genuinely coerced confessions excluded. The “justifica­&para;<br>tion for a conclusive presumption disappears when appli­&para;<br>cation of the presumption will not reach the correct result&para;<br>most of the time.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,&para;<br>737 (1991).&para;<br>At the same time that extending the Edwards rule&para;<br>yields diminished benefits, extending the rule also in­&para;<br>creases its costs: the in-fact voluntary confessions it ex­&para;<br>cludes from trial, and the voluntary confessions it deters&para;<br>law enforcement officers from even trying to obtain. Vol­&para;<br>untary confessions are not merely “a proper element in&para;<br>law enforcement,” Miranda, supra, at 478, they are an&para;<br>“unmitigated good,” McNeil, 501 U.

The prohibition applies, of course, when the subse­&para;<br>quent interrogation pertains to a different crime,&para;<br>Roberson, supra, when it is conducted by a different law&para;<br>enforcement authority, Minnick, 498 U. S. 146, and even&para;<br>when the suspect has met with an attorney after the first&para;<br>interrogation, ibid. And it not only prevents questioning&para;<br>ex ante; it would render invalid ex post, confessions invited&para;<br>and obtained from suspects who (unbeknownst to the&para;<br>interrogators) have acquired Edwards immunity previ­&para;<br>ously in connection with any offense in any jurisdiction.5&para;<br>In a country that harbors a large number of repeat offend­&para;<br>ers,6 this consequence is disastrous.&para;<br>We conclude that such an extension of Edwards is not&para;<br>justified; we have opened its “protective umbrella,” Solem,&para;<br>465 U. S., at 644, n. 4, far enough. The protections offered&para;<br>by Miranda, which we have deemed sufficient to ensure&para;<br>that the police respect the suspect’s desire to have an&para;<br>attorney present the first time police interrogate him,&para;<br>adequately ensure that result when a suspect who initially&para;<br>requested counsel is reinterrogated after a break in cus­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 This assumes that Roberson’s extension of Edwards to subsequent&para;<br>interrogation for a different crime, and Minnick’s extension of Edwards&para;<br>to subsequent interrogation by a different law enforcement agency&para;<br>would apply even when the place of custody and the identity of the&para;<br>custodial agency are not the same (as they were in Roberson and&para;<br>Minnick) as those of the original interrogation. That assumption would&para;<br>seem reasonable if the Edwards-suspending effect of a termination of&para;<br>custody is rejected. Reinterrogation in different custody or by a differ­&para;<br>ent interrogating agency would seem, if anything, less likely than&para;<br>termination of custody to reduce coercive pressures. At the original&para;<br>site, and with respect to the original interrogating agency, the suspect&para;<br>has already experienced cessation of interrogation when he demands&para;<br>counsel—which he may have no reason to expect elsewhere.&para;<br>6 According to a recent study, 67.5% of prisoners released from 15&para;<br>States in 1994 were rearrested within three years. See Dept. of Justice,&para;<br>Bureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report, Recidivism of Prisoners&para;<br>Released in 1994 (NCJ 193427, 2002).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tody that is of sufficient duration to dissipate its coercive&para;<br>effects.&para;<br>If Shatzer’s return to the general prison population&para;<br>qualified as a break in custody (a question we address in&para;<br>Part III, infra), there is no doubt that it lasted long&para;<br>enough (2½ years) to meet that durational requirement.&para;<br>But what about a break that has lasted only one year? Or&para;<br>only one week? It is impractical to leave the answer to&para;<br>that question for clarification in future case-by-case adju­&para;<br>dication; law enforcement officers need to know, with&para;<br>certainty and beforehand, when renewed interrogation is&para;<br>lawful. And while it is certainly unusual for this Court to&para;<br>set forth precise time limits governing police action, it is&para;<br>not unheard-of. In County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,&para;<br>500 U. S. 44 (1991), we specified 48 hours as the time&para;<br>within which the police must comply with the requirement&para;<br>of Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), that a person&para;<br>arrested without a warrant be brought before a magistrate&para;<br>to establish probable cause for continued detention.&para;<br>Like McLaughlin, this is a case in which the requisite&para;<br>police action (there, presentation to a magistrate; here,&para;<br>abstention from further interrogation) has not been pre­&para;<br>scribed by statute but has been established by opinion of&para;<br>this Court. We think it appropriate to specify a period of&para;<br>time to avoid the consequence that continuation of the&para;<br>Edwards presumption “will not reach the correct result&para;<br>most of the time.” Coleman, supra, at 737. It seems to us&para;<br>that period is 14 days. That provides plenty of time for&para;<br>the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to con­&para;<br>sult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any resid­&para;<br>ual coercive effects of his prior custody.&para;<br>The 14-day limitation meets Shatzer’s concern that a&para;<br>break-in-custody rule lends itself to police abuse. He&para;<br>envisions that once a suspect invokes his Miranda right to&para;<br>counsel, the police will release the suspect briefly (to end&para;<br>the Edwards presumption) and then promptly bring him&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>back into custody for reinterrogation. But once the sus­&para;<br>pect has been out of custody long enough (14 days) to&para;<br>eliminate its coercive effect, there will be nothing to gain&para;<br>by such gamesmanship—nothing, that is, except the en­&para;<br>tirely appropriate gain of being able to interrogate a sus­&para;<br>pect who has made a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.7&para;<br>Shatzer argues that ending the Edwards protections at&para;<br>a break in custody will undermine Edwards’ purpose to&para;<br>conserve judicial resources. To be sure, we have said that&para;<br>“[t]he merit of the Edwards decision lies in the clarity of&para;<br>its command and the certainty of its application.”&para;<br>Minnick, 498 U. S., at 151. But clarity and certainty are&para;<br>not goals in themselves. They are valuable only when&para;<br>they reasonably further the achievement of some substan­&para;<br>tive end—here, the exclusion of compelled confessions.&para;<br>Confessions obtained after a 2-week break in custody and&para;<br>a waiver of Miranda rights are most unlikely to be com­&para;<br>pelled, and hence are unreasonably excluded. In any case,&para;<br>a break-in-custody exception will dim only marginally, if&para;<br>at all, the bright-line nature of Edwards. In every case&para;<br>involving Edwards, the courts must determine whether&para;<br>the suspect was in custody when he requested counsel and&para;<br>when he later made the statements he seeks to suppress.&para;<br>Now, in cases where there is an alleged break in custody,&para;<br>they simply have to repeat the inquiry for the time be­&para;<br>tween the initial invocation and reinterrogation. In most&para;<br>cases that determination will be easy. And when it is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 A defendant who experiences a 14-day break in custody after invok­&para;<br>ing the Miranda right to counsel is not left without protection. Ed&para;<br>wards establishes a presumption that a suspect’s waiver of Miranda&para;<br>rights is involuntary. See Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 681&para;<br>(1988). Even without this “second layer of prophylaxis,” McNeil v.&para;<br>Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991), a defendant is still free to claim&para;<br>the prophylactic protection of Miranda—arguing that his waiver of&para;<br>Miranda rights was in fact involuntary under Johnson v.

No&para;<br>one questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda&para;<br>purposes during the interviews with Detective&para;<br>Blankenship in 2003 and Detective Hoover in 2006. Like­&para;<br>wise, no one questions that Shatzer triggered the Edwards&para;<br>protections when, according to Detective Blankenship’s&para;<br>notes of the 2003 interview, he stated that “ ‘he would not&para;<br>talk about this case without having an attorney present,’ ”&para;<br>405 Md., at 589, 954 A. 2d, at 1120. After the 2003 inter­&para;<br>view, Shatzer was released back into the general prison&para;<br>population where he was serving an unrelated sentence.&para;<br>The issue is whether that constitutes a break in Miranda&para;<br>custody.&para;<br>We have never decided whether incarceration consti­&para;<br>tutes custody for Miranda purposes, and have indeed&para;<br>explicitly declined to address the issue. See Perkins, 496&para;<br>U. S., at 299. See also Bradley v. Ohio, 497 U. S. 1011,&para;<br>1013 (1990) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certio­&para;<br>rari). Whether it does depends upon whether it exerts the&para;<br>coercive pressure that Miranda was designed to guard&para;<br>against—the “danger of coercion [that] results from the&para;<br>interaction of custody and official interrogation.” Perkins,&para;<br>supra, at 297 (emphasis added). To determine whether a&para;<br>suspect was in Miranda custody we have asked whether&para;<br>“there is a ‘formal arrest or restraint on freedom of move­&para;<br>ment’ of the degree associated with a formal arrest.” New&para;<br>York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984); see also Stans&para;<br>bury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam).&para;<br>This test, no doubt, is satisfied by all forms of incarcera­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion. Our cases make clear, however, that the freedom-of­&para;<br>movement test identifies only a necessary and not a suffi­&para;<br>cient condition for Miranda custody. We have declined to&para;<br>accord it “talismanic power,” because Miranda is to be&para;<br>enforced “only in those types of situations in which the&para;<br>concerns that powered the decision are implicated.”&para;<br>Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, the&para;<br>temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in­&para;<br>volved in a traffic stop or Terry stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392&para;<br>U. S. 1 (1968), does not constitute Miranda custody.&para;<br>McCarty, supra, at 439–440. See also Perkins, supra, at&para;<br>296.&para;<br>Here, we are addressing the interim period during&para;<br>which a suspect was not interrogated, but was subject to a&para;<br>baseline set of restraints imposed pursuant to a prior&para;<br>conviction. Without minimizing the harsh realities of&para;<br>incarceration, we think lawful imprisonment imposed&para;<br>upon conviction of a crime does not create the coercive&para;<br>pressures identified in Miranda.&para;<br>Interrogated suspects who have previously been con­&para;<br>victed of crime live in prison. When they are released&para;<br>back into the general prison population, they return to&para;<br>their accustomed surroundings and daily routine—they&para;<br>regain the degree of control they had over their lives prior&para;<br>to the interrogation. Sentenced prisoners, in contrast to&para;<br>the Miranda paradigm, are not isolated with their accus­&para;<br>ers. They live among other inmates, guards, and workers,&para;<br>and often can receive visitors and communicate with&para;<br>people on the outside by mail or telephone.&para;<br>Their detention, moreover, is relatively disconnected&para;<br>from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investi­&para;<br>gation. The former interrogator has no power to increase&para;<br>the duration of incarceration, which was determined at&para;<br>sentencing.8 And even where the possibility of parole&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 We&para;<br>&para;<br>distinguish the duration of incarceration from the duration of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

This is in stark contrast to the&para;<br>circumstances faced by the defendants in Edwards,&para;<br>Roberson, and Minnick, whose continued detention as&para;<br>suspects rested with those controlling their interrogation,&para;<br>and who confronted the uncertainties of what final&para;<br>charges they would face, whether they would be convicted,&para;<br>and what sentence they would receive.&para;<br>Shatzer’s experience illustrates the vast differences&para;<br>between Miranda custody and incarceration pursuant to&para;<br>conviction. At the time of the 2003 attempted interroga­&para;<br>tion, Shatzer was already serving a sentence for a prior&para;<br>conviction. After that, he returned to the general prison&para;<br>population in the Maryland Correctional InstitutionHagerstown and was later transferred, for unrelated&para;<br>reasons, down the street to the Roxbury Correctional&para;<br>Institute.

The “inherently compelling pres­&para;<br>sures” of custodial interrogation ended when he returned&para;<br>to his normal life.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>A few words in response to JUSTICE STEVENS’ concur­&para;<br>rence: It claims we ignore that “[w]hen police tell an indi­&para;<br>gent suspect that he has the right to an attorney” and&para;<br>then “reinterrogate” him without providing a lawyer, “the&para;<br>suspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that&para;<br>he really does not have any right to a lawyer.” Post, at 2&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment) (hereinafter concur­&para;<br>rence). See also post, at 4, 7, n. 11, 11, n. 16. The fallacy&para;<br>here is that we are not talking about “reinterrogating” the&para;<br>suspect; we are talking about asking his permission to be&para;<br>interrogated. An officer has in no sense lied to a suspect&para;<br>when, after advising, as Miranda requires, “You have the&para;<br>right to remain silent, and if you choose to speak you have&para;<br>the right to the presence of an attorney,” he promptly ends&para;<br>the attempted interrogation because the suspect declines&para;<br>to speak without counsel present, and then, two weeks&para;<br>later, reapproaches the suspect and asks, “Are you now&para;<br>willing to speak without a lawyer present?”&para;<br>The “concer[n] that motivated the Edwards line of&para;<br>cases,” post, at 2–3, n. 2, is that the suspect will be coerced&para;<br>into saying yes. That concern guides our decision today.&para;<br>Contrary to the concurrence’s conclusion, post, at 3, 5–6,&para;<br>there is no reason to believe a suspect will view confession&para;<br>as “ ‘the only way to end his interrogation’ ” when, before&para;<br>the interrogation begins, he is told that he can avoid it by&para;<br>simply requesting that he not be interrogated without&para;<br>counsel present—an option that worked before. If, as the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>concurrence argues will often be the case, post, at 5, a&para;<br>break in custody does not change the suspect’s mind, he&para;<br>need only say so.&para;<br>The concurrence also accuses the Court of “ignor[ing]&para;<br>that when a suspect asks for counsel, until his request is&para;<br>answered, there are still the same ‘inherently compelling’&para;<br>pressures of custodial interrogation on which the Miranda&para;<br>line of cases is based.” Post, at 4. We do not ignore these&para;<br>pressures; nor do we suggest that they disappear when&para;<br>custody is recommenced after a break, see post, at 5. But&para;<br>if those pressures are merely “the same” as before, then&para;<br>Miranda provides sufficient protection—as it did before.&para;<br>The Edwards presumption of involuntariness is justified&para;<br>only in circumstances where the coercive pressures have&para;<br>increased so much that suspects’ waivers of Miranda&para;<br>rights are likely to be involuntary most of the time. Con­&para;<br>trary to the concurrence’s suggestion, post, at 3, it is only&para;<br>in those narrow circumstances—when custody is unbro­&para;<br>ken—that the Court has concluded a “fresh se[t] of&para;<br>Miranda warnings” is not sufficient. See Roberson, 486&para;<br>U. S., at 686.&para;<br>In the last analysis, it turns out that the concurrence&para;<br>accepts our principal points. It agrees that Edwards&para;<br>prophylaxis is not perpetual; it agrees that a break in&para;<br>custody reduces the inherently compelling pressure upon&para;<br>which Edwards was based; it agrees that Shatzer’s release&para;<br>back into the general prison population constituted a&para;<br>break in custody; and it agrees that in this case the break&para;<br>was long enough to render Edwards inapplicable. Post, at&para;<br>10–12. We differ in two respects: Instead of terminating&para;<br>Edwards protection when the custodial pressures that&para;<br>were the basis for that protection dissipate, the concur­&para;<br>rence would terminate it when the suspect would no&para;<br>longer “feel that he has ‘been denied the counsel he has&para;<br>clearly requested,’ ” post, at 11. This is entirely unrelated&para;<br>to the rationale of Edwards. If confidence in the police’s&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>promise to provide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards&para;<br>would not have applied in Minnick, where the suspect in&para;<br>continuing custody actually met with appointed counsel.&para;<br>The concurrence’s rule is also entirely unrelated to the&para;<br>existence of a break in custody. While that may relieve&para;<br>the accumulated coercive pressures of custody that are the&para;<br>foundation for Edwards, it is hard to see how it bolsters&para;<br>the suspect’s confidence that if he asks for counsel he will&para;<br>get one.&para;<br>And secondly, the concurrence differs from us in declin­&para;<br>ing to say how long after a break in custody the termina­&para;<br>tion of Edwards protection occurs. Two and one-half&para;<br>years, it says, is clearly enough—but it gives law enforce­&para;<br>ment authorities no further guidance. The concurrence&para;<br>criticizes our use of 14 days as arbitrary and unexplained,&para;<br>post, at 5, and n. 7. But in fact that rests upon the same&para;<br>basis as the concurrence’s own approval of a 21⁄2-year&para;<br>break in custody: how much time will justify “treating the&para;<br>second interrogation as no more coercive than the first,”&para;<br>post, at 10. Failure to say where the line falls short of 21⁄2&para;<br>years, and leaving that for future case-by-case determina­&para;<br>tion, is certainly less helpful, but not at all less arbitrary.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda cus­&para;<br>tody lasting more than two weeks between the first and&para;<br>second attempts at interrogation, Edwards does not man­&para;<br>date suppression of his March 2006 statements.

Nor is there any reason to believe&para;<br>that it is arrest specific.&para;<br>9 The compulsion is heightened by the fact that “[t]he uncertainty of&para;<br>fate that being released from custody and then reapprehended entails&para;<br>is, in some circumstances, more coercive than continual custody.”&para;<br>Strauss, Reinterrogation, 22 Hastings Const.

The answer, we are&para;<br>told, is that once a suspect has been out of Miranda cus­&para;<br>tody for 14 days, “[h]e has likely been able to seek advice&para;<br>from an attorney, family members, and friends.” Ante, at&para;<br>8. This speculation, however, is overconfident and only&para;<br>questionably relevant. As a factual matter, we do not&para;<br>know whether the defendant has been able to seek advice:&para;<br>First of all, suspects are told that if they cannot afford a&para;<br>lawyer, one will be provided for them. Yet under the&para;<br>majority’s rule, an indigent suspect who took the police at&para;<br>their word when he asked for a lawyer will nonetheless be&para;<br>assumed to have “been able to seek advice from an attor­&para;<br>ney.” Second, even suspects who are not indigent cannot&para;<br>necessarily access legal advice (or social advice as the&para;<br>Court presumes) within 14 days. Third, suspects may not&para;<br>realize that they need to seek advice from an attorney.&para;<br>Unless police warn suspects that the interrogation will&para;<br>resume in 14 days, why contact a lawyer? When a suspect&para;<br>is let go, he may assume that the police were satisfied. In&para;<br>any event, it is not apparent why interim advice matters.11&para;<br>In Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990), we&para;<br>held that it is not sufficient that a detainee happened to&para;<br>speak at some point with a lawyer. See ibid. (noting that&para;<br>“consultation with an attorney” does not prevent “persis­&para;<br>tent attempts by officials to persuade [a suspect] to waive&para;<br>his rights” or shield against the “coercive pressures that&para;<br>accompany custody”). If the actual interim advice of an&para;<br>attorney is not sufficient, the hypothetical, interim advice&para;<br>of “an attorney, family members, and friends,” ante, at 8,&para;<br>is not enough.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 It is important to distinguish this from the point that I make above&para;<br>about indigent suspects. If the police promise to provide a lawyer and&para;<br>never do so, it sends a message to the suspect that the police have lied&para;<br>and that the rights read to him are hollow. But the mere fact that a&para;<br>suspect consulted a lawyer does not itself reduce the compulsion when&para;<br>police reinterrogate him.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>The many problems with the Court’s new rule are exac­&para;<br>erbated in the very situation in this case: a suspect who is&para;<br>in prison. Even if, as the Court assumes, a trip to one’s&para;<br>home significantly changes the Edwards calculus, a trip to&para;<br>one’s prison cell is not the same. A prisoner’s freedom is&para;<br>severely limited, and his entire life remains subject to&para;<br>government control. Such an environment is not condu­&para;<br>cive to “shak[ing] off any residual coercive effects of his&para;<br>prior custody.” Ante, at 11.12 Nor can a prisoner easily&para;<br>“seek advice from an attorney, family members, and&para;<br>friends,” ante, at 8, especially not within 14 days; prison­&para;<br>ers are frequently subject to restrictions on communica­&para;<br>tions. Nor, in most cases, can he live comfortably knowing&para;<br>that he cannot be badgered by police; prison is not like a&para;<br>normal situation in which a suspect “is in control, and&para;<br>need only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badg­&para;<br>ering.” Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 16). Indeed, for a person whose every move is&para;<br>controlled by the State, it is likely that “his sense of de­&para;<br>pendence on, and trust in, counsel as the guardian of his&para;<br>interests in dealing with government officials intensified.”&para;<br>United States v. Green, 592 A. 2d 985, 989 (D. C. 1991); cf.&para;<br>Minnick, 498 U.

First,&para;<br>because investigators know that their suspect is also a prisoner, there&para;<br>is no need formally to place him under arrest. Thus, police generally&para;<br>can interview prisoners even without probable cause to hold them.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ignores these realities of prison, and instead rests its&para;<br>argument on the supposition that a prisoner’s “detention&para;<br>. . . is relatively disconnected from their prior unwilling­&para;<br>ness to cooperate in an investigation.” Ante, at 14. But&para;<br>that is not necessarily the case. Prisoners are uniquely&para;<br>vulnerable to the officials who control every aspect of their&para;<br>lives; prison guards may not look kindly upon a prisoner&para;<br>who refuses to cooperate with police. And cooperation&para;<br>frequently is relevant to whether the prisoner can obtain&para;<br>parole. See, e.g., Code of Md. Regs., tit. 12, §08.01.18(A)(3)&para;<br>(2008). Moreover, even if it is true as a factual matter&para;<br>that a prisoner’s fate is not controlled by the police who&para;<br>come to interrogate him, how is the prisoner supposed to&para;<br>know that? As the Court itself admits, compulsion is&para;<br>likely when a suspect’s “captors appear to control [his]&para;<br>fate,” ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). But&para;<br>when a guard informs a suspect that he must go speak&para;<br>with police, it will “appear” to the prisoner that the guard&para;<br>and police are not independent. “Questioning by captors,&para;<br>who appear to control the suspect’s fate, may create mutu­&para;<br>ally reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will&para;<br>weaken the suspect’s will.” Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.

Second, because police know that their&para;<br>suspect is otherwise detained, there is no need necessarily to resolve&para;<br>the case quickly. Police can comfortably bide their time, interrogating&para;<br>and reinterrogating their suspect until he slips up.

Yet under the Court’s analysis, had Roberson&para;<br>been held long enough that he had become “accustomed” to the deten­&para;<br>tion facility, ante, at 14, there would have been a break in custody&para;<br>between each interrogation. Thus, despite the fact that coercive pres­&para;<br>sures “may increase as custody is prolonged,” Minnick, 498 U. S., at&para;<br>153, the real problem in Roberson may have been that the police did not&para;<br>leave him sitting in jail for long enough.&para;<br>This problem of pretrial custody also highlights a tension with the&para;<br>Court’s decision last Term in Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2009). In Montejo, the Court overturned Michigan v. Jackson, 475&para;<br>U. S. 625, 636 (1986), which had protected an accused’s Sixth Amend­&para;<br>ment right to counsel by “forbidding police to initiate interrogation of a&para;<br>criminal defendant once he has requested counsel at an arraignment or&para;<br>similar proceeding.” 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). In so doing, the&para;<br>Court emphasized that because the Edwards “regime suffices to protect&para;<br>the integrity of ‘a suspect’s voluntary choice not to speak outside his&para;<br>lawyer’s presence,’ before his arraignment, it is hard to see why it&para;<br>would not also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment.”&para;<br>556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162,&para;<br>175 (2001) (KENNEDY, J., concurring); citation omitted). But typically,&para;<br>after arraignment, defendants are released on bail or placed in deten­&para;<br>tion facilities, both of which, according to the majority’s logic, some­&para;<br>times constitute breaks in custody. How then, under the Court’s&para;<br>decision today, will Edwards serve the role that the Court placed on it&para;<br>in Montejo?&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tive power. But certain things change over time. An&para;<br>indigent suspect who took police at their word that they&para;<br>would provide an attorney probably will feel that he has&para;<br>“been denied the counsel he has clearly requested,”&para;<br>Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686, when police begin to question&para;<br>him, without a lawyer, only 14 days later.15 But, when a&para;<br>suspect has been left alone for a significant period of time,&para;<br>he is not as likely to draw such conclusions when the&para;<br>police interrogate him again.16 It is concededly “impossi­&para;<br>ble to determine with precision” where to draw such a line.&para;<br>Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 521 (1972). In the case&para;<br>before us, however, the suspect was returned to the gen­&para;<br>eral prison population for 2½ years. I am convinced that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 The Court responds that “[i]f confidence in the police’s promise to&para;<br>provide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards would not have applied&para;<br>in Minnick, where the suspect in continuing custody actually met with&para;<br>appointed counsel.” Ante, at 17–18. But my view is not that “confi­&para;<br>dence in the police’s promise to provide counsel” is “the touchtone.”&para;<br>Ante, at 17. Rather, my view is that although an appropriate break in&para;<br>custody will mitigate many of the reasons that custodial reinterrogation&para;<br>of a suspect who requested counsel is inherently compelling, it will not&para;<br>mitigate the effect of an indigent detainee believing that he has “been&para;<br>denied the counsel he has clearly requested,” Roberson, 486 U. S., at&para;<br>686. If police tell an indigent suspect that he is not required to speak&para;<br>without an attorney, and that they will provide him with an attorney,&para;<br>and that suspect asserts his right to an attorney, but police nonetheless&para;<br>do not provide an attorney and reinterrogate him (even if there was a&para;<br>break in custody between the interrogations), the indigent suspect is&para;<br>likely to feel that the police lied to him or are ignoring his rights. This&para;<br>view is not in tension with Minnick. Minnick holds only that consulta­&para;<br>tion with an attorney between interrogations is not sufficient to end the&para;<br>Edwards presumption and therefore that when there has been no break&para;<br>in custody, “counsel’s presence at interrogation,” 498 U. S., at 152, is&para;<br>necessary to address the compulsion with which the Edwards line of&para;<br>cases is concerned.&para;<br>16 I do not doubt that some of the compulsion caused by reinterrogat­&para;<br>ing an indigent suspect without providing a lawyer may survive even a&para;<br>break in custody and a very long passage of time. The relevant point&para;<br>here is more limited: A long break in time, far longer than 14 days,&para;<br>diminishes, rather than eliminates, that compulsion.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MARYLAND v. SHATZER&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>this period of time is sufficient. I therefore concur in the&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
