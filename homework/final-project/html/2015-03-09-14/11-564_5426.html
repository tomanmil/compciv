Based on the alert, the officers obtained a warrant for a search, which revealed marijuana plants;&para;<br>Jardines was charged with trafficking in cannabis. The Supreme&para;<br>Court of Florida approved the trial court’s decision to suppress the&para;<br>evidence, holding that the officers had engaged in a Fourth Amendment search unsupported by probable cause.&para;<br>Held: The investigation of Jardines’ home was a “search” within the&para;<br>meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 3–10.&para;<br>(a) When “the Government obtains information by physically intruding” on persons, houses, papers, or effects, “a ‘search’ within the&para;<br>original meaning of the Fourth Amendment” has “undoubtedly occurred.” United States v. Jones, 565 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3. Pp. 3–4.&para;<br>(b) At the Fourth Amendment’s “very core” stands “the right of a&para;<br>man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S.&para;<br>505, 511. The area “immediately surrounding and associated with&para;<br>the home”—the curtilage—is “part of the home itself for Fourth&para;<br>Amendment purposes.” Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, 180.&para;<br>The officers entered the curtilage here: The front porch is the classic&para;<br>exemplar of an area “to which the activity of home life extends.” Id.,&para;<br>at 182, n. 12. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(c) The officers’ entry was not explicitly or implicitly invited. Officers need not “shield their eyes” when passing by a home “on public&para;<br>thoroughfares,” California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213, but “no man&para;<br>can set his foot upon his neighbour’s close without his leave,” Entick&para;<br>v. Carrington, 2 Wils. K. B. 275, 291, 95 Eng. Rep. 807, 817. A police&para;<br>officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home in hopes of&para;<br>speaking to its occupants, because that is “no more than any private&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>citizen might do.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. But the scope&para;<br>of a license is limited not only to a particular area but also to a specific purpose, and there is no customary invitation to enter the curtilage&para;<br>simply to conduct a search.

One month later, the Department and the&para;<br>Drug Enforcement Administration sent a joint surveillance&para;<br>team to Jardines’ home. Detective Pedraja was part of&para;<br>that team. He watched the home for fifteen minutes and&para;<br>saw no vehicles in the driveway or activity around the&para;<br>home, and could not see inside because the blinds were&para;<br>drawn. Detective Pedraja then approached Jardines’&para;<br>home accompanied by Detective Douglas Bartelt, a trained&para;<br>canine handler who had just arrived at the scene with his&para;<br>drug-sniffing dog. The dog was trained to detect the scent&para;<br>of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and several other drugs,&para;<br>indicating the presence of any of these substances through&para;<br>particular behavioral changes recognizable by his handler.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Detective Bartelt had the dog on a six-foot leash, owing&para;<br>in part to the dog’s “wild” nature, App. to Pet. for Cert. A–&para;<br>35, and tendency to dart around erratically while searching. As the dog approached Jardines’ front porch, he&para;<br>apparently sensed one of the odors he had been trained to&para;<br>detect, and began energetically exploring the area for the&para;<br>strongest point source of that odor. As Detective Bartelt&para;<br>explained, the dog “began tracking that airborne odor by&para;<br>. . . tracking back and forth,” engaging in what is called&para;<br>“bracketing,” “back and forth, back and forth.” Id., at A–&para;<br>33 to A–34. Detective Bartelt gave the dog “the full six&para;<br>feet of the leash plus whatever safe distance [he could]&para;<br>give him” to do this—he testified that he needed to give&para;<br>the dog “as much distance as I can.” Id., at A–35. And&para;<br>Detective Pedraja stood back while this was occurring, so&para;<br>that he would not “get knocked over” when the dog was&para;<br>“spinning around trying to find” the source. Id., at A–38.&para;<br>After sniffing the base of the front door, the dog sat,&para;<br>which is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor’s&para;<br>strongest point. Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog&para;<br>away from the door and returned to his vehicle. He left&para;<br>the scene after informing Detective Pedraja that there had&para;<br>been a positive alert for narcotics.&para;<br>On the basis of what he had learned at the home, Detective Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to&para;<br>search the residence. When the warrant was executed later&para;<br>that day, Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested; the&para;<br>search revealed marijuana plants, and he was charged&para;<br>with trafficking in cannabis.&para;<br>At trial, Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana&para;<br>plants on the ground that the canine investigation was an&para;<br>unreasonable search. The trial court granted the motion,&para;<br>and the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed.&para;<br>On a petition for discretionary review, the Florida Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Third District&para;<br>Court of Appeal and approved the trial court’s decision to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>suppress, holding (as relevant here) that the use of the&para;<br>trained narcotics dog to investigate Jardines’ home was&para;<br>a Fourth Amendment search unsupported by probable&para;<br>cause, rendering invalid the warrant based upon information gathered in that search. 73 So. 3d 34 (2011).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, limited to the question of whether&para;<br>the officers’ behavior was a search within the meaning of&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment. 565 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that&para;<br>the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,&para;<br>papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and&para;<br>seizures, shall not be violated.” The Amendment establishes a simple baseline, one that for much of our history&para;<br>formed the exclusive basis for its protections: When “the&para;<br>Government obtains information by physically intruding”&para;<br>on persons, houses, papers, or effects, “a ‘search’ within&para;<br>the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment” has “undoubtedly occurred.” United States v. Jones, 565 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, n. 3 (2012) (slip op., at 6, n. 3). By reason of&para;<br>our decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347&para;<br>(1967), property rights “are not the sole measure of Fourth&para;<br>Amendment violations,” Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S.&para;<br>56, 64 (1992)—but though Katz may add to the baseline, it&para;<br>does not subtract anything from the Amendment’s protections “when the Government does engage in [a] physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area,” United&para;<br>States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J.,&para;<br>concurring in the judgment).&para;<br>That principle renders this case a straightforward one.&para;<br>The officers were gathering information in an area belonging to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house—&para;<br>in the curtilage of the house, which we have held enjoys&para;<br>protection as part of the home itself. And they gathered&para;<br>that information by physically entering and occupying the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>area to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment “indicates with some precision&para;<br>the places and things encompassed by its protections”:&para;<br>persons, houses, papers, and effects. Oliver v. United&para;<br>States, 466 U. S. 170, 176 (1984). The Fourth Amendment&para;<br>does not, therefore, prevent all investigations conducted&para;<br>on private property; for example, an officer may (subject to&para;<br>Katz) gather information in what we have called “open&para;<br>fields”—even if those fields are privately owned—because&para;<br>such fields are not enumerated in the Amendment’s text.&para;<br>Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924).&para;<br>But when it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home&para;<br>is first among equals. At the Amendment’s “very core”&para;<br>stands “the right of a man to retreat into his own home&para;<br>and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511&para;<br>(1961). This right would be of little practical value if the&para;<br>State’s agents could stand in a home’s porch or side garden and trawl for evidence with impunity; the right to&para;<br>retreat would be significantly diminished if the police&para;<br>could enter a man’s property to observe his repose from&para;<br>just outside the front window.&para;<br>We therefore regard the area “immediately surrounding&para;<br>and associated with the home”—what our cases call the&para;<br>curtilage—as “part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.” Oliver, supra, at 180. That principle has&para;<br>ancient and durable roots. Just as the distinction between&para;<br>the home and the open fields is “as old as the common&para;<br>law,” Hester, supra, at 59, so too is the identity of home&para;<br>and what Blackstone called the “curtilage or homestall,”&para;<br>for the “house protects and privileges all its branches and&para;<br>appurtenants.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the&para;<br>Laws of England 223, 225 (1769). This area around the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>home is “intimately linked to the home, both physically&para;<br>and psychologically,” and is where “privacy expectations&para;<br>are most heightened.” California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207,&para;<br>213 (1986).&para;<br>While the boundaries of the curtilage are generally&para;<br>“clearly marked,” the “conception defining the curtilage” is&para;<br>at any rate familiar enough that it is “easily understood&para;<br>from our daily experience.” Oliver, 466 U. S., at 182, n. 12.&para;<br>Here there is no doubt that the officers entered it: The&para;<br>front porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to&para;<br>the home and “to which the activity of home life extends.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Since the officers’ investigation took place in a constitutionally protected area, we turn to the question of whether&para;<br>it was accomplished through an unlicensed physical intrusion.1 While law enforcement officers need not “shield&para;<br>their eyes” when passing by the home “on public thoroughfares,” Ciraolo, 476 U. S., at 213, an officer’s leave to&para;<br>gather information is sharply circumscribed when he steps&para;<br>off those thoroughfares and enters the Fourth Amendment’s protected areas. In permitting, for example, visual&para;<br>observation of the home from “public navigable airspace,”&para;<br>we were careful to note that it was done “in a physically&para;<br>nonintrusive manner.” Ibid. Entick v. Carrington, 2 Wils.&para;<br>K. B. 275, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K. B. 1765), a case “undoubtedly familiar” to “every American statesman” at the time&para;<br>of the Founding, Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 At oral argument, the State and its amicus the Solicitor General&para;<br>argued that Jardines conceded in the lower courts that the officers had&para;<br>a right to be where they were. This misstates the record. Jardines&para;<br>conceded nothing more than the unsurprising proposition that the officers could have lawfully approached his home to knock on the front&para;<br>door in hopes of speaking with him. Of course, that is not what they&para;<br>did.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1886), states the general rule clearly: “[O]ur law holds the&para;<br>property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his&para;<br>foot upon his neighbour’s close without his leave.” 2 Wils.&para;<br>K. B., at 291, 95 Eng. Rep., at 817. As it is undisputed&para;<br>that the detectives had all four of their feet and all four of&para;<br>their companion’s firmly planted on the constitutionally&para;<br>protected extension of Jardines’ home, the only question is&para;<br>whether he had given his leave (even implicitly) for them&para;<br>to do so. He had not.&para;<br>“A license may be implied from the habits of the country,” notwithstanding the “strict rule of the English common law as to entry upon a close.” McKee v. Gratz, 260&para;<br>U. S. 127, 136 (1922) (Holmes, J.). We have accordingly&para;<br>recognized that “the knocker on the front door is treated&para;<br>as an invitation or license to attempt an entry, justifying&para;<br>ingress to the home by solicitors, hawkers and peddlers&para;<br>of all kinds.” Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622, 626&para;<br>(1951). This implicit license typically permits the visitor&para;<br>to approach the home by the front path, knock promptly,&para;<br>wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to&para;<br>linger longer) leave. Complying with the terms of that&para;<br>traditional invitation does not require fine-grained legal&para;<br>knowledge; it is generally managed without incident by&para;<br>the Nation’s Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters.2 Thus, a&para;<br>police officer not armed with a warrant may approach a&para;<br>home and knock, precisely because that is “no more than&para;<br>any private citizen might do.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 With this much, the dissent seems to agree—it would inquire into&para;<br>“ ‘the appearance of things,’ ” post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.), what is&para;<br>“typica[l]” for a visitor, ibid., what might cause “alarm” to a “resident of&para;<br>the premises,” ibid., what is “expected” of “ordinary visitors,” ibid., and&para;<br>what would be expected from a “ ‘reasonably respectful citizen,’ ” post, at&para;<br>7. These are good questions. But their answers are incompatible with&para;<br>the dissent’s outcome, which is presumably why the dissent does not&para;<br>even try to argue that it would be customary, usual, reasonable, respectful, ordinary, typical, nonalarming, etc., for a stranger to explore&para;<br>the curtilage of the home with trained drug dogs.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16).&para;<br>But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area&para;<br>around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating&para;<br>evidence is something else. There is no customary invitation to do that. An invitation to engage in canine forensic&para;<br>investigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of&para;<br>hanging a knocker.3 To find a visitor knocking on the door&para;<br>is routine (even if sometimes unwelcome); to spot that&para;<br>same visitor exploring the front path with a metal detector, or marching his bloodhound into the garden before&para;<br>saying hello and asking permission, would inspire most&para;<br>of us to—well, call the police. The scope of a license—&para;<br>express or implied—is limited not only to a particular area&para;<br>but also to a specific purpose. Consent at a traffic stop to&para;<br>an officer’s checking out an anonymous tip that there is a&para;<br>body in the trunk does not permit the officer to rummage&para;<br>through the trunk for narcotics. Here, the background&para;<br>social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not&para;<br>invite him there to conduct a search.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The dissent insists that our argument must rest upon “the particular instrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor of marijuana”—the dog. Post, at 8. It is not the dog that is the problem, but the&para;<br>behavior that here involved use of the dog. We think a typical person&para;<br>would find it “ ‘a cause for great alarm’ ” (the kind of reaction the dissent quite rightly relies upon to justify its no-night-visits rule, post,&para;<br>at 5) to find a stranger snooping about his front porch with or without&para;<br>a dog. The dissent would let the police do whatever they want by way&para;<br>of gathering evidence so long as they stay on the base-path, to use a&para;<br>baseball analogy—so long as they “stick to the path that is typically&para;<br>used to approach a front door, such as a paved walkway.” Ibid. From&para;<br>that vantage point they can presumably peer into the house through&para;<br>binoculars with impunity. That is not the law, as even the State concedes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.&para;<br>4 The dissent argues, citing King, that “gathering evidence—even&para;<br>damning evidence—is a lawful activity that falls within the scope of the&para;<br>license to approach.” Post, at 7. That is a false generalization. What&para;<br>King establishes is that it is not a Fourth Amendment search to approach the home in order to speak with the occupant, because all are&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The State points to our decisions holding that the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant. See Ashcroft v.&para;<br>al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___ (2011); Whren v. United States, 517&para;<br>U. S. 806 (1996). But those cases merely hold that a stop&para;<br>or search that is objectively reasonable is not vitiated by&para;<br>the fact that the officer’s real reason for making the stop&para;<br>or search has nothing to do with the validating reason.&para;<br>Thus, the defendant will not be heard to complain that&para;<br>although he was speeding the officer’s real reason for the&para;<br>stop was racial harassment. See id., at 810, 813. Here,&para;<br>however, the question before the court is precisely whether&para;<br>the officer’s conduct was an objectively reasonable search.&para;<br>As we have described, that depends upon whether the&para;<br>officers had an implied license to enter the porch, which in&para;<br>turn depends upon the purpose for which they entered.&para;<br>Here, their behavior objectively reveals a purpose to conduct a search, which is not what anyone would think he&para;<br>had license to do.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The State argues that investigation by a forensic narcotics dog by definition cannot implicate any legitimate privacy interest. The State cites for authority our decisions&para;<br>in United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), United&para;<br>States v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109 (1984), and Illinois v.&para;<br>Caballes, 543 U. S. 405 (2005), which held, respectively,&para;<br>that canine inspection of luggage in an airport, chemical&para;<br>testing of a substance that had fallen from a parcel in&para;<br>transit, and canine inspection of an automobile during a&para;<br>lawful traffic stop, do not violate the “reasonable expectation of privacy” described in Katz.&para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>invited to do that. The mere “purpose of discovering information,” post,&para;<br>at 8, in the course of engaging in that permitted conduct does not cause&para;<br>it to violate the Fourth Amendment. But no one is impliedly invited to&para;<br>enter the protected premises of the home in order to do nothing but&para;<br>conduct a search.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Just last Term, we considered an argument much like&para;<br>this. Jones held that tracking an automobile’s whereabouts using a physically-mounted GPS receiver is a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment search. The Government argued that the&para;<br>Katz standard “show[ed] that no search occurred,” as the&para;<br>defendant had “no ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ ” in&para;<br>his whereabouts on the public roads, Jones, 565 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 5)—a proposition with at least as much&para;<br>support in our case law as the one the State marshals&para;<br>here. See, e.g., United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 278&para;<br>(1983). But because the GPS receiver had been physically&para;<br>mounted on the defendant’s automobile (thus intruding on&para;<br>his “effects”), we held that tracking the vehicle’s movements was a search: a person’s “Fourth Amendment rights&para;<br>do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.” Jones,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). The Katz reasonableexpectations test “has been added to, not substituted&para;<br>for,” the traditional property-based understanding of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment, and so is unnecessary to consider&para;<br>when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas. Jones, supra, at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 8).&para;<br>Thus, we need not decide whether the officers’ investigation of Jardines’ home violated his expectation of privacy&para;<br>under Katz. One virtue of the Fourth Amendment’s&para;<br>property-rights baseline is that it keeps easy cases easy.&para;<br>That the officers learned what they learned only by physically intruding on Jardines’ property to gather evidence is&para;<br>enough to establish that a search occurred.&para;<br>For a related reason we find irrelevant the State’s argument (echoed by the dissent) that forensic dogs have&para;<br>been commonly used by police for centuries. This argument is apparently directed to our holding in Kyllo v.&para;<br>United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), that surveillance of&para;<br>the home is a search where “the Government uses a device&para;<br>that is not in general public use” to “explore details of the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.” Id., at 40 (emphasis added). But&para;<br>the implication of that statement (inclusio unius est exclusio alterius) is that when the government uses a physical&para;<br>intrusion to explore details of the home (including its&para;<br>curtilage), the antiquity of the tools that they bring along&para;<br>is irrelevant.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The government’s use of trained police dogs to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings is a&para;<br>“search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.&para;<br>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

A stranger&para;<br>comes to the front door of your home carrying super-highpowered binoculars. See ante, at 7, n. 3. He doesn’t knock&para;<br>or say hello.

Like the binoculars, a&para;<br>drug-detection dog is a specialized device for discovering&para;<br>objects not in plain view (or plain smell). And as in the&para;<br>hypothetical above, that device was aimed here at a&para;<br>home—the most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of&para;<br>all the places and things the Fourth Amendment protects.&para;<br>Was this activity a trespass? Yes, as the Court holds today. Was it also an invasion of privacy? Yes, that as well.&para;<br>The Court today treats this case under a property rubric; I write separately to note that I could just as happily&para;<br>have decided it by looking to Jardines’ privacy interests. A&para;<br>decision along those lines would have looked . . . well,&para;<br>much like this one. It would have talked about “ ‘the right&para;<br>of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free&para;<br>from unreasonable governmental intrusion.’ ” Ante, at 4&para;<br>(quoting Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511&para;<br>(1961)). It would have insisted on maintaining the “practical value” of that right by preventing police officers from&para;<br>standing in an adjacent space and “trawl[ing] for evidence&para;<br>with impunity.” Ante, at 4. It would have explained that&para;<br>“ ‘privacy expectations are most heightened’ ” in the home&para;<br>and the surrounding area. Ante, at 4–5 (quoting California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986)). And it would&para;<br>have determined that police officers invade those shared&para;<br>expectations when they use trained canine assistants to&para;<br>reveal within the confines of a home what they could not&para;<br>otherwise have found there. See ante, at 6–7, and nn. 2–3.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The law of property “naturally enough influence[s]”&para;<br>our “shared social expectations” of what places should be&para;<br>free from governmental incursions. Georgia v. Randolph,&para;<br>547 U.

And so the sentiment “my home is&para;<br>my own,” while originating in property law, now also&para;<br>denotes a common understanding—extending even beyond&para;<br>that law’s formal protections—about an especially private&para;<br>sphere. Jardines’ home was his property; it was also his&para;<br>most intimate and familiar space. The analysis proceeding from each of those facts, as today’s decision reveals,&para;<br>runs mostly along the same path.&para;<br>I can think of only one divergence: If we had decided&para;<br>this case on privacy grounds, we would have realized that&para;<br>Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), already resolved it.1 The Kyllo Court held that police officers conducted a search when they used a thermal-imaging device&para;<br>to detect heat emanating from a private home, even&para;<br>though they committed no trespass. Highlighting our&para;<br>intention to draw both a “firm” and a “bright” line at “the&para;<br>entrance to the house,” id., at 40, we announced the following rule:&para;<br>“Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is&para;<br>not in general public use, to explore details of the&para;<br>home that would previously have been unknowable&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The dissent claims, alternatively, that Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S.&para;<br>405, 409–410 (2005), controls this case (or nearly does). See post, at 9,&para;<br>11. But Caballes concerned a drug-detection dog’s sniff of an automobile during a traffic stop. See also Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2013). And we have held, over and over again, that people’s expectations of privacy are much lower in their cars than in their homes. See,&para;<br>e.g., Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 345 (2009); Wyoming v. Houghton,&para;<br>526 U. S. 295, 303 (1999); New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, 115 (1986);&para;<br>Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U.

As Kyllo made clear,&para;<br>the “sense-enhancing” tool at issue may be “crude” or&para;<br>“sophisticated,” may be old or new (drug-detection dogs&para;<br>actually go back not “12,000 years” or “centuries,” post, at&para;<br>2, 8, 12, but only a few decades), may be either smaller or&para;<br>bigger than a breadbox; still, “at least where (as here)” the&para;<br>device is not “in general public use,” training it on a home&para;<br>violates our “minimal expectation of privacy”—an expectation “that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable.” 533 U. S., at 34, 36.2 That does not mean the device&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent’s other principal reason for concluding that no violation&para;<br>of privacy occurred in this case—that police officers themselves might&para;<br>detect an aroma wafting from a house—works no better. If officers can&para;<br>smell drugs coming from a house, they can use that information; a&para;<br>human sniff is not a search, we can all agree. But it does not follow&para;<br>that a person loses his expectation of privacy in the many scents within&para;<br>his home that (his own nose capably tells him) are not usually detectible by humans standing outside. And indeed, Kyllo already decided as&para;<br>much. In response to an identical argument from the dissent in that&para;<br>case, see 533 U. S., at 43 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that humans&para;<br>can sometimes detect “heat emanating from a building”), the Kyllo&para;<br>Court stated: “The dissent’s comparison of the thermal imaging to&para;<br>various circumstances in which outside observers might be able to&para;<br>perceive, without technology, the heat of the home . . . is quite irrelevant. The fact that equivalent information could sometimes be obtained by other means does not make lawful the use of means that&para;<br>violate the Fourth Amendment. . . .

Thus, trespass law provides no support for the&para;<br>Court’s holding today.&para;<br>The Court’s decision is also inconsistent with the&para;<br>reasonable-expectations-of-privacy test that the Court&para;<br>adopted in Katz v.

This rule encompasses categories of visitors whom most homeowners&para;<br>almost certainly wish to allow to approach their front&para;<br>doors—friends, relatives, mail carriers, persons making&para;<br>deliveries.

The license is&para;<br>limited to the amount of time it would customarily take to&para;<br>approach the door, pause long enough to see if someone is&para;<br>home, and (if not expressly invited to stay longer), leave.&para;<br>As I understand the law of trespass and the scope of the&para;<br>implied license, a visitor who adheres to these limitations&para;<br>is not necessarily required to ring the doorbell, knock on&para;<br>the door, or attempt to speak with an occupant. For example, mail carriers, persons making deliveries, and individuals distributing flyers may leave the items they&para;<br>are carrying and depart without making any attempt to&para;<br>converse. A pedestrian or motorist looking for a particular&para;<br>address may walk up to a front door in order to check a&para;<br>house number that is hard to see from the sidewalk or&para;<br>road.

See ante, at&para;<br>6. As we recognized in Kentucky v. King, 563 U.

In other&para;<br>words, gathering evidence—even damning evidence—is a&para;<br>lawful activity that falls within the scope of the license to&para;<br>approach.

But a police officer&para;<br>who approaches the front door of a house in accordance&para;<br>with the limitations already discussed may gather evidence by means other than talking.

So the Court’s “objective purpose” argument&para;<br>cannot stand.&para;<br>What the Court must fall back on, then, is the particular&para;<br>instrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor&para;<br>of marijuana, namely, his dog. But in the entire body of&para;<br>common-law decisions, the Court has not found a single&para;<br>case holding that a visitor to the front door of a home&para;<br>commits a trespass if the visitor is accompanied by a dog&para;<br>on a leash.

But where is the support in the law&para;<br>of trespass for this proposition? Dogs’ keen sense of smell&para;<br>has been used in law enforcement for centuries. The&para;<br>antiquity of this practice is evidenced by a Scottish law&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>from 1318 that made it a crime to “disturb a tracking dog&para;<br>or the men coming with it for pursuing thieves or seizing&para;<br>malefactors.” K. Brown et al., The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, (St Andrews, 2007–2013),&para;<br>online at http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1318/9. If bringing a&para;<br>tracking dog to the front door of a home constituted a&para;<br>trespass, one would expect at least one case to have arisen&para;<br>during the past 800 years. But the Court has found none.&para;<br>For these reasons, the real law of trespass provides no&para;<br>support for the Court’s holding today. While the Court&para;<br>claims that its reasoning has “ancient and durable&para;<br>roots,” ante, at 4, its trespass rule is really a newly struck&para;<br>counterfeit.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The concurring opinion attempts to provide an alternative ground for today’s decision, namely, that Detective&para;<br>Bartelt’s conduct violated respondent’s reasonable expectations of privacy. But we have already rejected a very&para;<br>similar, if not identical argument, see Illinois v. Caballes,&para;<br>543 U. S. 405, 409–410 (2005), and in any event I see no&para;<br>basis for concluding that the occupants of a dwelling have&para;<br>a reasonable expectation of privacy in odors that emanate&para;<br>from the dwelling and reach spots where members of the&para;<br>public may lawfully stand.&para;<br>It is clear that the occupant of a house has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to odors that can be&para;<br>smelled by human beings who are standing in such places.&para;<br>See United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478, 482 (1985)&para;<br>(“After the officers came closer and detected the distinct&para;<br>odor of marihuana, they had probable cause to believe&para;<br>that the vehicles contained contraband”); United States&para;<br>v. Ventresca, 380 U. S. 102, 111 (1965) (scent of fermenting mash supported probable cause for warrant); United&para;<br>States v. Johnston, 497 F. 2d 397, 398 (CA9 1974) (there&para;<br>is no “reasonable expectation of privacy from drug agents&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>with inquisitive nostrils”). And I would not draw a line&para;<br>between odors that can be smelled by humans and those&para;<br>that are detectible only by dogs.&para;<br>Consider the situation from the point of view of the&para;<br>occupant of a building in which marijuana is grown or&para;<br>methamphetamine is manufactured. Would such an occupant reason as follows? “I know that odors may emanate from my building and that atmospheric conditions,&para;<br>such as the force and direction of the wind, may affect the&para;<br>strength of those odors when they reach a spot where&para;<br>members of the public may lawfully stand. I also know&para;<br>that some people have a much more acute sense of smell&para;<br>than others,6 and I have no idea who might be standing in&para;<br>one of the spots in question when the odors from my house&para;<br>reach that location. In addition, I know that odors coming&para;<br>from my building, when they reach these locations, may be&para;<br>strong enough to be detected by a dog. But I am confident&para;<br>that they will be so faint that they cannot be smelled by&para;<br>any human being.” Such a finely tuned expectation would&para;<br>be entirely unrealistic, and I see no evidence that society&para;<br>is prepared to recognize it as reasonable.&para;<br>In an attempt to show that respondent had a reasonable&para;<br>expectation of privacy in the odor of marijuana wafting&para;<br>from his house, the concurrence argues that this case is&para;<br>just like Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), which&para;<br>held that police officers conducted a search when they&para;<br>used a thermal imaging device to detect heat emanating&para;<br>from a house. Ante, at 3–4 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). This&para;<br>Court, however, has already rejected the argument that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Some humans naturally have a much more acute sense of smell&para;<br>than others, and humans can be trained to detect and distinguish odors&para;<br>that could not be detected without such training. See E. Hancock, A&para;<br>Primer on Smell, http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/996web/smell.html. Some&para;<br>individuals employed in the perfume and wine industries, for example,&para;<br>have an amazingly acute sense of smell. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the use of a drug-sniffing dog is the same as the use of a&para;<br>thermal imaging device. See Caballes, 543 U. S., at 409–&para;<br>410. The very argument now advanced by the concurrence&para;<br>appears in Justice Souter’s Caballes dissent. See id., at&para;<br>413, and n. 3. But the Court was not persuaded.&para;<br>Contrary to the interpretation propounded by the concurrence, Kyllo is best understood as a decision about the&para;<br>use of new technology. The Kyllo Court focused on the fact&para;<br>that the thermal imaging device was a form of “senseenhancing technology” that was “not in general public&para;<br>use,” and it expressed concern that citizens would be “at&para;<br>the mercy of advancing technology” if its use was not&para;<br>restricted. 533 U. S., at 34–35. A dog, however, is not a&para;<br>new form of “technology or a “device.” And, as noted, the&para;<br>use of dogs’ acute sense of smell in law enforcement dates&para;<br>back many centuries.&para;<br>The concurrence suggests that a Kyllo-based decision&para;<br>would be “much like” the actual decision of the Court, but&para;<br>that is simply not so. The holding of the Court is based on&para;<br>what the Court sees as a “ ‘physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting United States&para;<br>v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment)). As a result, it does not apply when a&para;<br>dog alerts while on a public sidewalk or street or in the&para;<br>corridor of a building to which the dog and handler have&para;<br>been lawfully admitted.&para;<br>The concurrence’s Kyllo-based approach would have a&para;<br>much wider reach. When the police used the thermal&para;<br>imaging device in Kyllo, they were on a public street, 533&para;<br>U. S., at 29, and “committed no trespass.” Ante, at 3.&para;<br>Therefore, if a dog’s nose is just like a thermal imaging&para;<br>device for Fourth Amendment purposes, a search would&para;<br>occur if a dog alerted while on a public sidewalk or in the&para;<br>corridor of an apartment building. And the same would be&para;<br>true if the dog was trained to sniff, not for marijuana, but&para;<br>for more dangerous quarry, such as explosives or for a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. JARDINES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>violent fugitive or kidnaped child. I see no ground for&para;<br>hampering legitimate law enforcement in this way.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The conduct of the police officer in this case did not&para;<br>constitute a trespass and did not violate respondent’s&para;<br>reasonable expectations of privacy. I would hold that this&para;<br>conduct was not a search, and I therefore respectfully&para;<br>dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
