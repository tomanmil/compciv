HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1211. Argued January 18, 2012—Decided March 28, 2012&para;<br>Before passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law&para;<br>provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already&para;<br>entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable aliens seeking entry into the United States. Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an “entry,” upon their return&para;<br>from “innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this country’s borders.” Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 462. In IIRIRA,&para;<br>Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation&para;<br>procedures, creating a uniform “removal” proceeding. See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1229, 1229a. Congress made “admission” the key word, and defined “admission” to mean “the lawful entry of the alien into the&para;<br>United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration&para;<br>officer.” §1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration&para;<br>Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as&para;<br>seeking admission if they have “committed an offense identified in&para;<br>section 1182(a)(2),” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, “a&para;<br>crime involving moral turpitude . . . or conspiracy to commit such a&para;<br>crime,” §1182(a)(2)(A)(i).&para;<br>Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United&para;<br>States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a&para;<br>counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.&para;<br>In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA’s passage,&para;<br>Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents. In&para;<br>2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an&para;<br>immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking “admission”&para;<br>based on his 1994 conviction. At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief&para;<br>under former §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The&para;<br>Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed. In 2008, Vartelas filed&para;<br>with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other&para;<br>lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA’s new “admission”&para;<br>provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status&para;<br>based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the motion. The&para;<br>Second Circuit affirmed. Rejecting Vartelas’ argument that IIRIRA&para;<br>operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime&para;<br>at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in&para;<br>force at the time of his conviction. Pp. 7–17.&para;<br>(a) Under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by&para;<br>Vartelas, courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v.&para;<br>USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 263. The presumption against retroactive legislation “embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than&para;<br>our Republic.” Id., at 265. Numerous decisions of this Court have&para;<br>invoked Justice Story’s formulation for determining when a law’s retrospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as relevant here, when such application would “attac[h] a new disability, in&para;<br>respect to transactions or considerations already past,” Society for&para;<br>Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767. See, e.g., INS&para;<br>v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 321; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex&para;<br>rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 947; Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 283. Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a “new disability,” effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, “in respect&para;<br>to” past events, specifically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and&para;<br>punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRA’s passage.&para;<br>Congress did not expressly prescribe §1101(a)(13)’s temporal reach.&para;<br>The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether&para;<br>application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to Vartelas “would have retroactive effect” Congress did not authorize. See id., at 280. Vartelas&para;<br>presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.&para;<br>Beyond genuine doubt §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)’s restraint on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a “new disability.” Once&para;<br>able to journey abroad to, e.g., fulfill religious obligations or respond&para;<br>to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe&para;<br>sanction. See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___. The Gov-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ernment suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States. But losing the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the&para;<br>more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family&para;<br>members.&para;<br>This Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar&para;<br>cases, see Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 559; St. Cyr,&para;<br>533 U. S., at 321–323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less&para;<br>momentous, see Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280–286; Hughes Aircraft,&para;<br>520 U. S., at 946–950. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>(b) The Court finds disingenuous the Government’s argument that&para;<br>no retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant&para;<br>event is the alien’s post-IIRIRA return to the United States. Vartelas’ return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for his “new disability” was his pre-IIRIRA conviction. That past&para;<br>misconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).&para;<br>Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(c) In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroactive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words “committed an&para;<br>offense” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). It reasoned that reliance on the prior&para;<br>law is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and&para;<br>that Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration&para;<br>laws. This reasoning is doubly flawed. A party is not required to&para;<br>show reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 282, n. 35. In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively. St. Cyr is&para;<br>illustrative. There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a&para;<br>criminal charge that made him deportable. Under the immigration&para;<br>law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to&para;<br>apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal proceeding was&para;<br>commenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance&para;<br>of discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct,&para;<br>533 U. S., at 321. Aliens like St. Cyr “almost certainly relied upon&para;<br>th[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead&para;<br>guilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial,” id., at 325. Because&para;<br>applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an “obvious&para;<br>and severe retroactive effect,” ibid., and Congress made no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyr’s case. Vartelas’ case is at least as clear as St. Cyr’s for declining to apply a new&para;<br>law retroactively. St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney General’s discretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an official’s permission, to make short trips to see and assist his parents in Greece.

He&para;<br>pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit&para;<br>security) in 1994, and served a prison sentence of four&para;<br>months for that offense. Vartelas traveled to Greece in&para;<br>2003 to visit his parents. On his return to the United&para;<br>States a week later, he was treated as an inadmissible&para;<br>alien and placed in removal proceedings. Under the law&para;<br>governing at the time of Vartelas’ plea, an alien in his&para;<br>situation could travel abroad for brief periods without&para;<br>jeopardizing his resident alien status. See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1101(a)(13) (1988 ed.), as construed in Rosenberg v.&para;<br>Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).&para;<br>In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration&para;<br>Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110&para;<br>Stat. 3009–546. That Act effectively precluded foreign&para;<br>travel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction&para;<br>like Vartelas’. Under IIRIRA, such aliens, on return from&para;<br>a sojourn abroad, however brief, may be permanently&para;<br>removed from the United States.&para;<br>See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v); §1182(a)(2).&para;<br>This case presents a question of retroactivity not addressed by Congress: As to a lawful permanent resident&para;<br>convicted of a crime before the effective date of IIRIRA,&para;<br>which regime governs, the one in force at the time of&para;<br>the conviction, or IIRIRA? If the former, Vartelas’ brief&para;<br>trip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resident status. If the latter, he may be denied reentry. We&para;<br>conclude that the relevant provision of IIRIRA,&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v), attached a new disability (denial of&para;<br>reentry) in respect to past events (Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA&para;<br>offense, plea, and conviction). Guided by the deeply rooted&para;<br>presumption against retroactive legislation, we hold that&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Vartelas’ conviction.&para;<br>The impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is therefore determined not by&para;<br>IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his&para;<br>conviction.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>Before IIRIRA’s passage, United States immigration law&para;<br>established “two types of proceedings in which aliens can&para;<br>be denied the hospitality of the United States: deportation&para;<br>hearings and exclusion hearings.” Landon v. Plasencia,&para;<br>459 U. S. 21, 25 (1982). Exclusion hearings were held for&para;<br>certain aliens seeking entry to the United States, and&para;<br>deportation hearings were held for certain aliens who had&para;<br>already entered this country. See ibid.&para;<br>Under this regime, “entry” into the United States was&para;<br>defined as “any coming of an alien into the United States,&para;<br>from a foreign port or place.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13) (1988&para;<br>ed.). The statute, however, provided an exception for&para;<br>lawful permanent residents; aliens lawfully residing here&para;<br>were not regarded as making an “entry” if their “departure&para;<br>to a foreign port or place . . . was not intended or reasona-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>bly to be expected by [them] or [their] presence in a foreign&para;<br>port or place . . . was not voluntary.” Ibid. Interpreting&para;<br>this cryptic provision, we held in Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 461–&para;<br>462, that Congress did not intend to exclude aliens long&para;<br>resident in the United States upon their return from&para;<br>“innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this&para;<br>country’s borders.” Instead, the Court determined, Congress meant to rank a once-permanent resident as a new&para;<br>entrant only when the foreign excursion “meaningfully&para;<br>interrupt[ed] . . . the alien’s [U. S.] residence.” Id., at 462.&para;<br>Absent such “disrupti[on]” of the alien’s residency, the&para;<br>alien would not be “subject . . . to the consequences of an&para;<br>‘entry’ into the country on his return.” Ibid.1&para;<br>In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between&para;<br>exclusion and deportation procedures and created a uniform proceeding known as “removal.” See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1229, 1229a; Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 1–2). Congress made “admission” the&para;<br>key word, and defined admission to mean “the lawful&para;<br>entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.”&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration&para;<br>Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. See In re&para;<br>Collado-Munoz, 21 I. &amp; N.

See post, at 6 (“same instinct” operative&para;<br>in Fleuti and this case).&para;<br>2 The BIA determined that the Fleuti doctrine no longer held sway&para;<br>because it was rooted in the “no longer existent definition of ‘entry’ in&para;<br>[the INA].” 21 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 1065. The Board also noted that “Congress . . . amended the law to expressly preserve some, but not all, of&para;<br>the Fleuti doctrine” when it provided that a lawful permanent resident&para;<br>absent from the United States for less than 180 days would not be&para;<br>regarded as seeking an admission except in certain enumerated circumstances, among them, prior commission of a crime of moral turpitude. See ibid. (citing 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>post-IIRIRA, like Vartelas, may be required to “ ‘see[k] an&para;<br>admission’ into the United States, without regard to&para;<br>whether the alien’s departure from the United States&para;<br>might previously have been ranked as ‘brief, casual, and&para;<br>innocent’ under the Fleuti doctrine.” Id., at 1066.&para;<br>An alien seeking “admission” to the United States is&para;<br>subject to various requirements, see, e.g., §1181(a), and&para;<br>cannot gain entry if she is deemed “inadmissible” on any of&para;<br>the numerous grounds set out in the immigration statutes, see §1182. Under IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents&para;<br>are regarded as seeking admission into the United States&para;<br>if they fall into any of six enumerated categories.&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C). Relevant here, the fifth of these categories covers aliens who “ha[ve] committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).&para;<br>Offenses in this category include “a crime involving moral&para;<br>turpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an&para;<br>attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime.”&para;<br>§1182(a)(2)(A)(i).&para;<br>In sum, before IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents who&para;<br>had committed a crime of moral turpitude could, under&para;<br>the Fleuti doctrine, return from brief trips abroad without applying for admission to the United States. Under&para;<br>IIRIRA, such residents are subject to admission procedures, and, potentially, to removal from the United States&para;<br>on grounds of inadmissibility.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Vartelas does not challenge the ruling in Collado-Munoz. We therefore assume, but do not decide, that IIRIRA’s amendments to&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(A) abrogated Fleuti.&para;<br>3 Although IIRIRA created a uniform removal procedure for both&para;<br>excludable and deportable aliens, the list of criminal offenses that&para;<br>subject aliens to exclusion remains separate from the list of offenses&para;<br>that render an alien deportable. These lists are “sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent.” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 2). Pertinent here, although a single crime involving&para;<br>moral turpitude may render an alien inadmissible, it would not render&para;<br>her deportable. See 8 U. S.

He currently lives in&para;<br>the New York area and works as a sales manager for a&para;<br>roofing company.&para;<br>In 1992, Vartelas opened an auto body shop in Queens,&para;<br>New York. One of his business partners used the shop’s&para;<br>photocopier to make counterfeit travelers’ checks. Vartelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individual checks, but Vartelas did not sell the checks or receive&para;<br>any money from the venture. In 1994, he pleaded guilty to&para;<br>conspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities, in&para;<br>violation of 18 U. S. C. §371. He was sentenced to four&para;<br>months’ incarceration, followed by two years’ supervised&para;<br>release.&para;<br>Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging&para;<br>parents in the years after his 1994 conviction; even after&para;<br>the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, his return to the United&para;<br>States from these visits remained uneventful. In January&para;<br>2003, however, when Vartelas returned from a week-long&para;<br>trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an&para;<br>alien seeking “admission.” The officer based this classification on Vartelas’ 1994 conviction. See United States&para;<br>ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U.

See 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994&para;<br>ed.) (repealed 1996).

In&para;<br>evaluating Vartelas’ argument, we note first a matter not&para;<br>disputed by the Government: Congress did not expressly&para;<br>prescribe the temporal reach of the IIRIRA provision in&para;<br>question, 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13). See Landgraf, 511 U. S.,&para;<br>at 280 (Court asks first “whether Congress has expressly&para;<br>prescribed [new §1101(a)(13)’s] proper reach”); Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 11 (Court’s holding in INS v. St. Cyr, 533&para;<br>U. S., at 317–320, “compels the conclusion that Congress&para;<br>has not ‘expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach’ ”&para;<br>(quoting Landgraf, 511 U.

See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 319–320, and&para;<br>n. 43 (setting out further examples). Accordingly, we&para;<br>proceed to the dispositive question whether, as Vartelas&para;<br>maintains, application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to him&para;<br>“would have retroactive effect” Congress did not authorize.&para;<br>See Landgraf, 511 U.

HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>loss at stake was less momentous.&para;<br>In Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884), a&para;<br>pathmarking decision, the Court confronted the “Chinese&para;<br>Restriction Act,” which barred Chinese laborers from&para;<br>reentering the United States without a certificate issued&para;<br>on their departure. The Court held the reentry bar inapplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the&para;<br>Act’s passage and tried to return afterward without a&para;<br>certificate. The Act’s text, the Court observed, was not “so&para;<br>clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt [retroactive&para;<br>application] was the intention of the legislature.” Id., at&para;<br>559.&para;<br>In Landgraf, the question was whether an amendment&para;<br>to Title VII’s ban on employment discrimination authorizing compensatory and punitive damages applied to preenactment conduct. The Court held it did not. No doubt&para;<br>the complaint against the employer charged discrimination that violated the Act at the time it occurred. But&para;<br>compensatory and punitive damages were not then available remedies. The later provision for such damages, the&para;<br>Court determined, operated prospectively only, and did&para;<br>not apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the amendment. See 511 U. S., at 280–&para;<br>286. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court held that a provision removing an affirmative defense to qui tam suits did&para;<br>not apply to pre-enactment fraud. As in Landgraf, the&para;<br>provision attached “a new disability” to past wrongful&para;<br>conduct and therefore could not apply retrospectively&para;<br>unless Congress clearly manifested such an intention.&para;<br>Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.

Rather, it has made the relevant event the alien’s&para;<br>post-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 19–20; post, at 3. We find this argument disingenuous. Vartelas’ return to the United States&para;<br>occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason&para;<br>for the “new disability” imposed on him was not his lawful&para;<br>foreign travel. It was, indeed, his conviction, pre-IIRIRA,&para;<br>of an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude. That&para;<br>past misconduct, in other words, not present travel, is the&para;<br>wrongful activity Congress targeted in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).&para;<br>The Government observes that lower courts have upheld Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act&para;<br>prosecutions that encompassed pre-enactment conduct.&para;<br>See Brief for Respondent 18 (citing United States v.&para;<br>Brown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977), and United&para;<br>States v. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)&para;<br>(per curiam)). But those prosecutions depended on criminal activity, i.e., an act of racketeering occuring after the&para;<br>provision’s effective date. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), in&para;<br>contrast, does not require any showing of criminal conduct&para;<br>postdating IIRIRA’s enactment.&para;<br>Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.

C. §1231(a)(5), an IIRIRA addition, which provides that an alien who reenters the United&para;<br>States after having been removed can be removed again&para;<br>under the same removal order. We held that the provision&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>could be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before&para;<br>IIRIRA’s enactment. Explaining the Court’s decision, we&para;<br>said: “[T]he conduct of remaining in the country . . . is the&para;<br>predicate action; the statute applies to stop an indefinitely&para;<br>continuing violation . . . . It is therefore the alien’s choice&para;<br>to continue his illegal presence . . . after the effective date&para;<br>of the new la[w] that subjects him to the new . . . legal&para;<br>regime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo.” 548&para;<br>U. S., at 44 (emphasis added). Vartelas, we have several&para;<br>times stressed, engaged in no criminal activity after&para;<br>IIRIRA’s passage. He simply took a brief trip to Greece,&para;<br>anticipating a return without incident as in past visits to&para;<br>his parents. No “indefinitely continuing” crime occurred;&para;<br>instead, Vartelas was apprehended because of a preIIRIRA crime he was “helpless to undo.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Government further refers to lower court decisions&para;<br>in cases involving 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which prohibits the&para;<br>possession of firearms by convicted felons. Brief for Respondent 18–19 (citing United States v.

Hemmings, 258&para;<br>F. 3d 587, 594 (CA7 2001)). “[L]ongstanding prohibitions&para;<br>on the possession of firearms by felons,” District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008), however, target a&para;<br>present danger, i.e., the danger posed by felons who bear&para;<br>arms. See, e.g., Pfeifer, 371 F. 3d, at 436 (hazardous conduct that statute targets “occurred after enactment of the&para;<br>statute”); Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of&para;<br>1968, §1201, 82 Stat. 236 (noting hazards involved when&para;<br>felons possess firearms).7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The dissent, see post, at 6, notes two statutes of the same genre:&para;<br>laws prohibiting persons convicted of a sex crime against a victim&para;<br>under 16 years of age from working in jobs involving frequent contact&para;<br>with minors, and laws prohibiting a person “who has been adjudicated&para;<br>as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution” from possessing guns, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(4). The dissent is&para;<br>correct that these statutes do not operate retroactively. Rather, they&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Nor do recidivism sentencing enhancements support the&para;<br>Government’s position. Enhanced punishment imposed&para;<br>for the later offense “ ‘is not to be viewed as . . . [an] additional penalty for the earlier crimes,’ but instead, as a&para;<br>‘stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered&para;<br>to be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive&para;<br>one.’ ” Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 400 (1995)&para;<br>(quoting Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948)). In&para;<br>Vartelas’ case, however, there is no “aggravated . . . repetitive” offense. There is, in contrast, no post-IIRIRA criminal offense at all. Vartelas’ travel abroad and return are&para;<br>“innocent” acts, see Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 462, burdened&para;<br>only because of his pre-IIRIRA offense.&para;<br>In sum, Vartelas’ brief trip abroad post-IIRIRA involved&para;<br>no criminal infraction. IIRIRA disabled him from leaving&para;<br>the United States and returning as a lawful permanent&para;<br>resident. That new disability rested not on any continuing&para;<br>criminal activity, but on a single crime committed years&para;<br>before IIRIRA’s enactment. The antiretroactivity principle&para;<br>instructs against application of the new proscription&para;<br>to render Vartelas a first-time arrival at the country’s&para;<br>gateway.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>address dangers that arise postenactment: sex offenders with a history&para;<br>of child molestation working in close proximity to children, and mentally unstable persons purchasing guns. The act of flying to Greece, in&para;<br>contrast, does not render a lawful permanent resident like Vartelas&para;<br>hazardous. Nor is it plausible that Congress’ solution to the problem of&para;<br>dangerous lawful permanent residents would be to pass a law that&para;<br>would deter such persons from ever leaving the United States.&para;<br>As for student loans, it is unlikely that the provision noted by the&para;<br>dissent, 20 U. S. C. §1091(r), would raise retroactivity questions in the&para;<br>first place. The statute has a prospective thrust. It concerns&para;<br>“[s]uspension of eligibility” when a student receiving a college loan&para;<br>commits a drug crime. The suspension runs “from the date of th[e]&para;<br>conviction” for specified periods, e.g., two years for a second offense of&para;<br>possession. Moreover, eligibility may be restored before the period of&para;<br>ineligibility ends if the student establishes, under prescribed criteria,&para;<br>his rehabilitation.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v.

It matters not that Vartelas may have&para;<br>relied on the prospect of continuing visits to Greece in&para;<br>deciding to plead guilty, the court reasoned. “[I]t would&para;<br>border on the absurd,” the court observed, “to suggest that&para;<br>Vartelas committed his counterfeiting crime in reliance on&para;<br>the immigration laws.” Id., at 120. This reasoning is&para;<br>doubly flawed.&para;<br>As the Government acknowledges, “th[is] Court has not&para;<br>required a party challenging the application of a statute to&para;<br>show [he relied on prior law] in structuring his conduct.”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 25–26. In Landgraf, for example,&para;<br>the issue was the retroactivity of compensatory and punitive damages as remedies for employment discrimination.&para;<br>“[C]oncerns of . . . upsetting expectations are attenuated in&para;<br>the case of intentional employment discrimination,” the&para;<br>Court noted, for such discrimination “has been unlawful&para;<br>for more than a generation.” 511 U.

But&para;<br>“[e]ven when the conduct in question is morally reprehensible or illegal,” the Court added, “a degree of unfairness is&para;<br>inherent whenever the law imposes additional burdens&para;<br>based on conduct that occurred in the past.” Id., at 283,&para;<br>n. 35. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court found that Congress’ 1986 removal of a defense to a qui tam action did&para;<br>not apply to pre-1986 conduct in light of the presumption&para;<br>against retroactivity. 520 U. S., at 941–942.8 As in Land——————&para;<br>8 The deleted defense permitted qui tam defendants to escape liability&para;<br>if the information on which a private plaintiff (relator) relied was&para;<br>already in the Government’s possession.

See 520 U. S., at 947.&para;<br>The operative presumption, after all, is that Congress&para;<br>intends its laws to govern prospectively only. See supra,&para;<br>at 7. “It is a strange ‘presumption,’ ” the Third Circuit&para;<br>commented, “that arises only on . . . a showing [of] actual&para;<br>reliance.” Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F. 3d 480, 491&para;<br>(2004). The essential inquiry, as stated in Landgraf, 511&para;<br>U. S., at 269–270, is “whether the new provision attaches&para;<br>new legal consequences to events completed before its&para;<br>enactment.” That is just what occurred here.&para;<br>In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing&para;<br>immigration law. While the presumption against retroactive application of statutes does not require a showing of&para;<br>detrimental reliance, see Olatunji, 387 F. 3d, at 389–395,&para;<br>reasonable reliance has been noted among the “familiar&para;<br>considerations” animating the presumption, see Landgraf,&para;<br>511 U. S., at 270 (presumption reflects “familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled&para;<br>expectations”). Although not a necessary predicate for invoking the antiretroactivity principle, the likelihood of&para;<br>reliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a&para;<br>newly enacted law prospectively. See Olatunji, 387 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 393 (discussing St. Cyr).&para;<br>St. Cyr is illustrative. That case involved a lawful permanent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge&para;<br>that made him deportable. Under the immigration law in&para;<br>effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible&para;<br>to apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal&para;<br>proceeding was commenced after Congress, in IIRIRA,&para;<br>withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance of discretionary&para;<br>waivers, the Court recognized, “attache[d] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already&para;<br>past.” 533 U.

Since Vartelas returned to the&para;<br>United States after the statute’s effective date, the application of that text to his reentry does not give the statute a&para;<br>retroactive effect.&para;<br>In determining whether a statute applies retroactively,&para;<br>we should concern ourselves with the statute’s actual&para;<br>operation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an&para;<br>abstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns.&para;<br>It is impossible to decide whether a statute’s application&para;<br>is retrospective or prospective without first identifying a&para;<br>reference point—a moment in time to which the statute’s&para;<br>effective date is either subsequent or antecedent. (Otherwise, the obvious question—retroactive in reference to&para;<br>what?—remains unanswered.) In my view, the identity of&para;<br>that reference point turns on the activity a statute is&para;<br>intended to regulate. For any given regulated party, the&para;<br>reference point (or “retroactivity event”) is the moment at&para;<br>which the party does what the statute forbids or fails to do&para;<br>what it requires. See Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 362–&para;<br>363 (1999) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring&para;<br>in judgment); Landgraf, supra, at 291 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgments). With an identified reference point, the&para;<br>retroactivity analysis is simple. If a person has engaged in&para;<br>the primary regulated activity before the statute’s effective&para;<br>date, then the statute’s application would be retroactive.&para;<br>But if a person engages in the primary regulated activity&para;<br>after the statute’s effective date, then the statute’s application is prospective only. In the latter case, the interpretive presumption against retroactivity does not bar the&para;<br>statute’s application.&para;<br>Under that commonsense approach, this is a relatively&para;<br>easy case. Although the class of aliens affected by&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is defined with respect to past crimes,&para;<br>the regulated activity is reentry into the United States. By&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>its terms, the statute is all about controlling admission at&para;<br>the border. It specifies six criteria to identify lawful permanent residents who are subject to formal “admission”&para;<br>procedures, most of which relate to the circumstances of&para;<br>departure, the trip itself, or reentry. The titles of the&para;<br>statutory sections containing §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) confirm&para;<br>its focus on admission, rather than crime: The provision is&para;<br>located within Title III of IIRIRA (“Inspection, Apprehension, Detention, Adjudication, and Removal of Inadmissible and Deportable Aliens”), under Subtitle A (“Revision of&para;<br>Procedures for Removal of Aliens”), and §301 (“Treating&para;<br>Persons Present in the United States Without Authorization as Not Admitted”). 110 Stat. 3009–575. And the&para;<br>specific subsection of IIRIRA at issue (§301(a), entitled&para;<br>“ ‘Admission’ Defined”) is an amendment to the definition&para;<br>of “entry” in the general “Definitions” section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). See ante, at 2–3. The&para;<br>original provision told border officials how to regulate&para;<br>admission—not how to punish crime—and the amendment&para;<br>does as well.&para;<br>Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) thus has no retroactive effect&para;<br>on Vartelas because the reference point here—Vartelas’s&para;<br>readmission to the United States after a trip abroad—&para;<br>occurred years after the statute’s effective date. Although&para;<br>Vartelas cannot change the fact of his prior conviction,&para;<br>he could have avoided entirely the consequences of&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) by simply remaining in the United&para;<br>States or, having left, remaining in Greece.&para;<br>That&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) had no effect on Vartelas until he performed a post-enactment activity is a clear indication&para;<br>that the statute’s application is purely prospective. See&para;<br>Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30, 45, n. 11,&para;<br>46 (2006) (no retroactive effect where the statute in&para;<br>question did “not operate on a completed preenactment&para;<br>act” and instead turned on “a failure to take timely action&para;<br>that would have avoided application of the new law&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>altogether”).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court avoids this conclusion by insisting that&para;<br>“[p]ast misconduct, . . . not present travel, is the wrongful&para;<br>activity Congress targeted” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Ante,&para;<br>at 11. That assertion does not, however, have any basis&para;<br>in the statute’s text or structure, and the Court does not&para;<br>pretend otherwise. Instead, the Court simply asserts that&para;<br>Vartelas’s “lawful foreign travel” surely could not be the&para;<br>“reason for the ‘new disability’ imposed on him.” Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added). But the reason for a prohibition has&para;<br>nothing to do with whether the prohibition is being applied to a past rather than a future act. It may be relevant&para;<br>to other legal inquiries—for example, to whether a legislative act violates one of the Ex Post Facto Clauses in Article&para;<br>I, see, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 92 (2003), or one of&para;<br>the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendments, see, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,&para;<br>Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487 (1955), or the Takings Clause in&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment, see, e.g., Kelo v. New London, 545&para;<br>U. S. 469, 477–483 (2005), or the Obligation of Contracts&para;<br>Clause in Article I, see, e.g., United States Trust Co. of&para;<br>N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 29 (1977). But it has no&para;<br>direct bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.*&para;<br>The Court’s failure to differentiate between the statutoryinterpretation question (whether giving certain effect to a&para;<br>provision would make it retroactive and hence presump——————&para;<br>* I say no direct bearing because if the prospective application of a&para;<br>statute would raise constitutional doubts because of its effect on preenactment conduct, that would be a reason to presume a legislative&para;<br>intent not to apply it unless the conduct in question is postenactment—that is, to consider it retroactive when the conduct in&para;<br>question is pre-enactment. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380–&para;<br>381 (2005). That is not an issue here. If the statute had expressly&para;<br>made the new “admission” rule applicable to those aliens with prior&para;<br>convictions, its constitutionality would not be in doubt.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tively unintended) and the validity question (whether&para;<br>giving certain effect to a provision is unlawful) is on full&para;<br>display in its attempts to distinguish §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)&para;<br>from similar statutes. Take, for example, the Court’s discussion of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). That Act, which targets “patterns&para;<br>of racketeering,” expressly defines those “patterns” to&para;<br>include some pre-enactment conduct. See 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1961(5). Courts interpreting RICO therefore need not&para;<br>consider the presumption against retroactivity; instead,&para;<br>the cases cited by the majority consider whether RICO&para;<br>violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. See United States v.&para;<br>Brown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977); United States&para;<br>v. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)&para;<br>(per curiam). The Government recognized this distinction&para;<br>and cited RICO to make a point about the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause rather than the presumption against retroactivity,&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 17–18; the Court evidently does not.&para;<br>The Court’s confident assertion that Congress surely&para;<br>would not have meant this statute to apply to Vartelas,&para;<br>whose foreign travel and subsequent return to the United&para;<br>States were innocent events, ante, at 11, 14, simply begs&para;<br>the question presented in this case. Ignorance, of course,&para;<br>is no excuse (ignorantia legis neminem excusat); and his&para;<br>return was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did&para;<br>not render it unlawful. Since IIRIRA’s effective date in&para;<br>1996, lawful permanent residents who have committed&para;<br>crimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the&para;<br>United States and return without formally seeking “admission.” See §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). As a result, Vartelas’s&para;<br>numerous trips abroad and “uneventful” reentries into the&para;<br>United States after the passage of IIRIRA, see ante, at 5,&para;<br>were lawful only if §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to&para;<br>him—which is, of course, precisely the matter in dispute&para;<br>here.&para;<br>The Court’s circular reasoning betrays its underlying&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>concern: Because the Court believes that reentry after a&para;<br>brief trip abroad should be lawful, it will decline to apply a&para;<br>statute that clearly provides otherwise for certain criminal&para;<br>aliens. (The same instinct likely produced the Court’s&para;<br>questionable statutory interpretation in Rosenberg v.&para;<br>Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).) The Court’s test for retroactivity—asking whether the statute creates a “new disability” in “respect to past events”—invites this focus on fairness. Understandably so, since it is derived from a Justice&para;<br>Story opinion interpreting a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that forbade retroactive laws—a provision comparable to the Federal Constitution’s ex post facto&para;<br>prohibition and bearing no relation to the presumption&para;<br>against retroactivity. What is unfair or irrational (and&para;<br>hence should be forbidden) has nothing to do with whether&para;<br>applying a statute to a particular act is prospective (and&para;<br>thus presumptively intended) or retroactive (and thus&para;<br>presumptively unintended). On the latter question, the&para;<br>“new disability in respect to past events” test provides no&para;<br>meaningful guidance.&para;<br>I can imagine countless laws that, like §1101(a)(13)&para;<br>(C)(v), impose “new disabilities” related to “past events”&para;<br>and yet do not operate retroactively. For example, a statute making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for&para;<br>student loans. See, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §1091(r)(1). Or laws&para;<br>prohibiting those convicted of sex crimes from working in&para;<br>certain jobs that involve repeated contact with minors.&para;<br>See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §290.95(c) (West Supp.&para;<br>2012). Or laws prohibiting those previously committed&para;<br>for mental instability from purchasing guns. See, e.g., 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §922(g)(4). The Court concedes that it would not&para;<br>consider the last two laws inapplicable to pre-enactment&para;<br>convictions or commitments. Ante, at 12, n. 7. The Court&para;<br>does not deny that these statutes impose a “new disability&para;<br>in respect to past events,” but it distinguishes them based&para;<br>on the reason for their enactment: These statutes “address&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dangers that arise postenactment.” Ante, at 13, n. 7. So&para;<br>much for the new-disability-in-respect-to-past-events test;&para;<br>it has now become a new-disability-not-designed-to-guardagainst-future-danger test. But why is guarding against&para;<br>future danger the only reason Congress may wish to regulate future action in light of past events? It obviously is&para;<br>not. So the Court must invent yet another doctrine to&para;<br>address my first example, the law making persons&para;<br>convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.&para;<br>According to the Court, that statute differs from&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) because it “has a prospective thrust.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13, n. 7. I cannot imagine what that means, other&para;<br>than that the statute regulates post-enactment conduct. But, of course, so does §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Rather&para;<br>than reconciling any of these distinctions with Justice&para;<br>Story’s formulation of retroactivity, the Court leaves to&para;<br>lower courts the unenviable task of identifying newdisabilities-not-designed-to-guard-against-future-dangerand-also-lacking-a-prospective-thrust.&para;<br>And anyway, is there any doubt that §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)&para;<br>is intended to guard against the “dangers that arise&para;<br>postenactment” from having aliens in our midst who have&para;<br>shown themselves to have proclivity for crime? Must that&para;<br>be rejected as its purpose simply because Congress has not&para;<br>sought to achieve it by all possible means—by ferreting&para;<br>out such dangerous aliens and going through the expensive and lengthy process of deporting them? At least some&para;<br>of the post-enactment danger can readily be eliminated by&para;<br>forcing lawful permanent residents who have committed&para;<br>certain crimes to undergo formal “admission” procedures&para;<br>at our borders. Indeed, by limiting criminal aliens’ opportunities to travel and then return to the United States,&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) may encourage self-deportation. But all&para;<br>this is irrelevant. The positing of legislative “purpose” is&para;<br>always a slippery enterprise compared to the simple&para;<br>determination of whether a statute regulates a future&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>VARTELAS v. HOLDER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>event—and it is that, rather than the Court’s pronouncement of some forward-looking reason, which governs&para;<br>whether a statute has retroactive effect.&para;<br>Finally, I cannot avoid observing that even if the Court’s&para;<br>concern about the fairness or rationality of applying&para;<br>§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) to Vartelas were relevant to the statutory interpretation question, that concern is greatly exaggerated. In disregard of a federal statute, convicted criminal Vartelas repeatedly traveled to and from Greece&para;<br>without ever seeking formal admission at this country’s&para;<br>borders. When he was finally unlucky enough to be apprehended, and sought discretionary relief from removal&para;<br>under former §212(c) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994&para;<br>ed.), the Immigration Judge denying his application found&para;<br>that Vartelas had made frequent trips to Greece and had&para;<br>remained there for long periods of time, that he was “a&para;<br>serious tax evader,” that he had offered testimony that&para;<br>was “close to incredible,” and that he had not shown hardship to himself or his estranged wife and children should&para;<br>he be removed. See 620 F. 3d 108, 111 (CA2 2010); Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). In&para;<br>decrying the “harsh penalty” imposed by this statute on&para;<br>Vartelas, the Court ignores those inconvenient facts.&para;<br>Ante, at 9. But never mind. Under any sensible approach&para;<br>to the presumption against retroactivity, these factual&para;<br>subtleties should be irrelevant to the temporal application&para;<br>of §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>This case raises a plain-vanilla question of statutory&para;<br>interpretation, not broader questions about frustrated&para;<br>expectations or fairness. Our approach to answering that&para;<br>question should be similarly straightforward: We should&para;<br>determine what relevant activity the statute regulates&para;<br>(here, reentry); absent a clear statement otherwise, only&para;<br>such relevant activity which occurs after the statute’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>effective date should be covered (here, post-1996 reentries). If, as so construed, the statute is unfair or irrational enough to violate the Constitution, that is another&para;<br>matter entirely, and one not presented here. Our interpretive presumption against retroactivity, however, is just&para;<br>that—a tool to ascertain what the statute means, not a&para;<br>license to rewrite the statute in a way the Court considers&para;<br>more desirable.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
