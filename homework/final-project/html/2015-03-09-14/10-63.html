Argued October 4, 2011—January 18, 2012&para;<br>Petitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to&para;<br>death in Alabama state court. In 2001, Maples sought postconviction&para;<br>relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32. Maples alleged, among&para;<br>other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys&para;<br>failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment. His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys,&para;<br>Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the&para;<br>New York offices of the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell law firm. As required&para;<br>by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer,&para;<br>John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice. Butler made&para;<br>clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement&para;<br>in the case.&para;<br>In 2002, while Maples’ state postconviction petition was pending,&para;<br>Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Their new employment disabled them from representing Maples. They did not inform Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as&para;<br>his counsel. In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial&para;<br>court’s leave to withdraw. No other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney&para;<br>entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of a change in Maples’ representation. Thus, Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples’ listed, and only, attorneys of record.&para;<br>The trial court denied Maples’ petition in May 2003. Notices of the&para;<br>order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan &amp;&para;<br>Cromwell’s address. When those postings were returned, unopened,&para;<br>the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing. Butler also received a copy of the order, but did not act on it. With no attorney of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>record in fact acting on Maples’ behalf, the 42-day period Maples had&para;<br>to file a notice of appeal ran out.&para;<br>About a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent&para;<br>a letter directly to Maples. The letter informed Maples of the missed&para;<br>deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a&para;<br>federal habeas petition. Maples immediately contacted his mother,&para;<br>who called Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Three Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order,&para;<br>thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period. The court denied the&para;<br>motion. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ&para;<br>of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-oftime appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.&para;<br>Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief. Both the District&para;<br>Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the&para;<br>procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure timely to appeal&para;<br>the state trial court’s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postconviction relief.&para;<br>Held: Maples has shown the requisite “cause” to excuse his procedural default. Pp. 11–22.&para;<br>(a) As a rule, a federal court may not entertain a state prisoner’s&para;<br>habeas claims “when (1) ‘a state court [has] declined to address&para;<br>[those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,’ and (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent&para;<br>and adequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin, 562&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___. The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if&para;<br>“the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in&para;<br>state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of&para;<br>federal law.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750.&para;<br>Cause for a procedural default exists where “something external to&para;<br>the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,]&para;<br>. . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 753. A prisoner’s postconviction attorney’s negligence does not&para;<br>qualify as “cause,” ibid., because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent,&para;<br>and under “well-settled” agency law, the principal bears the risk of&para;<br>his agent’s negligent conduct, id., at 753–754. Thus, a petitioner is&para;<br>bound by his attorney’s failure to meet a filing deadline and cannot&para;<br>rely on that failure to establish cause. Ibid.&para;<br>A markedly different situation arises, however, when an attorney&para;<br>abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default.&para;<br>In such cases, the principal-agent relationship is severed and the attorney’s acts or omissions “cannot fairly be attributed to [the client].”&para;<br>Id., at 753. Nor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own&para;<br>behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact,&para;<br>are not representing him.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, is instructive. There, the Court&para;<br>found that the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition&para;<br>can be tolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorney’s unprofessional conduct may sometimes be an “extraordinary circumstance”&para;<br>justifying equitable tolling. Id., at ___, ___–___. The Court recognized that an attorney’s negligence does not provide a basis for tolling&para;<br>a statutory time limit. Id., at ___. Holland’s claim that he was abandoned by his attorney, however, if true, “would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control,” id., at ___ (opinion of&para;<br>ALITO, J.). Pp. 11–15.&para;<br>(b) From the time of his initial Rule 32 petition until well after&para;<br>time ran out for appealing the trial court’s denial of that petition,&para;<br>Maples’ sole attorneys of record were Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and&para;<br>Butler. Unknown to Maples, none of those lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the 42-day appeal period. Pp. 15–21.&para;<br>(1) The State contends that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell represented&para;<br>Maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings, and that, as&para;<br>a result, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel during the&para;<br>42-day period. But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz&para;<br>severed their agency relationship with Maples long before the default&para;<br>occurred. Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial&para;<br>court’s permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey&para;<br>that they remained the attorneys of record. As such, the attorneys,&para;<br>not Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the clerk to furnish.&para;<br>The State asserts that, after Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s departure, other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as&para;<br>Maples’ counsel. At the time of the default, however, those attorneys&para;<br>had not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their&para;<br>appearances on Maples’ behalf, and had done nothing to inform the&para;<br>Alabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and IngenHousz. Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples’&para;<br>behalf before his time to appeal expired. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>(2) Maples’ only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, did&para;<br>not even begin to represent Maples. Butler told Munanka and IngenHousz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of enabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive&para;<br>role in the case. Other factors confirm that Butler was not Maples’&para;<br>“agent in any meaningful sense of that word.” Holland, 560 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (opinion of ALITO, J.). Upon receiving a copy of the trial court’s&para;<br>order, Butler did not contact Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to ensure that firm&para;<br>lawyers were taking appropriate action. Nor did the State treat Butler as Maples’ actual representative. Notably, the Alabama Assistant&para;<br>Attorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an&para;<br>opposing party known to be represented by counsel. Pp. 19–20.&para;<br>(3) Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of&para;<br>record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his&para;<br>representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive notice. He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for commencing an appeal. Given no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from&para;<br>complying with the State’s procedural rule. Pp. 20–21.&para;<br>(c) “The cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for&para;<br>States’ finality and comity interests while ensuring that ‘fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.’ ” Dretke v. Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 393. In the unusual circumstances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness&para;<br>point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Maples’ procedural default. Through no fault of his own, he lacked the&para;<br>assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42-day appeal period. And he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se status. Pp. 21–22.&para;<br>(d) The question of prejudice, which neither the District Court nor&para;<br>the Eleventh Circuit reached, remains open for decision on remand.&para;<br>P. 22.&para;<br>&para;<br>586 F. 3d 879, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals.&para;<br>At trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers,&para;<br>minimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.&para;<br>Maples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging&para;<br>ineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial&para;<br>infirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written&para;<br>by two New York attorneys serving pro bono, both associated with the same New York-based large law firm. An&para;<br>Alabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved&para;<br>the admission of the out-of-state counsel pro hac vice.

Neither they&para;<br>nor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able&para;<br>to handle Maples’ case.&para;<br>In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples’&para;<br>petition. Notices of the court’s order were posted to the&para;<br>New York attorneys at the address of the law firm with&para;<br>which they had been associated. Those postings were returned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempted no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact&para;<br>acting on Maples’ behalf, the time to appeal ran out.&para;<br>Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas&para;<br>corpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn,&para;<br>the Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the&para;<br>procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure&para;<br>timely to appeal the Alabama trial court’s order denying&para;<br>him postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was&para;<br>blameless for the default.&para;<br>The sole question this Court has taken up for review is&para;<br>whether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples’ case, there&para;<br>is “cause” to excuse the default. Maples maintains that&para;<br>there is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly representing him had abandoned the case without leave of&para;<br>court, without informing Maples they could no longer&para;<br>represent him, and without securing any recorded substitution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Maples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state&para;<br>postconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to&para;<br>protect himself pro se. In these circumstances, no just&para;<br>system would lay the default at Maples’ death-cell door.&para;<br>Satisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we&para;<br>reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>Alabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Accordingly, we confine our consideration to the question whether Maples has shown cause to&para;<br>excuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.&para;<br>Cause for a procedural default exists where “something&para;<br>external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be&para;<br>attributed to him[,] . . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply&para;<br>with the State’s procedural rule.’ ” Coleman, 501 U.

Negligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as “cause.”&para;<br>Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753. That is so, we reasoned in&para;<br>Coleman, because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent, and&para;<br>under “well-settled principles of agency law,” the principal&para;<br>bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his&para;<br>agent. Id., at 753–754. See also Irwin v. Department of&para;<br>Veterans Affairs, 498 U.

Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753–&para;<br>754. We do not disturb that general rule.&para;<br>A markedly different situation is presented, however, when&para;<br>an attorney abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default.

Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot&para;<br>establish abandonment by counsel continuing through the&para;<br>six weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial&para;<br>court’s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is&para;<br>undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their&para;<br>agency relationship with Maples long before the default&para;<br>occurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the&para;<br>two attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw&para;<br>from the case). Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left&para;<br>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s employ in the summer of 2002, at&para;<br>least nine months before the Alabama trial court entered&para;<br>its order denying Rule 32 relief.

Hornbook agency law establishes that the attorneys’ departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and their&para;<br>commencement of employment that prevented them from&para;<br>representing Maples ended their agency relationship with&para;<br>him.

Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) §111, Comment b&para;<br>(“[I]t is ordinarily inferred that a principal does not intend&para;<br>an agent to do an illegal act.”).

Regarding this assertion, we&para;<br>note, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submitted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples’&para;<br>request that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra,&para;<br>at 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been “involved in [Maples’] case since the summer of 2001.” App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied&para;<br>the State’s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw&para;<br>informed the court, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell “lawyers working&para;<br>on this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated]&para;<br>evidentiary hearing.” Id., at 258a. Another Sullivan &amp;&para;<br>Cromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit&para;<br>submitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003,&para;<br>that she “ha[d] worked on [Maples’] case since October 14,&para;<br>2002.” App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy described what their “involve[ment]” or “wor[k] on [Maples’]&para;<br>case” entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers,&para;<br>other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still&para;<br>with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in&para;<br>preparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw&para;<br>identify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed&para;<br>on Maples’ case between Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s&para;<br>departures and the firm’s receipt of the telephone call&para;<br>from Maples’ mother.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The unclear state of the record is perhaps not surprising, given Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s representation of Maples after the default. As&para;<br>amici for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the&para;<br>firm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors&para;<br>et al. as Amici Curiae 23–27. Following the default, the firm’s interest&para;<br>in avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples’&para;<br>strongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him,&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v.

For the facts essential to our&para;<br>decision are not in doubt. At the time of the default, the&para;<br>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys who later came forward—&para;<br>De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer—had not been&para;<br>admitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered&para;<br>their appearances on Maples’ behalf, and had done nothing to inform the Alabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. Thus, none of&para;<br>these attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples’&para;<br>behalf before his time to appeal expired. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) §111 (The “failure to acquire a qualification&para;<br>by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized&para;<br>act . . . terminates the agent’s authority to act.”).9 What&para;<br>they did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore&para;<br>——————&para;<br>therefore he had cause to be relieved from the default. Yet Sullivan &amp;&para;<br>Cromwell did not cede Maples’ representation to a new attorney, who&para;<br>could have made Maples’ abandonment argument plain to the Court of&para;<br>Appeals. Instead, the firm represented Maples through briefing and&para;<br>oral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, where they attempted to cast&para;<br>responsibility for the mishap on the clerk of the Alabama trial court.&para;<br>Given Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s conflict of interest, Maples’ federal habeas&para;<br>petition, prepared and submitted by the firm, is not persuasive evidence that Maples, prior to the default, ever “viewed himself” as represented by “the firm,” see post, at 4, rather than by his attorneys of&para;<br>record, Munanka and Ingen-Housz.&para;<br>9 The dissent argues that the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys had no&para;<br>basis “to infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,&para;<br>simply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court.”&para;<br>Post, at 6–7. While that may be true, it is irrelevant.

While the State may not be obligated&para;<br>to serve more than one attorney of record, its selection of New York&para;<br>rather than local counsel is some indication that, from the start, the&para;<br>State was cognizant of the limited role Butler would serve.

Unbeknownst to petitioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation&para;<br>due to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortunate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the&para;<br>two young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in&para;<br>his state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by&para;<br>these two attorneys of new employment that precluded&para;<br>them from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to&para;<br>notify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to&para;<br>withdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure&para;<br>of the firm that they left to monitor the status of petitioner’s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of&para;<br>the decision denying petitioner’s request for state postconviction relief was received in that firm’s offices, the&para;<br>failure of the firm’s mail room to route that important&para;<br>communication to either another member of the firm or to&para;<br>the departed attorneys’ new addresses; (7) the failure of&para;<br>the clerk’s office to take any action when the envelope&para;<br>containing that notice came back unopened; and (8) local&para;<br>counsel’s very limited conception of the role that he was&para;<br>obligated to play in petitioner’s representation. Under&para;<br>these unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner’s&para;<br>attorneys effectively abandoned him and that this aban-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>donment was a “cause” that is sufficient to overcome petitioner’s procedural default.&para;<br>In an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner’s&para;<br>counsel in the case now before us cast blame for what&para;<br>occurred on Alabama’s system of providing legal representation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral&para;<br>proceedings. See Brief for Petitioner 3–6. But whatever&para;<br>may be said about Alabama’s system, I do not think that&para;<br>Alabama’s system had much if anything to do with petitioner’s misfortune. The quality of petitioner’s representation at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet&para;<br>the deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial&para;<br>of his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any important connection between what happened in this case&para;<br>and Alabama’s system for providing representation for&para;<br>prisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to&para;<br>petition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other&para;<br>States, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to&para;<br>represent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that&para;<br>most of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.&para;<br>Id., at 4. Petitioner’s brief states that the Alabama system&para;<br>had “a direct bearing on the events giving rise . . . to the&para;<br>procedural default at issue,” id., at 3, but a similar combination of untoward events could have occurred if petitioner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were&para;<br>appointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The&para;<br>firm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one&para;<br>of the country’s most prestigious and expensive, and I&para;<br>have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they&para;<br>were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys&para;<br>from such a firm. See id., at 9 (stating that it “seemed as&para;<br>though Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys&para;<br>working at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to represent Maples pro bono”).&para;<br>What occurred here was not a predictable consequence&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Because I cannot agree with that conclusion, and because&para;<br>Maples’ alternative argument fares no better, I would&para;<br>affirm the judgment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Our doctrine of procedural default reflects, and furthers,&para;<br>the principle that errors in state criminal trials should&para;<br>be remedied in state court. As we have long recognized,&para;<br>federal habeas review for state prisoners imposes significant costs on the States, undermining not only their practical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments,&para;<br>see Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126–127 (1982), but also&para;<br>the primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitutional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, id.,&para;<br>at 128. We have further recognized that “[t]hese costs are&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>particularly high . . . when a state prisoner, through a&para;<br>procedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitutional claims in state court.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501&para;<br>U. S. 722, 748 (1991). In that situation, the prisoner has&para;<br>“deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address&para;<br>those claims in the first instance,” id., at 732, thereby&para;<br>leaving the state courts without “a chance to mend their&para;<br>own fences and avoid federal intrusion,” Engle, 456 U. S.,&para;<br>at 129. For that reason, and because permitting federalcourt review of defaulted claims would “undercu[t] the&para;<br>State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules,” ibid., we&para;<br>have held that when a state court has relied on an adequate and independent state procedural ground in denying&para;<br>a prisoner’s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain&para;<br>federal habeas relief. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729–730.&para;<br>To be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of&para;<br>defaulted claims is not absolute. A habeas petitioner’s default in state court will not bar federal habeas review if&para;<br>“the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,”&para;<br>id., at 748—“cause” constituting “something external to&para;<br>the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed&para;<br>to him,” that impeded compliance with the State’s procedural rule, id., at 753. As a general matter, an attorney’s&para;<br>mistakes (or omissions) do not meet the standard “because&para;<br>the attorney is the petitioner’s agent when acting, or&para;<br>failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the&para;<br>petitioner must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).&para;<br>See also Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 633–634,&para;<br>and n. 10 (1962).&para;<br>When an attorney’s error occurs at a stage of the proceedings at which the defendant has a constitutional right&para;<br>to effective assistance of counsel, that error may constitute&para;<br>cause to excuse a resulting procedural default. A State’s&para;<br>failure in its duty to provide an effective attorney, as&para;<br>measured by the standard set forth in Strickland v. Wash-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), makes the attorney’s error&para;<br>chargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.&para;<br>See Murray, supra, at 488. But when the client has no&para;<br>right to counsel—as is the case in the postconviction setting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555&para;<br>(1987)—the client bears the risk of all attorney errors&para;<br>made in the course of the representation, regardless of the&para;<br>egregiousness of the mistake. Coleman, supra, at 754&para;<br>(“[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters,&para;<br>but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to&para;<br>counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external&para;<br>factor”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct&para;<br>to conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner’s procedural default may be excused when it is attributable to&para;<br>abandonment by his attorney. In such a case, Coleman’s&para;<br>rationale for attributing the attorney’s acts and omissions&para;<br>to the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased&para;<br>acting as the client’s agent, “well-settled principles of&para;<br>agency law,” 501 U. S., at 754, no longer support charging&para;<br>the client with his lawyer’s mistakes. The attorney’s&para;<br>mistakes may therefore be understood as an “external&para;<br>factor,” ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may justify excusing the prisoner’s procedural default.&para;<br>I likewise agree with the Court’s conclusion, ante, at 15,&para;<br>that Maples’ two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi&para;<br>Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples&para;<br>by the time the Alabama trial court entered its order&para;<br>denying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court&para;<br>observes, ante, at 15–16, without informing Maples or&para;<br>seeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw&para;<br>from Maples’ case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left&para;<br>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s employ and accepted new positions&para;<br>that precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v.

As a result, Munanka’s and IngenHousz’s failure to take action in response to the trial&para;<br>court’s order should not be imputed to Maples.&para;<br>It is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Maples was left unrepresented during the relevant window&para;<br>between the Alabama trial court’s dismissal of his postconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for&para;<br>filing a notice of appeal established by Alabama Rule of&para;<br>Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009). Start with Maples’&para;<br>own allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition,&para;<br>Maples alleged that, at the time he sought postconviction relief in Alabama trial court, he “was represented by&para;<br>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell of New York, New York.” App. 256.&para;<br>Although the petition went on to identify Munanka and&para;<br>Ingen-Housz as “the two Sullivan lawyers handling the&para;<br>matter,” id., at 257, its statement that Maples was “represented” by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples&para;<br>viewed himself as having retained the services of the firm&para;<br>as a whole, a perfectly natural understanding. “When a&para;<br>client retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the&para;<br>presumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have&para;<br>been retained.” 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers §31, Comment f, p. 222 (1998). Admittedly,&para;<br>in connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial&para;<br>court to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell&para;<br>partner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating&para;<br>that the firm’s lawyers “handle pro bono cases on an individual basis” and that the lawyers who had appeared in&para;<br>Maples’ case had followed that practice, “attempt[ing] not&para;<br>to use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a. But Maples’ habeas petition is&para;<br>the pleading that initiated the current litigation; and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

De Leeuw’s affidavit acknowledged that he had&para;<br>“been involved in [Maples’] case since the summer of&para;<br>2001,” ibid., roughly a year before Munanka and IngenHousz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and it further stated that&para;<br>after “Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka” learned of the&para;<br>court’s initial order denying the State’s motion to dismiss&para;<br>Maples’ postconviction petition in December 2001, “the&para;<br>lawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared&para;<br>for the evidentiary hearing” Maples had requested, id., at&para;<br>258a. Moreover, when Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney&para;<br>Felice Duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before&para;<br>the Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to&para;<br>extend the deadline, she stated that she had “worked on&para;<br>[Maples’] case since October 14, 2002,” App. 231, months&para;<br>before the procedural default took place.&para;<br>According to the Court, see ante, at 17, De Leeuw’s&para;<br>affidavit does not make clear how he was “involved” in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>&para;<br>* The Court says that the allegations in Maples’ own habeas petition&para;<br>are not “persuasive evidence,” ante, at 17–18, n. 8, because Maples’&para;<br>lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest&para;<br>when they prepared the document. This is a curious point, since the&para;<br>effect of Maples’ statement was to implicate Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as a&para;<br>firm in missing the filing deadline. The conflict would have induced the&para;<br>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm. To be sure, as the&para;<br>case later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been&para;<br>conceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples’&para;<br>interest to say he had no lawyers. But the issue the petition’s statement raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is&para;<br>whether the statement was true. And if Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s involvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only&para;<br>reinforces the truth.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Maples’ case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and&para;<br>Ingen-Housz were among those who prepared for the&para;<br>anticipated evidentiary hearing; and Duffy’s motion does&para;<br>not make clear what her “wor[k]” entailed. But there is&para;<br>little doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the&para;<br>only attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that&para;<br>De Leeuw was “involved” and Duffy “worked” as lawyers&para;<br>for Maples (what other role could they have taken on?).&para;<br>De Leeuw’s distinction between “Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr.&para;<br>Munanka” and “the lawyers working on his case for Mr.&para;<br>Maples” would have been senseless if the latter category&para;<br>did not extend beyond the two named attorneys.&para;<br>In sum, there is every indication that when the trial&para;<br>court entered its order dismissing Maples’ postconviction&para;<br>petition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented&para;<br>by a team of attorneys in Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s New York&para;<br>office. The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of&para;<br>these attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been&para;<br>admitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered&para;<br>appearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not&para;<br>sought to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. See&para;<br>ante, at 18–19. The Court does not, however, explain why&para;<br>these facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples’&para;<br>agents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the&para;<br>case that did not require court appearance—which would&para;<br>certainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing&para;<br>deadlines. The Court’s quotation from the Restatement of&para;<br>Agency, ante, at 18, that the “failure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act . . . terminates the agent’s authority to act,” 1&para;<br>Restatement 2d, §111, at 290, omits the crucial condition&para;<br>contained at the end of the section: “if thereafter he [the&para;<br>agent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts,&para;<br>would not consent to the further exercise of the authority.”&para;<br>There was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer&para;<br>that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>simply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court. Though it would have been “illegal” for these&para;<br>attorneys to file a notice of appeal without being authorized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from&para;<br>first seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka&para;<br>and Ingen-Housz initially had done, and then filing a&para;<br>notice of appeal.&para;<br>It would create a huge gap in our Coleman jurisprudence to disregard all attorney errors committed before&para;<br>admission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap&para;<br>to disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed&para;<br>before the attorney enters an appearance. Moreover, even&para;<br>if these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples’ agents for&para;<br>purposes of conducting the Alabama litigation, they were&para;<br>at least his agents for purposes of advising him of the&para;<br>impending deadline. His unawareness was the fault of&para;<br>counsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him.&para;<br>What happened here is simply “[a]ttorney ignorance or&para;<br>inadvertence” of the sort that does not furnish cause to&para;<br>excuse a procedural default. Coleman, 501 U.

There is no&para;<br>support for the Court’s conclusion that Butler “did not&para;<br>even begin to represent Maples.” Ante, at 19. True, the&para;<br>affidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the&para;<br>proceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that&para;<br>he had “no substantive involvement” with the case, and&para;<br>that he had “agreed to serve as local counsel only.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 255a. But a disclaimer of “substantive involvement” in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer’s&para;<br>ethical obligations, see ante, at 19, is not equivalent to a&para;<br>denial of any agency role at all. A local attorney’s “nonsubstantive” involvement would surely include, at a minimum, keeping track of local court orders and advising&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“substantive” counsel of impending deadlines. Nor did&para;<br>Butler’s explanation for his failure to act when he received&para;<br>a copy of the trial court’s order sound in abandonment.&para;<br>Butler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order&para;<br>because he did not consider Maples to be his client. Instead, based on “past practice” and the content of the&para;<br>order, Butler “assumed” that Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan&para;<br>&amp; Cromwell would receive a copy. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>256a.&para;<br>The Court gets this badly wrong when it states that&para;<br>“Butler’s failure even to place a phone call to the New&para;<br>York firm” demonstrates Butler’s “disclaimer of any genuinely representative role.” Ante, at 19. By equating the&para;<br>very attorney error that contributed to Maples’ procedural&para;<br>default with the absence of an agency relationship, the&para;<br>Court ensures that today’s opinion will serve as a template&para;<br>for future habeas petitioners seeking to evade Coleman’s&para;<br>holding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will&para;<br>not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. See 501&para;<br>U. S., at 752–754. The trick will be to allege, not that&para;<br>counsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel’s ineffectiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely representative agent. No precedent should be so easily circumvented by word games, but the damage is particularly&para;<br>acute when the affected precedent is so firmly “grounded&para;<br>in concerns of comity and federalism.” Id., at 730.&para;<br>The Court’s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion&para;<br>that Butler was not Maples’ agent is to point out that a&para;<br>prosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him&para;<br>of the defaulted appeal. See ante, at 20. The Court reasons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples&para;<br>had been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate&para;<br>with a represented party would have been a violation of&para;<br>ethical standards. Ibid. But even if this supposition is&para;<br>correct, it is hard to understand what it proves. What&para;<br>matters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor thought&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Maples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really&para;<br>was abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler’s conduct&para;<br>after learning about the default further belies any such&para;<br>contention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooperate with Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, filing&para;<br>papers as “Counsel for Mr. Maples” or “Local Counsel for&para;<br>Petitioner Cory Maples” in multiple courts in an attempt&para;<br>to rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had&para;<br>Butler reassumed his representational duties after having&para;<br>abandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a&para;<br>conclusion of abandonment interruptus.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Maples argues in the alternative that his default should&para;<br>be excused because his right to due process was violated&para;<br>when the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s copies of the court’s dismissal&para;<br>order were returned undeliverable. According to Maples,&para;<br>our decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220 (2006),&para;<br>establishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.&para;<br>We held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax&para;<br>sale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional&para;<br>reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property. See id., at 234. It&para;<br>is questionable whether that holding has any relevance to&para;<br>the circumstances here, which involved not the institution&para;<br>of proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather&para;<br>the issuance of an order in a pending case that was instituted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful&para;<br>whether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a&para;<br>court’s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules certainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute requirement. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides&para;<br>that “[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment]&para;<br>does not affect the time for appeal or relieve—or authorize&para;<br>the court to relieve—a party for failing to appeal within&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MAPLES v. THOMAS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of&para;<br>Appellate Procedure (4)(a).” And although Federal Rule&para;<br>of Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for&para;<br>filing an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not&para;<br>receive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment&para;<br>or order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to&para;<br>reopen must be filed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).&para;<br>There is no need to grapple with this question, however,&para;<br>because Butler received a copy of the trial court’s order.&para;<br>“Under our system of representative litigation, ‘each party&para;<br>. . . is considered to have notice of all facts, notice of which&para;<br>can be charged upon [his] attorney.’ ” Irwin v. Department&para;<br>of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (quoting Link&para;<br>v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962)). The notice to&para;<br>Butler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>One suspects that today’s decision is motivated in large&para;<br>part by an understandable sense of frustration with the&para;<br>State’s refusal to waive Maples’ procedural default in&para;<br>the interest of fairness. Indeed, that frustration may well&para;<br>explain the Court’s lengthy indictment of Alabama’s general procedures for providing representation to capital&para;<br>defendants, ante, at 2–4, a portion of the Court’s opinion&para;<br>that is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be&para;<br>otherwise inexplicable.&para;<br>But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing&para;<br>Maples’ procedural default here, it does so whenever a&para;<br>defendant’s procedural default is caused by his attorney.&para;<br>That is simply not the law—and cannot be, if the states&para;<br>are to have an orderly system of criminal litigation conducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand&para;<br>on its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner’s procedural&para;<br>default even when counsel is to blame. Because a faithful&para;<br>application of those precedents leads to the conclusion that&para;<br>Maples has not demonstrated cause to excuse his proce-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dural default; and because the reasoning by which the&para;<br>Court justifies the opposite conclusion invites future evisceration of the principle that defendants are responsible&para;<br>for the mistakes of their attorneys; I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
