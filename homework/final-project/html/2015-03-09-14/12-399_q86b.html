S. 30, 32. As relevant here, the ICWA bars involuntary termination of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened&para;<br>showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from&para;<br>the parent’s “continued custody” of the child, 25 U. S. C. §1912(f);&para;<br>conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to&para;<br>an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to&para;<br>prevent the “breakup of the Indian family,” §1912(d); and provides&para;<br>placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children to members&para;<br>of the child’s extended family, other members of the Indian child’s&para;<br>tribe, and other Indian families, §1915(a).&para;<br>While Birth Mother was pregnant with Biological Father’s child,&para;<br>their relationship ended and Biological Father (a member of the&para;<br>Cherokee Nation) agreed to relinquish his parental rights. Birth&para;<br>Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption&para;<br>agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South&para;<br>Carolina. For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four&para;<br>months after Baby Girl’s birth, Biological Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl. About four months after&para;<br>Baby Girl’s birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of the pending adoption. In the adoption proceedings, Biological&para;<br>Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adoption. Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couple’s&para;<br>adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father. At the&para;<br>age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father,&para;<br>whom she had never met. The State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding&para;<br>related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a “parent” under the ICWA; that §§1912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his&para;<br>parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, §1915(a)’s&para;<br>adoption-placement preferences would have applied.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a&para;<br>“parent” under the ICWA, neither §1912(f) nor §1912(d) bars the&para;<br>termination of his parental rights. Pp. 6–14.&para;<br>(a) Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of parental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the&para;<br>parent’s “continued custody of the child.” The adjective “continued”&para;<br>plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary definitions. The phrase “continued custody” thus refers to custody that a&para;<br>parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a&para;<br>result, §1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had&para;<br>custody of the Indian child. This reading comports with the statutory&para;<br>text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to&para;<br>counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian&para;<br>families. See §1901(4). But the ICWA’s primary goal is not implicated when an Indian child’s adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights. Nonbinding&para;<br>guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate&para;<br>that the BIA envisioned that §1912(f)’s standard would apply only to&para;<br>termination of a custodial parent’s rights. Under this reading, Biological Father should not have been able to invoke §1912(f) in this&para;<br>case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl&para;<br>as of the time of the adoption proceedings. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>(b) Section §1912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing “that active&para;<br>efforts have been made to provide remedial services . . . designed to&para;<br>prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have&para;<br>proved unsuccessful.” Consistent with this text, §1912(d) applies only when an Indian family’s “breakup” would be precipitated by terminating parental rights. The term “breakup” refers in this context to&para;<br>“[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,” American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or “an ending as an effective entity,” Webster’s&para;<br>Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961). But when an Indian&para;<br>parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has&para;<br>never been in the Indian parent’s legal or physical custody, there is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>no “relationship” to be “discontinu[ed]” and no “effective entity” to be&para;<br>“end[ed]” by terminating the Indian parent’s rights. In such a situation, the “breakup of the Indian family” has long since occurred, and&para;<br>§1912(d) is inapplicable. This interpretation is consistent with the&para;<br>explicit congressional purpose of setting certain “standards for the&para;<br>removal of Indian children from their families,” §1902, and with BIA&para;<br>Guidelines. Section 1912(d)’s proximity to §§1912(e) and (f), which&para;<br>both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian&para;<br>child’s “continued custody” with his parent, strongly suggests that&para;<br>the phrase “breakup of the Indian family” should be read in harmony&para;<br>with the “continued custody” requirement. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>2. Section 1915(a)’s adoption-placement preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt&para;<br>the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby&para;<br>Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Biological Father is not covered by §1915(a) because he did not seek to&para;<br>adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should&para;<br>not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought&para;<br>by Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents, other members of the Cherokee Nation, or other Indian families. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>398 S. C. 625, 731 S.

The&para;<br>provisions of the federal statute at issue here do not demand this result.&para;<br>Contrary to the State Supreme Court’s ruling, we hold&para;<br>that 25 U. S. C. §1912(f )—which bars involuntary termination of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened&para;<br>showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to&para;<br>result from the parent’s “continued custody” of the child—&para;<br>does not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never&para;<br>had custody of the child.

BABY GIRL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that&para;<br>remedial efforts have been made to prevent the “breakup&para;<br>of the Indian family”—is inapplicable when, as here, the&para;<br>parent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never&para;<br>had custody of the child. Finally, we clarify that §1915(a),&para;<br>which provides placement preferences for the adoption of&para;<br>Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like&para;<br>Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no&para;<br>other eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child.&para;<br>We accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court’s&para;<br>judgment and remand for further proceedings.&para;<br>I&para;<br>“The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 92 Stat.&para;<br>3069, 25 U. S. C. §§1901–1963, was the product of rising&para;<br>concern in the mid-1970’s over the consequences to Indian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive&para;<br>child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of&para;<br>large numbers of Indian children from their families and&para;<br>tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually&para;<br>in non-Indian homes.” Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32 (1989). Congress found&para;<br>that “an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families&para;<br>[were being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted,&para;<br>of their children from them by nontribal public and&para;<br>private agencies.” §1901(4). This “wholesale removal of&para;<br>Indian children from their homes” prompted Congress to&para;<br>enact the ICWA, which establishes federal standards that&para;<br>govern state-court child custody proceedings involving&para;<br>Indian children. Id., at 32, 36 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); see also §1902 (declaring that the ICWA establishes “minimum Federal standards for the removal of&para;<br>Indian children from their families”).1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an “Indian child” as defined by the&para;<br>ICWA because she is an unmarried minor who “is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Three provisions of the ICWA are especially relevant to&para;<br>this case. First, “[a]ny party seeking” an involuntary&para;<br>termination of parental rights to an Indian child under&para;<br>state law must demonstrate that “active efforts have&para;<br>been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative&para;<br>programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian&para;<br>family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.”&para;<br>§1912(d). Second, a state court may not involuntarily&para;<br>terminate parental rights to an Indian child “in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert&para;<br>witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the&para;<br>parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious&para;<br>emotional or physical damage to the child.” §1912(f ).&para;<br>Third, with respect to adoptive placements for an Indian&para;<br>child under state law, “a preference shall be given, in the&para;<br>absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with&para;<br>(1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other&para;<br>members of the Indian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian&para;<br>families.” §1915(a).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In this case, Birth Mother (who is predominantly Hispanic) and Biological Father (who is a member of the&para;<br>Cherokee Nation) became engaged in December 2008.&para;<br>One month later, Birth Mother informed Biological Father, who lived about four hours away, that she was pregnant. After learning of the pregnancy, Biological Father&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>Indian tribe,” §1903(4)(b). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 1, 51, &para;<br>&para;<br>n. 22; Brief for Respondent Cherokee Nation 1; Brief for Petitioners 44&para;<br>(“Baby Girl’s eligibility for membership in the Cherokee Nation depends solely upon a lineal blood relationship with a tribal ancestor”).&para;<br>It is also undisputed that the present case concerns a “child custody&para;<br>proceeding,” which the ICWA defines to include proceedings that&para;<br>involve “termination of parental rights” and “adoptive placement,”&para;<br>§1903(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>asked Birth Mother to move up the date of the wedding.&para;<br>He also refused to provide any financial support until after&para;<br>the two had married. The couple’s relationship deteriorated,&para;<br>and Birth Mother broke off the engagement in May 2009.&para;<br>In June, Birth Mother sent Biological Father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Biological Father responded&para;<br>via text message that he relinquished his rights.&para;<br>Birth Mother then decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption. Because Birth Mother believed that Biological Father had Cherokee Indian heritage, her attorney contacted&para;<br>the Cherokee Nation to determine whether Biological&para;<br>Father was formally enrolled. The inquiry letter misspelled Biological Father’s first name and incorrectly&para;<br>stated his birthday, and the Cherokee Nation responded&para;<br>that, based on the information provided, it could not verify&para;<br>Biological Father’s membership in the tribal records.&para;<br>Working through a private adoption agency, Birth&para;<br>Mother selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in&para;<br>South Carolina, to adopt Baby Girl. Adoptive Couple&para;<br>supported Birth Mother both emotionally and financially&para;<br>throughout her pregnancy. Adoptive Couple was present&para;<br>at Baby Girl’s birth in Oklahoma on September 15, 2009,&para;<br>and Adoptive Father even cut the umbilical cord. The&para;<br>next morning, Birth Mother signed forms relinquishing&para;<br>her parental rights and consenting to the adoption. Adoptive Couple initiated adoption proceedings in South Carolina a few days later, and returned there with Baby Girl.&para;<br>After returning to South Carolina, Adoptive Couple allowed Birth Mother to visit and communicate with Baby&para;<br>Girl.&para;<br>It is undisputed that, for the duration of the pregnancy&para;<br>and the first four months after Baby Girl’s birth, Biological Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother&para;<br>or Baby Girl, even though he had the ability to do so. Indeed, Biological Father “made no meaningful attempts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to assume his responsibility of parenthood” during this&para;<br>period. App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a (Sealed; internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Approximately four months after Baby Girl’s birth,&para;<br>Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of&para;<br>the pending adoption. (This was the first notification&para;<br>that they had provided to Biological Father regarding&para;<br>the adoption proceeding.) Biological Father signed papers&para;<br>stating that he accepted service and that he was “not&para;<br>contesting the adoption.” App. 37. But Biological Father&para;<br>later testified that, at the time he signed the papers, he&para;<br>thought that he was relinquishing his rights to Birth&para;<br>Mother, not to Adoptive Couple.&para;<br>Biological Father contacted a lawyer the day after signing the papers, and subsequently requested a stay of the&para;<br>adoption proceedings.2 In the adoption proceedings, Biological Father sought custody and stated that he did not&para;<br>consent to Baby Girl’s adoption. Moreover, Biological&para;<br>Father took a paternity test, which verified that he was&para;<br>Baby Girl’s biological father.&para;<br>A trial took place in the South Carolina Family Court in&para;<br>September 2011, by which time Baby Girl was two years&para;<br>old. 398 S. C. 625, 634–635, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 555–556&para;<br>(2012). The Family Court concluded that Adoptive Couple&para;<br>had not carried the heightened burden under §1912(f ) of&para;<br>proving that Baby Girl would suffer serious emotional or&para;<br>physical damage if Biological Father had custody. See id.,&para;<br>at 648–651, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562–564. The Family Court&para;<br>therefore denied Adoptive Couple’s petition for adoption&para;<br>and awarded custody to Biological Father. Id., at 629,&para;<br>636, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552, 556. On December 31, 2011, at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Around&para;<br>&para;<br>the same time, the Cherokee Nation identified Biological&para;<br>Father as a registered member and concluded that Baby Girl was an&para;<br>“Indian child” as defined in the ICWA.

Id., at 629, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552. The&para;<br>State Supreme Court first determined that the ICWA&para;<br>applied because the case involved a child custody proceeding relating to an Indian child. Id., at 637, 643, n. 18, 731&para;<br>S. E. 2d, at 556, 560, n. 18. It also concluded that Biological Father fell within the ICWA’s definition of a “ ‘parent.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 644, 731 S. E. 2d, at 560. The court then held that&para;<br>two separate provisions of the ICWA barred the termination of Biological Father’s parental rights. First, the court&para;<br>held that Adoptive Couple had not shown that “active&para;<br>efforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and&para;<br>rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup&para;<br>of the Indian family.” §1912(d); see also id., at 647–648,&para;<br>731 S. E. 2d, at 562. Second, the court concluded that&para;<br>Adoptive Couple had not shown that Biological Father’s&para;<br>“custody of Baby Girl would result in serious emotional or&para;<br>physical harm to her beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at&para;<br>648–649, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562–563 (citing §1912(f )). Finally,&para;<br>the court stated that, even if it had decided to terminate&para;<br>Biological Father’s parental rights, §1915(a)’s adoptionplacement preferences would have applied. Id., at 655–657,&para;<br>731 S. E. 2d, at 566–567. We granted certiorari. 568 U.

Moreover, according to&para;<br>Birth Mother, Biological Father has made no attempt to contact her&para;<br>since the time he took custody of Baby Girl.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

C., at 644, n. 19, 731 S. E. 2d, at&para;<br>560, n. 19 (“Under state law, [Biological] Father’s consent to the adoption would not have been required”). The&para;<br>South Carolina Supreme Court held, however, that Biological Father is a “parent” under the ICWA and that two&para;<br>statutory provisions—namely, §1912(f ) and §1912(d)—bar&para;<br>the termination of his parental rights. In this Court,&para;<br>Adoptive Couple contends that Biological Father is not a&para;<br>“parent” and that §1912(f ) and §1912(d) are inapplicable.&para;<br>We need not—and therefore do not—decide whether Biological Father is a “parent.” See §1903(9) (defining “parent”).4 Rather, assuming for the sake of argument that he&para;<br>is a “parent,” we hold that neither §1912(f ) nor §1912(d)&para;<br>bars the termination of his parental rights.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Section 1912(f ) addresses the involuntary termination&para;<br>of parental rights with respect to an Indian child. Specifically, §1912(f ) provides that “[n]o termination of parental&para;<br>rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of&para;<br>a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, . . . that the continued custody of the child by&para;<br>the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious&para;<br>emotional or physical damage to the child.” (Emphasis&para;<br>added.) The South Carolina Supreme Court held that&para;<br>Adoptive Couple failed to satisfy §1912(f ) because they did&para;<br>not make a heightened showing that Biological Father’s&para;<br>“prospective legal and physical custody” would likely result&para;<br>in serious damage to the child. 398 S. C., at 651, 731 S. E.&para;<br>2d, at 564 (emphasis added). That holding was error.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 If Biological Father is not a “parent” under the ICWA, then §1912(f )&para;<br>and §1912(d)—which relate to proceedings involving possible termination of “parental” rights—are inapplicable. Because we conclude that&para;<br>these provisions are inapplicable for other reasons, however, we need&para;<br>not decide whether Biological Father is a “parent.”&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Section 1912(f ) conditions the involuntary termination&para;<br>of parental rights on a showing regarding the merits of&para;<br>“continued custody of the child by the parent.” (Emphasis&para;<br>added.) The adjective “continued” plainly refers to a preexisting state. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concedes, post, at&para;<br>11 (dissenting opinion) (hereinafter the dissent), “continued” means “[c]arried on or kept up without cessation”&para;<br>or “[e]xtended in space without interruption or breach of&para;<br>conne[ct]ion.” Compact Edition of the Oxford English&para;<br>Dictionary 909 (1981 reprint of 1971 ed.) (Compact OED);&para;<br>see also American Heritage Dictionary 288 (1981) (defining “continue” in the following manner: “1. To go on with&para;<br>a particular action or in a particular condition; persist. . . .&para;<br>3. To remain in the same state, capacity, or place”); Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 493 (1961)&para;<br>(Webster’s) (defining “continued” as “stretching out in time&para;<br>or space esp. without interruption”); Aguilar v. FDIC, 63&para;<br>F. 3d 1059, 1062 (CA11 1995) (per curiam) (suggesting&para;<br>that the phrase “continue an action” means “go on with . . .&para;<br>an action” that is “preexisting”). The term “continued”&para;<br>also can mean “resumed after interruption.” Webster’s&para;<br>493; see American Heritage Dictionary 288. The phrase&para;<br>“continued custody” therefore refers to custody that a&para;<br>parent already has (or at least had at some point in the&para;<br>past). As a result, §1912(f ) does not apply in cases where&para;<br>the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.5&para;<br>Biological Father’s contrary reading of §1912(f ) is nonsensical. Pointing to the provision’s requirement that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 With&para;<br>&para;<br>a torrent of words, the dissent attempts to obscure the fact&para;<br>that its interpretation simply cannot be squared with the statutory&para;<br>text. A biological father’s “continued custody” of a child cannot be&para;<br>assessed if the father never had custody at all, and the use of a different phrase—“termination of parental rights”—cannot change that. In&para;<br>addition, the dissent’s reliance on subsection headings, post, at 9,&para;<br>overlooks the fact that those headings were not actually enacted by&para;<br>Congress. See 92 Stat. 3071–3072.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered . . . in&para;<br>the absence of a determination” relating to “the continued&para;<br>custody of the child by the parent,” Biological Father&para;<br>contends that if a determination relating to “continued&para;<br>custody” is inapposite in cases where there is no “custody,”&para;<br>the statutory text prohibits termination.

We disagree.&para;<br>Consistent with the statutory text, we hold that&para;<br>§1912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family’s&para;<br>“breakup” would be precipitated by the termination of the&para;<br>parent’s rights. The term “breakup” refers in this context&para;<br>to “[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,” American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or “an ending as an&para;<br>effective entity,” Webster’s 273 (defining “breakup” as “a&para;<br>disruption or dissolution into component parts: an ending&para;<br>as an effective entity”). See also Compact OED 1076&para;<br>(defining “break-up” as, inter alia, a “disruption, separation into parts, disintegration”). But when an Indian&para;<br>parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that&para;<br>child has never been in the Indian parent’s legal or&para;<br>physical custody, there is no “relationship” that would be&para;<br>“discontinu[ed]”—and no “effective entity” that would&para;<br>be “end[ed]”—by the termination of the Indian parent’s rights. In such a situation, the “breakup of the&para;<br>Indian family” has long since occurred, and §1912(d) is&para;<br>inapplicable.&para;<br>Our interpretation of §1912(d) is, like our interpretation&para;<br>of §1912(f ), consistent with the explicit congressional&para;<br>purpose of providing certain “standards for the removal of&para;<br>Indian children from their families.” §1902 (emphasis&para;<br>added); see also, e.g., §1901(4); Holyfield, 490 U. S., at 32–&para;<br>34. In addition, the BIA’s Guidelines confirm that remedial services under §1912(d) are intended “to alleviate the&para;<br>need to remove the Indian child from his or her parents or&para;<br>Indian custodians,” not to facilitate a transfer of the child&para;<br>to an Indian parent. See 44 Fed. Reg., at 67592 (emphasis&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

That these three provisions appear adjacent to&para;<br>each other strongly suggests that the phrase “breakup of&para;<br>the Indian family” should be read in harmony with the&para;<br>“continued custody” requirement. See United Sav. Assn.&para;<br>of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484&para;<br>U. S. 365, 371 (1988) (explaining that statutory construction “is a holistic endeavor” and that “[a] provision that&para;<br>may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the&para;<br>remainder of the statutory scheme”). None of these three&para;<br>provisions creates parental rights for unwed fathers where&para;<br>no such rights would otherwise exist. Instead, Indian&para;<br>parents who are already part of an “Indian family” are&para;<br>provided with access to “remedial services and rehabilitative programs” under §1912(d) so that their “custody”&para;<br>might be “continued” in a way that avoids foster-care&para;<br>placement under §1912(e) or termination of parental&para;<br>rights under §1912(f ). In other words, the provision of&para;<br>“remedial services and rehabilitative programs” under&para;<br>§1912(d) supports the “continued custody” that is protected&para;<br>by §1912(e) and §1912(f ).8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The dissent claims that our reasoning “necessarily extends to all&para;<br>Indian parents who have never had custody of their children,” even if&para;<br>those parents have visitation rights. Post, at 2–3, 13–14. As an initial&para;<br>matter, the dissent’s concern about the effect of our decision on individuals with visitation rights will be implicated, at most, in a relatively&para;<br>small class of cases. For example, our interpretation of §1912(d) would&para;<br>implicate the dissent’s concern only in the case of a parent who abandoned his or her child prior to birth and never had physical or legal&para;<br>custody, but did have some sort of visitation rights. Moreover, in cases&para;<br>where this concern is implicated, such parents might receive “comparable” protections under state law. See post, at 15.

It&para;<br>would, however, be unusual to apply §1912(d) in the context of an Indian parent who abandoned a child prior to&para;<br>birth and who never had custody of the child. The decision&para;<br>below illustrates this point.

Because the Court’s decision avoids those problems,&para;<br>I concur in its interpretation.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case arises out of a contested state-court adoption&para;<br>proceeding. Adoption proceedings are adjudicated in state&para;<br>family courts across the country every day, and “domestic&para;<br>relations” is “an area that has long been regarded as a&para;<br>virtually exclusive province of the States.” Sosna v. Iowa,&para;<br>419 U. S. 393, 404 (1975). Indeed, “[t]he whole subject of&para;<br>the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and&para;<br>child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws&para;<br>of the United States.” In re Burrus, 136 U.

Nevertheless, when Adoptive Couple filed a&para;<br>petition in South Carolina Family Court to finalize their&para;<br>adoption of Baby Girl, Birth Father, who had relinquished&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>his parental rights via a text message to Birth Mother,&para;<br>claimed a federal right under the ICWA to block the adoption and to obtain custody.&para;<br>The ICWA establishes “federal standards that govern&para;<br>state-court child custody proceedings involving Indian&para;<br>children.” Ante, at 2. The ICWA defines “Indian child” as&para;<br>“any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is&para;<br>either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible&para;<br>for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological&para;<br>child of a member of an Indian tribe.” 25 U. S. C. §1903(4).&para;<br>As relevant, the ICWA defines “child custody proceeding,”&para;<br>§1903(1), to include “adoptive placement,” which means&para;<br>“the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption,&para;<br>including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption,” §1903(1)(iv), and “termination of parental rights,”&para;<br>which means “any action resulting in the termination of&para;<br>the parent-child relationship,” §1903(1)(ii).&para;<br>The ICWA restricts a state court’s ability to terminate&para;<br>the parental rights of an Indian parent in two relevant&para;<br>ways. Section 1912(f) prohibits a state court from involuntarily terminating parental rights “in the absence of a&para;<br>determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,&para;<br>that the continued custody of the child by the parent or&para;<br>Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or&para;<br>physical damage to the child.” Section 1912(d) prohibits a&para;<br>state court from terminating parental rights until the&para;<br>court is satisfied “that active efforts have been made to&para;<br>provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs&para;<br>designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and&para;<br>that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.” A third&para;<br>provision creates specific placement preferences for the&para;<br>adoption of Indian children, which favor placement with&para;<br>Indians over other adoptive families. §1915(a). Operating&para;<br>together, these requirements often lead to different outcomes than would result under state law. That is precisely&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

See Natelson 219,&para;<br>and n. 121 (citing colonial laws).

On July 24, 1787, the convention elected&para;<br>a drafting committee—the Committee of Detail—and&para;<br>charged it to “report a Constitution conformable to the Resolutions passed by the Convention.” 2 Records of the&para;<br>Federal Convention of 1787, p.106 (M.

Id., at 137, n. 6,&para;<br>143. The first draft reported back to the convention,&para;<br>however, provided Congress with authority “[t]o regulate&para;<br>commerce with foreign nations, and among the several&para;<br>States,” id., at 181 (Madison) (Aug. 6, 1787), but did not&para;<br>include any specific Indian affairs clause.

By limiting Congress’ power to the former, the&para;<br>Framers declined to grant Congress the same broad powers over Indian affairs conferred by the Articles of Confederation. See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89&para;<br>Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 1090 (2004).&para;<br>During the ratification debates, opposition to the Indian&para;<br>Commerce Clause was nearly nonexistent.

See Natelson 247–250.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In light of the original understanding of the Indian&para;<br>Commerce Clause, the constitutional problems that would&para;<br>be created by application of the ICWA here are evident.&para;<br>First, the statute deals with “child custody proceedings,”&para;<br>§1903(1), not “commerce.” It was enacted in response to&para;<br>concerns that “an alarmingly high percentage of Indian&para;<br>families [were] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public&para;<br>and private agencies.” §1901(4). The perceived problem&para;<br>was that many Indian children were “placed in non-Indian&para;<br>foster and adoptive homes and institutions.” Ibid. This&para;<br>problem, however, had nothing to do with commerce.&para;<br>Second, the portions of the ICWA at issue here do not&para;<br>regulate Indian tribes as tribes. Sections 1912(d) and (f ),&para;<br>and §1915(a) apply to all child custody proceedings involving an Indian child, regardless of whether an Indian tribe&para;<br>is involved. This case thus does not directly implicate&para;<br>Congress’ power to “legislate in respect to Indian tribes.”&para;<br>United States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (emphasis&para;<br>added).

S. 30, 53–54 (1989) (holding that the&para;<br>Indian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody&para;<br>proceedings, even though the children were born off the&para;<br>reservation, because the children were “domiciled” on the&para;<br>reservation for purposes of the ICWA). Although Birth&para;<br>Father is a registered member of The Cherokee Nation, he&para;<br>did not live on a reservation either. He was, thus, subject&para;<br>to the laws of the State in which he resided (Oklahoma)&para;<br>and of the State where his daughter resided during the&para;<br>custody proceedings (South Carolina). Nothing in the Indian Commerce Clause permits Congress to enact special laws applicable to Birth Father merely because of his&para;<br>status as an Indian.3&para;<br>Because adoption proceedings like this one involve&para;<br>neither “commerce” nor “Indian tribes,” there is simply no&para;<br>constitutional basis for Congress’ assertion of authority&para;<br>over such proceedings. Also, the notion that Congress can&para;<br>direct state courts to apply different rules of evidence and&para;<br>procedure merely because a person of Indian descent is&para;<br>involved raises absurd possibilities. Such plenary power&para;<br>would allow Congress to dictate specific rules of criminal&para;<br>procedure for state-court prosecutions against Indian&para;<br>defendants. Likewise, it would allow Congress to substitute federal law for state law when contract disputes&para;<br>involve Indians. But the Constitution does not grant&para;<br>Congress power to override state law whenever that law&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Petitioners and the guardian ad litem contend that applying the&para;<br>ICWA to child custody proceedings on the basis of race implicates equal&para;<br>protection concerns. See Brief for Petitioners 45 (arguing that the&para;<br>statute would be unconstitutional “if unwed fathers with no preexisting&para;<br>substantive parental rights receive a statutory preference based solely&para;<br>on the Indian child’s race”); Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem&para;<br>48–49 (same).

First,&para;<br>the statute does not directly explain how to treat an absentee Indian father who had next-to-no involvement with&para;<br>his child in the first few months of her life. That category&para;<br>of fathers may include some who would prove highly unsuitable parents, some who would be suitable, and a range&para;<br>of others in between. Most of those who fall within that&para;<br>category seem to fall outside the scope of the language of&para;<br>25 U. S. C. §§1912(d) and (f ). Thus, while I agree that the&para;<br>better reading of the statute is, as the majority concludes,&para;<br>to exclude most of those fathers, ante, at 8, 12, I also understand the risk that, from a policy perspective, the&para;<br>Court’s interpretation could prove to exclude too many.&para;<br>See post, at 13, 22–23 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Second, we should decide here no more than is necessary. Thus, this case does not involve a father with visitation rights or a father who has paid “all of his child&para;<br>support obligations.” See post, at 13. Neither does it involve&para;<br>special circumstances such as a father who was deceived&para;<br>about the existence of the child or a father who was prevented from supporting his child. See post, at 13 n. 8. The&para;<br>Court need not, and in my view does not, now decide&para;<br>whether or how §§1912(d) and (f ) apply where those cir-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Section&para;<br>1915(a) grants an adoptive “preference” to “(1) a member&para;<br>of the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the&para;<br>Indian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families . . . . in the&para;<br>absence of good cause to the contrary.” Further, §1915(c)&para;<br>allows the “Indian child’s tribe” to “establish a different&para;<br>order of preference by resolution.” Could these provisions&para;<br>allow an absentee father to re-enter the special statutory&para;<br>order of preference with support from the tribe, and subject to a court’s consideration of “good cause?” I raise, but&para;<br>do not here try to answer, the question.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

I read the provision as requiring the court to&para;<br>satisfy itself (beyond a reasonable doubt) not merely that&para;<br>initial or temporary custody is not “likely to result in&para;<br>serious emotional or physical damage to the child,” but&para;<br>that continued custody is not likely to do so. See Webster’s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed. 1950)&para;<br>(defining “continued” as “[p]rotracted in time or space, esp.&para;<br>without interruption; constant”). For the reasons set forth&para;<br>in JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent, that connotation is much&para;<br>more in accord with the rest of the statute.&para;<br>While I am at it, I will add one thought. The Court’s&para;<br>opinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans the rights of&para;<br>parenthood. It has been the constant practice of the common law to respect the entitlement of those who bring a&para;<br>child into the world to raise that child. We do not inquire&para;<br>whether leaving a child with his parents is “in the best&para;<br>interest of the child.” It sometimes is not; he would be&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

The majority thereby trans­&para;<br>forms a statute that was intended to provide uniform&para;<br>federal standards for child custody proceedings involving&para;<br>Indian children and their biological parents into an illogi­&para;<br>cal piecemeal scheme.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Better to start at the beginning and consider the opera­&para;<br>tion of the statute as a whole. Cf. ante, at 13 (“[S]tatutory&para;<br>construction ‘is a holistic endeavor[,]’ and . . . ‘[a] provision&para;<br>that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by&para;<br>the remainder of the statutory scheme’ ” (quoting United&para;<br>Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,&para;<br>Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988))).&para;<br>ICWA commences with express findings. Congress rec­&para;<br>ognized that “there is no resource that is more vital to&para;<br>the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than&para;<br>their children,” 25 U. S. C. §1901(3), and it found that this&para;<br>resource was threatened. State authorities insufficiently&para;<br>sensitive to “the essential tribal relations of Indian people&para;<br>and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian&para;<br>communities and families” were breaking up Indian fami­&para;<br>lies and moving Indian children to non-Indian homes and&para;<br>institutions. See §§1901(4)–(5). As §1901(4) makes clear,&para;<br>and as this Court recognized in Mississippi Band of&para;<br>Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 33 (1989),&para;<br>adoptive placements of Indian children with non-Indian&para;<br>families contributed significantly to the overall problem. See&para;<br>§1901(4) (finding that “an alarmingly high percentage of&para;<br>[Indian] children are placed in non-Indian . . . adoptive&para;<br>homes”).&para;<br>Consistent with these findings, Congress declared its&para;<br>purpose “to protect the best interests of Indian children&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes&para;<br>and families by the establishment of minimum Federal&para;<br>standards” applicable to child custody proceedings involv­&para;<br>ing Indian children. §1902. Section 1903 then goes on to&para;<br>establish the reach of these protections through its definitional provisions. For present purposes, two of these&para;<br>definitions are crucial to understanding the statute’s full&para;<br>scope.&para;<br>First, ICWA defines the term “parent” broadly to mean&para;<br>“any biological parent . . . of an Indian child or any Indian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child.”&para;<br>§1903(9). It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an “Indian&para;<br>child” within the meaning of the statute, see §1903(4);&para;<br>ante, at 2, n. 1, and Birth Father consequently qualifies&para;<br>as a “parent” under the Act. The statutory definition of&para;<br>parent “does not include the unwed father where paternity&para;<br>has not been acknowledged or established,” §1903(9), but&para;<br>Birth Father’s biological paternity has never been ques­&para;<br>tioned by any party and was confirmed by a DNA test&para;<br>during the state court proceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>109a (Sealed).&para;<br>Petitioners and Baby Girl’s guardian ad litem devote&para;<br>many pages of briefing to arguing that the term “parent”&para;<br>should be defined with reference to the law of the State in&para;<br>which an ICWA child custody proceeding takes place. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 19–29; Brief for Respondent Guardian&para;<br>Ad Litem 32–41. These arguments, however, are incon­&para;<br>sistent with our recognition in Holyfield that Congress&para;<br>intended the critical terms of the statute to have uniform&para;<br>federal definitions. See 490 U. S., at 44–45. It is therefore&para;<br>unsurprising, although far from unimportant, that the&para;<br>majority assumes for the purposes of its analysis that&para;<br>Birth Father is an ICWA “parent.” See ante, at 7.&para;<br>Second, the Act’s comprehensive definition of “child&para;<br>custody proceeding” includes not only “ ‘adoptive place­&para;<br>ment[s],’ ” “ ‘preadoptive placement[s],’ ” and “ ‘foster care&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>placement[s],’ ” but also “ ‘termination of parental rights’ ”&para;<br>proceedings. §1903(1). This last category encompasses&para;<br>“any action resulting in the termination of the parentchild relationship,” §1903(1)(ii) (emphasis added). So far,&para;<br>then, it is clear that Birth Father has a federally recog­&para;<br>nized status as Baby Girl’s “parent” and that his “parent­&para;<br>child relationship” with her is subject to the protections of&para;<br>the Act.&para;<br>These protections are numerous. Had Birth Father&para;<br>petitioned to remove this proceeding to tribal court, for&para;<br>example, the state court would have been obligated to&para;<br>transfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or good&para;<br>cause to the contrary. See §1911(b). Any voluntary con­&para;<br>sent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl’s adoption would have&para;<br>been invalid unless written and executed before a judge&para;<br>and would have been revocable up to the time a final&para;<br>decree of adoption was entered.1 See §§1913(a), (c). And&para;<br>§1912, the center of the dispute here, sets forth procedural&para;<br>and substantive standards applicable in “involuntary&para;<br>proceeding[s] in a State court,” including foster care&para;<br>placements of Indian children and termination of paren­&para;<br>tal rights proceedings. §1912(a). I consider §1912’s provi­&para;<br>sions in order.&para;<br>Section 1912(a) requires that any party seeking “termi­&para;<br>nation of parental rights t[o] an Indian child” provide&para;<br>notice to both the child’s “parent or Indian custodian”&para;<br>and the child’s tribe “of the pending proceedings and of&para;<br>their right of intervention.” Section 1912(b) mandates&para;<br>that counsel be provided for an indigent “parent or Indian custodian” in any “termination proceeding.” Section&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 For this reason, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Birth&para;<br>Father did not give valid consent to Baby Girl’s adoption when, four&para;<br>months after her birth, he signed papers stating that he accepted&para;<br>service and was not contesting the adoption. See 398 S. C. 625, 645–&para;<br>646, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 561 (2012). See also ante, at 5. Petitioners do&para;<br>not challenge this aspect of the South Carolina court’s holding.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>1912(c) also gives all “part[ies]” to a termination proceed­&para;<br>ing—which, thanks to §§1912(a) and (b), will always in­&para;<br>clude a biological father if he desires to be present—the&para;<br>right to inspect all material “reports or other documents&para;<br>filed with the court.” By providing notice, counsel, and&para;<br>access to relevant documents, the statute ensures a biolog­&para;<br>ical father’s meaningful participation in an adoption pro­&para;<br>ceeding where the termination of his parental rights is at&para;<br>issue.&para;<br>These protections are consonant with the principle,&para;<br>recognized in our cases, that the biological bond between&para;<br>parent and child is meaningful. “[A] natural parent’s&para;<br>desire for and right to the companionship, care, custody,&para;<br>and management of his or her children,” we have ex­&para;<br>plained, “is an interest far more precious than any property right.” Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 758–759&para;<br>(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also infra,&para;<br>at 19-20. Although the Constitution does not compel the&para;<br>protection of a biological father’s parent-child relationship&para;<br>until he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has&para;<br>nevertheless recognized that “the biological connection . . .&para;<br>offers the natural father an opportunity that no other&para;<br>male possesses to develop a relationship with his off­&para;<br>spring.” Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 262 (1983).&para;<br>Federal recognition of a parent-child relationship between&para;<br>a birth father and his child is consistent with ICWA’s&para;<br>purpose of providing greater protection for the familial&para;<br>bonds between Indian parents and their children than&para;<br>state law may afford.&para;<br>The majority does not and cannot reasonably dispute&para;<br>that ICWA grants biological fathers, as “parent[s],” the&para;<br>right to be present at a termination of parental rights&para;<br>proceeding and to have their views and claims heard&para;<br>there.2 But the majority gives with one hand and takes&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Petitioners&para;<br>&para;<br>concede that, assuming Birth Father is a “parent” under&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>away with the other. Having assumed a uniform federal&para;<br>definition of “parent” that confers certain procedural&para;<br>rights, the majority then illogically concludes that ICWA’s&para;<br>substantive protections are available only to a subset of&para;<br>“parent[s]”: those who have previously had physical or&para;<br>state-recognized legal custody of his or her child. The&para;<br>statute does not support this departure.&para;<br>Section 1912(d) provides that&para;<br>“Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement&para;<br>of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child&para;<br>under State law shall satisfy the court that active&para;<br>efforts have been made to provide remedial services&para;<br>and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the&para;<br>breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts&para;<br>have proved unsuccessful.” (Emphasis added.)&para;<br>In other words, subsection (d) requires that an attempt&para;<br>be made to cure familial deficiencies before the drastic&para;<br>measures of foster care placement or termination of paren­&para;<br>tal rights can be taken.&para;<br>The majority would hold that the use of the phrase&para;<br>“breakup of the Indian family” in this subsection means&para;<br>that it does not apply where a birth father has not previ­&para;<br>ously had custody of his child. Ante, at 12. But there is&para;<br>nothing about this capacious phrase that licenses such a&para;<br>narrowing construction. As the majority notes, “breakup”&para;<br>means “ ‘[t]he discontinuance of a relationship.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>12 (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed.&para;<br>1992)). So far, all of §1912’s provisions expressly apply in&para;<br>actions aimed at terminating the “parent-child relation­&para;<br>ship” that exists between a birth father and his child, and&para;<br>they extend to it meaningful protections. As a logical&para;<br>matter, that relationship is fully capable of being pre­&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>ICWA, the notice and counsel provisions of 25 U. S. C. §§1912(a) and (b)&para;<br>&para;<br>apply to him. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>served via remedial services and rehabilitation programs.&para;<br>See infra, at 15–17. Nothing in the text of subsection (d)&para;<br>indicates that this blood relationship should be excluded&para;<br>from the category of familial “relationships” that the provision aims to save from “discontinuance.”&para;<br>The majority, reaching the contrary conclusion, asserts&para;<br>baldly that “when an Indian parent abandons an Indian&para;<br>child prior to birth and that child has never been in the&para;<br>Indian parent’s legal or physical custody, there is no ‘rela­&para;<br>tionship’ that would be ‘discontinu[ed]’ . . . by the termina­&para;<br>tion of the Indian parent’s rights.” Ante, at 12. Says who?&para;<br>Certainly not the statute. Section 1903 recognizes Birth&para;<br>Father as Baby Girl’s “parent,” and, in conjunction with&para;<br>ICWA’s other provisions, it further establishes that their&para;<br>“parent-child relationship” is protected under federal law.&para;<br>In the face of these broad definitions, the majority has no&para;<br>warrant to substitute its own policy views for Congress’ by&para;<br>saying that “no ‘relationship’ ” exists between Birth Father&para;<br>and Baby Girl simply because, based on the hotly contested facts of this case, it views their family bond as insufficiently substantial to deserve protection.3 Ibid.&para;<br>The majority states that its “interpretation of §1912(d)&para;<br>is . . . confirmed by the provision’s placement next to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The majority’s discussion of §1912(d) repeatedly references Birth&para;<br>Father’s purported “abandon[ment]” of Baby Girl, ante, at 12, 13, n. 8,&para;<br>14, and it contends that its holding with regard to this provision is&para;<br>limited to such circumstances, see ante, at 13, n. 8; see also ante, at 1&para;<br>(BREYER, J., concurring). While I would welcome any limitations on the&para;<br>majority’s holding given that it is contrary to the language and purpose&para;<br>of the statute, the majority never explains either the textual basis or&para;<br>the precise scope of its “abandon[ment]” limitation. I expect that the&para;<br>majority’s inexact use of the term “abandon[ment]” will sow confusion,&para;<br>because it is a commonly used term of art in state family law that does&para;<br>not have a uniform meaning from State to State.

This is the only aspect of&para;<br>the majority’s argument regarding §1912(d) that is based&para;<br>on ICWA’s actual text rather than layers of assertion superimposed on the text; but the conclusion the majority&para;<br>draws from the juxtaposition of these provisions is exactly&para;<br>backward.&para;<br>Section 1912(f ) is paired with §1912(e), and as the ma­&para;<br>jority notes, both come on the heels of the requirement of&para;<br>rehabilitative efforts just reviewed. The language of the&para;<br>two provisions is nearly identical; subsection (e) is headed&para;<br>“Foster care placement orders,” and subsection (f ), the&para;<br>relevant provision here, is headed “Parental rights termi­&para;<br>nation orders.” Subsection (f ) reads in its entirety,&para;<br>“No termination of parental rights may be ordered&para;<br>in such proceeding in the absence of a determination,&para;<br>supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, in­&para;<br>cluding testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that&para;<br>the continued custody of the child by the parent or In­&para;<br>dian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional&para;<br>or physical damage to the child.” §1912(f ).4&para;<br>The immediate inference to be drawn from the statute’s&para;<br>structure is that subsections (e) and (f ) work in tandem&para;<br>with the rehabilitative efforts required by (d).

If one refers back&para;<br>to the Act’s definitional section, this conclusion is not&para;<br>surprising.

A court applying §1912(f ) where the&para;<br>parent does not have pre-existing custody should, as Birth&para;<br>Father argues, determine whether the party seeking ter­&para;<br>mination of parental rights has established that the con­&para;<br>tinuation of the parent-child relationship will result in&para;<br>“serious emotional or physical damage to the child.”7&para;<br>The majority is willing to assume, for the sake of argu­&para;<br>ment, that Birth Father is a “parent” within the meaning&para;<br>of ICWA.

They are families nonetheless. Congress&para;<br>understood as much. ICWA’s definitions of “parent” and&para;<br>“termination of parental rights” provided in §1903 sweep&para;<br>broadly. They should be honored.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The majority does not rely on the theory pressed by&para;<br>petitioners and the guardian ad litem that the canon of&para;<br>constitutional avoidance compels the conclusion that ICWA&para;<br>is inapplicable here. See Brief for Petitioners 43–51;&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 48–58. It&para;<br>states instead that it finds the statute clear.16 Ante, at 17.&para;<br>But the majority nevertheless offers the suggestion that a&para;<br>contrary result would create an equal protection problem.&para;<br>Ibid. Cf. Brief for Petitioners 44–47; Brief for Respondent&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS concurs in the majority’s interpretation because,&para;<br>although he finds the statute susceptible of more than one plausible&para;<br>reading, he believes that the majority’s reading avoids “significant&para;<br>constitutional problems” concerning whether ICWA exceeds Congress’&para;<br>authority under the Indian Commerce Clause. Ante, at 1, 3–12. No&para;<br>party advanced this argument, and it is inconsistent with this Court’s&para;<br>precedents holding that Congress has “broad general powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes, powers that we have consistently&para;<br>described as plenary and exclusive,” founded not only on the Indian&para;<br>Commerce Clause but also the Treaty Clause. United States v. Lara,&para;<br>541 U. S. 193, 200–201 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Guardian Ad Litem 53–55.&para;<br>It is difficult to make sense of this suggestion in light of&para;<br>our precedents, which squarely hold that classifications&para;<br>based on Indian tribal membership are not impermissible&para;<br>racial classifications. See United States v. Antelope, 430&para;<br>U. S. 641, 645–647 (1977); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S.&para;<br>535, 553–554 (1974). The majority’s repeated, analytically&para;<br>unnecessary references to the fact that Baby Girl is 3/256&para;<br>Cherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its intima­&para;<br>tion that the statute may violate the Equal Protection&para;<br>Clause as applied here. See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante,&para;<br>at 16 (stating that ICWA “would put certain vulnerable children at a great disadvantage solely because an&para;<br>ancestor—even a remote one—was an Indian” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). I see no ground for this Court to second-guess the&para;<br>membership requirements of federally recognized Indian&para;<br>tribes, which are independent political entities. See Santa&para;<br>Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 72, n. 32 (1978).&para;<br>I am particularly averse to doing so when the Federal&para;<br>Government requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for&para;<br>official recognition, to make “descen[t] from a historical&para;<br>Indian tribe” a condition of membership. 25 CFR §83.7(e)&para;<br>(2012).&para;<br>The majority’s treatment of this issue, in the end, does&para;<br>no more than create a lingering mood of disapprobation of&para;<br>the criteria for membership adopted by the Cherokee&para;<br>Nation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an “Indian child”&para;<br>under the statute. Its hints at lurking constitutional&para;<br>problems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its statutory&para;<br>analysis, and accordingly need not detain us any longer.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Because I would affirm the South Carolina Supreme&para;<br>Court on the ground that §1912 bars the termination of&para;<br>Birth Father’s parental rights, I would not reach the&para;<br>question of the applicability of the adoptive placement&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>preferences of §1915. I note, however, that the majority&para;<br>does not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on re­&para;<br>mand, Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents or other mem­&para;<br>bers of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for&para;<br>adoption of Baby Girl. If these parties do so, and if on&para;<br>remand Birth Father’s parental rights are terminated so&para;<br>that an adoption becomes possible, they will then be enti­&para;<br>tled to consideration under the order of preference estab­&para;<br>lished in §1915. The majority cannot rule prospectively&para;<br>that §1915 would not apply to an adoption petition that&para;<br>has not yet been filed. Indeed, the statute applies “[i]n&para;<br>any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State&para;<br>law,” 25 U. S. C. §1915(a) (emphasis added), and contains&para;<br>no temporal qualifications. It would indeed be an odd&para;<br>result for this Court, in the name of the child’s best interests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro­&para;<br>ceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her&para;<br>paternal grandparents, who may have well-established&para;<br>relationships with her.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The majority opinion turns §1912 upside down, reading&para;<br>it from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is&para;<br>manifestly contrary to Congress’ express purpose in enact­&para;<br>ing ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian&para;<br>parents and their children and, more broadly, Indian&para;<br>tribes’ relationships with the future citizens who are “vital&para;<br>to [their] continued existence and integrity.” §1901(3).&para;<br>The majority casts Birth Father as responsible for the&para;<br>painful circumstances in this case, suggesting that he&para;<br>intervened “at the eleventh hour to override the mother’s&para;<br>decision and the child’s best interests,” ante, at 16. I have&para;<br>no wish to minimize the trauma of removing a 27-month­&para;<br>old child from her adoptive family. It bears remembering,&para;<br>however, that Birth Father took action to assert his paren­&para;<br>tal rights when Baby Girl was four months old, as soon as&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>he learned of the impending adoption. As the South Caro­&para;<br>lina Supreme Court recognized, “ ‘[h]ad the mandate of . . .&para;<br>ICWA been followed [in 2010], . . . much potential anguish&para;<br>might have been avoided[;] and in any case the law cannot&para;<br>be applied so as automatically to “reward those who obtain&para;<br>custody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it&para;<br>during any ensuing (and protracted) litigation.” ’ ” 398&para;<br>S. C., at 652, 731 S. E. 2d, at 564 (quoting Holyfield, 490&para;<br>U. S., at 53–54).&para;<br>The majority’s hollow literalism distorts the statute and&para;<br>ignores Congress’ purpose in order to rectify a perceived&para;<br>wrong that, while heartbreaking at the time, was a correct&para;<br>application of federal law and that in any case cannot be&para;<br>undone. Baby Girl has now resided with her father for 18&para;<br>months. However difficult it must have been for her to&para;<br>leave Adoptive Couple’s home when she was just over 2&para;<br>years old, it will be equally devastating now if, at the age&para;<br>of 3½, she is again removed from her home and sent to live&para;<br>halfway across the country. Such a fate is not foreor­&para;<br>dained, of course. But it can be said with certainty that&para;<br>the anguish this case has caused will only be compounded&para;<br>by today’s decision.&para;<br>I believe that the South Carolina Supreme Court’s&para;<br>judgment was correct, and I would affirm it.
