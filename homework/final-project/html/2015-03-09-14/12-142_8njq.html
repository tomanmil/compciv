BARTLETT&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–142.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 19, 2013—Decided June 24, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requires manufacturers to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before&para;<br>marketing any brand-name or generic drug in interstate commerce.&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §355(a). Once a drug is approved, a manufacturer is prohibited from making any major changes to the “qualitative or quantitative formulation of the drug product, including active ingredients,&para;<br>or in the specifications provided in the approved application.” 21&para;<br>CFR §314.70(b)(2)(i). Generic manufacturers are also prohibited&para;<br>from making any unilateral changes to a drug’s label.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§§314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10).&para;<br>In 2004, respondent was prescribed Clinoril, the brand-name version of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac,&para;<br>for shoulder pain. Her pharmacist dispensed a generic form of sulindac manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical. Respondent soon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.&para;<br>She is now severely disfigured, has physical disabilities, and is nearly&para;<br>blind. At the time of the prescription, sulindac’s label did not specifically refer to toxic epidermal necrolysis. By 2005, however, the FDA&para;<br>had recommended changing all NSAID labeling to contain a more explicit toxic epidermal necrolysis warning. Respondent sued Mutual&para;<br>in New Hampshire state court, and Mutual removed the case to federal court. A jury found Mutual liable on respondent’s design-defect&para;<br>claim and awarded her over $21 million. The First Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>As relevant, it found that neither the FDCA nor the FDA’s regulations pre-empted respondent’s design-defect claim. It distinguished&para;<br>PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.

BARTLETT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>guing that generic manufacturers facing design-defect claims could&para;<br>comply with both federal and state law simply by choosing not to&para;<br>make the drug at all.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: State-law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a&para;<br>drug’s warnings are pre-empted by federal law under PLIVA. Pp. 6–&para;<br>20.&para;<br>(a) Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that conflict with federal law are “without effect.” Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725,&para;<br>746. Even in the absence of an express pre-emption provision, a state&para;<br>law may be impliedly pre-empted where it is “impossible for a private&para;<br>party to comply with both state and federal requirements.” English&para;<br>v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79. Here, it is impossible for Mutual to comply with both its federal-law duty not to alter sulindac’s&para;<br>label or composition and its state-law duty to either strengthen the&para;<br>warnings on sulindac’s label or change sulindac’s design. Pp. 6–13.&para;<br>(1) New Hampshire’s design-defect cause of action imposes affirmative duties on manufacturers, including a “duty to design [their&para;<br>products] reasonably safely for the uses which [they] can foresee.”&para;<br>Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 118 N. H. 802, 809, 395 A. 2d 843,&para;<br>847. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(2) To assess whether a product’s design is “unreasonably dangerous to the user,” Vautour v. Body Masters Sports Industries, Inc.,&para;<br>147 N. H. 150, 153, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1181, the New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a “risk-utility approach,” which asks whether&para;<br>the danger’s magnitude outweighs the product’s utility, id., at 154,&para;<br>784 A. 2d, at 1182. The court has repeatedly identified three factors&para;<br>as germane to that inquiry: “the usefulness and desirability of the&para;<br>product to the public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could&para;<br>have been reduced without significantly affecting either the product’s&para;<br>effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the presence and efficacy of&para;<br>a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.” Ibid. Increasing a drug’s “usefulness”&para;<br>or reducing its “risk of danger” would require redesigning the drug,&para;<br>since those factors are direct results of a drug’s chemical design and&para;<br>active ingredients. Here, however, redesign was not possible for two&para;<br>reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same&para;<br>active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength,&para;<br>and labeling as its brand-name drug equivalent. Second, because of&para;<br>sulindac’s simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned. Accordingly, because redesign was impossible, Mutual could only ameliorate sulindac’s “risk-utility” profile by&para;<br>strengthening its warnings. Thus, New Hampshire’s law ultimately&para;<br>required Mutual to change sulindac’s labeling. Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>(3) But PLIVA makes clear that federal law prevents generic&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>drug manufacturers from changing their labels. See 564 U. S., at&para;<br>___. Accordingly, Mutual was prohibited from taking the remedial&para;<br>action required to avoid liability under New Hampshire law. P. 13.&para;<br>(4) When federal law forbids an action required by state law, the&para;<br>state law is “without effect.” Maryland, supra, at 746. Because it&para;<br>was impossible for Mutual to comply with both state and federal law,&para;<br>New Hampshire’s warning-based design-defect cause of action is preempted with respect to FDA-approved drugs sold in interstate commerce. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(b) The First Circuit’s rationale—that Mutual could escape the impossibility of complying with both its federal- and state-law duties by&para;<br>choosing to stop selling sulindac—is incompatible with this Court’s&para;<br>pre-emption cases, which have presumed that an actor seeking to satisfy both federal- and state-law obligations is not required to cease&para;<br>acting altogether.

Because Mutual was unable to change sulindac’s&para;<br>composition as a matter of both federal law and basic&para;<br>chemistry, New Hampshire’s design-defect cause of action&para;<br>effectively required Mutual to change sulindac’s labeling&para;<br>to provide stronger warnings. But, as this Court recognized just two Terms ago in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2011), federal law prohibits generic drug manufacturers from independently changing their drugs’ labels.&para;<br>Accordingly, state law imposed a duty on Mutual not to&para;<br>comply with federal law.

BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law are pre-empted and, thus, are “without effect.” Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ solution—that Mutual should&para;<br>simply have pulled sulindac from the market in order to&para;<br>comply with both state and federal law—is no solution.&para;<br>Rather, adopting the Court of Appeals’ stop-selling rationale would render impossibility pre-emption a dead&para;<br>letter and work a revolution in this Court’s pre-emption&para;<br>case law.&para;<br>Accordingly, we hold that state-law design-defect claims&para;<br>that turn on the adequacy of a drug’s warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA. We thus reverse the&para;<br>decision of the Court of Appeals below.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act&para;<br>(FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C.&para;<br>§301 et seq., drug manufacturers must gain approval from&para;<br>the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&para;<br>before marketing any drug in interstate commerce.&para;<br>§355(a). In the case of a new brand-name drug, FDA&para;<br>approval can be secured only by submitting a new-drug&para;<br>application (NDA). An NDA is a compilation of materials&para;<br>that must include “full reports of [all clinical] investigations,” §355(b)(1)(A), relevant nonclinical studies, and “any&para;<br>other data or information relevant to an evaluation of the&para;<br>safety and effectiveness of the drug product obtained or&para;<br>otherwise received by the applicant from any source,” 21&para;<br>CFR §§314.50(d)(2) and (5)(iv) (2012). The NDA must also&para;<br>include “the labeling proposed to be used for such drug,”&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §355(b)(1)(F); 21 CFR §314.50(c)(2)(i), and “a&para;<br>discussion of why the [drug’s] benefits exceed the risks&para;<br>under the conditions stated in the labeling,” 21 CFR&para;<br>§314.50(d)(5)(viii); §314.50(c)(2)(ix). The FDA may approve an NDA only if it determines that the drug in&para;<br>question is “safe for use” under “the conditions of use pre-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>scribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.” 21 U. S. C. §355(d). In order for the FDA to&para;<br>consider a drug safe, the drug’s “probable therapeutic&para;<br>benefits must outweigh its risk of harm.” FDA v. Brown &amp;&para;<br>Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 140 (2000).&para;<br>The process of submitting an NDA is both onerous and&para;<br>lengthy. See Report to Congressional Requesters, Government Accountability Office, Nov. 2006, New Drug&para;<br>Development, 26 Biotechnology L. Rep. 82, 94 (2007) (A&para;<br>typical NDA spans thousands of pages and is based on&para;<br>clinical trials conducted over several years). In order to&para;<br>provide a swifter route for approval of generic drugs,&para;<br>Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent&para;<br>Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1585, popularly known&para;<br>as the “Hatch-Waxman Act.” Under Hatch-Waxman,&para;<br>a generic drug may be approved without the same level&para;<br>of clinical testing required for approval of a new brandname drug, provided the generic drug is identical to&para;<br>the already-approved brand-name drug in several key&para;<br>respects.&para;<br>First, the proposed generic drug must be chemically&para;<br>equivalent to the approved brand-name drug: it must have&para;<br>the same “active ingredient” or “active ingredients,” “route&para;<br>of administration,” “dosage form,” and “strength” as its&para;<br>brand-name counterpart. 21 U. S. C. §§355(j)(2)(A)(ii) and&para;<br>(iii). Second, a proposed generic must be “bioequivalent”&para;<br>to an approved brand-name drug. §355(j)(2)(A)(iv). That&para;<br>is, it must have the same “rate and extent of absorption”&para;<br>as the brand-name drug. §355(j)(8)(B). Third, the generic&para;<br>drug manufacturer must show that “the labeling proposed&para;<br>for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for&para;<br>the [approved brand-name] drug.” §355(j)(2)(A)(v).&para;<br>Once a drug—whether generic or brand-name—is approved, the manufacturer is prohibited from making any&para;<br>major changes to the “qualitative or quantitative formulation of the drug product, including active ingredients, or in&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the specifications provided in the approved application.”&para;<br>21 CFR §314.70(b)(2)(i). Generic manufacturers are also&para;<br>prohibited from making any unilateral changes to a drug’s&para;<br>label. See §§314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10) (approval for&para;<br>a generic drug may be withdrawn if the generic drug’s&para;<br>label “is no longer consistent with that for [the brandname] drug”).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In 1978, the FDA approved a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pain reliever called “sulindac” under the&para;<br>brand name Clinoril. When Clinoril’s patent expired, the&para;<br>FDA approved several generic sulindacs, including one&para;<br>manufactured by Mutual Pharmaceutical. 678 F. 3d 30,&para;<br>34 (CA1 2012) (case below); App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a–&para;<br>145a. In a very small number of patients, NSAIDs—&para;<br>including both sulindac and popular NSAIDs such as&para;<br>ibuprofen, naproxen, and Cox2-inhibitors—have the serious side effect of causing two hypersensitivity skin reactions characterized by necrosis of the skin and of the&para;<br>mucous membranes: toxic epidermal necrolysis, and its&para;<br>less severe cousin, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. 678 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 34, 43–44; Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary&para;<br>1872 (31st ed. 2007); Physicians’ Desk Reference 146–147,&para;<br>597 (6th ed. 2013); Friedman, Orlet, Still, &amp; Law, Toxic&para;<br>Epidermal Necrolysis Due to Administration of Celecobix&para;<br>(Celebrex), 95 Southern Medical J. 1213, 1213–1214&para;<br>(2002).&para;<br>In December 2004, respondent Karen L. Bartlett was&para;<br>prescribed Clinoril for shoulder pain. Her pharmacist&para;<br>dispensed a generic form of sulindac, which was manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical. Respondent&para;<br>soon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.&para;<br>The results were horrific. Sixty to sixty-five percent of&para;<br>the surface of respondent’s body deteriorated, was burned&para;<br>off, or turned into an open wound. She spent months in a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>medically induced coma, underwent 12 eye surgeries, and&para;<br>was tube-fed for a year. She is now severely disfigured,&para;<br>has a number of physical disabilities, and is nearly blind.&para;<br>At the time respondent was prescribed sulindac, the&para;<br>drug’s label did not specifically refer to Stevens-Johnson&para;<br>Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, but did warn&para;<br>that the drug could cause “severe skin reactions”&para;<br>and “[f]atalities.” App. 553; 731 F. Supp. 2d 135, 142&para;<br>(NH 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). However,&para;<br>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis&para;<br>were listed as potential adverse reactions on the drug’s&para;<br>package insert. 678 F. 3d, at 36, n. 1. In 2005—once&para;<br>respondent was already suffering from toxic epidermal&para;<br>necrolysis—the FDA completed a “comprehensive review&para;<br>of the risks and benefits, [including the risk of toxic&para;<br>epidermal necrolysis], of all approved NSAID products.”&para;<br>Decision Letter, FDA Docket No. 2005P-0072/CP1, p. 2&para;<br>(June 22, 2006), online at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/&para;<br>dockets/05p0072/05p-0072-pav0001-vol1.pdf (as visited June&para;<br>18, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). As a&para;<br>result of that review, the FDA recommended changes to&para;<br>the labeling of all NSAIDs, including sulindac, to more&para;<br>explicitly warn against toxic epidermal necrolysis. App.&para;<br>353–354, 364, 557–561, 580, and n. 8.&para;<br>Respondent sued Mutual in New Hampshire state court,&para;<br>and Mutual removed the case to federal court. Respondent&para;<br>initially asserted both failure-to-warn and design-defect&para;<br>claims, but the District Court dismissed her failure-towarn claim based on her doctor’s “admi[ssion] that he&para;<br>had not read the box label or insert.” 678 F. 3d, at 34.&para;<br>After a 2-week trial on respondent’s design-defect claim, a&para;<br>jury found Mutual liable and awarded respondent over&para;<br>$21 million in damages.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals affirmed. 678 F. 3d 30.

S. ___ —in&para;<br>which the Court held that failure-to-warn claims against&para;<br>generic manufacturers are pre-empted by the FDCA’s&para;<br>prohibition on changes to generic drug labels—by arguing&para;<br>that generic manufacturers facing design-defect claims&para;<br>could simply “choose not to make the drug at all” and thus&para;<br>comply with both federal and state law. 678 F. 3d, at 37.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 568 U.

Accordingly, the state law is&para;<br>pre-empted.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We begin by identifying petitioner’s duties under state&para;<br>law. As an initial matter, respondent is wrong in asserting that the purpose of New Hampshire’s designdefect cause of action “is compensatory, not regulatory.”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 19. Rather, New Hampshire’s designdefect cause of action imposes affirmative duties on&para;<br>manufacturers.&para;<br>Respondent is correct that New Hampshire has adopted&para;<br>the doctrine of strict liability in tort as set forth in Section&para;<br>402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. See 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1963 and 1964) (hereinafter Restatement 2d). See Buttrick v. Arthur Lessard &amp;&para;<br>Sons, Inc., 110 N. H. 36, 37–39, 260 A. 2d 111, 112–113&para;<br>(1969). Under the Restatement—and consequently, under&para;<br>New Hampshire tort law—“[o]ne who sells any product in&para;<br>a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user&para;<br>or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for&para;<br>physical harm thereby caused” even though he “has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the&para;<br>product.” Restatement 2d §402A, at 347–348.&para;<br>But respondent’s argument conflates what we will call a&para;<br>“strict-liability” regime (in which liability does not depend&para;<br>on negligence, but still signals the breach of a duty) with&para;<br>what we will call an “absolute-liability” regime (in which&para;<br>liability does not reflect the breach of any duties at all, but&para;<br>merely serves to spread risk). New Hampshire has adopted&para;<br>the former, not the latter. Indeed, the New Hampshire&para;<br>Supreme Court has consistently held that the manufacturer of a product has a “duty to design his product&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reasonably safely for the uses which he can foresee.”&para;<br>Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 118 N.

H. 457, 465, 404 A. 2d 1094, 1099 (1979) (“In&para;<br>New Hampshire, the manufacturer is under a general&para;<br>duty to design his product reasonably safely for the uses&para;<br>which he can foresee” (internal quotation marks omitted));&para;<br>Chellman v. Saab-Scania AB, 138 N. H. 73, 78, 637 A. 2d&para;<br>148, 150 (1993) (“The duty to warn is part of the general&para;<br>duty to design, manufacture and sell products that are&para;<br>reasonably safe for their foreseeable uses”); cf.

H. 386, 390, 702 A. 2d&para;<br>330, 333 (1997) (cautioning “that the term ‘unreasonably&para;<br>dangerous’ should not be interpreted so broadly as to&para;<br>impose absolute liability on manufacturers or make them&para;<br>insurers of their products”). Accordingly, respondent is&para;<br>incorrect in arguing that New Hampshire’s strict-liability&para;<br>system “imposes no substantive duties on manufacturers.”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 19.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 We&para;<br>&para;<br>can thus save for another day the question whether a true&para;<br>absolute-liability state-law system could give rise to impossibility&para;<br>pre-emption. As we have noted, most common-law causes of action for&para;<br>negligence and strict liability do not exist merely to spread risk, but&para;<br>rather impose affirmative duties. See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552&para;<br>U. S. 312, 323–324 (2008) (“In [Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.

Determining the content of that duty&para;<br>requires somewhat more analysis.

Since Mutual did not have the option of&para;<br>changing sulindac’s design, New Hampshire law ultimately&para;<br>required it to change sulindac’s labeling.&para;<br>Respondent argues that, even if New Hampshire law&para;<br>does impose a duty on drug manufacturers, that duty does&para;<br>not encompass either the “duty to change sulindac’s design” or the duty “to change sulindac’s labeling.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 30 (capitalization and emphasis deleted).&para;<br>That argument cannot be correct. New Hampshire imposes&para;<br>design-defect liability only where “the design of the&para;<br>product created a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.” Vautour v.

To&para;<br>determine whether a product is “unreasonably dangerous,”&para;<br>the New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a “riskutility approach” under which “a product is defective as&para;<br>designed if the magnitude of the danger outweighs the&para;<br>utility of the product.” Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d,&para;<br>at 1182 (internal quotation marks omitted).

BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>open one, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has repeatedly identified three factors as germane to the risk-utility&para;<br>inquiry: “the usefulness and desirability of the product to&para;<br>the public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could&para;<br>have been reduced without significantly affecting either&para;<br>the product’s effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the&para;<br>presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable&para;<br>uses.” Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182; see also&para;<br>Price, supra, at 389, 702 A. 2d, at 333 (same); Chellman,&para;<br>supra, at 77–78, 637 A. 2d, at 150 (same).&para;<br>In the drug context, either increasing the “usefulness” of&para;<br>a product or reducing its “risk of danger” would require&para;<br>redesigning the drug: A drug’s usefulness and its risk&para;<br>of danger are both direct results of its chemical design&para;<br>and, most saliently, its active ingredients. See 21 CFR&para;<br>§201.66(b)(2) (2012) (“Active ingredient means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity&para;<br>or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the&para;<br>structure of any function of the body of humans” (italics&para;<br>deleted)).&para;<br>In the present case, however, redesign was not possible&para;<br>for two reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug&para;<br>to have the same active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling as the&para;<br>brand-name drug on which it is based. 21 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§355(j)(2)(A)(ii)–(v) and (8)(B); 21 CFR §320.1(c). Consequently, the Court of Appeals was correct to recognize that&para;<br>“Mutual cannot legally make sulindac in another composition.” 678 F. 3d, at 37. Indeed, were Mutual to change the&para;<br>composition of its sulindac, the altered chemical would be a&para;<br>new drug that would require its own NDA to be marketed&para;<br>in interstate commerce. See 21 CFR §310.3(h) (giving&para;<br>examples of when the FDA considers a drug to be new,&para;<br>including cases involving “newness for drug use of any&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

See 678 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 37 (“Mutual cannot legally make sulindac in another&para;<br>composition (nor it is apparent how it could alter a onemolecule drug anyway)”).&para;<br>Given the impossibility of redesigning sulindac, the only&para;<br>way for Mutual to ameliorate the drug’s “risk-utility”&para;<br>profile—and thus to escape liability—was to strengthen&para;<br>“the presence and efficacy of [sulindac’s] warning” in such&para;<br>a way that the warning “avoid[ed] an unreasonable risk of&para;<br>harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.”&para;<br>Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182.

If the design of a product makes a warning&para;<br>necessary to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from a&para;<br>foreseeable use, the lack of warning or an ineffective warning causes the product to be defective and unreasonably&para;<br>dangerous” (citation omitted)). Thus, New Hampshire’s&para;<br>design-defect cause of action imposed a duty on Mutual to&para;<br>strengthen sulindac’s warnings.&para;<br>For these reasons, it is unsurprising that allegations&para;<br>that sulindac’s label was inadequate featured prominently&para;<br>at trial.

This Court has previously noted&para;<br>that, as of 1986, “a large number of courts” took comment k to mean&para;<br>that manufacturers “did not face strict liability for side effects of&para;<br>properly manufactured prescription drugs that were accompanied by&para;<br>adequate warnings.” Bruesewitz v.

But, as discussed below, infra, at 15–16—leaving aside the rare case in which&para;<br>state or federal law actually requires a product to be pulled from the&para;<br>market—our pre-emption cases presume that a manufacturer’s ability&para;<br>to stop selling does not turn impossibility into possibility. See, e.g.,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>warning-based design-defect cause of action is pre-empted&para;<br>with respect to FDA-approved drugs sold in interstate&para;<br>commerce.4&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reasoned that Mutual could escape&para;<br>the impossibility of complying with both its federal- and&para;<br>state-law duties by “choos[ing] not to make [sulindac] at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

And, of course, PLIVA,&para;<br>Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.

See id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 12) (“[I]t was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply&para;<br>with both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal law&para;<br>duty to keep the label the same”). To hold otherwise would render&para;<br>impossibility pre-emption “all but meaningless.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 14).&para;<br>4 We do not address state design-defect claims that parallel the federal&para;<br>misbranding statute. The misbranding statute requires a manufacturer to pull even an FDA-approved drug from the market when it is&para;<br>“dangerous to health” even if “used in the dosage or manner, or with&para;<br>the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the&para;<br>labeling thereof.” 21 U.

The parties and the Government appear to agree that a&para;<br>drug is misbranded under federal law only when liability is based on&para;<br>new and scientifically significant information that was not before the&para;<br>FDA. Because the jury was not asked to find whether new evidence&para;<br>concerning sulindac that had not been made available to the FDA&para;<br>rendered sulindac so dangerous as to be misbranded under the federal&para;<br>misbranding statute, the misbranding provision is not applicable here.&para;<br>Cf. 760 F.

We reject this “stop-selling” rationale as incompatible with our pre-emption jurisprudence. Our pre-emption cases presume that an actor&para;<br>seeking to satisfy both his federal- and state-law obligations is not required to cease acting altogether in order to&para;<br>avoid liability. Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility pre-emption&para;<br>would be “all but meaningless.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 14).&para;<br>The incoherence of the stop-selling theory becomes plain&para;<br>when viewed through the lens of our previous cases. In&para;<br>every instance in which the Court has found impossibility&para;<br>pre-emption, the “direct conflict” between federal- and&para;<br>state-law duties could easily have been avoided if the&para;<br>regulated actor had simply ceased acting.&para;<br>PLIVA is an obvious example: As discussed above, the&para;<br>PLIVA Court held that state failure-to-warn claims were&para;<br>pre-empted by the FDCA because it was impossible for&para;<br>drug manufacturers like PLIVA to comply with both the&para;<br>state-law duty to label their products in a way that rendered them reasonably safe and the federal-law duty not&para;<br>to change their drugs’ labels. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11). It&para;<br>would, of course, have been possible for drug manufacturers like PLIVA to pull their products from the market&para;<br>altogether. In so doing, they would have avoided liability&para;<br>under both state and federal law: such manufacturers&para;<br>would neither have labeled their products in a way that&para;<br>rendered them unsafe nor impermissibly changed any&para;<br>federally approved label.&para;<br>In concluding that “it was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change&para;<br>the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the&para;<br>same,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 12), the Court was undeterred by the prospect that PLIVA could have complied&para;<br>with both state and federal requirements by simply leaving the market. The Court of Appeals decision below had&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>found that Mensing’s state-law failure-to-warn claims&para;<br>escaped pre-emption based on the very same stop-selling&para;<br>rationale the First Circuit relied on in this case. See&para;<br>Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d 603, 611 (CA8 2009)&para;<br>(“[G]eneric defendants were not compelled to market&para;<br>metoclopramide.

PLIVA, supra; Pet. for Reh’g in No. 09–993 etc.,&para;<br>p. 2. Nonetheless, this Court squarely determined that it&para;<br>had been “impossible” for PLIVA to comply with both its&para;<br>state and federal duties. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).5&para;<br>Adopting the First Circuit’s stop-selling rationale would&para;<br>mean that not only PLIVA, but also the vast majority—if&para;<br>not all—of the cases in which the Court has found impossibility pre-emption, were wrongly decided. Just as the&para;<br>prospect that a regulated actor could avoid liability under&para;<br>both state and federal law by simply leaving the market&para;<br>did not undermine the impossibility analysis in PLIVA, so&para;<br>it is irrelevant to our analysis here.&para;<br>V&para;<br>The dreadful injuries from which products liabilities&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Respondent attempts to distinguish this case from PLIVA, arguing&para;<br>that “[w]here, as in PLIVA, state law imposes an affirmative duty on a&para;<br>manufacturer to improve the product’s label, suspending sales does not&para;<br>comply with the state-law duty; it merely offers an indirect means of&para;<br>avoiding liability for noncompliance with that duty.” Brief for Respondent 39. But that difference is purely semantic: the state-law duty&para;<br>in PLIVA to amend metoclopramide’s label could just as easily have&para;<br>been phrased as a duty not to sell the drug without adequate warnings.&para;<br>At least where a State imposes liability based on a balancing of a&para;<br>product’s harms and benefits in light of its labeling—rather than&para;<br>directly prohibiting the product’s sale—the mere fact that a manufacturer may avoid liability by leaving the market does not defeat a claim&para;<br>of impossibility.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Where state law&para;<br>imposes a duty to take such remedial measures, it “actual[ly] conflict[s] with federal law” by making it “ ‘impossible for a private party to comply with both state and&para;<br>federal requirements.’ ” Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514&para;<br>U. S. 280, 287 (1995) (quoting English, 496 U. S., at 78–&para;<br>79). The dissent seems to acknowledge that point when it&para;<br>concedes that, “if federal law requires a particular product&para;<br>label to include a complete list of ingredients while state&para;<br>law specifically forbids that labeling practice, there is little&para;<br>question that state law ‘must yield.’ ” Post, at 6–7 (quoting&para;<br>Felder v.

What the&para;<br>dissent does not see is that that is this case: Federal law&para;<br>requires a very specific label for sulindac, and state law&para;<br>forbids the use of that label.&para;<br>The dissent responds that New Hampshire law “merely&para;<br>create[s] an incentive” to alter sulindac’s label or composition, post, at 7, but does not impose any actual “legal&para;<br>obligation,” post, at 13. The contours of that argument are&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>difficult to discern. Perhaps the dissent is drawing a&para;<br>distinction between common-law “exposure to liability,”&para;<br>post, at 12, and a statutory “legal mandate,” ibid. But the&para;<br>distinction between common law and statutory law is&para;<br>irrelevant to the argument at hand: In violating a commonlaw duty, as surely as by violating a statutory duty, a&para;<br>party contravenes the law. While it is true that, in a&para;<br>certain sense, common-law duties give a manufacturer the&para;<br>choice “between exiting the market or continuing to sell&para;<br>while knowing it may have to pay compensation to consumers injured by its product,” post, at 16, statutory&para;<br>“mandate[s]” do precisely the same thing: They require a&para;<br>manufacturer to choose between leaving the market and&para;<br>accepting the consequences of its actions (in the form of a&para;<br>fine or other sanction). See generally Calabresi &amp; Melamed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability:&para;<br>One View of the Cathedral, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089 (1972)&para;<br>(discussing liability rules). And, in any event, PLIVA—&para;<br>which the dissent agrees involved a state-law “requirement that conflicted with federal law,” post, at 13—dealt&para;<br>with common-law failure-to-warn claims, see PLIVA,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4). Because PLIVA controls the&para;<br>instant case, the dissent is reduced to fighting a rearguard&para;<br>action against its reasoning despite ostensibly swearing&para;<br>fealty to its holding.&para;<br>To suggest that Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544&para;<br>U. S. 431 (2005), is to the contrary is simply misleading.&para;<br>The dissent is correct that Bates held a Texas state-law&para;<br>design-defect claim not to be pre-empted. But, it did so&para;<br>because the design-defect claim in question was not a&para;<br>“requirement ‘for labeling or packaging ’ ” and thus fell&para;<br>outside the class of claims covered by the express preemption provision at issue in that case. Id., at 443–444&para;<br>(emphasis in original). Indeed, contrary to the impression&para;<br>one might draw from the dissent, post, at 12–13, the Bates&para;<br>Court actually blessed the lower court’s determination&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the State’s design-defect claim imposed a preemptable “requirement”: “The Court of Appeals did, however, correctly hold that the term ‘requirements’ in&para;<br>§136v(b) reaches beyond positive enactments, such as&para;<br>statutes and regulations, to embrace common-law duties.”&para;<br>Bates, supra, at 443. The dissent offers no compelling&para;<br>reason why the “common-law duty” in this case should not&para;<br>similarly be viewed as a “requirement.” We agree, of&para;<br>course, that “determining precisely what, if any, specific&para;<br>requirement a state common-law claim imposes is important.” Post, at 12, n. 5. As Bates makes clear, “[t]he&para;<br>proper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of&para;<br>the common-law duty at issue; it does not call for speculation as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manufacturer to take any particular action.” 544 U. S., at 445&para;<br>(citation omitted). Here, as we have tried to make clear,&para;<br>the duty to ensure that one’s products are not “unreasonably dangerous” imposed by New Hampshire’s design-defect&para;<br>cause of action, Vautour, 147 N. H., at 153, 784 A. 2d, at&para;<br>1181, involves a duty to make one of several changes. In&para;<br>cases where it is impossible—in fact or by law—to alter a&para;<br>product’s design (and thus to increase the product’s “usefulness” or decrease its “risk of danger”), the duty to render a product “reasonably safe” boils down to a duty to&para;<br>ensure “the presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an&para;<br>unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from&para;<br>foreseeable uses.” Id., at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182. The&para;<br>duty to redesign sulindac’s label was thus a part of the&para;<br>common-law duty at issue—not merely an action Mutual&para;<br>might have been prompted to take by the adverse jury&para;<br>verdict here.&para;<br>Finally, the dissent laments that we have ignored&para;<br>“Congress’ explicit efforts to preserve state common-law&para;<br>liability.” Post, at 26.

Remarkably,&para;<br>the Court derives this proposition from a federal law that,&para;<br>in order to protect consumers, prohibits manufacturers&para;<br>from distributing new drugs in commerce without federal&para;<br>regulatory approval, and specifically disavows any intent&para;<br>to displace state law absent a direct and positive conflict.&para;<br>Karen Bartlett was grievously injured by a drug that a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

If our established pre-emption&para;<br>principles were properly applied in this case, and if New&para;<br>Hampshire law were correctly construed, then federal law&para;<br>would pose no barrier to Karen Bartlett’s recovery. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>I begin with “two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence,” Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.

First, “ ‘the purpose of Congress is&para;<br>the ultimate touchstone’ in every pre-emption case.” Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485&para;<br>(1996)). Second, we start from the “assumption that the&para;<br>historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by [a] Federal Act unless that was the clear and&para;<br>manifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator&para;<br>Corp., 331 U.

Tracing the history of&para;<br>federal drug regulation from the 1906 Federal Food and&para;<br>Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, up to the FDCA and its major&para;<br>amendments, the Court explained that federal drug law&para;<br>and state common-law liability have long been understood&para;<br>to operate in tandem to promote consumer safety. See&para;<br>Levine, 555 U. S., at 566–568, 574. That basic principle,&para;<br>which the majority opinion elides, is essential to understanding this case.&para;<br>The FDCA prohibits the “introduction into interstate&para;<br>commerce [of ] any new drug” without prior approval from&para;<br>the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §355(a). Brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are required to make different showings to receive agency approval in this premarketing review process.&para;<br>See ante, at 2–3. But in either case, the FDA’s permission to market a drug has never been regarded as a&para;<br>final stamp of approval of the drug’s safety. Under the&para;<br>FDCA, manufacturers, who have greater “access to information about their drugs” than the FDA, Levine, 555&para;<br>U.

In addition to their&para;<br>ongoing obligations to monitor a drug’s risks and to report&para;<br>adverse drug responses to the FDA, see 21 CFR §§314.80,&para;<br>314.81, 314.98 (2012), manufacturers may not sell a drug&para;<br>that is “deemed to be misbranded” because it is “danger——————&para;<br>useful.

Levine, 555 U. S., at 578. Federal law in this area&para;<br>was initially intended to “supplemen[t] the protection for&para;<br>consumers already provided by state regulation and&para;<br>common-law liability.” Id., at 566. And as Congress “enlarged&para;<br>the FDA’s powers,” it “took care to preserve state law.”&para;<br>Id., at 567. In the 1962 amendments to the FDCA, which&para;<br>established the FDA’s premarketing review in its modern&para;<br>form, Congress adopted a saving clause providing that&para;<br>the amendments should not be construed to invalidate&para;<br>any provision of state law absent “a direct and positive&para;<br>conflict.” §202, 76 Stat. 793. And in the years since,&para;<br>with “state common-law suits ‘continu[ing] unabated despite . . . FDA regulation,’ ” Levine, 555 U. S., at 567&para;<br>(quoting Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U.

Moreover, the FDA, which is tasked with monitoring thousands of drugs on the market and considering new&para;<br>drug applications, faces significant resource constraints&para;<br>that limit its ability to protect the public from dangerous&para;<br>drugs. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 578–579, and n. 11; Brief&para;<br>for Former FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 6–7, 12–20. Tort suits can help fill the gaps&para;<br>in federal regulation by “serv[ing] as a catalyst” to identify&para;<br>previously unknown drug dangers. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.

Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 64 (2002). While the&para;<br>Court has not always been consistent on this issue, it has&para;<br>repeatedly cautioned against reading federal statutes to&para;<br>“remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured”&para;<br>when Congress did not provide a federal remedy.

And in fact, the legislative history of the&para;<br>FDCA suggests that Congress chose not to create a federal&para;<br>cause of action for damages precisely because it believed&para;<br>that state tort law would allow injured consumers to&para;<br>obtain compensation. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 574–575,&para;<br>and n. 7.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In light of this background, Mutual should face an&para;<br>uphill climb to show that federal law pre-empts a New&para;<br>Hampshire strict-liability claim against a generic drug&para;<br>manufacturer for defective design. The majority nevertheless accepts Mutual’s argument that “compliance with&para;<br>both federal and state [law was] a physical impossibility.”&para;<br>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S.&para;<br>132, 142–143 (1963); see ante, at 7. But if state and federal law are properly understood, it is clear that New&para;<br>Hampshire’s design-defect claim did not impose a legal&para;<br>obligation that Mutual had to violate federal law to satisfy.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Impossibility pre-emption “is a demanding defense,” Levine, 555 U. S., at 573, that requires the defendant to&para;<br>show an “irreconcilable conflict” between federal and state&para;<br>legal obligations, Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 256. The logic&para;<br>underlying true impossibility pre-emption is that when&para;<br>state and federal law impose irreconcilable affirmative&para;<br>requirements, no detailed “inquiry into congressional design” is necessary because the inference that Congress&para;<br>would have intended federal law to displace the conflicting&para;<br>state requirement “is inescapable.” Florida Lime, 373&para;<br>U. S., at 142–143. So, for example, if federal law requires&para;<br>a particular product label to include a complete list of&para;<br>ingredients while state law specifically forbids that labeling practice, there is little question that state law “must&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>yield.” Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138 (1988).&para;<br>The key inquiry for impossibility pre-emption, then, is&para;<br>to identify whether state and federal law impose directly&para;<br>conflicting affirmative legal obligations such that state law&para;<br>“require[s] the doing of an act which is unlawful under”&para;<br>federal law. California Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Guerra,&para;<br>479 U. S. 272, 292 (1987). Impossibility does not exist&para;<br>where the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that&para;<br>the laws of the other sovereign restricts or even prohibits.&para;<br>See Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517&para;<br>U. S. 25, 31 (1996); Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assn.,&para;<br>Inc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467&para;<br>U. S. 461, 478, n. 21 (1984). So, to modify the previous&para;<br>example, if federal law permitted (but did not require)&para;<br>a labeling practice that state law prohibited, there would&para;<br>be no irreconcilable conflict; a manufacturer could comply with the more stringent regulation. And by the same&para;<br>logic, impossibility does not exist where one sovereign’s&para;<br>laws merely create an incentive to take an action that the&para;<br>other sovereign has not authorized because it is possible to&para;<br>comply with both laws.&para;<br>Of course, there are other types of pre-emption. Courts&para;<br>may find that state laws that incentivize what federal law&para;<br>discourages or forbid what federal law authorizes are preempted for reasons apart from impossibility: The state&para;<br>laws may fall within the scope of an express pre-emption&para;<br>provision, pose an obstacle to federal purposes and objectives, or intrude upon a field that Congress intended for&para;<br>federal law to occupy exclusively. See Crosby v. National&para;<br>Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372–373 (2000).&para;<br>But absent a direct conflict between two mutually incompatible legal requirements, there is no impossibility and&para;<br>courts may not automatically assume that Congress intended for state law to give way. Instead, a more careful&para;<br>inquiry into congressional intent is called for, and that&para;<br>inquiry should be informed by the presumption against&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>pre-emption.&para;<br>In keeping with the strict standard for impossibility,&para;<br>cases that actually find pre-emption on that basis are rare.&para;<br>See Abrams, Plenary Power Preemption, 99 Va. L. Rev.&para;<br>601, 608 (2013). Mensing is an outlier, as the Court found&para;<br>impossibility because a generic drug manufacturer could&para;<br>not strengthen its product label to come into line with a&para;<br>state-law duty to warn without the exercise of judgment&para;<br>by the FDA.

In addition, New Hampshire has specifically rejected the doctrine, advocated by&para;<br>the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability §2(b)&para;<br>(1997) (hereinafter Third Restatement), that a plaintiff&para;<br>must present evidence of a reasonable alternative design&para;<br>to show that a product’s design is defective.

See Brochu, 642&para;<br>F. 2d, at 657. Comment k did not factor into the jury’s&para;<br>assessment of liability in this case because Mutual abandoned a comment k defense before trial. Ante, at 12, n. 2.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Though the majority does not rely on comment k to find preemption, it misleadingly implies that New Hampshire, like “a large&para;<br>majority of States,” has applied comment k categorically to prescription&para;<br>drugs to exempt manufacturers from “ ‘strict liability for side effects of&para;<br>properly manufactured prescription drugs that [are] accompanied by adequate warnings.’ ” Ante, at 12, n. 2 (quoting Bruesewitz v.

Specifically, and contrary to the majority, see ante,&para;<br>at 11, New Hampshire’s design-defect law did not require&para;<br>Mutual to change its warning label. A drug’s warning&para;<br>label is just one factor in a nonexclusive list for evaluating&para;<br>whether a drug is unreasonably dangerous, see Vautour,&para;<br>147 N. H., at 156, 784 A. 2d, at 1183, and an adequate&para;<br>label is therefore neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for avoiding design-defect liability. Likewise, New&para;<br>Hampshire law imposed no duty on Mutual to change&para;<br>sulindac’s chemical composition. The New Hampshire&para;<br>Supreme Court has held that proof of an alternative feasible design is not an element of a design-defect claim, see&para;<br>Kelleher v.

In Bates, for example, we rejected an argument that design-defect claims&para;<br>brought against a pesticide manufacturer were pre-empted&para;<br>because they would likely “induce” the manufacturer to&para;<br>change its product label and thus run afoul of an express&para;<br>pre-emption provision forbidding state labeling “requirements” that were different or in addition to federal requirements. 544 U.

A requirement, we&para;<br>explained, “is a rule of law that must be obeyed.” Id., at&para;<br>445. “[A]n event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates an optional decision,” does not rise to that level.&para;<br>Ibid.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The majority suggests my account of Bates is “simply misleading,”&para;<br>ante, at 18, but it simply misses the point.

See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 323–324&para;<br>(2008). But determining precisely what, if any, specific requirement a&para;<br>state common-law claim imposes is important. In Bates, the lower&para;<br>court had accepted the same basic argument that the majority advances&para;<br>here: that the plaintiffs’ design-defect claim that a pesticide was “unreasonably dangerous” was “merely a disguised claim for failure to&para;<br>warn” because success on the claim that the pesticide was dangerous to&para;<br>crops in soil above a certain pH level would “necessarily induce” a&para;<br>manufacturer to change its product’s label to avoid liability.

The District Court also explained to the jury that&para;<br>because Bartlett’s claim addressed only whether sulindac’s&para;<br>design was defective, Mutual’s conduct, “which included&para;<br>any failure to change its warning, was ‘not relevant to this&para;<br>case.’ ” 760 F.

Though the&para;<br>majority insists otherwise, ante, at 17, it appears to rely&para;<br>principally on an implicit assumption about rights conferred by federal premarket approval under the FDCA.&para;<br>After correctly observing that changing sulindac’s chemical composition would create a new drug that would have&para;<br>to go through its own approval process, the majority reasons that Mutual must have been under a state-law duty&para;<br>to change its label because it had no other option to avoid&para;<br>liability while continuing to sell its product. Ante, at 10–&para;<br>11. But that conclusion is based on a false premise.&para;<br>A manufacturer of a drug that is unreasonably dangerous under New Hampshire law has multiple options: It&para;<br>can change the drug’s design or label in an effort to alter&para;<br>its risk-benefit profile, remove the drug from the market,&para;<br>or pay compensation as a cost of doing business. If federal&para;<br>law or the drug’s chemical properties take the redesign&para;<br>option off the table, then that does not mean the manufacturer suddenly has a legal obligation under state law to&para;<br>improve the drug’s label. Indeed, such a view of state law&para;<br>makes very little sense here because even if Mutual had&para;<br>strengthened its label to fully account for sulindac’s risks,&para;<br>the company might still have faced liability for having&para;<br>a defective design. See Thibault, 118 N. H., at 808, 395&para;<br>A. 2d, at 847 (explaining that strict liability “may attach&para;<br>even though . . . there was an adequate warning”). When&para;<br>a manufacturer cannot change the label or when doing so&para;<br>would not make the drug safe, the manufacturer may still&para;<br>choose between exiting the market or continuing to sell&para;<br>while knowing it may have to pay compensation to consumers injured by its product.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The majority’s suggestion that a manufacturer’s option of continuing&para;<br>to sell while paying compensation is akin to violating a statutory&para;<br>mandate and then suffering the consequence (such as paying a fine) is&para;<br>flawed.

Because the&para;<br>majority does not rely on obstacle pre-emption, it must&para;<br>believe that a manufacturer that received FDA premarket&para;<br>approval has a right not only to keep its drug on the market unless and until the FDA revokes approval, but also to&para;<br>be free from state-law liability that makes doing so more&para;<br>expensive.

Yet the majority skips that analysis and instead finds impossibility&para;<br>where it does not exist by relying on a question-begging&para;<br>assumption that Congress intended for Mutual to have a&para;<br>way to continue selling sulindac without incurring common-law liability. See ante, at 9–11.&para;<br>The distinction between impossibility and obstacle preemption is an important one. While obstacle pre-emption&para;<br>can be abused when courts apply an overly broad conception of the relevant federal purpose to find pre-emption,&para;<br>see Levine, 555 U.

BARTLETT&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>in judgment), it is a useful framework for a case like this&para;<br>one because it would at least lead the Court to ask the&para;<br>right questions.&para;<br>For example, properly evaluating the asserted conflict&para;<br>here through the lens of obstacle pre-emption would allow&para;<br>the Court to consider evidence about whether Congress&para;<br>intended the FDA to make an optimal safety determination and set a maximum safety standard (in which case&para;<br>state tort law would undermine the purpose) rather than&para;<br>a minimal safety threshold (in which case state tort&para;<br>law could supplement it). See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda&para;<br>Motor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 11). By contrast, the majority’s overbroad impossibility&para;<br>framework takes no account of how federal drug safety&para;<br>review actually works. Though the majority gestures to&para;<br>the rigorous nature of the FDA’s review of new drug applications, ante, at 2–3, nothing in the majority’s reasoning turns on how the FDA’s premarketing review operates&para;<br>or on the agency’s capacity to engage in postmarketing&para;<br>review.&para;<br>In taking the approach it does, the majority replaces&para;<br>careful assessment of regulatory structure with an ipse&para;<br>dixit that pharmaceutical companies must have a way to&para;<br>“escape liability,” ante, at 11, while continuing to sell a&para;<br>drug that received FDA approval. As a result, the majority effectively makes a highly contested policy judgment&para;<br>about the relationship between FDA review and state tort&para;<br>law—treating the FDA as the sole guardian of drug&para;<br>safety—without defending its judgment and without considering whether that is the policy judgment that Congress&para;<br>made.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Defending a policy judgment that treats the FDA as the exclusive&para;<br>guarantor of drug safety would be no easy task in light of evidence that&para;<br>resource constraints and gaps in legal authority, among other factors,&para;<br>limit the agency’s ability to safeguard public health.

The FDA, through an amicus brief filed by the&para;<br>United States, generally supports this argument. The&para;<br>FDA states that the question whether a design-defect&para;<br>claim12 is pre-empted is “difficult and close,” and it recognizes that “[s]everal factors do weigh in favor of finding no&para;<br>preemption,” including the absence of textual support in&para;<br>the FDCA for the idea that an approved drug must be&para;<br>made available in any particular State. See U. S. Brief&para;<br>12, 21–22. But the FDA ultimately contends that designdefect claims are pre-empted unless they parallel the&para;<br>FDCA’s misbranding prohibition because the agency believes that permitting juries to balance the health risks&para;<br>and benefits of an FDA-approved drug would undermine&para;<br>the FDA’s drug-safety determinations and could reduce&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Failure-to-Warn Claims, 96 Geo.

The FDA’s separate discussion of a “pure” design-defect claim is&para;<br>based on the premise that New Hampshire’s design-defect claim turns&para;<br>on the adequacy of a drug’s warning. See U. S.

This assumption, it seems, will&para;<br>always create an automatic conflict between a federal&para;<br>premarket review requirement and state-law design-defect&para;<br>liability because premarket review, by definition, prevents&para;<br>manufacturers from unilaterally changing their products’&para;<br>designs.14 That is true, for example, of the designs (i.e.,&para;<br>the chemical composition) of brand-name drugs under&para;<br>the FDCA no less than it is for generic drugs. See ante, at&para;<br>3–4.&para;<br>If the creation of such an automatic conflict is the ultimate end-point of the majority’s continued expansion of&para;<br>impossibility pre-emption, then the result is frankly astonishing. Congress adopted the FDCA’s premarketing approval requirement in 1938 and then strengthened it in&para;<br>1962 in response to serious public-health episodes involving unsafe drugs. See Future of Drug Safety 152. Yet by&para;<br>the majority’s lights, the very act of creating that requirement in order to “safeguard the consumer,” United&para;<br>States v. Sullivan, 332 U. S. 689, 696 (1948), also created&para;<br>by operation of law a shield for drug manufacturers to&para;<br>avoid paying common-law damages under state laws that&para;<br>are also designed to protect consumers. That is so notwithstanding Congress’ effort to disclaim any intent to&para;<br>pre-empt all state law. See supra, at 4. The majority’s&para;<br>reasoning thus “has the ‘perverse effect’ of granting broad&para;<br>immunity ‘to an entire industry that, in the judgment of&para;<br>Congress, needed more stringent regulation.’ ” Riegel, 552&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 Or at least it creates an automatic conflict with the caveat that&para;<br>design-defect claims that parallel a federal duty for manufacturers to&para;<br>withdraw a product might not be pre-empted.

See, e.g., Riegel, 552 U. S., at 323–&para;<br>325; see supra, at 4, and n. 2. In other instances, such as&para;<br>with prescription drugs, it has not.

This could have serious consequences for product safety.
