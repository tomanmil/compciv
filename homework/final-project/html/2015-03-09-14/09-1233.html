Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 23, 2011&para;<br>California’s prisons are designed to house a population just under&para;<br>80,000, but at the time of the decision under review the population&para;<br>was almost double that. The resulting conditions are the subject of&para;<br>two federal class actions. In Coleman v. Brown, filed in 1990, the&para;<br>District Court found that prisoners with serious mental illness do not&para;<br>receive minimal, adequate care. A Special Master appointed to over&para;<br>see remedial efforts reported 12 years later that the state of mental&para;<br>health care in California’s prisons was deteriorating due to increased&para;<br>overcrowding. In Plata v. Brown, filed in 2001, the State conceded&para;<br>that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth&para;<br>Amendment rights and stipulated to a remedial injunction. But&para;<br>when the State had not complied with the injunction by 2005, the&para;<br>court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts. Three years&para;<br>later, the Receiver described continuing deficiencies caused by over&para;<br>crowding. Believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and&para;<br>mental health care could not be achieved without reducing over&para;<br>crowding, the Coleman and Plata plaintiffs moved their respective&para;<br>District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered by the&para;<br>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) to order reductions in&para;<br>the prison population. The judges in both actions granted the re&para;<br>quest, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge&para;<br>court. After hearing testimony and making extensive findings of fact,&para;<br>the court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5%&para;<br>of design capacity within two years. Finding that the prison popula&para;<br>tion would have to be reduced if capacity could not be increased&para;<br>through new construction, the court ordered the State to formulate a&para;<br>compliance plan and submit it for court approval.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The court-mandated population limit is necessary to remedy the&para;<br>violation of prisoners’ constitutional rights and is authorized by the&para;<br>PLRA. Pp. 12–41.&para;<br>(a) If a prison deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including&para;<br>adequate medical care, the courts have a responsibility to remedy the&para;<br>resulting Eighth Amendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437&para;<br>U. S. 678, 687, n. 9. They must consider a range of options, including&para;<br>the appointment of special masters or receivers, the possibility of&para;<br>consent decrees, and orders limiting a prison’s population. Under the&para;<br>PLRA, only a three-judge court may limit a prison population. 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3626(a)(3). Before convening such a court, a district court&para;<br>must have entered an order for less intrusive relief that failed to&para;<br>remedy the constitutional violation and must have given the defen&para;<br>dant a reasonable time to comply with its prior orders.&para;<br>§3626(a)(3)(A). Once convened, the three-judge court must find by&para;<br>clear and convincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of&para;<br>the violation” and “no other relief will remedy [the] violation,”&para;<br>§3626(a)(3)(E); and that the relief is “narrowly drawn, extends no fur&para;<br>ther than necessary. . . , and is the least intrusive means necessary to&para;<br>correct the violation,” §3626(a)(1)(A). The court must give “substan&para;<br>tial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of&para;<br>a criminal justice system caused by the relief.” Ibid. Its legal deter&para;<br>minations are reviewed de novo, but its factual findings are reviewed&para;<br>for clear error. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(b) The Coleman and Plata courts acted reasonably in convening&para;<br>a three-judge court. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>(1) The merits of the decision to convene are properly before&para;<br>this Court, which has exercised its 28 U. S. C. §1253 jurisdiction to&para;<br>determine the authority of a court below, including whether a three&para;<br>judge court was properly constituted. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employ&para;<br>ees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12. Pp. 15–16.&para;<br>(2) Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)’s previous order requirement was&para;<br>satisfied in Coleman by the Special Master’s 1995 appointment and&para;<br>in Plata by the 2002 approval of a consent decree and stipulated in&para;<br>junction. Both orders were intended to remedy constitutional viola&para;<br>tions and were given ample time to succeed—12 years in Coleman,&para;<br>and 5 years in Plata.&para;<br>Contrary to the State’s claim,&para;<br>§3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)’s reasonable time requirement did not require the&para;<br>District Courts to give more time for subsequent remedial efforts to&para;<br>succeed. Such a reading would in effect require courts to impose a&para;<br>moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit,&para;<br>which would delay an eventual remedy, prolong the courts’ involve&para;<br>ment, and serve neither the State nor the prisoners. The Coleman&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to&para;<br>build new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy, given&para;<br>the ongoing deficiencies recently reported by both the Special Master&para;<br>and the Receiver. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>(c) The three-judge court did not err in finding that “crowding&para;<br>[was] the primary cause of the violation,” §3626(a)(3)(E)(i). Pp. 19–&para;<br>29.&para;<br>(1) The trial record documents the severe impact of burgeoning&para;<br>demand on the provision of care. The evidence showed that there&para;<br>were high vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff, e.g.,&para;<br>20% for surgeons and 54.1% for psychiatrists; that these numbers&para;<br>understated the severity of the crisis because the State has not budg&para;<br>eted sufficient staff to meet demand; and that even if vacant positions&para;<br>could be filled, there would be insufficient space for the additional&para;<br>staff. Such a shortfall contributes to significant delays in treating&para;<br>mentally ill prisoners, who are housed in administrative segregation&para;<br>for extended periods while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health&para;<br>treatment beds. There are also backlogs of up to 700 prisoners wait&para;<br>ing to see a doctor for physical care. Crowding creates unsafe and&para;<br>unsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and&para;<br>mental health care. It also promotes unrest and violence and can&para;<br>cause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop&para;<br>overt symptoms. Increased violence requires increased reliance on&para;<br>lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective&para;<br>delivery of care. Overcrowding’s effects are particularly acute in&para;<br>prison reception centers, which process 140,000 new or returning&para;<br>prisoners annually, and which house some prisoners for their entire&para;<br>incarceration period. Numerous experts testified that crowding is the&para;<br>primary cause of the constitutional violations. Pp. 19–24.&para;<br>(2) Contrary to the State’s claim, the three-judge court prop&para;<br>erly admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison condi&para;<br>tions as relevant to the issues before it. Expert witnesses based their&para;<br>conclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court ad&para;<br>mitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Spe&para;<br>cial Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current&para;<br>conditions. The court’s orders cutting off discovery a few months be&para;<br>fore trial and excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a&para;<br>population limit is appropriate under the PLRA were within the&para;<br>court’s sound discretion. Orderly trial management may require dis&para;<br>covery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the&para;<br>merits and the remedy. The State points to no significant evidence&para;<br>that it was unable to present and that would have changed the out&para;<br>come here. Pp. 24–26.&para;<br>(3) It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>overcrowding was the “primary,” but not the only, cause of the viola&para;<br>tions, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the viola&para;<br>tions. This understanding of the primary cause requirement is con&para;<br>sistent with the PLRA. Had Congress intended to require that&para;<br>crowding be the only cause, the PLRA would have said so. Pp. 26–29.&para;<br>(d) The evidence supports the three-judge court’s finding that “no&para;<br>other relief [would] remedy the violation,” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii). The&para;<br>State’s claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive al&para;<br>ternative to a population limit must fail because requiring transfers&para;<br>is a population limit under the PLRA. Even if they could be regarded&para;<br>as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evi&para;<br>dence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve over&para;<br>crowding. The court also found no realistic possibility that California&para;<br>could build itself out of this crisis, particularly given the State’s ongo&para;<br>ing fiscal problems. Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realis&para;<br>tic alternative, since the prison system was chronically understaffed&para;<br>and would have insufficient space were adequate personnel retained.&para;<br>The court also did not err when it concluded that, absent a population&para;<br>reduction, the Receiver’s and Special Master’s continued efforts&para;<br>would not achieve a remedy. Their reports are persuasive evidence&para;<br>that, with no reduction, any remedy might prove unattainable and&para;<br>would at the very least require vast expenditures by the State. The&para;<br>State asserts that these measures would succeed if combined, but a&para;<br>long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evi&para;<br>dence of overcrowding’s deleterious effects on the provision of care,&para;<br>compels a different conclusion here. Pp. 29–33.&para;<br>(e) The prospective relief ordered here was narrowly drawn, ex&para;<br>tended no further than necessary to correct the violation, and was the&para;<br>least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation. Pp. 33–41.&para;<br>(1) The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply&para;<br>because prisoners beyond the plaintiff class will have to be released&para;<br>through parole or sentencing reform in order to meet the required re&para;<br>duction. While narrow tailoring requires a “ ‘ “fit” between the [rem&para;<br>edy’s] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,’ ” Board&para;<br>of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480, a narrow&para;<br>and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not in&para;<br>valid simply because it will have collateral effects. Nor does the&para;<br>PLRA require that result. The order gives the State flexibility to de&para;<br>termine who should be released, and the State could move the three&para;<br>judge court to modify its terms. The order also is not overbroad be&para;<br>cause it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than sepa&para;<br>rately assessing each institution’s need for a population limit. The&para;<br>Coleman court found a systemwide violation, and the State stipulated&para;<br>to systemwide relief in Plata. Assuming no constitutional violation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>results, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the 137.5%&para;<br>limit provided others fall sufficiently below it so the system as a&para;<br>whole remains in compliance with the order. This will afford the&para;<br>State flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.&para;<br>The order may shape or control the State’s authority in the realm of&para;<br>prison administration, but it leaves much to the State’s discretion.&para;<br>The order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional vio&para;<br>lation. The State may move the three-judge court to modify its order,&para;<br>but it has proposed no realistic alternative remedy at this time.&para;<br>Pp. 33–36.&para;<br>(2) The three-judge court gave “substantial weight” to any po&para;<br>tential adverse impact on public safety from its order. The PLRA’s&para;<br>“substantial weight” requirement does not require the court to certify&para;<br>that its order has no possible adverse impact on the public. Here,&para;<br>statistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered&para;<br>without adversely affecting public safety in some California counties,&para;<br>several States, and Canada. The court found that various available&para;<br>methods of reducing overcrowding—good time credits and diverting&para;<br>low-risk offenders to community programs—would have little or no&para;<br>impact on public safety, and its order took account of such concerns&para;<br>by giving the State substantial flexibility to select among the means&para;<br>of reducing overcrowding. The State complains that the court ap&para;<br>proved the State’s population reduction plan without considering&para;<br>whether its specific measures would substantially threaten public&para;<br>safety. But the court left state officials the choice of how best to com&para;<br>ply and was not required to second-guess their exercise of discretion.&para;<br>Developments during the pendency of this appeal, when the State&para;<br>has begun to reduce the prison population, support the conclusion&para;<br>that a reduction can be accomplished without an undue negative ef&para;<br>fect on public safety. Pp. 37–41.&para;<br>2. The three-judge court’s order, subject to the State’s right to seek&para;<br>its modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.&para;<br>Pp. 41–48.&para;<br>(a) To comply with the PLRA, a court must set a population limit&para;<br>at the highest level consistent with an efficacious remedy, and it&para;<br>must order the population reduction to be achieved in the shortest&para;<br>period of time reasonably consistent with public safety. Pp. 41–42.&para;<br>(b) The three-judge court’s conclusion that the prison population&para;<br>should be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly errone&para;<br>ous. The court concluded that the evidence supported a limit be&para;<br>tween the 130% limit supported by expert testimony and the Federal&para;<br>Bureau of Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State&para;<br>Corrections Independent Review Panel. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring&para;<br>requirement is satisfied so long as such equitable, remedial judg&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ments are made with the objective of releasing the fewest possible&para;<br>prisoners consistent with an efficacious remedy. Pp. 42–44.&para;<br>(c) The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year dead&para;<br>line for relief, especially in light of the State’s failure to contest the&para;<br>issue at trial. The State has not asked this Court to extend the dead&para;<br>line, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility,&para;<br>to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.&para;<br>Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes re&para;<br>quire that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State consid&para;<br>erable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will&para;<br>promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public&para;<br>safety. The court may, e.g., grant a motion to extend the deadline if&para;<br>the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that&para;<br>the plan will be implemented without undue delay. Such observa&para;<br>tions reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable&para;<br>relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not in&para;<br>tended to cast doubt on the validity of the order’s basic premise.&para;<br>Pp. 44–48.&para;<br>&para;<br>Affirmed.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which GINSBURG,&para;<br>BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

BROWN, JR., GOVERNOR OF CAL- &para;<br>&para;<br>IFORNIA, ET AL., APPELLANTS v. MARCIANO &para;<br>&para;<br>PLATA ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS &para;<br>&para;<br>FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT AND THE NORTHERN&para;<br>&para;<br>DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA&para;<br>&para;<br>[May 23, 2011] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>This case arises from serious constitutional violations in&para;<br>California’s prison system. The violations have persisted&para;<br>for years. They remain uncorrected. The appeal comes to&para;<br>this Court from a three-judge District Court order direct&para;<br>ing California to remedy two ongoing violations of the&para;<br>Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a guarantee&para;<br>binding on the States by the Due Process Clause of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment. The violations are the subject of&para;<br>two class actions in two Federal District Courts. The first&para;<br>involves the class of prisoners with serious mental disor&para;<br>ders. That case is Coleman v. Brown. The second involves&para;<br>prisoners with serious medical conditions. That case is&para;<br>Plata v. Brown. The order of the three-judge District&para;<br>Court is applicable to both cases.&para;<br>After years of litigation, it became apparent that a&para;<br>remedy for the constitutional violations would not be ef&para;<br>fective absent a reduction in the prison system popula&para;<br>tion. The authority to order release of prisoners as a&para;<br>remedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth Amend&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment is a power reserved to a three-judge district court,&para;<br>not a single-judge district court. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). In&para;<br>accordance with that rule, the Coleman and Plata District&para;<br>Judges independently requested that a three-judge court&para;<br>be convened. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit convened a three-judge court composed&para;<br>of the Coleman and Plata District Judges and a third,&para;<br>Ninth Circuit Judge. Because the two cases are interre&para;<br>lated, their limited consolidation for this purpose has a&para;<br>certain utility in avoiding conflicting decrees and aiding&para;<br>judicial consideration and enforcement. The State in this&para;<br>Court has not objected to consolidation, although the State&para;<br>does argue that the three-judge court was prematurely&para;<br>convened. The State also objects to the substance of the&para;<br>three-judge court order, which requires the State to reduce&para;<br>overcrowding in its prisons.&para;<br>The appeal presents the question whether the remedial&para;<br>order issued by the three-judge court is consistent with&para;<br>requirements and procedures set forth in a congressional&para;<br>statute, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA).&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §3626; see Appendix A, infra. The order leaves&para;<br>the choice of means to reduce overcrowding to the discre&para;<br>tion of state officials. But absent compliance through new&para;<br>construction, out-of-state transfers, or other means—or&para;<br>modification of the order upon a further showing by the&para;<br>State—the State will be required to release some number&para;<br>of prisoners before their full sentences have been served.&para;<br>High recidivism rates must serve as a warning that mis&para;<br>taken or premature release of even one prisoner can cause&para;<br>injury and harm. The release of prisoners in large num&para;<br>bers—assuming the State finds no other way to comply&para;<br>with the order—is a matter of undoubted, grave concern.&para;<br>At the time of trial, California’s correctional facilities&para;<br>held some 156,000 persons. This is nearly double the&para;<br>number that California’s prisons were designed to hold,&para;<br>and California has been ordered to reduce its prison popu&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lation to 137.5% of design capacity. By the three-judge&para;<br>court’s own estimate, the required population reduction&para;<br>could be as high as 46,000 persons. Although the State&para;<br>has reduced the population by at least 9,000 persons dur&para;<br>ing the pendency of this appeal, this means a further&para;<br>reduction of 37,000 persons could be required. As will be&para;<br>noted, the reduction need not be accomplished in an indis&para;<br>criminate manner or in these substantial numbers if sat&para;<br>isfactory, alternate remedies or means for compliance&para;<br>are devised. The State may employ measures, including&para;<br>good-time credits and diversion of low-risk offenders and&para;<br>technical parole violators to community-based programs,&para;<br>that will mitigate the order’s impact. The population&para;<br>reduction potentially required is nevertheless of unprece&para;<br>dented sweep and extent.&para;<br>Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm resulting&para;<br>from these serious constitutional violations. For years the&para;<br>medical and mental health care provided by California’s&para;<br>prisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional re&para;<br>quirements and has failed to meet prisoners’ basic health&para;<br>needs. Needless suffering and death have been the well&para;<br>documented result. Over the whole course of years during&para;<br>which this litigation has been pending, no other remedies&para;<br>have been found to be sufficient. Efforts to remedy the&para;<br>violation have been frustrated by severe overcrowding in&para;<br>California’s prison system. Short term gains in the provi&para;<br>sion of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of&para;<br>severe and pervasive overcrowding.&para;<br>Overcrowding has overtaken the limited resources of&para;<br>prison staff; imposed demands well beyond the capacity&para;<br>of medical and mental health facilities; and created unsan&para;<br>itary and unsafe conditions that make progress in the&para;<br>provision of care difficult or impossible to achieve. The&para;<br>overcrowding is the “primary cause of the violation of a&para;<br>Federal right,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically&para;<br>the severe and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>through grossly inadequate provision of medical and&para;<br>mental health care.&para;<br>This Court now holds that the PLRA does authorize the&para;<br>relief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated&para;<br>population limit is necessary to remedy the violation of&para;<br>prisoners’ constitutional rights. The order of the three&para;<br>judge court, subject to the right of the State to seek&para;<br>its modification in appropriate circumstances, must be&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The degree of overcrowding in California’s prisons is&para;<br>exceptional. California’s prisons are designed to house a&para;<br>population just under 80,000, but at the time of the three&para;<br>judge court’s decision the population was almost double&para;<br>that. The State’s prisons had operated at around 200% of&para;<br>design capacity for at least 11 years. Prisoners are&para;<br>crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to&para;<br>house inmates. As many as 200 prisoners may live in a&para;<br>gymnasium, monitored by as few as two or three correc&para;<br>tional officers. App. 1337–1338, 1350; see Appendix B,&para;<br>infra. As many as 54 prisoners may share a single toilet.&para;<br>App. 1337.&para;<br>The Corrections Independent Review Panel, a body&para;<br>appointed by the Governor and composed of correctional&para;<br>consultants and representatives from state agencies,&para;<br>concluded that California’s prisons are “ ‘severely over&para;<br>crowded, imperiling the safety of both correctional em&para;<br>ployees and inmates.’ ”1 Juris.

In 2006,&para;<br>then-Governor Schwarzenegger declared a state of emer&para;<br>gency in the prisons, as “ ‘immediate action is necessary to&para;<br>prevent death and harm caused by California’s severe&para;<br>prison overcrowding.’ ” Id., at 61a. The consequences of&para;<br>overcrowding identified by the Governor include “ ‘in&para;<br>creased, substantial risk for transmission of infectious&para;<br>illness’ ” and a suicide rate “ ‘approaching an average of&para;<br>one per week.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>Prisoners in California with serious mental illness do&para;<br>not receive minimal, adequate care. Because of a shortage&para;<br>of treatment beds, suicidal inmates may be held for pro&para;<br>longed periods in telephone-booth sized cages without&para;<br>toilets. See Appendix C, infra. A psychiatric expert re&para;<br>ported observing an inmate who had been held in such a&para;<br>cage for nearly 24 hours, standing in a pool of his own&para;<br>urine, unresponsive and nearly catatonic. Prison officials&para;<br>explained they had “ ‘no place to put him.’ ” App. 593.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>At trial, current and former California prison officials also testified to&para;<br>the degree of overcrowding. Jeanne Woodford, who recently adminis&para;<br>tered California’s prison system, stated that “ ‘[o]vercrowding in the&para;<br>[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)] is&para;<br>extreme, its effects are pervasive and it is preventing the Department&para;<br>from providing adequate mental and medical health care to prisoners.’ ”&para;<br>Juris. App. 84a. Matthew Cate, the head of the California prison&para;<br>system, stated that “ ‘overpopulation makes everything we do more&para;<br>difficult.’ ” Ibid.

Doyle&para;<br>Wayne Scott, the former head of corrections in Texas, described con&para;<br>ditions in California’s prisons as “appalling,” “inhumane,” and “unac&para;<br>ceptable” and stated that “[i]n more than 35 years of prison work&para;<br>experience, I have never seen anything like it.” App. 1337. Joseph&para;<br>Lehman, the former head of correctional systems in Washington,&para;<br>Maine, and Pennsylvania, concluded that “[t]here is no question that&para;<br>California’s prisons are overcrowded” and that “this is an emergency&para;<br>situation; it calls for drastic and immediate action.” Id., at 1312.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

In 2006, the suicide rate&para;<br>in California’s prisons was nearly 80% higher than the&para;<br>national average for prison populations; and a court&para;<br>appointed Special Master found that 72.1% of suicides&para;<br>involved “some measure of inadequate assessment, treat&para;<br>ment, or intervention, and were therefore most probably&para;<br>foreseeable and/or preventable.”2 Id., at 1781.&para;<br>Prisoners suffering from physical illness also receive&para;<br>severely deficient care.

Over 15 years ago, in 1995,&para;<br>after a 39-day trial, the Coleman District Court found&para;<br>“overwhelming evidence of the systematic failure to de&para;<br>liver necessary care to mentally ill inmates” in California&para;<br>prisons. Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1316 (ED&para;<br>Cal.). The prisons were “seriously and chronically under&para;<br>staffed,” id., at 1306, and had “no effective method for&para;<br>ensuring . . . the competence of their staff,” id., at 1308.&para;<br>The prisons had failed to implement necessary suicide&para;<br>prevention procedures, “due in large measure to the severe&para;<br>understaffing.” Id., at 1315. Mentally ill inmates “lan&para;<br>guished for months, or even years, without access to nec&para;<br>essary care.” Id., at 1316. “They suffer from severe hallu&para;<br>cinations, [and] they decompensate into catatonic states.”&para;<br>Ibid.

App. 489. The&para;<br>Special Master ascribed this change to increased over&para;<br>crowding. The rise in population had led to greater&para;<br>demand for care, and existing programming space and&para;<br>staffing levels were inadequate to keep pace. Prisons had&para;<br>retained more mental health staff, but the “growth of the&para;<br>resource [had] not matched the rise in demand.” Id., at&para;<br>482. At the very time the need for space was rising, the&para;<br>need to house the expanding population had also caused a&para;<br>“reduction of programming space now occupied by inmate&para;<br>bunks.” Id., at 479. The State was “facing a four to five&para;<br>year gap in the availability of sufficient beds to meet the&para;<br>treatment needs of many inmates/patients.” Id., at 481.&para;<br>“[I]ncreasing numbers of truly psychotic inmate/patients&para;<br>are trapped in [lower levels of treatment] that cannot meet&para;<br>their needs.” Ibid. The Special Master concluded that&para;<br>many early “achievements have succumbed to the inexo&para;<br>rably rising tide of population, leaving behind growing&para;<br>frustration and despair.” Id., at 489.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The second action, Plata v. Brown, involves the class of&para;<br>state prisoners with serious medical conditions. After this&para;<br>action commenced in 2001, the State conceded that defi&para;<br>ciencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth&para;<br>Amendment rights. The State stipulated to a remedial&para;<br>injunction. The State failed to comply with that injunc&para;<br>tion, and in 2005 the court appointed a Receiver to oversee&para;<br>remedial efforts. The court found that “the California&para;<br>prison medical care system is broken beyond repair,”&para;<br>resulting in an “unconscionable degree of suffering and&para;<br>death.” App. 917. The court found: “[I]t is an uncontested&para;<br>fact that, on average, an inmate in one of California’s&para;<br>prisons needlessly dies every six to seven days due to&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>constitutional deficiencies in the [California prisons’]&para;<br>medical delivery system.” Ibid. And the court made&para;<br>findings regarding specific instances of neglect, including&para;<br>the following:&para;<br>“[A] San Quentin prisoner with hypertension, diabetes&para;<br>and renal failure was prescribed two different medica&para;<br>tions that actually served to exacerbate his renal fail&para;<br>ure. An optometrist noted the patient’s retinal bleed&para;<br>ing due to very high blood pressure and referred him&para;<br>for immediate evaluation, but this evaluation never&para;<br>took place. It was not until a year later that the pa&para;<br>tient’s renal failure was recognized, at which point he&para;<br>was referred to a nephrologist on an urgent basis;&para;<br>he should have been seen by the specialist within 14&para;<br>days but the consultation never happened and the pa&para;<br>tient died three months later.” Id., at 928 (citations&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Prisons were unable to retain sufficient numbers of com&para;<br>petent medical staff, id., at 937, and would “hire any&para;<br>doctor who had ‘a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,’ ” id.,&para;<br>at 926. Medical facilities lacked “necessary medical equip&para;<br>ment” and did “not meet basic sanitation standards.” Id.,&para;<br>at 944. “Exam tables and counter tops, where prisoners&para;<br>with . . . communicable diseases are treated, [were] not&para;<br>routinely disinfected.” Ibid.&para;<br>In 2008, three years after the District Court’s decision,&para;<br>the Receiver described continuing deficiencies in the&para;<br>health care provided by California prisons:&para;<br>“Timely access is not assured.

Indeed, it is&para;<br>a misnomer to call the existing chaos a ‘medical deliv&para;<br>ery system’—it is more an act of desperation than a&para;<br>system.” Record in No. 3:01–CV–01351–TEH (ND&para;<br>Cal.), Doc. 1136, p. 5.&para;<br>A report by the Receiver detailed the impact of overcrowd&para;<br>ing on efforts to remedy the violation. The Receiver ex&para;<br>plained that “overcrowding, combined with staffing short&para;<br>ages, has created a culture of cynicism, fear, and despair&para;<br>which makes hiring and retaining competent clinicians&para;<br>extremely difficult.” App. 1031. “[O]vercrowding, and the&para;<br>resulting day to day operational chaos of the [prison sys&para;<br>tem], creates regular ‘crisis’ situations which . . . take time&para;<br>[and] energy . . . away from important remedial pro&para;<br>grams.” Id., at 1035. Overcrowding had increased the&para;<br>incidence of infectious disease, id., at 1037–1038, and had&para;<br>led to rising prison violence and greater reliance by custo&para;<br>dial staff on lockdowns, which “inhibit the delivery of&para;<br>medical care and increase the staffing necessary for such&para;<br>care.” Id., at 1037. “Every day,” the Receiver reported,&para;<br>“California prison wardens and health care managers&para;<br>make the difficult decision as to which of the class actions,&para;<br>Coleman . . . or Plata they will fail to comply with because&para;<br>of staff shortages and patient loads.” Id., at 1038.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The Coleman and Plata plaintiffs, believing that a rem&para;<br>edy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care&para;<br>could not be achieved without reducing overcrowding,&para;<br>moved their respective District Courts to convene a three&para;<br>judge court empowered under the PLRA to order reduc&para;<br>tions in the prison population. The judges in both actions&para;<br>granted the request, and the cases were consolidated&para;<br>before a single three-judge court. The State has not chal&para;<br>lenged the validity of the consolidation in proceedings&para;<br>before this Court, so its propriety is not presented by this&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>appeal.&para;<br>The three-judge court heard 14 days of testimony and&para;<br>issued a 184-page opinion, making extensive findings of&para;<br>fact. The court ordered California to reduce its prison&para;<br>population to 137.5% of the prisons’ design capacity within&para;<br>two years. Assuming the State does not increase capacity&para;<br>through new construction, the order requires a population&para;<br>reduction of 38,000 to 46,000 persons. Because it appears&para;<br>all but certain that the State cannot complete sufficient&para;<br>construction to comply fully with the order, the prison&para;<br>population will have to be reduced to at least some extent.&para;<br>The court did not order the State to achieve this reduction&para;<br>in any particular manner. Instead, the court ordered the&para;<br>State to formulate a plan for compliance and submit its&para;<br>plan for approval by the court.&para;<br>The State appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1253, and the Court postponed consideration of the ques&para;<br>tion of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. Schwar&para;<br>zenegger v. Plata, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>As a consequence of their own actions, prisoners may be&para;<br>deprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty. Yet the&para;<br>law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain&para;<br>other rights. Prisoners retain the essence of human dig&para;<br>nity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity&para;<br>animates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel&para;<br>and unusual punishment. “ ‘The basic concept underlying&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of&para;<br>man.’ ” Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002) (quot&para;<br>ing Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality&para;<br>opinion)).&para;<br>To incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means&para;<br>to provide for their own needs. Prisoners are dependent&para;<br>on the State for food, clothing, and necessary medical care.&para;<br>A prison’s failure to provide sustenance for inmates “may&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>actually produce physical ‘torture or a lingering death.’ ”&para;<br>Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting In re&para;<br>Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A.&para;<br>Elsner, Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons&para;<br>(2004). Just as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or she&para;<br>may suffer or die if not provided adequate medical care. A&para;<br>prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, includ&para;<br>ing adequate medical care, is incompatible with the con&para;<br>cept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.&para;<br>If government fails to fulfill this obligation, the courts&para;<br>have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth&para;<br>Amendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,&para;<br>687, n. 9 (1978). Courts must be sensitive to the State’s&para;<br>interest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as&para;<br>well as the need for deference to experienced and expert&para;<br>prison administrators faced with the difficult and danger&para;<br>ous task of housing large numbers of convicted criminals.&para;<br>See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547–548 (1979). Courts&para;<br>nevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to “en&para;<br>force the constitutional rights of all ‘persons,’ including&para;<br>prisoners.” Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319, 321 (1972) (per&para;<br>curiam). Courts may not allow constitutional violations to&para;<br>continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion&para;<br>into the realm of prison administration.&para;<br>Courts faced with the sensitive task of remedying un&para;<br>constitutional prison conditions must consider a range of&para;<br>available options, including appointment of special mas&para;<br>ters or receivers and the possibility of consent decrees.&para;<br>When necessary to ensure compliance with a constitu&para;<br>tional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on&para;<br>a prison’s population. By its terms, the PLRA restricts the&para;<br>circumstances in which a court may enter an order “that&para;<br>has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison&para;<br>population.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(g)(4). The order in this&para;<br>case does not necessarily require the State to release any&para;<br>prisoners. The State may comply by raising the design&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>capacity of its prisons or by transferring prisoners to&para;<br>county facilities or facilities in other States. Because the&para;<br>order limits the prison population as a percentage of de&para;<br>sign capacity, it nonetheless has the “effect of reducing or&para;<br>limiting the prison population.” Ibid.&para;<br>Under the PLRA, only a three-judge court may enter an&para;<br>order limiting a prison population. §3626(a)(3)(B). Before&para;<br>a three-judge court may be convened, a district court first&para;<br>must have entered an order for less intrusive relief that&para;<br>failed to remedy the constitutional violation and must&para;<br>have given the defendant a reasonable time to comply&para;<br>with its prior orders. §3626(a)(3)(A). The party request&para;<br>ing a three-judge court must then submit “materials suffi&para;<br>cient to demonstrate that [these requirements] have been&para;<br>met.” §3626(a)(3)(C). If the district court concludes that&para;<br>the materials are, in fact, sufficient, a three-judge court&para;<br>may be convened. Ibid.; see also 28 U. S. C. §2284(b)(1)&para;<br>(stating that a three-judge court may not be convened if&para;<br>the district court “determines that three judges are not&para;<br>required”); 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; V.&para;<br>Amar, Federal Practice and Procedure §4235 (3d ed. 2007).&para;<br>The three-judge court must then find by clear and con&para;<br>vincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of&para;<br>the violation of a Federal right” and that “no other relief&para;<br>will remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3626(a)(3)(E). As with any award of prospective relief&para;<br>under the PLRA, the relief “shall extend no further than&para;<br>necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of&para;<br>a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” §3626(a)(1)(A). The&para;<br>three-judge court must therefore find that the relief is&para;<br>“narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary . . . ,&para;<br>and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the&para;<br>violation of the Federal right.” Ibid. In making this de&para;<br>termination, the three-judge court must give “substantial&para;<br>weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the op&para;<br>eration of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ibid. Applying these standards, the three-judge court&para;<br>found a population limit appropriate, necessary, and&para;<br>authorized in this case.&para;<br>This Court’s review of the three-judge court’s legal&para;<br>determinations is de novo, but factual findings are re&para;<br>viewed for clear error. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470&para;<br>U. S. 564, 573–574 (1985). Deference to trial court fact&para;<br>finding reflects an understanding that “[t]he trial judge’s&para;<br>major role is the determination of fact, and with experi&para;<br>ence in fulfilling that role comes expertise.” Id., at 574.&para;<br>The three-judge court oversaw two weeks of trial and&para;<br>heard at considerable length from California prison offi&para;<br>cials, as well as experts in the field of correctional admini&para;<br>stration. The judges had the opportunity to ask relevant&para;<br>questions of those witnesses. Two of the judges had over&para;<br>seen the ongoing remedial efforts of the Receiver and&para;<br>Special Master. The three-judge court was well situated&para;<br>to make the difficult factual judgments necessary to fash&para;<br>ion a remedy for this complex and intractable constitu&para;<br>tional violation. The three-judge court’s findings of fact&para;<br>may be reversed only if this Court is left with a “ ‘definite&para;<br>and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 573 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum&para;<br>Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948)).&para;<br>A&para;<br>The State contends that it was error to convene the&para;<br>three-judge court without affording it more time to comply&para;<br>with the prior orders in Coleman and Plata.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The parties dispute this Court’s jurisdiction to review&para;<br>the determinations of the Coleman and Plata District&para;<br>Courts that a three-judge court should be convened.&para;<br>Plaintiffs claim the State was required to raise this issue&para;<br>first in the Court of Appeals by appealing the orders of the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>District Courts. When exercising jurisdiction under 28&para;<br>U. S.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>satisfied in Plata by approval of a consent decree and&para;<br>stipulated injunction in 2002. Both orders were intended&para;<br>to remedy the constitutional violations. Both were given&para;<br>ample time to succeed. When the three-judge court was&para;<br>convened, 12 years had passed since the appointment of&para;<br>the Coleman Special Master, and 5 years had passed since&para;<br>the approval of the Plata consent decree. The State does&para;<br>not claim that either order achieved a remedy. Although&para;<br>the PLRA entitles a State to terminate remedial orders&para;<br>such as these after two years unless the district court&para;<br>finds that the relief “remains necessary to correct a&para;<br>current and ongoing violation of the Federal right,”&para;<br>§3626(b)(3), California has not attempted to obtain relief&para;<br>on this basis.&para;<br>The State claims instead that the second condition, the&para;<br>reasonable time requirement of §3626(a)(3)(A)(ii), was not&para;<br>met because other, later remedial efforts should have been&para;<br>given more time to succeed. In 2006, the Coleman District&para;<br>Judge approved a revised plan of action calling for con&para;<br>struction of new facilities, hiring of new staff, and im&para;<br>plementation of new procedures. That same year, the&para;<br>Plata District Judge selected and appointed a Receiver to&para;<br>oversee the State’s ongoing remedial efforts. When the&para;<br>three-judge court was convened, the Receiver had filed a&para;<br>preliminary plan of action calling for new construction,&para;<br>hiring of additional staff, and other procedural reforms.&para;<br>Although both the revised plan of action in Coleman and&para;<br>the appointment of the Receiver in Plata were new devel&para;<br>opments in the courts’ remedial efforts, the basic plan to&para;<br>solve the crisis through construction, hiring, and proce&para;<br>dural reforms remained unchanged. These efforts had&para;<br>been ongoing for years; the failed consent decree in Plata&para;<br>had called for implementation of new procedures and&para;<br>hiring of additional staff; and the Coleman Special Master&para;<br>had issued over 70 orders directed at achieving a remedy&para;<br>through construction, hiring, and procedural reforms. The&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Coleman Special Master and Plata Receiver were unable&para;<br>to provide assurance that further, substantially similar&para;<br>efforts would yield success absent a population reduction.&para;<br>Instead, the Coleman Special Master explained that&para;<br>“many of the clinical advances . . . painfully accomplished&para;<br>over the past decade are slip-sliding away” as a result of&para;<br>overcrowding. App. 481–482. And the Plata Receiver&para;<br>indicated that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, a&para;<br>successful remedial effort could “all but bankrupt” the&para;<br>State of California. App. 1053.&para;<br>Having engaged in remedial efforts for 5 years in Plata&para;<br>and 12 in Coleman, the District Courts were not required&para;<br>to wait to see whether their more recent efforts would&para;<br>yield equal disappointment. When a court attempts to&para;<br>remedy an entrenched constitutional violation through&para;<br>reform of a complex institution, such as this statewide&para;<br>prison system, it may be necessary in the ordinary course&para;<br>to issue multiple orders directing and adjusting ongoing&para;<br>remedial efforts. Each new order must be given a reason&para;<br>able time to succeed, but reasonableness must be assessed&para;<br>in light of the entire history of the court’s remedial efforts.&para;<br>A contrary reading of the reasonable time requirement&para;<br>would in effect require district courts to impose a morato&para;<br>rium on new remedial orders before issuing a population&para;<br>limit. This unnecessary period of inaction would delay an&para;<br>eventual remedy and would prolong the courts’ involve&para;<br>ment, serving neither the State nor the prisoners. Con&para;<br>gress did not require this unreasonable result when it&para;<br>used the term “reasonable.”&para;<br>The Coleman and Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt&para;<br>that additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new&para;<br>staff would achieve a remedy. Indeed, although 5 years&para;<br>have now passed since the appointment of the Plata&para;<br>Receiver and approval of the revised plan of action in&para;<br>Coleman, there is no indication that the constitutional&para;<br>violations have been cured. A report filed by the Coleman&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Special Master in July 2009 describes ongoing violations,&para;<br>including an “absence of timely access to appropriate&para;<br>levels of care at every point in the system.” App. 807. A&para;<br>report filed by the Plata Receiver in October 2010 likewise&para;<br>describes ongoing deficiencies in the provision of medical&para;<br>care and concludes that there are simply “too many pris&para;<br>oners for the healthcare infrastructure.” Id., at 1655. The&para;<br>Coleman and Plata courts acted reasonably when they&para;<br>convened a three-judge court without further delay.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Once a three-judge court has been convened, the court&para;<br>must find additional requirements satisfied before it may&para;<br>impose a population limit. The first of these requirements&para;<br>is that “crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a&para;<br>Federal right.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i).&para;<br>1&para;<br>The three-judge court found the primary cause require&para;<br>ment satisfied by the evidence at trial. The court found&para;<br>that overcrowding strains inadequate medical and mental&para;<br>health facilities; overburdens limited clinical and custodial&para;<br>staff; and creates violent, unsanitary, and chaotic condi&para;<br>tions that contribute to the constitutional violations and&para;<br>frustrate efforts to fashion a remedy. The three-judge&para;<br>court also found that “until the problem of overcrowding is&para;<br>overcome it will be impossible to provide constitutionally&para;<br>compliant care to California’s prison population.” Juris.&para;<br>App. 141a.&para;<br>The parties dispute the standard of review applicable to&para;<br>this determination. With respect to the three-judge court’s&para;<br>factual findings, this Court’s review is necessarily deferen&para;<br>tial. It is not this Court’s place to “duplicate the role” of&para;<br>the trial court. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 573. The ultimate&para;<br>issue of primary cause presents a mixed question of law&para;<br>and fact; but there, too, “the mix weighs heavily on the&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>‘fact’ side.” Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 148 (1999)&para;<br>(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment). Because the&para;<br>“district court is ‘better positioned’ . . . to decide the issue,”&para;<br>our review of the three-judge court’s primary cause deter&para;<br>mination is deferential. Salve Regina College v. Russell,&para;<br>499 U. S. 225, 233 (1991).&para;<br>The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning&para;<br>demand on the provision of care. At the time of trial,&para;<br>vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff ranged&para;<br>as high as 20% for surgeons, 25% for physicians, 39% for&para;<br>nurse practitioners, and 54.1% for psychiatrists. Juris.&para;<br>App. 105a, 108a. These percentages are based on the&para;<br>number of positions budgeted by the State. Dr. Ronald&para;<br>Shansky, former medical director of the Illinois prison&para;<br>system, concluded that these numbers understate the se&para;<br>verity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted&para;<br>sufficient staff to meet demand.5&para;<br>According to Dr.&para;<br>Shansky, “even if the prisons were able to fill all of their&para;<br>vacant health care positions, which they have not been&para;<br>able to do to date, . . . the prisons would still be unable to&para;<br>handle the level of need given the current overcrowding.”&para;<br>Record in No. 2:90–CV–00520–LKK–JFM (ED Cal.), Doc.&para;<br>3231–13, p. 16 (hereinafter Doc. 3231–13). Dr. Craig&para;<br>Haney, a professor of psychology, reported that mental&para;<br>health staff are “managing far larger caseloads than is&para;<br>appropriate or effective.” App. 596. A prison psychiatrist&para;<br>told Dr. Haney that “ ‘we are doing about 50% of what we&para;<br>should be doing.’ ” Ibid. In the context of physical care Dr.&para;<br>Shansky agreed that “demand for care, particularly for the&para;<br>high priority cases, continues to overwhelm the resources&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Dr. Craig Haney likewise testified that the State had “significantly&para;<br>underestimated the staffing needed to implement critical portions of the&para;<br>Coleman Program Guide requirements,” that “key tasks were omitted&para;<br>when determining staffing workloads,” and that estimates were based&para;<br>on “key assumptions” that caused the State to underestimate demand&para;<br>for mental health care. App. 596–597.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>available.” Id., at 1408.&para;<br>Even on the assumption that vacant positions could be&para;<br>filled, the evidence suggested there would be insufficient&para;<br>space for the necessary additional staff to perform their&para;<br>jobs. The Plata Receiver, in his report on overcrowding,&para;<br>concluded that even the “newest and most modern pris&para;<br>ons” had been “designed with clinic space which is only&para;<br>one-half that necessary for the real-life capacity of the&para;<br>prisons.” App. 1023 (emphasis deleted). Dr. Haney re&para;<br>ported that “[e]ach one of the facilities I toured was short&para;<br>of significant amounts of space needed to perform other&para;<br>wise critical tasks and responsibilities.” Id., at 597–598.&para;<br>In one facility, staff cared for 7,525 prisoners in space&para;<br>designed for one-third as many. Juris. App. 93a. Staff&para;<br>operate out of converted storage rooms, closets, bath&para;<br>rooms, shower rooms, and visiting centers. These make&para;<br>shift facilities impede the effective delivery of care and&para;<br>place the safety of medical professionals in jeopardy,&para;<br>compounding the difficulty of hiring additional staff.&para;<br>This shortfall of resources relative to demand contrib&para;<br>utes to significant delays in treatment. Mentally ill pris&para;<br>oners are housed in administrative segregation while&para;<br>awaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds&para;<br>for appropriate care. One correctional officer indicated&para;<br>that he had kept mentally ill prisoners in segregation for&para;<br>“ ‘6 months or more.’ ” App. 594. Other prisoners awaiting&para;<br>care are held in tiny, phone-booth sized cages. The record&para;<br>documents instances of prisoners committing suicide while&para;<br>awaiting treatment.6&para;<br>Delays are no less severe in the context of physical care.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 For instance, Dr. Pablo Stewart reported that one prisoner was&para;<br>referred to a crisis bed but, “[a]fter learning that the restraint room&para;<br>was not available and that there were no crisis beds open, staff moved&para;<br>[the prisoner] back to his administrative segregation cell without any&para;<br>prescribed observation.” App. 736. The prisoner “hanged himself that&para;<br>night in his cell.” Ibid.; see also Juris. App. 99a.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Prisons have backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see&para;<br>a doctor. Doc. 3231–13, at 18. A review of referrals for&para;<br>urgent specialty care at one prison revealed that only 105&para;<br>of 316 pending referrals had a scheduled appointment,&para;<br>and only 2 had an appointment scheduled to occur within&para;<br>14 days. Id., at 22–23. Urgent specialty referrals at one&para;<br>prison had been pending for six months to a year. Id.,&para;<br>at 27.&para;<br>Crowding also creates unsafe and unsanitary living&para;<br>conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and&para;<br>mental health care. A medical expert described living&para;<br>quarters in converted gymnasiums or dayrooms, where&para;<br>large numbers of prisoners may share just a few toilets&para;<br>and showers, as “ ‘breeding grounds for disease.’ ”7 Juris.&para;<br>App. 102a. Cramped conditions promote unrest and vio&para;<br>lence, making it difficult for prison officials to monitor and&para;<br>control the prison population. On any given day, prisoners&para;<br>in the general prison population may become ill, thus&para;<br>entering the plaintiff class; and overcrowding may prevent&para;<br>immediate medical attention necessary to avoid suffering,&para;<br>death, or spread of disease. After one prisoner was as&para;<br>saulted in a crowded gymnasium, prison staff did not even&para;<br>learn of the injury until the prisoner had been dead for&para;<br>several hours. Tr. 382. Living in crowded, unsafe, and&para;<br>unsanitary conditions can cause prisoners with latent&para;<br>mental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.&para;<br>Crowding may also impede efforts to improve delivery of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Correctional officials at trial described several outbreaks of disease.&para;<br>One officer testified that antibiotic-resistant staph infections spread&para;<br>widely among the prison population and described prisoners “bleeding,&para;<br>oozing with pus that is soaking through their clothes when they come&para;<br>in to get the wound covered and treated.” Tr. 601, 604–605. Another&para;<br>witness testified that inmates with influenza were sent back from the&para;<br>infirmary due to a lack of beds and that the disease quickly spread to&para;<br>“more than half ” the 340 prisoners in the housing unit, with the result&para;<br>that the unit was placed on lockdown for a week. Id., at 720–721.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>care. Two prisoners committed suicide by hanging after&para;<br>being placed in cells that had been identified as requiring&para;<br>a simple fix to remove attachment points that could sup&para;<br>port a noose. The repair was not made because doing so&para;<br>would involve removing prisoners from the cells, and there&para;<br>was no place to put them. Id., at 769–777. More gen&para;<br>erally, Jeanne Woodford, the former acting secretary of&para;<br>California’s prisons, testified that there “ ‘are simply too&para;<br>many issues that arise from such a large number of pris&para;<br>oners,’ ” and that, as a result, “ ‘management spends virtu&para;<br>ally all of its time fighting fires instead of engaging in&para;<br>thoughtful decision-making and planning’ ” of the sort&para;<br>needed to fashion an effective remedy for these constitu&para;<br>tional violations. Juris. App. 82a.&para;<br>Increased violence also requires increased reliance on&para;<br>lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede&para;<br>the effective delivery of care. In 2006, prison officials&para;<br>instituted 449 lockdowns. Id., at 116a. The average lock&para;<br>down lasted 12 days, and 20 lockdowns lasted 60 days or&para;<br>longer. Ibid. During lockdowns, staff must either escort&para;<br>prisoners to medical facilities or bring medical staff to the&para;<br>prisoners. Either procedure puts additional strain on&para;<br>already overburdened medical and custodial staff. Some&para;<br>programming for the mentally ill even may be canceled&para;<br>altogether during lockdowns, and staff may be unable to&para;<br>supervise the delivery of psychotropic medications.&para;<br>The effects of overcrowding are particularly acute in&para;<br>the prisons’ reception centers, intake areas that process&para;<br>140,000 new or returning prisoners every year. Id., at&para;<br>85a. Crowding in these areas runs as high as 300% of&para;<br>design capacity. Id., at 86a. Living conditions are&para;<br>“ ‘toxic,’ ” and a lack of treatment space impedes efforts to&para;<br>identify inmate medical or mental health needs and pro&para;<br>vide even rudimentary care. Id., at 92a. The former&para;<br>warden of San Quentin reported that doctors in that&para;<br>prison’s reception center “ ‘were unable to keep up with&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>physicals or provid[e] any kind of chronic care follow-up.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 90a. Inmates spend long periods of time in these&para;<br>areas awaiting transfer to the general population. Some&para;<br>prisoners are held in the reception centers for their entire&para;<br>period of incarceration.&para;<br>Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary&para;<br>cause of the constitutional violations. The former warden&para;<br>of San Quentin and former acting secretary of the Califor&para;<br>nia prisons concluded that crowding “makes it ‘virtually&para;<br>impossible for the organization to develop, much less&para;<br>implement, a plan to provide prisoners with adequate&para;<br>care.’ ” Id., at 83a. The former executive director of the&para;<br>Texas Department of Criminal Justice testified that&para;<br>“ ‘[e]verything revolves around overcrowding” and that&para;<br>“ ‘overcrowding is the primary cause of the medical and&para;<br>mental health care violations.’ ” Id., at 127a. The former&para;<br>head of corrections in Pennsylvania, Washington, and&para;<br>Maine testified that overcrowding is “ ‘overwhelming the&para;<br>system both in terms of sheer numbers, in terms of the&para;<br>space available, in terms of providing healthcare.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>And the current secretary of the Pennsylvania Depart&para;<br>ment of Corrections testified that “ ‘‘the biggest inhibiting&para;<br>factor right now in California being able to deliver appro&para;<br>priate mental health and medical care is the severe over&para;<br>crowding.’ ” Id., at 82a.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The State attempts to undermine the substantial evi&para;<br>dence presented at trial, and the three-judge court’s find&para;<br>ings of fact, by complaining that the three-judge court did&para;<br>not allow it to present evidence of current prison condi&para;<br>tions. This suggestion lacks a factual basis.&para;<br>The three-judge court properly admitted evidence of&para;<br>current conditions as relevant to the issues before it. The&para;<br>three-judge court allowed discovery until a few months&para;<br>before trial; expert witnesses based their conclusions on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>recent observations of prison conditions; the court ad&para;<br>mitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Plata&para;<br>Receiver and Coleman Special Master; and both parties&para;<br>presented testimony related to current conditions, includ&para;<br>ing understaffing, inadequate facilities, and unsanitary&para;<br>and unsafe living conditions. See supra, at 4–8, 19–24.&para;<br>Dr. Craig Haney, for example, based his expert report on&para;<br>tours of eight California prisons. App. 539. These tours&para;<br>occurred as late as August 2008, two weeks before Dr.&para;<br>Haney submitted his report and less than four months&para;<br>before the first day of trial. Id., at 585; see also id., at 563,&para;<br>565, 580 (July tours). Other experts submitted reports&para;<br>based on similar observations. See, e.g., Doc. 3231–13,&para;<br>at 6 (Dr. Shansky); App. 646 (Dr. Stewart); id., at 1245&para;<br>(Austin); id., at 1312 (Lehman).&para;<br>The three-judge court’s opinion cited and relied on this&para;<br>evidence of current conditions. The court relied exten&para;<br>sively on the expert witness reports. See generally Juris.&para;<br>App. 85a–143a. The court cited the most current data&para;<br>available on suicides and preventable deaths in the Cali&para;<br>fornia prisons. Id., at 123a, 125a. The court relied on&para;<br>statistics on staff vacancies that dated to three months&para;<br>before trial, id., at 105a, 108a, and statistics on shortages&para;<br>of treatment beds for the same period, id., at 97a. These&para;<br>are just examples of the extensive evidence of current&para;<br>conditions that informed every aspect of the judgment of&para;<br>the three-judge court. The three-judge court did not abuse&para;<br>its discretion when it also cited findings made in earlier&para;<br>decisions of the Plata and Coleman District Courts. Those&para;<br>findings remained relevant to establish the nature of these&para;<br>longstanding, continuing constitutional violations.&para;<br>It is true that the three-judge court established a cutoff&para;<br>date for discovery a few months before trial. The order&para;<br>stated that site inspections of prisons would be allowed&para;<br>until that date, and that evidence of “changed prison&para;<br>conditions” after that date would not be admitted. App.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1190. The court also excluded evidence not pertinent to&para;<br>the issue whether a population limit is appropriate under&para;<br>the PLRA, including evidence relevant solely to the exis&para;<br>tence of an ongoing constitutional violation. The court&para;<br>reasoned that its decision was limited to the issue of rem&para;<br>edy and that the merits of the constitutional violation had&para;<br>already been determined. The three-judge court made&para;<br>clear that all such evidence would be considered “[t]o the&para;<br>extent that it illuminates questions that are properly&para;<br>before the court.” App. 2339.&para;<br>Both rulings were within the sound discretion of the&para;<br>three-judge court. Orderly trial management may require&para;<br>discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litiga&para;<br>tion of the merits and the remedy. The State in fact&para;<br>represented to the three-judge court that it would be “ap&para;<br>propriate” to cut off discovery before trial because “like&para;<br>plaintiffs, we, too, are really gearing up and going into a&para;<br>pretrial mode.” Id., at 1683. And if the State truly be&para;<br>lieved there was no longer a violation, it could have argued&para;<br>to the Coleman and Plata District Courts that a three&para;<br>judge court should not be convened because the District&para;<br>Courts’ prior orders had not “failed to remedy the dep&para;<br>rivation” of prisoners’ constitutional rights. 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3626(a)(3)(A)(i); see also supra, at 16–17. Once the three&para;<br>judge court was convened, that court was not required to&para;<br>reconsider the merits. Its role was solely to consider the&para;<br>propriety and necessity of a population limit.&para;<br>The State does not point to any significant evidence that&para;<br>it was unable to present and that would have changed the&para;<br>outcome of the proceedings. To the contrary, the record&para;<br>and opinion make clear that the decision of the three&para;<br>judge court was based on current evidence pertaining to&para;<br>ongoing constitutional violations.&para;<br>3&para;<br>The three-judge court acknowledged that the violations&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>were caused by factors in addition to overcrowding and&para;<br>that reducing crowding in the prisons would not entirely&para;<br>cure the violations. This is consistent with the reports&para;<br>of the Coleman Special Master and Plata Receiver, both&para;<br>of whom concluded that even a significant reduction in the&para;<br>prison population would not remedy the violations absent&para;<br>continued efforts to train staff, improve facilities, and&para;<br>reform procedures. App. 487, 1054.8 The three-judge&para;<br>court nevertheless found that overcrowding was the pri&para;<br>mary cause in the sense of being the foremost cause of the&para;<br>violation.&para;<br>This understanding of the primary cause requirement is&para;<br>consistent with the text of the PLRA. The State in fact&para;<br>concedes that it proposed this very definition of primary&para;<br>cause to the three-judge court. “Primary” is defined as&para;<br>“[f]irst or highest in rank, quality, or importance; princi&para;<br>pal.” American Heritage Dictionary 1393 (4th ed. 2000);&para;<br>see also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary&para;<br>1800 (2002) (defining “primary” as “first in rank or impor&para;<br>tance”); 12 Oxford English Dictionary 472 (2d ed. 1989)&para;<br>(defining “primary” as “[o]f the first or highest rank or&para;<br>importance; that claims the first consideration; principal,&para;<br>chief ”). Overcrowding need only be the foremost, chief, or&para;<br>principal cause of the violation. If Congress had intended&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The Plata Receiver concluded that those who believed a population&para;<br>reduction would be a panacea were “simply wrong.” App. 1054–1055.&para;<br>The Receiver nevertheless made clear that “the time this process will&para;<br>take, and the cost and the scope of intrusion by the Federal Court&para;<br>cannot help but increase, and increase in a very significant manner, if&para;<br>the scope and characteristics of [California prison] overcrowding&para;<br>continue.” Id., at 1053. The Coleman Special Master likewise found&para;<br>that a large release of prisoners, without other relief, would leave the&para;<br>violation “largely unmitigated” even though deficiencies in care “are&para;<br>unquestionably exacerbated by overcrowding” and “defendants’ ability&para;<br>to provide required mental health services would be enhanced consid&para;<br>erably by a reduction in the overall census” of the prisons.

PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to require that crowding be the only cause, it would have&para;<br>said so, assuming in its judgment that definition would be&para;<br>consistent with constitutional limitations.&para;<br>As this case illustrates, constitutional violations in&para;<br>conditions of confinement are rarely susceptible of simple&para;<br>or straightforward solutions. In addition to overcrowding&para;<br>the failure of California’s prisons to provide adequate&para;<br>medical and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic&para;<br>and worsening budget shortfalls, a lack of political will in&para;<br>favor of reform, inadequate facilities, and systemic admin&para;<br>istrative failures. The Plata District Judge, in his order&para;<br>appointing the Receiver, compared the problem to “ ‘a&para;<br>spider web, in which the tension of the various strands is&para;<br>determined by the relationship among all the parts of the&para;<br>web, so that if one pulls on a single strand, the tension of&para;<br>the entire web is redistributed in a new and complex&para;<br>pattern.’ ” App. 966–967 (quoting Fletcher, The Discre&para;<br>tionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies and Judicial&para;<br>Legitimacy, 91 Yale L. J. 635, 645 (1982)); see also Hutto,&para;<br>437 U. S., at 688 (noting “the interdependence of the con&para;<br>ditions producing the violation,” including overcrowd&para;<br>ing). Only a multifaceted approach aimed at many causes,&para;<br>including overcrowding, will yield a solution.&para;<br>The PLRA should not be interpreted to place undue&para;<br>restrictions on the authority of federal courts to fashion&para;<br>practical remedies when confronted with complex and&para;<br>intractable constitutional violations.

A reading of the PLRA that&para;<br>would render population limits unavailable in practice&para;<br>would raise serious constitutional concerns. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476&para;<br>U. S. 667, 681, n. 12 (1986). A finding that overcrowding&para;<br>is the “primary cause” of a violation is therefore permissi&para;<br>ble, despite the fact that additional steps will be required&para;<br>to remedy the violation.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The three-judge court was also required to find by clear&para;<br>and convincing evidence that “no other relief will remedy&para;<br>the violation of the Federal right.” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).&para;<br>The State argues that the violation could have been&para;<br>remedied through a combination of new construction,&para;<br>transfers of prisoners out of State, hiring of medical per&para;<br>sonnel, and continued efforts by the Plata Receiver and&para;<br>Coleman Special Master. The order in fact permits the&para;<br>State to comply with the population limit by transferring&para;<br>prisoners to county facilities or facilities in other States, or&para;<br>by constructing new facilities to raise the prisons’ design&para;<br>capacity. And the three-judge court’s order does not bar&para;<br>the State from undertaking any other remedial efforts. If&para;<br>the State does find an adequate remedy other than a&para;<br>population limit, it may seek modification or termination&para;<br>of the three-judge court’s order on that basis. The evi&para;<br>dence at trial, however, supports the three-judge court’s&para;<br>conclusion that an order limited to other remedies would&para;<br>not provide effective relief.&para;<br>The State’s argument that out-of-state transfers provide&para;<br>a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>because requiring out-of-state transfers itself qualifies as&para;<br>a population limit under the PLRA.9 Such an order “has&para;<br>the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison&para;<br>population, or . . . directs the release from or nonadmission&para;<br>of prisoners to a prison.” §3626(g)(4). The same is true of&para;<br>transfers to county facilities. Transfers provide a means&para;<br>to reduce the prison population in compliance with the&para;<br>three-judge court’s order. They are not a less restrictive&para;<br>alternative to that order.&para;<br>Even if out-of-state transfers could be regarded as a less&para;<br>restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no&para;<br>evidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to&para;<br>relieve overcrowding. The State complains that the Cole&para;<br>man District Court slowed the rate of transfer by requir&para;<br>ing inspections to assure that the receiving institutions&para;<br>were in compliance with the Eighth Amendment, but the&para;<br>State has made no effort to show that it has the resources&para;<br>and the capacity to transfer significantly larger numbers&para;<br>of prisoners absent that condition.&para;<br>Construction of new facilities, in theory, could alleviate&para;<br>overcrowding, but the three-judge court found no realistic&para;<br>possibility that California would be able to build itself out&para;<br>of this crisis. At the time of the court’s decision the State&para;<br>had plans to build new medical and housing facilities, but&para;<br>funding for some plans had not been secured and funding&para;<br>for other plans had been delayed by the legislature for&para;<br>years. Particularly in light of California’s ongoing fiscal&para;<br>crisis, the three-judge court deemed “chimerical” any&para;<br>“remedy that requires significant additional spending by&para;<br>the state.” Juris. App. 151a. Events subsequent to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 A program of voluntary transfers by the State would, of course, be&para;<br>less restrictive than an order mandating a reduction in the prison&para;<br>population. In light of the State’s longstanding failure to remedy these&para;<br>serious constitutional violations, the three-judge court was under no&para;<br>obligation to consider voluntary population-reduction measures by the&para;<br>State as a workable alternative to injunctive relief.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>three-judge court’s decision have confirmed this conclu&para;<br>sion. In October 2010, the State notified the Coleman&para;<br>District Court that a substantial component of its con&para;<br>struction plans had been delayed indefinitely by the legis&para;<br>lature. And even if planned construction were to be&para;<br>completed, the Plata Receiver found that many so-called&para;<br>“expansion” plans called for cramming more prisoners into&para;<br>existing prisons without expanding administrative and&para;<br>support facilities. Juris. App. 151a–152a. The former&para;<br>acting secretary of the California prisons explained that&para;<br>these plans would “ ‘compound the burdens imposed on&para;<br>prison administrators and line staff’’ ” by adding to the&para;<br>already overwhelming prison population, creating new&para;<br>barriers to achievement of a remedy. Id., at 152a.&para;<br>The three-judge court also rejected additional hiring as&para;<br>a realistic means to achieve a remedy. The State for years&para;<br>had been unable to fill positions necessary for the ade&para;<br>quate provision of medical and mental health care, and&para;<br>the three-judge court found no reason to expect a change.&para;<br>Although the State points to limited gains in staffing&para;<br>between 2007 and 2008, the record shows that the prison&para;<br>system remained chronically understaffed through trial in&para;<br>2008. See supra, at 20. The three-judge court found that&para;<br>violence and other negative conditions caused by crowding&para;<br>made it difficult to hire and retain needed staff. The court&para;<br>also concluded that there would be insufficient space for&para;<br>additional staff to work even if adequate personnel could&para;<br>somehow be retained. Additional staff cannot help to&para;<br>remedy the violation if they have no space in which to see&para;<br>and treat patients.&para;<br>The three-judge court also did not err, much less commit&para;<br>clear error, when it concluded that, absent a population&para;<br>reduction, continued efforts by the Receiver and Special&para;<br>Master would not achieve a remedy. Both the Receiver&para;<br>and the Special Master filed reports stating that over&para;<br>crowding posed a significant barrier to their efforts. The&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

App. 1053. The Coleman Special Master noted&para;<br>even more serious concerns, stating that previous reme&para;<br>dial efforts had “succumbed to the inexorably rising tide of&para;<br>population.” App. 489. Both reports are persuasive evi&para;<br>dence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem&para;<br>edy might prove unattainable and would at the very least&para;<br>require vast expenditures of resources by the State. Noth&para;<br>ing in the long history of the Coleman and Plata actions&para;<br>demonstrates any real possibility that the necessary re&para;<br>sources would be made available.&para;<br>The State claims that, even if each of these measures&para;<br>were unlikely to remedy the violation, they would succeed&para;<br>in doing so if combined together. Aside from asserting this&para;<br>proposition, the State offers no reason to believe it is so.&para;<br>Attempts to remedy the violations in Plata have been&para;<br>ongoing for 9 years. In Coleman, remedial efforts have&para;<br>been ongoing for 16. At one time, it may have been possi&para;<br>ble to hope that these violations would be cured without a&para;<br>reduction in overcrowding.

Without a reduction in overcrowd&para;<br>ing, there will be no efficacious remedy for the unconsti&para;<br>tutional care of the sick and mentally ill in California’s&para;<br>prisons.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The PLRA states that no prospective relief shall issue&para;<br>with respect to prison conditions unless it is narrowly&para;<br>drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the&para;<br>violation of a federal right, and is the least intrusive&para;<br>means necessary to correct the violation. 18 U.

Reducing overcrowding will also have positive&para;<br>effects beyond facilitating timely and adequate access to&para;<br>medical care, including reducing the incidence of prison&para;<br>violence and ameliorating unsafe living conditions. Ac&para;<br>cording to the State, these collateral consequences are&para;<br>evidence that the order sweeps more broadly than&para;<br>necessary.&para;<br>The population limit imposed by the three-judge court&para;<br>does not fail narrow tailoring simply because it will have&para;<br>positive effects beyond the plaintiff class.

The scope of the remedy must be proportional&para;<br>to the scope of the violation, and the order must extend&para;<br>no further than necessary to remedy the violation. This&para;<br>Court has rejected remedial orders that unnecessarily&para;<br>reach out to improve prison conditions other than those&para;<br>that violate the Constitution. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.&para;<br>343, 357 (1996). But the precedents do not suggest that a&para;<br>narrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional&para;<br>violation is invalid simply because it will have collateral&para;<br>effects.&para;<br>Nor does anything in the text of the PLRA require that&para;<br>result. The PLRA states that a remedy shall extend no&para;<br>further than necessary to remedy the violation of the&para;<br>rights of a “particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3626(a)(1)(A). This means only that the scope of the&para;<br>order must be determined with reference to the consti&para;<br>tutional violations established by the specific plaintiffs&para;<br>before the court.&para;<br>This case is unlike cases where courts have impermis&para;<br>sibly reached out to control the treatment of persons or&para;<br>institutions beyond the scope of the violation. See Dayton&para;<br>Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 420 (1977). Even&para;<br>prisoners with no present physical or mental illness may&para;<br>become afflicted, and all prisoners in California are at risk&para;<br>so long as the State continues to provide inadequate care.&para;<br>Prisoners in the general population will become sick, and&para;<br>will become members of the plaintiff classes, with routine frequency; and overcrowding may prevent the timely&para;<br>diagnosis and care necessary to provide effective treat&para;<br>ment and to prevent further spread of disease.

They are&para;<br>that system’s next potential victims.&para;<br>A release order limited to prisoners within the plaintiff&para;<br>classes would, if anything, unduly limit the ability of State&para;<br>officials to determine which prisoners should be released.&para;<br>As the State acknowledges in its brief, “release of seriously&para;<br>mentally ill inmates [would be] likely to create special&para;<br>dangers because of their recidivism rates.” Consolidated&para;<br>Reply Brief for Appellants 34. The order of the three&para;<br>judge court gives the State substantial flexibility to&para;<br>determine who should be released. If the State truly be&para;<br>lieves that a release order limited to sick and mentally ill&para;<br>inmates would be preferable to the order entered by the&para;<br>three-judge court, the State can move the three-judge&para;<br>court for modification of the order on that basis. The State&para;<br>has not requested this relief from this Court.&para;<br>The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses&para;<br>the entire prison system, rather than separately assessing&para;<br>the need for a population limit at every institution. The&para;<br>Coleman court found a systemwide violation when it first&para;<br>afforded relief, and in Plata the State stipulated to sys&para;<br>temwide relief when it conceded the existence of a viola&para;<br>tion. Both the Coleman Special Master and the Plata&para;<br>Receiver have filed numerous reports detailing system&para;<br>wide deficiencies in medical and mental health care.&para;<br>California’s medical care program is run at a systemwide&para;<br>level, and resources are shared among the correctional&para;<br>facilities.&para;<br>Although the three-judge court’s order addresses the&para;<br>entire California prison system, it affords the State flexi&para;<br>bility to accommodate differences between institutions.&para;<br>There is no requirement that every facility comply with&para;<br>the 137.5% limit. Assuming no constitutional violation&para;<br>results, some facilities may retain populations in excess of&para;<br>the limit provided other facilities fall sufficiently below it&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>so the system as a whole remains in compliance with the&para;<br>order. This will allow prison officials to shift prisoners&para;<br>to facilities that are better able to accommodate over&para;<br>crowding, or out of facilities where retaining sufficient&para;<br>medical staff has been difficult. The alternative—a series&para;<br>of institution-specific population limits—would require&para;<br>federal judges to make these choices. Leaving this discre&para;<br>tion to state officials does not make the order overbroad.&para;<br>Nor is the order overbroad because it limits the State’s&para;<br>authority to run its prisons, as the State urges in its brief.&para;<br>While the order does in some respects shape or control the&para;<br>State’s authority in the realm of prison administration, it&para;<br>does so in a manner that leaves much to the State’s discre&para;<br>tion. The State may choose how to allocate prisoners&para;<br>between institutions; it may choose whether to increase&para;<br>the prisons’ capacity through construction or reduce the&para;<br>population; and, if it does reduce the population, it may&para;<br>decide what steps to take to achieve the necessary reduc&para;<br>tion. The order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a&para;<br>constitutional violation.&para;<br>As the State implements the order of the three-judge&para;<br>court, time and experience may reveal targeted and effec&para;<br>tive remedies that will end the constitutional violations&para;<br>even without a significant decrease in the general prison&para;<br>population. The State will be free to move the three-judge&para;<br>court for modification of its order on that basis, and these&para;<br>motions would be entitled to serious consideration. See&para;<br>infra, at 45–48. At this time, the State has not proposed&para;<br>any realistic alternative to the order. The State’s desire to&para;<br>avoid a population limit, justified as according respect to&para;<br>state authority, creates a certain and unacceptable risk of&para;<br>continuing violations of the rights of sick and mentally ill&para;<br>prisoners, with the result that many more will die or&para;<br>needlessly suffer. The Constitution does not permit this&para;<br>wrong.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

This is particularly true&para;<br>when the order requires release of prisoners before their&para;<br>sentence has been served. Persons incarcerated for even&para;<br>one offense may have committed many other crimes prior&para;<br>to arrest and conviction, and some number can be ex&para;<br>pected to commit further crimes upon release.

See supra, at 28–29. A court is required to consider&para;<br>the public safety consequences of its order and to struc&para;<br>ture, and monitor, its ruling in a way that mitigates those&para;<br>consequences while still achieving an effective remedy of&para;<br>the constitutional violation.&para;<br>This inquiry necessarily involves difficult predictive&para;<br>judgments regarding the likely effects of court orders.&para;<br>Although these judgments are normally made by state&para;<br>officials, they necessarily must be made by courts when&para;<br>&para;<br>38&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

Expansion of good-time credits would allow&para;<br>the State to give early release to only those prisoners who&para;<br>pose the least risk of reoffending. Diverting low-risk&para;<br>offenders to community programs such as drug treatment,&para;<br>day reporting centers, and electronic monitoring would&para;<br>likewise lower the prison population without releasing&para;<br>violent convicts.12 The State now sends large numbers of&para;<br>persons to prison for violating a technical term or condi&para;<br>tion of their parole, and it could reduce the prison popula&para;<br>tion by punishing technical parole violations through&para;<br>community-based programs. This last measure would be&para;<br>particularly beneficial as it would reduce crowding in the&para;<br>reception centers, which are especially hard hit by over&para;<br>crowding. See supra, at 23–24. The court’s order took&para;<br>account of public safety concerns by giving the State sub&para;<br>stantial flexibility to select among these and other means&para;<br>of reducing overcrowding.&para;<br>The State submitted a plan to reduce its prison popula&para;<br>tion in accordance with the three-judge court’s order, and&para;<br>it complains that the three-judge court approved that&para;<br>plan without considering whether the specific measures&para;<br>contained within it would substantially threaten public&para;<br>safety.

The decision&para;<br>to leave details of implementation to the State’s discretion&para;<br>protected public safety by leaving sensitive policy deci&para;<br>sions to responsible and competent state officials.&para;<br>During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact&para;<br>began to implement measures to reduce the prison popula&para;<br>tion. See Supp. Brief for Appellants 1. These measures&para;<br>will shift “thousands” of prisoners from the state prisons&para;<br>to the county jails by “mak[ing] certain felonies punishable&para;<br>by imprisonment in county jail” and “requir[ing] that&para;<br>individuals returned to custody for violating their condi&para;<br>tions of parole ‘serve any custody term in county jail.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. These developments support the three-judge court’s&para;<br>conclusion that the prison population can be reduced in&para;<br>a manner calculated to avoid an undue negative effect on&para;<br>public safety.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Establishing the population at which the State could&para;<br>begin to provide constitutionally adequate medical and&para;<br>mental health care, and the appropriate time frame within&para;<br>which to achieve the necessary reduction, requires a de&para;<br>gree of judgment. The inquiry involves uncertain predic&para;<br>tions regarding the effects of population reductions, as&para;<br>well as difficult determinations regarding the capacity of&para;<br>prison officials to provide adequate care at various popu&para;<br>lation levels. Courts have substantial flexibility when&para;<br>making these judgments. “ ‘Once invoked, “the scope of a&para;<br>district court’s equitable powers . . . is broad, for breadth&para;<br>and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” ’ ”&para;<br>Hutto, 437 U. S., at 687, n. 9 (quoting Milliken v. Bradley,&para;<br>433 U. S. 267, 281 (1977), in turn quoting Swann v.&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971)).&para;<br>Nevertheless, the PLRA requires a court to adopt a&para;<br>remedy that is “narrowly tailored” to the constitutional&para;<br>violation and that gives “substantial weight” to public&para;<br>safety. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). When a court is imposing a&para;<br>population limit, this means the court must set the limit&para;<br>at the highest population consistent with an efficacious&para;<br>remedy. The court must also order the population reduc&para;<br>tion achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably&para;<br>consistent with public safety.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The three-judge court concluded that the population of&para;<br>California’s prisons should be capped at 137.5% of design&para;<br>capacity. This conclusion is supported by the record.&para;<br>Indeed, some evidence supported a limit as low as 100% of&para;<br>design capacity. The chief deputy secretary of Correc&para;<br>tional Healthcare Services for the California prisons tes&para;<br>tified that California’s prisons “ ‘were not designed and&para;<br>made no provision for any expansion of medical care space&para;<br>beyond the initial 100% of capacity.’ ” Juris. App. 176a.&para;<br>Other evidence supported a limit as low as 130%. The&para;<br>head of the State’s Facilities Strike Team recommended&para;<br>reducing the population to 130% of design capacity as a&para;<br>long-term goal. Id., at 179a–180a. A former head of cor&para;<br>rectional systems in Washington State, Maine, and Penn&para;<br>sylvania testified that a 130% limit would “ ‘give prison&para;<br>officials and staff the ability to provide the necessary&para;<br>programs and services for California’s prisoners.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>180a. A former executive director of the Texas prisons&para;<br>testified that a limit of 130% was “ ‘realistic and appro&para;<br>priate’ ” and would “ ‘ensure that [California’s] prisons are&para;<br>safe and provide legally required services.’ ” Ibid. And a&para;<br>former acting secretary of the California prisons agreed&para;<br>with a 130% limit with the caveat that a 130% limit might&para;<br>prove inadequate in some older facilities. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Of course,&para;<br>courts must not confuse professional standards with con&para;<br>stitutional requirements. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S.&para;<br>337, 348, n. 13 (1981). But expert opinion may be relevant&para;<br>when determining what is obtainable and what is accept&para;<br>able in corrections philosophy. See supra, at 37–38.&para;<br>Nothing in the record indicates that the experts in this&para;<br>case imposed their own policy views or lost sight of the&para;<br>underlying violations. To the contrary, the witnesses&para;<br>testified that a 130% population limit would allow the&para;<br>State to remedy the constitutionally inadequate provision&para;<br>of medical and mental health care. When expert opinion&para;<br>is addressed to the question of how to remedy the relevant&para;<br>constitutional violations, as it was here, federal judges can&para;<br>give it considerable weight.&para;<br>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has set 130% as a&para;<br>long-term goal for population levels in the federal prison&para;<br>system. Brief for Appellants 43–44. The State suggests&para;<br>the expert witnesses impermissibly adopted this profes&para;<br>sional standard in their testimony. But courts are not&para;<br>required to disregard expert opinion solely because it&para;<br>adopts or accords with professional standards. Profes&para;<br>sional standards may be “helpful and relevant with re&para;<br>spect to some questions.” Chapman, supra, at 348, n. 13.&para;<br>The witnesses testified that a limit of 130% was necessary&para;<br>to remedy the constitutional violations, not that it should&para;<br>be adopted because it is a BOP standard. If anything, the&para;<br>fact that the BOP views 130% as a manageable population&para;<br>density bolsters the three-judge court’s conclusion that a&para;<br>population limit of 130% would alleviate the pressures&para;<br>associated with overcrowding and allow the State to begin&para;<br>to provide constitutionally adequate care.&para;<br>Although the three-judge court concluded that the “evi&para;<br>dence in support of a 130% limit is strong,” it found that&para;<br>&para;<br>44&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>some upward adjustment was warranted in light of “the&para;<br>caution and restraint required by the PLRA.” Juris. App.&para;<br>183a, 184a. The three-judge court noted evidence support&para;<br>ing a higher limit. In particular, the State’s Corrections&para;<br>Independent Review Panel had found that 145% was the&para;<br>maximum “operable capacity” of California’s prisons, id.,&para;<br>at 181a–182a, although the relevance of that determina&para;<br>tion was undermined by the fact that the panel had not&para;<br>considered the need to provide constitutionally adequate&para;<br>medical and mental health care, as the State itself con&para;<br>cedes. Brief for Coleman Appellees 45. After considering,&para;<br>but discounting, this evidence, the three-judge court con&para;<br>cluded that the evidence supported a limit lower than&para;<br>145%, but higher than 130%. It therefore imposed a limit&para;<br>of 137.5%.&para;<br>This weighing of the evidence was not clearly erroneous.&para;<br>The adversary system afforded the court an opportunity&para;<br>to weigh and evaluate evidence presented by the parties.&para;<br>The plaintiffs’ evidentiary showing was intended to justify&para;<br>a limit of 130%, and the State made no attempt to show&para;<br>that any other number would allow for a remedy. There&para;<br>are also no scientific tools available to determine the&para;<br>precise population reduction necessary to remedy a consti&para;<br>tutional violation of this sort. The three-judge court made&para;<br>the most precise determination it could in light of the&para;<br>record before it. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring require&para;<br>ment is satisfied so long as these equitable, remedial&para;<br>judgments are made with the objective of releasing the&para;<br>fewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious&para;<br>remedy. In light of substantial evidence supporting an&para;<br>even more drastic remedy, the three-judge court complied&para;<br>with the requirement of the PLRA in this case.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The three-judge court ordered the State to achieve this&para;<br>reduction within two years.

The&para;<br>State later submitted a plan for court approval that would&para;<br>achieve the required reduction within five years, and that&para;<br>would reduce the prison population to 151% of design&para;<br>capacity in two years. The State represented that this&para;<br>plan would “safely reach a population level of 137.5% over&para;<br>time.” App. to Juris. Statement 32a. The three-judge&para;<br>court rejected this plan because it did not comply with the&para;<br>deadline set by its order.&para;<br>The State first had notice that it would be required to&para;<br>reduce its prison population in February 2009, when the&para;<br>three-judge court gave notice of its tentative ruling after&para;<br>trial. The 2-year deadline, however, will not begin to run&para;<br>until this Court issues its judgment. When that happens,&para;<br>the State will have already had over two years to begin&para;<br>complying with the order of the three-judge court. The&para;<br>State has used the time productively. At oral argument,&para;<br>the State indicated it had reduced its prison population&para;<br>by approximately 9,000 persons since the decision of the&para;<br>three-judge court. After oral argument, the State filed a&para;<br>supplemental brief indicating that it had begun to imple&para;<br>ment measures to shift “thousands” of additional prisoners&para;<br>to county facilities. Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1.&para;<br>Particularly in light of the State’s failure to contest the&para;<br>issue at trial, the three-judge court did not err when&para;<br>it established a 2-year deadline for relief. Plaintiffs pro&para;<br>posed a 2-year deadline, and the evidence at trial was&para;<br>intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a 2-year dead&para;<br>line. See Tr. 2979. Notably, the State has not asked this&para;<br>Court to extend the 2-year deadline at this time.&para;<br>The three-judge court, however, retains the authority,&para;<br>and the responsibility, to make further amendments to the&para;<br>existing order or any modified decree it may enter as&para;<br>warranted by the exercise of its sound discretion. “The&para;<br>power of a court of equity to modify a decree of injunctive&para;<br>&para;<br>46&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

Even with an extension of&para;<br>time to construct new facilities and implement other&para;<br>reforms, it may become necessary to release prisoners to&para;<br>comply with the court’s order.

One would think that, before&para;<br>allowing the decree of a federal district court to release&para;<br>46,000 convicted felons, this Court would bend every effort&para;<br>to read the law in such a way as to avoid that outrageous&para;<br>result.

I dissent because the institutional reform the&para;<br>District Court has undertaken violates the terms of the gov&para;<br>erning statute, ignores bedrock limitations on the power&para;<br>of Article III judges, and takes federal courts wildly&para;<br>beyond their institutional capacity.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) states that&para;<br>“[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to&para;<br>prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary&para;<br>to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular&para;<br>plaintiff or plaintiffs”; that such relief must be “narrowly&para;<br>drawn, [and] exten[d] no further than necessary to correct&para;<br>the violation of the Federal right”; and that it must be “the&para;<br>least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of&para;<br>the Federal right.” 18 U.

In deciding&para;<br>whether these multiple limitations have been complied&para;<br>with, it is necessary to identify with precision what is the&para;<br>“violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or&para;<br>plaintiffs” that has been alleged. What has been alleged&para;<br>here, and what the injunction issued by the Court is&para;<br>tailored (narrowly or not) to remedy is the running of a&para;<br>prison system with inadequate medical facilities. That&para;<br>may result in the denial of needed medical treatment to “a&para;<br>particular [prisoner] or [prisoners],” thereby violating (ac&para;<br>cording to our cases) his or their Eighth Amendment&para;<br>rights. But the mere existence of the inadequate system&para;<br>does not subject to cruel and unusual punishment the&para;<br>entire prison population in need of medical care, including&para;<br>those who receive it.&para;<br>The Court acknowledges that the plaintiffs “do not base&para;<br>their case on deficiencies in care provided on any one&para;<br>occasion”; rather, “[p]laintiffs rely on systemwide deficien&para;<br>cies in the provision of medical and mental health care&para;<br>that, taken as a whole, subject sick and mentally ill pris&para;<br>oners in California to ‘substantial risk of serious harm’&para;<br>and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall below&para;<br>the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress&para;<br>of a maturing society.” Ante, at 7, n. 3.

Indeed, it is inconceivable that&para;<br>anything more than a small proportion of prisoners in&para;<br>the plaintiff classes have personally received sufficiently&para;<br>atrocious treatment that their Eighth Amendment right&para;<br>was violated—which, as the Court recognizes, is why the&para;<br>plaintiffs do not premise their claim on “deficiencies in&para;<br>care provided on any one occasion.” Ante, at 7, n. 3.&para;<br>Rather, the plaintiffs’ claim is that they are all part of a&para;<br>medical system so defective that some number of prisoners&para;<br>will inevitably be injured by incompetent medical care,&para;<br>and that this number is sufficiently high so as to render&para;<br>the system, as a whole, unconstitutional.&para;<br>But what procedural principle justifies certifying a class&para;<br>of plaintiffs so they may assert a claim of systemic uncon&para;<br>stitutionality? I can think of two possibilities, both of&para;<br>which are untenable. The first is that although some or&para;<br>most plaintiffs in the class do not individually have viable&para;<br>Eighth Amendment claims, the class as a whole has collec&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tively suffered an Eighth Amendment violation. That&para;<br>theory is contrary to the bedrock rule that the sole purpose&para;<br>of classwide adjudication is to aggregate claims that are&para;<br>individually viable. “A class action, no less than tradi&para;<br>tional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a&para;<br>federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at&para;<br>once, instead of in separate suits. And like traditional&para;<br>joinder, it leaves the parties’ legal rights and duties intact&para;<br>and the rules of decision unchanged.” Shady Grove Or&para;<br>thopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 14).&para;<br>The second possibility is that every member of the plain&para;<br>tiff class has suffered an Eighth Amendment violation&para;<br>merely by virtue of being a patient in a poorly-run prison&para;<br>system, and the purpose of the class is merely to aggregate&para;<br>all those individually viable claims. This theory has the&para;<br>virtue of being consistent with procedural principles, but&para;<br>at the cost of a gross substantive departure from our case&para;<br>law. Under this theory, each and every prisoner who&para;<br>happens to be a patient in a system that has systemic&para;<br>weaknesses—such as “hir[ing] any doctor who had a li&para;<br>cense, a pulse and a pair of shoes,” ante, at 10 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)—has suffered cruel or unusual&para;<br>punishment, even if that person cannot make an individu&para;<br>alized showing of mistreatment. Such a theory of the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment is preposterous. And we have said as&para;<br>much in the past: “If . . . a healthy inmate who had suf&para;<br>fered no deprivation of needed medical treatment were&para;<br>able to claim violation of his constitutional right to medi&para;<br>cal care . . . simply on the ground that the prison medical&para;<br>facilities were inadequate, the essential distinction be&para;<br>tween judge and executive would have disappeared: it&para;<br>would have become the function of the courts to assure&para;<br>adequate medical care in prisons.” Lewis v. Casey, 518&para;<br>U. S. 343, 350 (1996).&para;<br>Whether procedurally wrong or substantively wrong,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

It follows that the remedy decreed&para;<br>here is also contrary to law, since the theory of systemic&para;<br>unconstitutionality is central to the plaintiffs’ case. The&para;<br>PLRA requires plaintiffs to establish that the systemwide&para;<br>injunction entered by the District Court was “narrowly&para;<br>drawn” and “extends no further than necessary” to correct&para;<br>“the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff&para;<br>or plaintiffs.” If (as is the case) the only viable constitu&para;<br>tional claims consist of individual instances of mistreat&para;<br>ment, then a remedy reforming the system as a whole goes&para;<br>far beyond what the statute allows.&para;<br>It is also worth noting the peculiarity that the vast&para;<br>majority of inmates most generously rewarded by the re&para;<br>lease order—the 46,000 whose incarceration will be ended—&para;<br>do not form part of any aggrieved class even under the&para;<br>Court’s expansive notion of constitutional violation. Most&para;<br>of them will not be prisoners with medical conditions or&para;<br>severe mental illness; and many will undoubtedly be fine&para;<br>physical specimens who have developed intimidating&para;<br>muscles pumping iron in the prison gym.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Even if I accepted the implausible premise that the&para;<br>plaintiffs have established a systemwide violation of&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment, I would dissent from the Court’s&para;<br>endorsement of a decrowding order. That order is an&para;<br>example of what has become known as a “structural in&para;<br>junction.” As I have previously explained, structural&para;<br>injunctions are radically different from the injunctions&para;<br>traditionally issued by courts of equity, and presumably&para;<br>part of “the judicial Power” conferred on federal courts by&para;<br>Article III:&para;<br>“The mandatory injunctions issued upon termination&para;<br>of litigation usually required ‘a single simple act.’ H.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

And where specific performance of contracts&para;<br>was sought, it was the categorical rule that no decree&para;<br>would issue that required ongoing supervision. . . .&para;<br>Compliance with these ‘single act’ mandates could, in&para;<br>addition to being simple, be quick; and once it was&para;<br>achieved the contemnor’s relationship with the court&para;<br>came to an end, at least insofar as the subject of the&para;<br>order was concerned. Once the document was turned&para;<br>over or the land conveyed, the litigant’s obligation to&para;<br>the court, and the court’s coercive power over the liti&para;<br>gant, ceased. . . .

The factfinding judges tradition&para;<br>ally engage in involves the determination of past or pre&para;<br>sent facts based (except for a limited set of materials of&para;<br>which courts may take “judicial notice”) exclusively upon&para;<br>a closed trial record. That is one reason why a district&para;<br>judge’s factual findings are entitled to clear-error review:&para;<br>because having viewed the trial first hand he is in a better&para;<br>position to evaluate the evidence than a judge reviewing a&para;<br>cold record. In a very limited category of cases, judges&para;<br>have also traditionally been called upon to make some&para;<br>predictive judgments: which custody will best serve the&para;<br>interests of the child, for example, or whether a particular&para;<br>one-shot injunction will remedy the plaintiff’s grievance.&para;<br>When a judge manages a structural injunction, however,&para;<br>he will inevitably be required to make very broad empiri&para;<br>cal predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy&para;<br>views—the sort of predictions regularly made by legis&para;<br>lators and executive officials, but inappropriate for the&para;<br>Third Branch.&para;<br>This feature of structural injunctions is superbly illus&para;<br>trated by the District Court’s proceeding concerning the&para;<br>decrowding order’s effect on public safety. The PLRA&para;<br>requires that, before granting “[p]rospective relief in [a]&para;<br>civil action with respect to prison conditions,” a court must&para;<br>“give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public&para;<br>safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused&para;<br>by the relief.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). Here, the Dis&para;<br>trict Court discharged that requirement by making the&para;<br>“factual finding” that “the state has available methods by&para;<br>which it could readily reduce the prison population to&para;<br>137.5% design capacity or less without an adverse impact&para;<br>on public safety or the operation of the criminal justice&para;<br>system.” Juris. Statement App., O. T. 2009, No. 09-416, p.&para;<br>253a. It found the evidence “clear” that prison overcrowd&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing would “perpetuate a criminogenic prison system that&para;<br>itself threatens public safety,” id., at 186a, and volun&para;<br>teered its opinion that “[t]he population could be reduced&para;<br>even further with the reform of California’s antiquated&para;<br>sentencing policies and other related changes to the laws.”&para;<br>Id., at 253a. It “reject[ed] the testimony that inmates&para;<br>released early from prison would commit additional new&para;<br>crimes,” id., at 200a, finding that “shortening the length of&para;<br>stay through earned credits would give inmates incentives&para;<br>to participate in programming designed to lower recidi&para;<br>vism,” id., at 204a, and that “slowing the flow of technical&para;<br>parole violators to prison, thereby substantially reducing&para;<br>the churning of parolees, would by itself improve both&para;<br>the prison and parole systems, and public safety.” Id., at&para;<br>209a. It found that “the diversion of offenders to commu&para;<br>nity correctional programs has significant beneficial ef&para;<br>fects on public safety,” id., at 214a, and that “additional&para;<br>rehabilitative programming would result in a significant&para;<br>population reduction while improving public safety,” id., at&para;<br>216a.&para;<br>The District Court cast these predictions (and the Court&para;<br>today accepts them) as “factual findings,” made in reliance&para;<br>on the procession of expert witnesses that testified at trial.&para;<br>Because these “findings” have support in the record, it is&para;<br>difficult to reverse them under a plain-error standard of&para;<br>review. Ante, at 38. And given that the District Court&para;<br>devoted nearly 10 days of trial and 70 pages of its opinion&para;<br>to this issue, it is difficult to dispute that the District&para;<br>Court has discharged its statutory obligation to give “sub&para;<br>stantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety.”&para;<br>But the idea that the three District Judges in this case&para;<br>relied solely on the credibility of the testifying expert&para;<br>witnesses is fanciful. Of course they were relying largely&para;<br>on their own beliefs about penology and recidivism. And&para;<br>of course different district judges, of different policy views,&para;<br>would have “found” that rehabilitation would not work&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and that releasing prisoners would increase the crime&para;<br>rate. I am not saying that the District Judges rendered&para;<br>their factual findings in bad faith. I am saying that it is&para;<br>impossible for judges to make “factual findings” without&para;<br>inserting their own policy judgments, when the factual&para;<br>findings are policy judgments. What occurred here is no&para;<br>more judicial factfinding in the ordinary sense than would&para;<br>be the factual findings that deficit spending will not lower&para;<br>the unemployment rate, or that the continued occupation&para;<br>of Iraq will decrease the risk of terrorism. Yet, because&para;<br>they have been branded “factual findings” entitled to&para;<br>deferential review, the policy preferences of three District&para;<br>Judges now govern the operation of California’s penal&para;<br>system.&para;<br>It is important to recognize that the dressing-up of pol&para;<br>icy judgments as factual findings is not an error peculiar to this case. It is an unavoidable concomitant of insti&para;<br>tutional-reform litigation. When a district court issues an&para;<br>injunction, it must make a factual assessment of the an&para;<br>ticipated consequences of the injunction. And when the&para;<br>injunction undertakes to restructure a social institution,&para;<br>assessing the factual consequences of the injunction is&para;<br>necessarily the sort of predictive judgment that our sys&para;<br>tem of government allocates to other government officials.&para;<br>But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges to&para;<br>indulge policy preferences. They invite judges to indulge&para;<br>incompetent policy preferences. Three years of law school&para;<br>and familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents&para;<br>give no insight whatsoever into the management of social&para;<br>institutions. Thus, in the proceeding below the District&para;<br>Court determined that constitutionally adequate medical&para;<br>services could be provided if the prison population was&para;<br>137.5% of design capacity. This was an empirical finding&para;<br>it was utterly unqualified to make. Admittedly, the court&para;<br>did not generate that number entirely on its own; it heard&para;<br>the numbers 130% and 145% bandied about by various&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>witnesses and decided to split the difference. But the&para;<br>ability of judges to spit back or even average-out numbers&para;<br>spoon-fed to them by expert witnesses does not render&para;<br>them competent decisionmakers in areas in which they&para;<br>are otherwise unqualified.&para;<br>The District Court also relied heavily on the views of the&para;<br>Receiver and Special Master, and those reports play a&para;<br>starring role in the Court’s opinion today. The Court notes&para;<br>that “the Receiver and the Special Master filed reports&para;<br>stating that overcrowding posed a significant barrier to&para;<br>their efforts” and deems those reports “persuasive evi&para;<br>dence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem&para;<br>edy might prove unattainable and would at the very least&para;<br>require vast expenditures of resources by the State.” Ante,&para;<br>at 31–32. The use of these reports is even less consonant&para;<br>with the traditional judicial role than the District Court’s&para;<br>reliance on the expert testimony at trial. The latter, even&para;<br>when, as here, it is largely the expression of policy judg&para;<br>ments, is at least subject to cross-examination. Relying on&para;<br>the un-cross-examined findings of an investigator, sent&para;<br>into the field to prepare a factual report and give sugges&para;<br>tions on how to improve the prison system, bears no re&para;<br>semblance to ordinary judicial decisionmaking. It is true&para;<br>that the PLRA contemplates the appointment of Special&para;<br>Masters (although not Receivers), but Special Masters are&para;<br>authorized only to “conduct hearings and prepare pro&para;<br>posed findings of fact” and “assist in the development of&para;<br>remedial plans,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(f)(6). This does not&para;<br>authorize them to make factual findings (unconnected to&para;<br>hearings) that are given seemingly wholesale deference.&para;<br>Neither the Receiver nor the Special Master was selected&para;<br>by California to run its prisons, and the fact that they may&para;<br>be experts in the field of prison reform does not justify the&para;<br>judicial imposition of their perspectives on the state.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

The Dis&para;<br>trict Court, it says, “may grant such a request provided&para;<br>that the State satisfies necessary and appropriate precon&para;<br>ditions designed to ensure the measures are taken to&para;<br>implement the plan without undue delay”; and it gives&para;<br>vague suggestions of what these preconditions “may in&para;<br>clude,” such as “interim benchmarks.” Ante, at 47. It also&para;<br>invites the District Court to “consider whether it is appro&para;<br>priate to order the State to begin without delay to develop&para;<br>a system to identify prisoners who are unlikely to reof&para;<br>fend,” and informs the State that it “should devise systems&para;<br>to select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public&para;<br>safety.” Ibid.

If it is nothing but a polite reminder to&para;<br>the State and to the District Court that the injunction is&para;<br>subject to modification, then it is entirely unnecessary. As&para;<br>both the State and the District Court are undoubtedly&para;<br>aware, a party is always entitled to move to modify an&para;<br>equitable decree, and the PLRA contains an express provi&para;<br>sion authorizing District Courts to modify or terminate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Such a warning, if successful, would achieve&para;<br>the benefit of a marginal reduction in the inevitable mur&para;<br>ders, robberies, and rapes to be committed by the released&para;<br>inmates. But it would achieve that at the expense of in&para;<br>tellectual bankruptcy, as the Court’s “warning” is entirely alien to ordinary principles of appellate review of&para;<br>injunctions. When a party moves for modification of&para;<br>an injunction, the district court is entitled to rule on that&para;<br>motion first, subject to review for abuse of discretion if it&para;<br>declines to modify the order. Horne v. Flores, 557 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10, 20). Moreover, when a&para;<br>district court enters a new decree with new benchmarks,&para;<br>the selection of those benchmarks is also reviewed under&para;<br>a deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of review—a&para;<br>point the Court appears to recognize. Ante, at 45. Appel&para;<br>late courts are not supposed to “affirm” injunctions while&para;<br>preemptively noting that the State “may” request, and the&para;<br>District Court “may” grant, a request to extend the State’s&para;<br>deadline to release prisoners by three years based on some&para;<br>suggestions on what appropriate preconditions for such a&para;<br>modification “may” include.&para;<br>Of course what is really happening here is that the&para;<br>Court, overcome by common sense, disapproves of the&para;<br>results reached by the District Court, but cannot remedy&para;<br>them (it thinks) by applying ordinary standards of appel&para;<br>late review. It has therefore selected a solution unknown&para;<br>in our legal system: A deliberately ambiguous set of sug&para;<br>gestions on how to modify the injunction, just deferential&para;<br>enough so that it can say with a straight face that it is&para;<br>“affirming,” just stern enough to put the District Court on&para;<br>notice that it will likely get reversed if it does not follow&para;<br>them. In doing this, the Court has aggrandized itself,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>grasping authority that appellate courts are not supposed&para;<br>to have, and using it to enact a compromise solution with&para;<br>no legal basis other than the Court’s say-so. That we are&para;<br>driven to engage in these extralegal activities should be a&para;<br>sign that the entire project of permitting district courts to&para;<br>run prison systems is misbegotten.&para;<br>But perhaps I am being too unkind. The Court, or at&para;<br>least a majority of the Court’s majority, must be aware&para;<br>that the judges of the District Court are likely to call its&para;<br>bluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly be an&para;<br>abuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State’s proposed&para;<br>modifications in an injunction that has just been approved&para;<br>(affirmed) in its present form. An injunction, after all,&para;<br>does not have to be perfect; only good enough for govern&para;<br>ment work, which the Court today says this is. So perhaps&para;<br>the coda is nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the&para;<br>hands—making it clear for all to see, that if the terrible&para;<br>things sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous&para;<br>order do happen, they will be none of this Court’s respon&para;<br>sibility. After all, did we not want, and indeed even sug&para;<br>gest, something better?&para;<br>III&para;<br>In view of the incoherence of the Eighth Amendment&para;<br>claim at the core of this case, the nonjudicial features of&para;<br>institutional reform litigation that this case exemplifies,&para;<br>and the unique concerns associated with mass prisoner&para;<br>releases, I do not believe this Court can affirm this injunc&para;<br>tion. I will state my approach briefly: In my view, a court&para;<br>may not order a prisoner’s release unless it determines&para;<br>that the prisoner is suffering from a violation of his consti&para;<br>tutional rights, and that his release, and no other relief,&para;<br>will remedy that violation. Thus, if the court determines&para;<br>that a particular prisoner is being denied constitutionally&para;<br>required medical treatment, and the release of that pris&para;<br>oner (and no other remedy) would enable him to obtain&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>medical treatment, then the court can order his release;&para;<br>but a court may not order the release of prisoners who&para;<br>have suffered no violations of their constitutional rights,&para;<br>merely to make it less likely that that will happen to them&para;<br>in the future.&para;<br>This view follows from the PLRA’s text that I discussed&para;<br>at the outset, 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). “[N]arrowly&para;<br>drawn” means that the relief applies only to the “particu&para;<br>lar [prisoner] or [prisoners]” whose constitutional rights&para;<br>are violated; “extends no further than necessary” means&para;<br>that prisoners whose rights are not violated will not obtain&para;<br>relief; and “least intrusive means necessary to correct the&para;<br>violation of the Federal right” means that no other relief is&para;<br>available.*&para;<br>I acknowledge that this reading of the PLRA would se&para;<br>verely limit the circumstances under which a court could&para;<br>issue structural injunctions to remedy allegedly unconsti&para;<br>tutional prison conditions, although it would not eliminate&para;<br>them entirely. If, for instance, a class representing all&para;<br>prisoners in a particular institution alleged that the tem&para;<br>perature in their cells was so cold as to violate the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment, or that they were deprived of all exercise&para;<br>time, a court could enter a prisonwide injunction ordering&para;<br>that the temperature be raised or exercise time be pro&para;<br>vided. Still, my approach may invite the objection that the&para;<br>PLRA appears to contemplate structural injunctions in&para;<br>general and mass prisoner-release orders in particular.&para;<br>The statute requires courts to “give substantial weight to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Any doubt on this last score, at least as far as prisoner-release or&para;<br>ders are concerned, is eliminated by §3626(a)(3)(E) of the statute, which&para;<br>provides that to enter a prisoner-release order the court must find&para;<br>“by clear and convincing evidence that—&para;<br>(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right;&para;<br>and&para;<br>(ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.”&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

It also sets forth criteria under which&para;<br>courts may issue orders that have “the purpose or effect of&para;<br>reducing or limiting the prisoner population,” §3626(g)(4).&para;<br>I do not believe that objection carries the day. In addi&para;<br>tion to imposing numerous limitations on the ability of&para;<br>district courts to order injunctive relief with respect to&para;<br>prison conditions, the PLRA states that “[n]othing in this&para;<br>section shall be construed to . . . repeal or detract from&para;<br>otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of&para;<br>the courts.” §3626(a)(1)(C). The PLRA is therefore best&para;<br>understood as an attempt to constrain the discretion of&para;<br>courts issuing structural injunctions—not as a mandate&para;<br>for their use. For the reasons I have outlined, structural&para;<br>injunctions, especially prisoner-release orders, raise grave&para;<br>separation-of-powers concerns and veer significantly from&para;<br>the historical role and institutional capability of courts.

First, the three-judge court improperly refused&para;<br>to consider evidence concerning present conditions in the&para;<br>California prison system. Second, the court erred in hold&para;<br>ing that no remedy short of a massive prisoner release can&para;<br>bring the California system into compliance with the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment. Third, the court gave inadequate&para;<br>weight to the impact of its decree on public safety.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Both the PLRA and general principles concerning in&para;<br>junctive relief dictate that a prisoner release order cannot&para;<br>properly be issued unless the relief is necessary to remedy&para;<br>an ongoing violation. Under the PLRA, a prisoner release&para;<br>may be decreed only if crowding “is the primary cause” of&para;<br>an Eighth Amendment violation and only if no other re&para;<br>lief “will remedy” the violation. §3626(a)(3)(E) (emphasis&para;<br>added). This language makes it clear that proof of past&para;<br>violations alone is insufficient to justify a court-ordered&para;<br>prisoner release.&para;<br>Similarly, in cases not governed by the PLRA, we have&para;<br>held that an inmate seeking an injunction to prevent a&para;<br>violation of the Eighth Amendment must show that prison&para;<br>officials are “knowingly and unreasonably disregarding an&para;<br>objectively intolerable risk of harm, and that they will&para;<br>continue to do so . . . into the future.” Farmer v. Brennan,&para;<br>511 U. S. 825, 846 (1994). The “deliberate indifference”&para;<br>needed to establish an Eighth Amendment violation must&para;<br>be examined “in light of the prison authorities’ current&para;<br>attitudes and conduct,” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25,&para;<br>36 (1993), which means “their attitudes and conduct at the&para;<br>time suit is brought and persisting thereafter,” Farmer,&para;<br>supra, at 845.&para;<br>For these reasons, the propriety of the relief ordered&para;<br>here cannot be assessed without ascertaining the nature&para;<br>and scope of any ongoing constitutional violations. Proof&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of past violations will not do; nor is it sufficient simply&para;<br>to establish that some violations continue. The scope of&para;<br>permissible relief depends on the scope of any continuing&para;<br>violations, and therefore it was essential for the three&para;<br>judge court to make a reliable determination of the extent&para;<br>of any violations as of the time its release order was is&para;<br>sued. Particularly in light of the radical nature of its&para;<br>chosen remedy, nothing less than an up-to-date assess&para;<br>ment was tolerable.&para;<br>The three-judge court, however, relied heavily on out&para;<br>dated information and findings and refused to permit&para;<br>California to introduce new evidence. Despite evidence of&para;<br>improvement,1 the three-judge court relied on old findings&para;<br>made by the single-judge courts, see Juris.

Instead, it based its remedy on constitutional defi&para;<br>ciencies that, in its own words, were found “years ago.”&para;<br>Ibid.2&para;<br>The three-judge court justified its refusal to receive up&para;<br>to-date evidence on the ground that the State had not filed&para;<br>a motion to terminate prospective relief under a provision&para;<br>of the PLRA, §3626(b).

Today’s&para;<br>opinion for this Court endorses that reasoning, ante, at 26.&para;<br>But the State’s opportunity to file such a motion did not&para;<br>eliminate the three-judge court’s obligation to ensure that&para;<br>its relief was necessary to remedy ongoing violations.3&para;<br>Moreover, the lower court’s reasoning did not properly&para;<br>take into account the potential significance of the evidence&para;<br>that the State sought to introduce. Even if that evidence&para;<br>did not show that all violations had ceased—the showing&para;<br>needed to obtain the termination of relief under&para;<br>§3626(b)—that evidence was highly relevant with respect&para;<br>to the nature and scope of permissible relief.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 For&para;<br>&para;<br>this reason, it is simply not the case that “evidence of current&para;<br>conditions . . . informed every aspect of the judgment of the three-judge&para;<br>court,” as the majority insists, ante, at 25.&para;<br>3 Because the Ninth Circuit places the burden on the State to prove&para;<br>the absence of an ongoing violation when it moves to terminate pro&para;<br>spective relief, see Gilmore v. California, 220 F. 3d 987, 1007 (CA9&para;<br>2000), even if the State had unsuccessfully moved to terminate pro&para;<br>spective relief under 18 U. S. C. §3626(b), there would still have been no&para;<br>determination that plaintiffs had carried their burden under the PLRA&para;<br>to establish by clear and convincing evidence that a prisoner release&para;<br>order is necessary to correct an ongoing rights violation.&para;<br>4 It is also no answer to say, as the Court now does, ante, at 26, that&para;<br>the State had the opportunity to resist the convening of the three-judge&para;<br>court on the ground that there were no unremedied constitutional&para;<br>violations as of that date. See §3626(a)(3)(A)(i). The District Courts&para;<br>granted plaintiffs’ motions to convene a three-judge court in 2007, three&para;<br>years before the remedial decree here was issued. Thus, the conditions&para;<br>in the prison system as of the date when the decree was issued were not&para;<br>necessarily the same as those that existed before the three-judge court&para;<br>proceedings began. Moreover, as noted above, even if all of the viola&para;<br>tions in the system had not been cured at the time of the remedial&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

With the safety of the people of California in&para;<br>the balance, the record on this issue should not have been&para;<br>closed.&para;<br>The majority repeats the lower court’s error of reciting&para;<br>statistics that are clearly out of date. The Court notes&para;<br>the lower court’s finding that as of 2005 “an inmate in one&para;<br>of California’s prisons needlessly dies every six to seven&para;<br>days.” See ante, at 9. Yet by the date of the trial before&para;<br>the three-judge court, the death rate had been trending&para;<br>downward for 10 quarters, App. 2257, and the number of&para;<br>likely preventable deaths fell from 18 in 2006 to 3 in 2007,&para;<br>a decline of 83 percent.5 Between 2001 and 2007, the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>decree, an accurate assessment of conditions as of that date was essen&para;<br>tial in order to ensure that the relief did not sweep more broadly than&para;<br>necessary.&para;<br>5 2008 Death Reviews 22.

The&para;<br>population of the California prison system (156,000 in&para;<br>mates at the time of trial) is larger than that of many&para;<br>medium-sized cities,7 and an examination of the medical&para;<br>care provided to the residents of many such cities would&para;<br>likely reveal cases in which grossly deficient treatment&para;<br>was provided.

This argu&para;<br>ment is implausible on its face and is not supported by the&para;<br>requisite clear and convincing evidence.&para;<br>It is instructive to consider the list of deficiencies in the&para;<br>California prison health care system that are highlighted&para;<br>in today’s opinion for this Court and in the opinion of the&para;<br>court below. The deficiencies noted by the majority here&para;<br>include the following: “ ‘[e]xam tables and counter tops,&para;<br>where prisoners with . . . communicable diseases are&para;<br>treated, [are] not routinely disinfected,’ ” ante, at 10; medi&para;<br>cal facilities “ ‘are in an abysmal state of disrepair,’ ” ibid.;&para;<br>medications “ ‘are too often not available when needed,’ ”&para;<br>ante, at 10–11; “ ‘[b]asic medical equipment is often not&para;<br>available or used,’ ” ante, at 10; prisons “would ‘hire any&para;<br>doctor who had “a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,” ’ ”&para;<br>ibid.; and medical and mental health staff positions have&para;<br>high vacancy rates, ante, at 20. The three-judge court&para;<br>pointed to similar problems. See Juris. App. 93a–121a&para;<br>(citing, among other things, staffing vacancies, too few&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Without&para;<br>taking that radical and dangerous step, exam tables and&para;<br>counter tops cannot properly be disinfected? None of the&para;<br>system’s dilapidated facilities can be repaired?

A better&para;<br>records management system cannot be developed and&para;<br>implemented?&para;<br>I do not dispute that general overcrowding contributes to&para;<br>many of the California system’s healthcare problems. But&para;<br>it by no means follows that reducing overcrowding is the&para;<br>only or the best or even a particularly good way to allevi&para;<br>ate those problems. Indeed, it is apparent that the pris&para;<br>oner release ordered by the court below is poorly suited for&para;<br>this purpose. The release order is not limited to prisoners&para;<br>needing substantial medical care but instead calls for a&para;<br>reduction in the system’s overall population. Under the&para;<br>order issued by the court below, it is not necessary for&para;<br>a single prisoner in the plaintiff classes to be released.&para;<br>Although some class members will presumably be among&para;<br>those who are discharged, the decrease in the number of&para;<br>prisoners needing mental health treatment or other forms&para;<br>of extensive medical care will be much smaller than the&para;<br>total number of prisoners released, and thus the release&para;<br>will produce at best only a modest improvement in the&para;<br>burden on the medical care system.&para;<br>The record bears this out. The Special Master stated&para;<br>dramatically that even releasing 100,000 inmates (two&para;<br>thirds of the California system’s entire inmate popula&para;<br>tion!) would leave the problem of providing mental health&para;<br>treatment “largely unmitigated.” App. 487. Similarly, the&para;<br>Receiver proclaimed that “ ‘those . . . who think that popu&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lation controls will solve California’s prison health care&para;<br>problems . . . are simply wrong.’ ” Juris. App. 282a.&para;<br>The State proposed several remedies other than a mas&para;<br>sive release of prisoners, but the three-judge court, seem&para;<br>ingly intent on attacking the broader problem of general&para;<br>overcrowding, rejected all of the State’s proposals. In&para;<br>doing so, the court made three critical errors.&para;<br>First, the court did not assess those proposals and other&para;<br>remedies in light of conditions proved to exist at the time&para;<br>the release order was framed. Had more recent evidence&para;<br>been taken into account, a less extreme remedy might&para;<br>have been shown to be sufficient.&para;<br>Second, the court failed to distinguish between condi&para;<br>tions that fall below the level that may be desirable as a&para;<br>matter of public policy and conditions that do not meet the&para;<br>minimum level mandated by the Constitution. To take&para;<br>one example, the court criticized the California system&para;<br>because prison doctors must conduct intake exams in&para;<br>areas separated by folding screens rather than in separate&para;<br>rooms, creating conditions that “do not allow for appropri&para;<br>ate confidentiality.” Id., at 88a. But the legitimate pri&para;<br>vacy expectations of inmates are greatly diminished, see&para;<br>Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 525–526 (1984), and this&para;<br>Court has never suggested that the failure to provide&para;<br>private consultation rooms in prisons amounts to cruel&para;<br>and unusual punishment.&para;<br>Third, the court rejected alternatives that would not&para;<br>have provided “ ‘immediate’ ” relief. Juris. App. 148a. But&para;<br>nothing in the PLRA suggests that public safety may be&para;<br>sacrificed in order to implement an immediate remedy&para;<br>rather than a less dangerous one that requires a more&para;<br>extended but reasonable period of time.&para;<br>If the three-judge court had not made these errors, it is&para;<br>entirely possible that an adequate but less drastic reme&para;<br>dial plan could have been crafted.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>might provide, and in any event, that is not a task that&para;<br>should be undertaken in the first instance by this Court.&para;<br>But possible components of such a plan are not hard to&para;<br>identify.&para;<br>Many of the problems noted above plainly could be&para;<br>addressed without releasing prisoners and without in&para;<br>curring the costs associated with a large-scale prison&para;<br>construction program. Sanitary procedures could be im&para;<br>proved; sufficient supplies of medicine and medical&para;<br>equipment could be purchased; an adequate system of&para;<br>records management could be implemented; and the num&para;<br>ber of medical and other staff positions could be increased.&para;<br>Similarly, it is hard to believe that staffing vacancies&para;<br>cannot be reduced or eliminated and that the qualifica&para;<br>tions of medical personnel cannot be improved by any&para;<br>means short of a massive prisoner release. Without spe&para;<br>cific findings backed by hard evidence, this Court should&para;<br>not accept the counterintuitive proposition that these&para;<br>problems cannot be ameliorated by increasing salaries,&para;<br>improving working conditions, and providing better train&para;<br>ing and monitoring of performance.&para;<br>While the cost of a large-scale construction program&para;<br>may well exceed California’s current financial capabilities,&para;<br>a more targeted program, involving the repair and per&para;<br>haps the expansion of current medical facilities (as op&para;<br>posed to general prison facilities), might be manageable.&para;<br>After all, any remedy in this case, including the new pro&para;<br>grams associated with the prisoner release order and&para;<br>other proposed relief now before the three-judge court, will&para;<br>necessarily involve some state expenditures.&para;<br>Measures such as these might be combined with tar&para;<br>geted reductions in critical components of the State’s&para;<br>prison population. A certain number of prisoners in the&para;<br>classes on whose behalf the two cases were brought might&para;<br>be transferred to out-of-state facilities. The three-judge&para;<br>court rejected the State’s proposal to transfer prisoners to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>out-of-state facilities in part because the number of pro&para;<br>posed transfers was too small. See id., at 160a. See also&para;<br>ante, at 30. But this reasoning rested on the court’s insis&para;<br>tence on a reduction in the State’s general prison popula&para;<br>tion rather than the two plaintiff classes.&para;<br>When the State proposed to make a targeted transfer of&para;<br>prisoners in one of the plaintiff classes (i.e., prisoners&para;<br>needing mental health treatment), one of the District&para;<br>Judges blocked the transfers for fear that the out-of-state&para;<br>facilities would not provide a sufficiently high level of care.&para;<br>See App. 434–440. The District Judge even refused to&para;<br>allow out-of-state transfers for prisoners who volunteered&para;<br>for relocation. See id., at 437. And the court did this even&para;<br>though there was not even an allegation, let alone clear&para;<br>evidence, that the States to which these prisoners would&para;<br>have been sent were violating the Eighth Amendment.&para;<br>The District Judge presumed that the receiving States&para;<br>might fail to provide constitutionally adequate care, but&para;<br>“ ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts&para;<br>presume that [public officers] have properly discharged&para;<br>their official duties.’ ” United States v. Armstrong, 517&para;<br>U. S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting United States v. Chemical&para;<br>Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14–15 (1926)); Postal Service&para;<br>v. Gregory, 534 U.

But the PLRA does not apply when the State&para;<br>voluntarily conducts such transfers, as it has sought to do.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. 2915:12–15 (Feb. 3, 2009). The three-judge&para;<br>court rejected this proposal, and its response exemplified&para;<br>what went wrong in this case. One judge complained that&para;<br>this remedy would be deficient because it would protect&para;<br>only the members of the plaintiff classes. The judge&para;<br>stated:&para;<br>“The only thing is we would be protecting the class&para;<br>members. And maybe that’s the appropriate thing to&para;<br>do. I mean, that’s what this case is about, but it&para;<br>would be . . . difficult for me to say yes, and the hell&para;<br>with everybody else.” Id., at 2915:23–2916:2.&para;<br>Overstepping his authority, the judge was not content to&para;<br>provide relief for the classes of plaintiffs on whose behalf&para;<br>the suit before him was brought. Nor was he content to&para;<br>remedy the only constitutional violations that were&para;<br>proved—which concerned the treatment of the members of&para;<br>those classes. Instead, the judge saw it as his responsibil&para;<br>ity to attack the general problem of overcrowding.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Before ordering any prisoner release, the PLRA com&para;<br>mands a court to “give substantial weight to any adverse&para;<br>impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal&para;<br>justice system caused by the relief.” §3626(a)(1)(A). This&para;<br>provision unmistakably reflects Congress’ view that pris&para;<br>oner release orders are inherently risky.&para;<br>In taking this view, Congress was well aware of the&para;<br>impact of previous prisoner release orders. The prisoner&para;<br>release program carried out a few years earlier in Phila&para;<br>delphia is illustrative. In the early 1990’s, federal courts&para;<br>enforced a cap on the number of inmates in the Philadel&para;<br>phia prison system, and thousands of inmates were set&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. PLATA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>free. Although efforts were made to release only those&para;<br>prisoners who were least likely to commit violent crimes,&para;<br>that attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful. During an&para;<br>18-month period, the Philadelphia police rearrested thou&para;<br>sands of these prisoners for committing 9,732 new crimes.&para;<br>Those defendants were charged with 79 murders, 90&para;<br>rapes, 1,113 assaults, 959 robberies, 701 burglaries, and&para;<br>2,748 thefts, not to mention thousands of drug offenses.9&para;<br>Members of Congress were well aware of this experience.10&para;<br>Despite the record of past prisoner release orders, the&para;<br>three-judge court in this case concluded that loosing&para;<br>46,000 criminals would not produce a tally like that in&para;<br>Philadelphia and would actually improve public safety.&para;<br>Juris. App. 248a–249a. In reaching this debatable con&para;<br>clusion, the three-judge court relied on the testimony of&para;<br>selected experts, id., at 248a, and the majority now defers&para;<br>to what it characterizes as the lower court’s findings of&para;<br>fact on this controversial public policy issue, ante, at 15,&para;<br>19–20, 24.&para;<br>This is a fundamental and dangerous error.
