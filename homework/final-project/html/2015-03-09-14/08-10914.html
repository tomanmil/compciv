OFFICER GADDY&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–10914.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided February 22, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>In Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992), this&para;<br>Court held that “the use of excessive physical force against&para;<br>a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment&para;<br>[even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.” In&para;<br>this case, the District Court dismissed a prisoner’s exces&para;<br>sive force claim based entirely on its determination that&para;<br>his injuries were “de minimis.” Because the District&para;<br>Court’s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with&para;<br>Hudson’s direction to decide excessive force claims based&para;<br>on the nature of the force rather than the extent of the&para;<br>injury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judg&para;<br>ment is reversed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In March 2008, petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North&para;<br>Carolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Western District of North Carolina&para;<br>pursuant to 42 U. S. C. §1983. Wilkins’ pro se complaint&para;<br>alleged that, on June 13, 2007, he was “maliciously and&para;<br>sadistically” assaulted “[w]ithout any provocation” by a&para;<br>corrections officer, respondent Gaddy.1 App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. C–4. According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently&para;<br>angered by Wilkins’ request for a grievance form,&para;<br>“snatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto&para;<br>the concrete floor.” Ibid. Gaddy “then proceeded to punch,&para;<br>kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>materials in the record do not disclose Gaddy’s full name.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WILKINS v. GADDY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>physically remove him from [Wilkins].” Ibid. Wilkins&para;<br>further alleged that, “[a]s a result of the excessive force&para;<br>used by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries&para;<br>including a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood&para;<br>pressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness”&para;<br>and “psychological trauma and mental anguish including&para;<br>depression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>The District Court, on its own motion and without a&para;<br>response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins’ complaint for&para;<br>failure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court&para;<br>stated that, “[i]n order to state an excessive force claim&para;<br>under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish&para;<br>that he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.” No.&para;<br>3:08–cv–00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp. 1, 2 (citing&para;<br>Taylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v.&para;<br>Dorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); foot&para;<br>note omitted). According to the court, Wilkins’ alleged&para;<br>injuries were no more severe than those deemed de mini&para;<br>mis in the Circuit’s Taylor and Riley decisions. Indeed,&para;<br>the court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his inju&para;<br>ries had required medical attention.&para;<br>In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he&para;<br>was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment&para;<br>might prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been&para;<br>prescribed, and continued to take, medication for his&para;<br>headaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And&para;<br>he attached medical records purporting to corroborate his&para;<br>injuries and course of treatment.&para;<br>Describing reconsideration as “an extraordinary rem&para;<br>edy,” the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No.&para;<br>3:08–cv–00138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p. 1. The medical&para;<br>records, the court observed, indicated that some of Wil&para;<br>kins’ alleged injuries “were pre-existing conditions.” Id.,&para;<br>at 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pres&para;<br>sure and mental health issues even before the assault.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray&para;<br>after the incident “to examine his ‘bruised heel,’ ” but it&para;<br>“note[d] that bruising is generally considered a de mini&para;<br>mus [sic] injury.” Id., at 4. The court similarly character&para;<br>ized as de minimis Wilkins’ complaints of back pain and&para;<br>headaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his&para;<br>complaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals affirmed “for the reasons stated by the district&para;<br>court.” No. 08–7881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In requiring what amounts to a showing of significant&para;<br>injury in order to state an excessive force claim, the&para;<br>Fourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this&para;<br>Court in Hudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner in Hudson&para;<br>filed suit under §1983 alleging that corrections officers&para;<br>had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had&para;<br>punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach&para;<br>without justification, resulting in “minor bruises and&para;<br>swelling of his face, mouth, and lip” as well as loosened&para;<br>teeth and a cracked partial dental plate. 503 U. S., at 4.&para;<br>A Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson’s favor,&para;<br>but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed,&para;<br>holding that an inmate must prove “a significant injury” in&para;<br>order to state an excessive force claim. Hudson v. McMil&para;<br>lian, 929 F. 2d 1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam). According&para;<br>to the Court of Appeals, Hudson’s injuries, which had not&para;<br>required medical attention, were too “minor” to warrant&para;<br>relief. Ibid.&para;<br>Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the&para;<br>notion that “significant injury” is a threshold requirement&para;<br>for stating an excessive force claim. The “core judicial&para;<br>inquiry,” we held, was not whether a certain quantum of&para;<br>injury was sustained, but rather “whether force was ap&para;<br>plied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore disci&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WILKINS v. GADDY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>pline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” 503&para;<br>U. S., at 7; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319–&para;<br>321 (1986). “When prison officials maliciously and sadisti&para;<br>cally use force to cause harm,” the Court recognized, “con&para;<br>temporary standards of decency always are violated . . .&para;<br>whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise,&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical pun&para;<br>ishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting&para;<br>less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.” Hudson, 503&para;<br>U. S., at 9; see also id., at 13–14 (Blackmun, J., concurring&para;<br>in judgment) (“The Court today appropriately puts to rest&para;<br>a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an exces&para;<br>sive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amend&para;<br>ment only when coupled with ‘significant injury,’ e.g.,&para;<br>injury that requires medical attention or leaves perma&para;<br>nent marks”).&para;<br>This is not to say that the “absence of serious injury” is&para;<br>irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Id., at 7.&para;<br>“[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor&para;<br>that may suggest ‘whether the use of force could plausibly&para;<br>have been thought necessary’ in a particular situation.”&para;<br>Ibid. (quoting Whitley, 475 U. S., at 321). The extent of&para;<br>injury may also provide some indication of the amount of&para;<br>force applied. As we stated in Hudson, not “every malevo&para;<br>lent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of&para;<br>action.” 503 U. S., at 9. “The Eighth Amendment’s prohi&para;<br>bition of ‘cruel and unusual’ punishments necessarily&para;<br>excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses&para;<br>of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a&para;<br>sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” Ibid. (some&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who com&para;<br>plains of a “push or shove” that causes no discernible&para;<br>injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force&para;<br>claim. Ibid. (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028,&para;<br>1033 (CA2 1973)).&para;<br>Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly corre&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>lated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts. An in&para;<br>mate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose&para;<br>his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely be&para;<br>cause he has the good fortune to escape without serious&para;<br>injury. Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that&para;<br>the supposedly “minor” nature of the injuries “provide[d]&para;<br>no basis for dismissal of [Hudson’s] §1983 claim” because&para;<br>“the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,&para;<br>swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are&para;<br>not de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.” 503&para;<br>U. S., at 10.&para;<br>The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite&para;<br>similar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Court’s&para;<br>analysis closely resembles the approach Hudson dis&para;<br>avowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked,&para;<br>kneed, choked, and body slammed “maliciously and sadis&para;<br>tically” and “[w]ithout any provocation.” Dismissing Wil&para;<br>kins’ action sua sponte, the District Court did not hold that&para;<br>this purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a&para;<br>bruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medi&para;<br>cal treatment, involved de minimis force. Instead, the&para;<br>court concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim&para;<br>because “he simply has not alleged that he suffered any&para;<br>thing more than de minimus [sic] injury.” No. 3:08–cv–&para;<br>00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at 2.&para;<br>In giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis&para;<br>nature of Wilkins’ injuries, the District Court relied on two&para;<br>Fourth Circuit cases. See Riley, 115 F. 3d, at 1166–1168;&para;<br>Taylor, 155 F. 3d, at 483–485. Those cases, in turn, were&para;<br>based upon the Fourth Circuit’s earlier decision in Nor&para;<br>man v. Taylor, 25 F. 3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which&para;<br>approved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.&para;<br>According to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson “does not fore&para;<br>close and indeed is consistent with [the] view . . . that,&para;<br>absent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff&para;<br>cannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WILKINS v. GADDY&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>claim if his injuries are de minimis.” 25 F. 3d, at 1263.&para;<br>The Fourth Circuit’s strained reading of Hudson is not&para;<br>defensible. This Court’s decision did not, as the Fourth&para;<br>Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury&para;<br>threshold for excessive force claims from “significant” to&para;<br>“non-de minimis”—whatever those ill-defined terms might&para;<br>mean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the “core judicial&para;<br>inquiry” from the extent of the injury to the nature of the&para;<br>force—specifically, whether it was nontrivial and “was&para;<br>applied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.”&para;<br>503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did&para;<br>here, that the absence of “some arbitrary quantity of&para;<br>injury” requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force&para;<br>claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id., at 9.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Most&para;<br>&para;<br>Circuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Cir&para;<br>cuit’s de minimis injury requirement. See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554&para;<br>F. 3d 255, 269–270 (CA2 2009) (“[O]ur Court has reversed summary&para;<br>dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where&para;<br>the plaintiff’s evidence of injury was slight . . . . [T]he absence of any&para;<br>significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment&para;<br>inquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of&para;<br>such injury if the defendant’s use of force was malicious or sadistic”);&para;<br>Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648–649 (CA3 2002) (“[T]he Eighth&para;<br>Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the&para;<br>circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . .&para;<br>[D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force”);&para;<br>Oliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view “that&para;<br>to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must&para;<br>have suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical&para;<br>injury” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee,&para;<br>439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement&para;<br>with the Fourth Circuit’s approach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163&para;<br>F. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (“[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive&para;<br>force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a&para;<br>more than de minimis injury”). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d&para;<br>384, 386 (2006) (“This Court has never directly held that injuries must&para;<br>reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force&para;<br>claim”).

The Court adhered to this understanding&para;<br>until 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429&para;<br>U.

See generally Hudson, supra, at 18–20&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (THOMAS,&para;<br>J., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expan&para;<br>sion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new inter&para;<br>pretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to&para;<br>every deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should&para;<br>apply “only [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving&para;<br>‘serious’ injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a&para;<br>culpable state of mind.” Hudson, supra, at 20 (THOMAS,&para;<br>J., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally&para;<br>Wilson v.
