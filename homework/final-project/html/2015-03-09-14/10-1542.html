MARTINEZ &para;<br>&para;<br>GUTIERREZ &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1542. Argued January 18, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012*&para;<br>Title 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a) authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the&para;<br>removal of an alien from the United States who, among other things,&para;<br>has held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least&para;<br>five years, §1229b(a)(1), and has lived in the United States for at&para;<br>least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, §1229b(a)(2).&para;<br>These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA&para;<br>or Board) should impute a parent’s years of continuous residence or&para;<br>LPR status to his or her child. That issue arises because a child may&para;<br>enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his&para;<br>parents does—meaning that a parent may satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or&para;<br>§1229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not. In&para;<br>In re Escobar, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien&para;<br>must meet §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own. But the Ninth Circuit found the Board’s position unreasonable, holding that&para;<br>§1229b(a)(1) and §1229b(a)(2) require imputation. See MercadoZazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102; Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430&para;<br>F. 3d 1013.&para;<br>Respondent Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the country with&para;<br>his family in 1989, when he was 5 years old. Martinez Gutierrez’s father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.&para;<br>But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR&para;<br>status until 2003. Two years after that, he was apprehended for&para;<br>smuggling undocumented aliens across the border. Admitting the offense, he sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 10–1543, Holder, Attorney General v. Sawyers,&para;<br>also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his&para;<br>father’s immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could&para;<br>not satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his own. Relying on Escobar, the BIA reversed. The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez&para;<br>Gutierrez’s petition for review and remanded the case to the Board&para;<br>for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions.&para;<br>Respondent Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October&para;<br>1995, when he was 15 years old. At that time, his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After Sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in August&para;<br>2002, the Government began removal proceedings. The Immigration&para;<br>Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he&para;<br>could not satisfy §1229b(a)(2). The BIA affirmed, and Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review. There, he argued that the Board&para;<br>should have counted his mother’s years of residency while he was a&para;<br>minor toward §1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year continuous-residency requirement. The Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the&para;<br>case to the BIA.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The BIA’s rejection of imputation is based on a permissible construction of §1229b(a). Pp. 6–13.&para;<br>(a) The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own, without relying&para;<br>on a parent’s years of continuous residence or immigration status.&para;<br>That position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute,&para;<br>whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a&para;<br>court might think best. See e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11. The&para;<br>BIA’s approach satisfies this standard.&para;<br>The Board’s position is consistent with the statute’s text. Section&para;<br>1229b(a) does not mention—much less require—imputation. Instead,&para;<br>it simply calls for “the alien” to meet the prerequisites for cancellation of removal. See §§1101(a)(13)(A) and (a)(33). Respondents contend that this language does not foreclose imputation, but even if so,&para;<br>that is not enough to require the Board to adopt that policy. Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>(b) Neither does the statute’s history and context mandate imputation. Section 1229b(a) replaced former §212(c) of the Immigration&para;<br>and Nationality Act (INA), which allowed the Attorney General to&para;<br>prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained&para;<br>a “lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this&para;<br>country. Like §1229b(a), §212(c) was silent on imputation. But every&para;<br>Court of Appeals that confronted the question concluded that, in determining eligibility for §212(c) relief, the Board should impute a&para;<br>parent’s years of domicile to his or her child. Based on this history,&para;<br>Sawyers contends that Congress would have understood §1229b(a)’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>language to provide for imputation. But in enacting §1229b(a), Congress eliminated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals&para;<br>courts had founded their imputation decisions. And the doctrine of&para;<br>congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a&para;<br>statute without relevant change. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349.&para;<br>Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation. As respondents&para;<br>correctly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the&para;<br>goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with&para;<br>strong ties to this country. But these are not the INA’s only goals,&para;<br>and Congress did not pursue them at all costs. For example, aliens&para;<br>convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of&para;<br>removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see&para;<br>§1229b(a)(3). In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with&para;<br>LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.&para;<br>A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because&para;<br>that rule would be family-friendly. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the&para;<br>Board’s position is not entitled to Chevron deference. First, they&para;<br>claim that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a) is arbitrary because it is&para;<br>inconsistent with the Board’s acceptance of imputation under other,&para;<br>similar provisions that are silent on the matter. See §1182(k) and&para;<br>§1181(b). But the Board’s decision in Escobar provided a reasoned&para;<br>explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters&para;<br>involving an alien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective&para;<br>conditions or characteristics. See 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 233–234, and&para;<br>n. 4. Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration&para;<br>status and place of residence. See id., at 233. So the Board’s&para;<br>approach to §1229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward&para;<br>distinction.&para;<br>Second, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation&para;<br>rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice. But&para;<br>Escobar belies this contention.&para;<br>The Board did explain how&para;<br>§1229b(a)’s text supports its no-imputation policy. But the Board also brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It noted that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or&para;<br>residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a)&para;<br>would create anomalies in the statutory scheme. Escobar thus expressed the BIA’s view that statutory text, administrative practice,&para;<br>and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation. In&para;<br>making that case, the opinion reads like a multitude of agency interpretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.&para;<br>Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>No. 10–1542, 411 Fed.

S. C. §1229b(a), authorizes&para;<br>the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien&para;<br>from the United States so long as the alien satisfies certain criteria. One of those criteria relates to the length of&para;<br>time an alien has lawfully resided in the United States,&para;<br>and another to the length of time he has held permanent&para;<br>resident status here. We consider whether the Board of&para;<br>Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) could reasonably&para;<br>conclude that an alien living in this country as a child&para;<br>must meet those requirements on his own, without counting a parent’s years of residence or immigration status.&para;<br>We hold that the BIA’s approach is based on a permissible&para;<br>construction of the statute.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The immigration laws have long given the Attorney&para;<br>General discretion to permit certain otherwise-removable&para;<br>aliens to remain in the United States. See Judulang v.&para;<br>Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2–4). The&para;<br>Attorney General formerly exercised this authority by&para;<br>virtue of §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act&para;<br>(INA), 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), a provision with some lingering relevance here, see infra, at 7–9.&para;<br>But in 1996, Congress replaced §212(c) with §1229b(a)&para;<br>(2006 ed.). That new section, applicable to the cases before us, provides as follows:&para;<br>“(a) Cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents&para;<br>“The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case&para;<br>of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the&para;<br>United States if the alien—&para;<br>“(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years,&para;<br>“(2) has resided in the United States continuously&para;<br>for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and&para;<br>“(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.” Ibid.&para;<br>Section 1229b(a) thus specifies the criteria that make an&para;<br>alien eligible to obtain relief from the Attorney General.&para;<br>The first paragraph requires that the alien have held the&para;<br>status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least&para;<br>five years. And the second adds that the alien must have&para;<br>lived in the United States for at least seven continuous&para;<br>years after a lawful admission, whether as an LPR or in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>some other immigration status.1 (The third paragraph is&para;<br>not at issue in these cases.)&para;<br>The question we consider here is whether, in applying&para;<br>this statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent’s&para;<br>years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her&para;<br>child. That question arises because a child may enter the&para;<br>country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of&para;<br>his parents does. A parent may therefore satisfy the requirements of §§1229b(a)(1) and (2), while his or her&para;<br>child, considered independently, does not. In these circumstances, is the child eligible for cancellation of removal?&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit, the first court of appeals to confront&para;<br>this issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief. See&para;<br>Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F. 3d 1013 (2005). Enrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents came to the United&para;<br>States illegally in 1985, when he was one year old. CuevasGaspar’s mother was lawfully admitted to the country&para;<br>in 1990, as an LPR. But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully&para;<br>admitted only in 1997, when he too received LPR status.&para;<br>That meant that when Cuevas-Gaspar committed a removable offense in 2002, he could not independently satisfy §1229b(a)(2)’s requirement of seven consecutive years of&para;<br>residence after a lawful entry.2 (The parties agreed that&para;<br>he just met §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year status requirement.) The&para;<br>Board deemed Cuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that&para;<br>account, but the Ninth Circuit found that position unrea——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>INA defines “admitted” as referring to “the lawful entry of&para;<br>the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by&para;<br>an immigration officer.” 8 U. S. C. §1101 (a)(13)(A). The 7-year clock of&para;<br>§1229b(a)(2) thus begins with an alien’s lawful entry.&para;<br>2 The 7-year clock stopped running on the date of Cuevas-Gaspar’s&para;<br>offense under a statutory provision known as the “stop-time” rule. See&para;<br>§1229b(d)(1) (“For purposes of this section, any period of continuous&para;<br>residence . . . in the United States shall be deemed to end . . . when the&para;<br>alien is served a notice to appear . . . or . . . when the alien has committed an offense . . . that renders the alien . . . removable from the United&para;<br>States . . . , whichever is earliest”).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sonable. According to the Court of Appeals, the Board&para;<br>should have “imputed” to Cuevas-Gaspar his mother’s&para;<br>years of continuous residence during the time he lived&para;<br>with her as an “unemancipated minor.” Id., at 1029. That&para;<br>approach, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, followed from both&para;<br>the INA’s “priorit[ization]” of familial relations and the&para;<br>Board’s “consistent willingness” to make imputations from&para;<br>a parent to a child in many areas of immigration law. Id.,&para;<br>at 1026.&para;<br>The Board responded by reiterating its opposition to&para;<br>imputation under both relevant paragraphs of §1229b(a).&para;<br>In In re Escobar, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 231 (2007), the Board&para;<br>considered whether a child could rely on a parent’s period&para;<br>of LPR status to satisfy §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year clock. The&para;<br>Board expressly “disagree[d] with the reasoning” of CuevasGaspar, rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s understanding of&para;<br>both the statute and the Board’s prior policies. 24 I. &amp; N.&para;<br>Dec., at 233–234, and n. 4. Accordingly, the Board announced that it would “decline to extend” Cuevas-Gaspar&para;<br>to any case involving §1229b(a)(1), and that it would&para;<br>ignore the decision even as to §1229b(a)(2) outside the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit. 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 235. A year later, in&para;<br>Matter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 599 (2008), the&para;<br>BIA took the final step: It rejected imputation under&para;<br>§1229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit, maintaining that the court should abandon Cuevas-Gaspar and&para;<br>defer to the Board’s intervening reasoned decision in&para;<br>Escobar. See Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 600–601&para;<br>(citing National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v.&para;<br>Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)).&para;<br>The BIA’s position on imputation touched off a split in&para;<br>the courts of appeals. The Third and Fifth Circuits both&para;<br>deferred to the BIA’s approach as a reasonable construction of §1229b(a). See Augustin v. Attorney Gen., 520 F. 3d&para;<br>264 (CA3 2008); Deus v. Holder, 591 F. 3d 807 (CA5 2009).&para;<br>But in Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102 (2009),&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit doubled down on its contrary view,&para;<br>declaring the BIA’s position unreasonable and requiring&para;<br>imputation under both §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2). See id.,&para;<br>at 1103 (“[T]he rationale and holding of Cuevas-Gaspar&para;<br>apply equally to the five-year permanent residence and&para;<br>the seven-year continuance residence requirements” of&para;<br>§1229b(a)).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Two cases are before us. In 1989, at the age of five,&para;<br>respondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered&para;<br>the United States with his family. Martinez Gutierrez’s&para;<br>father was lawfully admitted to the country two years&para;<br>later as an LPR. But Martinez Gutierrez himself was&para;<br>neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until&para;<br>2003. Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the&para;<br>border. He admitted the offense, and sought cancellation&para;<br>of removal. The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father’s&para;<br>immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez&para;<br>could not satisfy either §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his&para;<br>own. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, pp. 20a–&para;<br>22a (citing Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d 1013). The BIA&para;<br>reversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand,&para;<br>reaffirmed its disposition in an order relying on Escobar,&para;<br>see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, at 5a–6a. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez’s petition&para;<br>for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of the court’s contrary decisions. See&para;<br>411 Fed. Appx. 121 (2011).&para;<br>Respondent Damien Sawyers was lawfully admitted as&para;<br>an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At&para;<br>that time, his mother had already resided in the country&para;<br>for six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After&para;<br>Sawyers’s conviction of a drug offense in August 2002, the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Government initiated removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of&para;<br>removal because he was a few months shy of the seven&para;<br>years of continuous residence required under §1229b(a)(2).&para;<br>See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1543, p. 13a. (No one&para;<br>doubted that Sawyers had by that time held LPR status&para;<br>for five years, as required under §1229b(a)(1).) The Board&para;<br>affirmed, relying on its reasoning in Escobar. See In&para;<br>re Sawyers, No. A44 852 478, 2007 WL 4711443 (Dec.&para;<br>26, 2007). Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for&para;<br>review, arguing that the Board should have counted his&para;<br>mother’s years of residency while he was a minor toward&para;<br>§1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year requirement. As in Gutierrez, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the&para;<br>case to the BIA. See 399 Fed. Appx. 313 (2010).&para;<br>We granted the Government’s petitions for certiorari,&para;<br>564 U. S. ___ (2011), consolidated the cases, and now&para;<br>reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgments.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation&para;<br>of removal to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own,&para;<br>without counting a parent’s years of continuous residence&para;<br>or LPR status. That position prevails if it is a reasonable&para;<br>construction of the statute, whether or not it is the only&para;<br>possible interpretation or even the one a court might think&para;<br>best. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11&para;<br>(1984); see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415,&para;<br>424–425 (1999) (according Chevron deference to the&para;<br>Board’s interpretations of the INA). We think the BIA’s&para;<br>view on imputation meets that standard, and so need not&para;<br>decide if the statute permits any other construction.&para;<br>The Board’s approach is consistent with the statute’s&para;<br>text, as even respondents tacitly concede.&para;<br>Section&para;<br>1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>it. The provision calls for “the alien”—not, say, “the alien&para;<br>or one of his parents”—to meet the three prerequisites for&para;<br>cancellation of removal. Similarly, several of §1229b(a)’s&para;<br>other terms have statutory definitions referring to only a&para;<br>single individual. See, e.g., §1101(a)(13)(A) (“The terms&para;<br>‘admission’ and ‘admitted’ mean, with respect to an alien,&para;<br>the lawful entry of the alien into the United States” (emphasis added)); §1101(a)(33) (“The term ‘residence’ means&para;<br>the place of general abode; the place of general abode of&para;<br>a person means his principal, actual dwelling” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). Respondents contend that none of this language&para;<br>“forecloses” imputation: They argue that if the Board&para;<br>allowed imputation, “[t]he alien” seeking cancellation&para;<br>would “still have to satisfy the provision’s durational&para;<br>requirements”—just pursuant to a different computational&para;<br>rule. Brief for Respondent Martinez Gutierrez in No. 10–&para;<br>1542, p. 16 (hereinafter Martinez Gutierrez Brief); see&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Sawyers in No. 10–1543, pp. 11, 15&para;<br>(hereinafter Sawyers Brief). And they claim that the&para;<br>Board’s history of permitting imputation under similarly&para;<br>“silent” statutes supports this construction. Martinez&para;<br>Gutierrez Brief 16; see Sawyers Brief 15–16; infra, at 10–&para;<br>11. But even if so—even if the Board could adopt an&para;<br>imputation rule consistent with the statute’s text—that&para;<br>would not avail respondents. Taken alone, the language of&para;<br>§1229b(a) at least permits the Board to go the other way—&para;<br>to say that “the alien” must meet the statutory conditions&para;<br>independently, without relying on a parent’s history.&para;<br>For this reason, respondents focus on §1229b(a)’s history&para;<br>and context—particularly, the provision’s relationship to&para;<br>the INA’s former §212(c) and its associated imputation&para;<br>rule. Section 212(c)—§1229b(a)’s predecessor—generally&para;<br>allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an&para;<br>alien with LPR status who had maintained a “lawful&para;<br>unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this&para;<br>country. 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.). Like §1229b(a),&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§212(c) was silent on imputation. Yet the Second, Third,&para;<br>and Ninth Circuits (the only appellate courts to consider&para;<br>the question) concluded that, in determining eligibility for&para;<br>relief under §212(c), the Board should impute a parent’s&para;<br>years of domicile to his or her child. See Rosario v. INS,&para;<br>962 F. 2d 220 (CA2 1992); Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F. 3d&para;<br>1021, 1024–1026 (CA9 1994); Morel v. INS, 90 F. 3d 833,&para;<br>840–842 (CA3 1996). Those courts reasoned that at common law, a minor’s domicile was “the same as that of its&para;<br>parents, since most children are presumed not legally&para;<br>capable of forming the requisite intent to establish their&para;<br>own domicile.” Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; see Mississippi&para;<br>Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 48&para;<br>(1989) (defining “domicile” as “physical presence in a place&para;<br>in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one’s&para;<br>intent to remain there”). So by the time Congress replaced&para;<br>§212(c) with §1229b(a), the BIA often imputed a parent’s&para;<br>years of domicile to a child in determining eligibility for&para;<br>cancellation of removal. Sawyers argues that against this&para;<br>backdrop, Congress “would have understood the language&para;<br>it chose [in §1229b(a)] to provide for imputation.” Sawyers&para;<br>Brief 10.&para;<br>But we cannot conclude that Congress ratified an imputation requirement when it passed §1229b(a). As all parties&para;<br>agree, Congress enacted §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve&para;<br>an unrelated question about §212(c)’s meaning. See id.,&para;<br>at 17; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>25. Courts had differed on whether an alien’s “seven&para;<br>consecutive years” of domicile under §212(c) all had to&para;<br>post-date the alien’s obtaining LPR status. See CuevasGaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1027–1028 (canvassing split). Congress addressed that split by creating two distinct durational conditions: the 5-year status requirement of subsection (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an&para;<br>LPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of&para;<br>subsection (a)(2), which can include years preceding the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>acquisition of LPR status. In doing so, Congress eliminated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals courts&para;<br>had founded their imputation decisions. See supra, at 8.&para;<br>That alteration dooms respondents’ position, because the&para;<br>doctrine of congressional ratification applies only when&para;<br>Congress reenacts a statute without relevant change. See&para;<br>Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S.&para;<br>335, 349 (2005).3 So the statutory history here provides no&para;<br>basis for holding that the BIA flouted a congressional&para;<br>command in adopting its no-imputation policy.&para;<br>Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation here, as&para;<br>both respondents claim. According to Martinez Gutierrez,&para;<br>the BIA’s approach contradicts that statute’s objectives of&para;<br>“providing relief to aliens with strong ties to the United&para;<br>States” and “promoting family unity.” Martinez Gutierrez&para;<br>Brief 40, 44; see Sawyers Brief 37. We agree—indeed, we&para;<br>have stated—that the goals respondents identify underlie&para;<br>or inform many provisions of immigration law. See Fiallo&para;<br>v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 795, n. 6 (1977); INS v. Errico, 385&para;<br>U. S. 214, 220 (1966). But they are not the INA’s only&para;<br>goals, and Congress did not pursue them to the nth degree. To take one example, §1229b(a)’s third paragraph&para;<br>makes aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Sawyers contends that §1229b(a)(2)’s replacement term—“resided&para;<br>continuously”—is a “term of art” in the immigration context which&para;<br>incorporates “an intent component” and so means the same thing as&para;<br>“domiciled.” Sawyers Brief 25–26 (emphasis deleted). Thus, Sawyers&para;<br>argues, we should read §1229b(a) as reenacting §212(c) without meaningful change. See id., at 25. But even assuming that Congress could&para;<br>ratify judicial decisions based on the term “domicile” through a new&para;<br>statute using a synonym for that term, we do not think “resided continuously” qualifies. The INA defines “residence” as a person’s “principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent,” 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1101(a)(33) (emphasis added), and we find nothing to suggest that&para;<br>Congress added an intent element, inconsistent with that definition, by&para;<br>requiring that the residence have been maintained “continuously for 7&para;<br>years.”&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their&para;<br>family ties. See §1229b(a)(3). And more generally—as&para;<br>these very cases show—not every alien who obtains LPR&para;<br>status can immediately get the same for her spouse or&para;<br>minor children. See Brief for Petitioner 31–32, and n. 9&para;<br>(providing program-specific examples). We cannot read a&para;<br>silent statute as requiring (not merely allowing) imputation just because that rule would be family-friendly.&para;<br>Respondents’ stronger arguments take a different&para;<br>tack—that we should refuse to defer to the Board’s decision even assuming Congress placed the question of imputation in its hands. Respondents offer two main reasons.&para;<br>First, they contend that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a)&para;<br>cannot be squared with its acceptance of imputation under&para;<br>other, similar statutory provisions. This “wil[d]” and “ ‘[u]nexplained inconsistency,’ ” Sawyers asserts, is the very&para;<br>“paradigm of arbitrary agency action.” Sawyers Brief&para;<br>13, 41 (emphasis deleted); see Martinez Gutierrez Brief&para;<br>52–54. Second, they argue that the Board did not appreciate its own discretion over whether to allow imputation.&para;<br>The Board, they say, thought Congress had forbidden&para;<br>imputation, and so did not bring its “ ‘experience and&para;<br>expertise to bear’ ” on the issue. Id., at 31 (quoting PDK&para;<br>Labs. Inc. v. DEA, 362 F. 3d 786, 797 (CADC 2004)); see&para;<br>Sawyers Brief 38–39. These arguments are not insubstantial, but in the end neither persuades us to deny the Board&para;<br>the usual deference we accord to agency interpretations.&para;<br>Start with the claim of inconsistency. The BIA has&para;<br>indeed imputed parental attributes to children under&para;<br>other INA provisions that do not mention the matter.&para;<br>Section 1182(k), for example, enables the Attorney General to let certain inadmissible aliens into the country if he&para;<br>finds “that inadmissibility was not known to, and could&para;<br>not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable&para;<br>diligence by, the immigrant before the time of departure.”&para;<br>Like §1229b(a), that provision refers to a single person&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(“the immigrant”) and says nothing about imputation. But&para;<br>the BIA has consistently imputed a parent’s knowledge&para;<br>of inadmissibility (or lack thereof ) to a child. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Senica v. INS, 16 F. 3d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (“Therefore,&para;<br>the BIA reasoned, the children were not entitled to relief&para;<br>under [§1182(k)] because [their mother’s] knowledge was&para;<br>imputed to them”); In re Mushtaq, No. A43 968 082, 2007&para;<br>WL 4707539 (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007) (per curiam); In re Ahmed, No. A41 982 631, 2006 WL 448156 (BIA, Jan. 17,&para;<br>2006) (per curiam).&para;<br>Similarly, the Board imputes a parent’s abandonment&para;<br>(or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when&para;<br>determining whether that child can reenter the country as&para;<br>a “returning resident immigran[t]” under §1181(b). See&para;<br>Matter of Zamora, 17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (holding that a “voluntary and intended abandonment by the&para;<br>mother is imputed” to an unemancipated minor child for&para;<br>purposes of applying §1181(b)); Matter of Huang, 19 I.&para;<br>&amp; N. Dec. 749, 755–756 (1988) (concluding that a mother&para;<br>and her children abandoned their LPR status based&para;<br>solely on the mother’s intent); In re Ali, No. A44 143 723,&para;<br>2006 WL 3088820 (BIA, Sept. 11, 2006) (holding that a&para;<br>child could not have abandoned his LPR status if his&para;<br>mother had not abandoned hers). And once again, that is&para;<br>so even though neither §1181(b) nor any other statutory&para;<br>provision says that the BIA should look to the parent in&para;<br>assessing the child’s eligibility for reentry.&para;<br>But Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these&para;<br>divergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an&para;<br>alien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective&para;<br>conditions or characteristics. See 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 233–&para;<br>234, and n. 4. On one side of the line, knowledge of inadmissibility is all and only about a mental state. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Senica, 16 F. 3d, at 1015; In re Ahmed, 2006 WL 448156.&para;<br>Likewise, abandonment of status turns on an alien’s “intention of . . . returning to the United States” to live as a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>permanent resident, Zamora, 17 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 396; the&para;<br>Board thus explained that imputing abandonment is&para;<br>“consistent with the . . . longstanding policy that a child&para;<br>cannot form the intent necessary to establish his or her&para;<br>own domicile,” Escobar, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 234, n. 4. And&para;<br>as that analogy recalls, the 7-year domicile requirement of&para;<br>the former §212(c) also involved intent and so lent itself to&para;<br>imputation. See Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; supra, at 8.&para;<br>But the 5- and 7-year clocks of §1229b(a) fall on the other&para;<br>side of the line, because they hinge not on any state of&para;<br>mind but on the objective facts of immigration status and&para;<br>place of residence. See Escobar, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 233&para;<br>(“[W]e find that residence is different from domicile because it ‘contains no element of subjective intent’ ” (quoting Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J.,&para;<br>dissenting))). The BIA’s varied rulings on imputation thus&para;<br>largely follow from one straightforward distinction.4&para;<br>Similarly, Escobar belies respondents’ claim that the&para;<br>BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it&para;<br>thought Congress had left it no other choice. The Board,&para;<br>to be sure, did not highlight the statute’s gaps or ambiguity;&para;<br>rather, it read §1229b(a)’s text to support its conclusion&para;<br>that each alien must personally meet that section’s dura——————&para;<br>4 Respondents aver that the BIA deviates from this principle in imputing to a child his parent’s “ ‘firm resettlement’ ” in another country,&para;<br>which renders an alien ineligible for asylum without regard to intent.&para;<br>See Sawyers Brief 39; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52. But the Government denies that it has a “settled imputation rule” in that context.&para;<br>Reply Brief for Petitioner 13. And the sources on which respondents&para;<br>rely are slender reeds: a 40-year old ruling by a regional commissioner&para;<br>(not the Board itself) that considered the conduct of both the parents&para;<br>and the child, see Matter of Ng, 12 I. &amp; N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth&para;<br>Circuit decision imputing a parent’s resettlement even though the&para;<br>Board had focused only on the child’s actions, see Vang v. INS, 146&para;<br>F. 3d 1114, 1117 (1998). Based on these scant decisions, we cannot&para;<br>conclude that the Board has any policy on imputing resettlement, let&para;<br>alone one inconsistent with Escobar.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tional requirements. See 24 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 235. But the&para;<br>Board also explained that “there [was] no precedent” in its&para;<br>decisions for imputing status or residence, and distinguished those statutory terms, on the ground just explained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR status. Id.,&para;<br>at 234; see id., at 233–234, and n. 4. And the Board argued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a) would&para;<br>create anomalies in administration of the statutory&para;<br>scheme by permitting even those who had not obtained&para;<br>LPR status—or could not do so because of a criminal&para;<br>history—to become eligible for cancellation of removal.&para;<br>See id., at 234–235, and n. 5. The Board therefore saw&para;<br>neither a “logical” nor a “legal” basis for adopting a policy&para;<br>of imputation. Id., at 233. We see nothing in this decision&para;<br>to suggest that the Board thought its hands tied, or that it&para;<br>might have reached a different result if assured it could do&para;<br>so. To the contrary, the decision expressed the BIA’s view,&para;<br>based on its experience implementing the INA, that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all&para;<br>pointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation.&para;<br>In making that case, the decision reads like a multitude&para;<br>of agency interpretations—not the best example, but far&para;<br>from the worst—to which we and other courts have routinely deferred. We see no reason not to do so here.&para;<br>Because the Board’s rejection of imputation under&para;<br>§1229b(a) is “based on a permissible construction of the&para;<br>statute,” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, we reverse the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s judgments and remand the cases for further&para;<br>proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
