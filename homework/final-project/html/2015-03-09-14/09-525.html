(JCG),&para;<br>filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission&para;<br>(SEC) Rule 10b–5, which forbids “any person . . . [t]o make any un&para;<br>true statement of a material fact” in connection with the purchase or&para;<br>sale of securities. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its&para;<br>wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC&para;<br>(JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by&para;<br>Janus Investment Fund—for which JCM was the investment adviser&para;<br>and administrator—and that those statements affected the price of&para;<br>JCG’s stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a&para;<br>separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. The&para;<br>District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.&para;<br>The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had suffi&para;<br>ciently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing&para;<br>and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading state&para;<br>ments contained in the documents. Before this Court, First Deriva&para;<br>tive continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to&para;<br>hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under §20(a).&para;<br>Held: Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were&para;<br>made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot&para;<br>be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b–5. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(a) Although neither Rule 10b–5 nor the statute it interprets,&para;<br>§10(b) of the Act, expressly creates a private right of action, such an&para;<br>“action is implied under §10(b).” Superintendent of Ins. of N.

S. 148, 165, but, in analyzing the question at is&para;<br>sue, the Court is mindful that it must give “narrow dimensions . . . to&para;<br>a right . . . Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the stat&para;<br>ute and did not expand when it revisited” it, id., at 167. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(1) For Rule 10b–5 purposes, the maker of a statement is the&para;<br>person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ&para;<br>ing its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without&para;<br>control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not&para;<br>“make” a statement in its own right. This rule follows from Central&para;<br>Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511&para;<br>U. S. 164, 180, which held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of action&para;<br>does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute&para;<br>“substantial assistance” to the making of a statement but do not ac&para;<br>tually make it. Reading “make” more broadly, to include persons or&para;<br>entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substan&para;<br>tially undermine Central Bank by rendering aiders and abettors al&para;<br>most nonexistent. The Court’s interpretation is also suggested by&para;<br>Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that&para;<br>must be given the implied private right of action, id., at 167. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(2) The Court rejects the Government’s contention that “make”&para;<br>should be defined as “create,” thereby allowing private plaintiffs to&para;<br>sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that&para;<br>another person puts into a statement. Adopting that definition would&para;<br>be inconsistent with Stoneridge, supra, at 161, which rejected a pri&para;<br>vate Rule 10b–5 suit against companies involved in deceptive trans&para;<br>actions, even when information about those transactions was later&para;<br>incorporated into false public statements. First Derivative notes the&para;<br>uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its invest&para;<br>ment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reap&para;<br>portionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly&para;<br>the responsibility of Congress, not the courts. Furthermore, First&para;<br>Derivative’s rule would read into Rule 10b–5 a theory of liability&para;<br>similar to—but broader than—control-person liability under §20(a).&para;<br>Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(b) Although JCM may have been significantly involved in prepar&para;<br>ing the prospectuses, it did not itself “make” the statements at issue&para;<br>for Rule 10b–5 purposes. Its assistance in crafting what was said&para;<br>was subject to Janus Investment Fund’s ultimate control.

FIRST DERIVATIVE &para;<br>&para;<br>TRADERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>by mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has no&para;<br>assets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM&para;<br>provides Janus Investment Fund with investment advi&para;<br>sory services, which include “the management and admin&para;<br>istrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus]&para;<br>Fun[d],” App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal&para;<br>independence. At all times relevant to this case, all of&para;<br>the officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of&para;<br>JCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund’s&para;<br>board of trustees was associated with JCM. This is more&para;<br>independence than is required: By statute, up to 60 per&para;<br>cent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of&para;<br>“interested persons.” See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §80a–10(a); see also 15 U. S. C. A. §80a–2(a)(19)&para;<br>(2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining “interested&para;<br>person”).&para;<br>As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund&para;<br>issued prospectuses describing the investment strategy&para;<br>and operations of its mutual funds to investors. See 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §§77b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a–8(b), 80a–2(a)(31),&para;<br>80a–29(a)–(b). The prospectuses for several funds repre&para;<br>sented that the funds were not suitable for market timing&para;<br>and can be read to suggest that JCM would implement&para;<br>policies to curb the practice.1 For example, the Janus&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Market timing is a trading strategy that exploits time delay in mu&para;<br>tual funds’ daily valuation system. The price for buying or selling&para;<br>shares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset&para;<br>value (NAV) calculation after the order is placed. The NAV calculation&para;<br>usually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets.&para;<br>Because of certain time delays, however, the values used in these&para;<br>calculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the&para;<br>underlying assets. For example, a fund may value its foreign securities&para;<br>based on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have&para;<br>occurred several hours before the calculation. But events might have&para;<br>taken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected&para;<br>to affect their price. If the event were expected to increase the price of&para;<br>the foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy shares of a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Although market timing is legal, it harms&para;<br>other investors in the mutual fund.&para;<br>In September 2003, the Attorney General of the State of&para;<br>New York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging&para;<br>that JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit&para;<br>market timing in several funds run by JCM. After the&para;<br>complaint’s allegations became public, investors withdrew&para;<br>significant amounts of money from the Janus Investment&para;<br>Fund mutual funds.2 Because Janus Investment Fund&para;<br>compensated JCM based on the total value of the funds&para;<br>and JCM’s management fees comprised a significant&para;<br>percentage of JCG’s income, Janus Investment Fund’s loss&para;<br>of value affected JCG’s value as well. JCG’s stock price&para;<br>fell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to&para;<br>$13.50 on September 26.&para;<br>Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative)&para;<br>represents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of&para;<br>September 3, 2003.

The&para;<br>only question we must answer, therefore, is whether JCM made the&para;<br>misstatements.

S. 148, 165&para;<br>(2008), but “[c]oncerns with the judicial creation of a pri&para;<br>vate cause of action caution against its expansion,” ibid.&para;<br>Thus, in analyzing whether JCM “made” the statements&para;<br>for purposes of Rule 10b–5, we are mindful that we must&para;<br>give “narrow dimensions . . . to a right of action Congress&para;<br>did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did&para;<br>not expand when it revisited the law.” Id., at 167.&para;<br>1&para;<br>One “makes” a statement by stating it. When “make” is&para;<br>paired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the&para;<br>resulting phrase is “approximately equivalent in sense” to&para;<br>that verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933)&para;<br>(hereinafter OED); accord, Webster’s New International&para;<br>Dictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (“Make followed by&para;<br>a noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equiva&para;<br>lent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun”).&para;<br>For instance, “to make a proclamation” is the approximate&para;<br>equivalent of “to proclaim,” and “to make a promise” ap&para;<br>proximates “to promise.” See 6 OED 66 (def. 59). The&para;<br>phrase at issue in Rule 10b–5, “[t]o make any . . . state&para;<br>ment,” is thus the approximate equivalent of “to state.”&para;<br>For purposes of Rule 10b–5, the maker of a statement is&para;<br>the person or entity with ultimate authority over the&para;<br>statement, including its content and whether and how to&para;<br>communicate it. Without control, a person or entity can&para;<br>merely suggest what to say, not “make” a statement in its&para;<br>own right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on&para;<br>behalf of another is not its maker. And in the ordinary&para;<br>case, attribution within a statement or implicit from sur&para;<br>rounding circumstances is strong evidence that a state&para;<br>ment was made by—and only by—the party to whom it is&para;<br>attributed. This rule might best be exemplified by the&para;<br>relationship between a speechwriter and a speaker.

And&para;<br>it is the speaker who takes credit—or blame—for what is&para;<br>ultimately said.&para;<br>This rule follows from Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.&para;<br>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164&para;<br>(1994), in which we held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of&para;<br>action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.&para;<br>See id., at 180. Such suits—against entities that contrib&para;<br>ute “substantial assistance” to the making of a statement&para;<br>but do not actually make it—may be brought by the SEC,&para;<br>see 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e), but not by private parties. A&para;<br>broader reading of “make,” including persons or entities&para;<br>without ultimate control over the content of a statement,&para;<br>would substantially undermine Central Bank. If persons&para;<br>or entities without control over the content of a statement&para;<br>could be considered primary violators who “made” the&para;<br>statement, then aiders and abettors would be almost&para;<br>nonexistent.6&para;<br>This interpretation is further supported by our recent&para;<br>decision in Stoneridge. There, investors sued “entities&para;<br>who, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to&para;<br>arrangements that allowed the investors’ company to&para;<br>mislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial&para;<br>statement.” 552 U.

Post, at 4 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But for Cen&para;<br>tral Bank to have any meaning, there must be some distinction be&para;<br>tween those who are primarily liable (and thus may be pursued in&para;<br>private suits) and those who are secondarily liable (and thus may not&para;<br>be pursued in private suits).&para;<br>We draw a clean line between the two—the maker is the person or&para;<br>entity with ultimate authority over a statement and others are not. In&para;<br>contrast, the dissent’s only limit on primary liability is not much of a&para;<br>limit at all.

The phrase “directly or&para;<br>indirectly” is set off by itself in Rule 10b–5 and modifies not just “to&para;<br>make,” but also “to employ” and “to engage.” We think the phrase&para;<br>merely clarifies that as long as a statement is made, it does not matter&para;<br>whether the statement was communicated directly or indirectly to the&para;<br>recipient. A different understanding of “indirectly” would, like a broad&para;<br>definition of “make,” threaten to erase the line between primary viola&para;<br>tors and aiders and abettors established by Central Bank.&para;<br>In this case, we need not define precisely what it means to communi&para;<br>cate a “made” statement indirectly because none of the statements in&para;<br>the prospectuses were attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to JCM.&para;<br>Without attribution, there is no indication that Janus Investment Fund&para;<br>was quoting or otherwise repeating a statement originally “made” by&para;<br>JCM. Cf. Anixter v. Home-Stake Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1220, and&para;<br>n. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed “ ‘Auditor’s Report’ ” included in a pro&para;<br>spectus); Basic, supra, at 227, n. 4 (quoting a news item reporting a state&para;<br>ment by Basic’s president).

The specific legal&para;<br>question before us is whether Janus Management can be&para;<br>held responsible under the Rule for having “ma[d]e” cer­&para;<br>tain false statements about the Janus Fund’s activities.&para;<br>The statements in question appear in the Janus Fund’s&para;<br>prospectuses.&para;<br>The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus&para;<br>Management, could have “ma[d]e” those statements. The&para;<br>majority points out that the Janus Fund’s board of trus­&para;<br>tees has “ultimate authority” over the content of the&para;<br>statements in a Fund prospectus. And in the majority’s&para;<br>view, only “the person or entity with ultimate authority&para;<br>over the statement, including its content and whether and&para;<br>how to communicate it” can “make” a statement within the&para;<br>terms of Rule 10b–5. Ante, at 6.&para;<br>In my view, however, the majority has incorrectly inter­&para;<br>preted the Rule’s word “make.” Neither common English&para;<br>nor this Court’s earlier cases limit the scope of that&para;<br>word to those with “ultimate authority” over a statement’s&para;<br>content. To the contrary, both language and case law&para;<br>indicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a man­&para;<br>agement company, a board of trustees, individual company&para;<br>officers, or others, separately or together, might “make”&para;<br>statements contained in a firm’s prospectus—even if a&para;<br>board of directors has ultimate content-related responsi­&para;<br>bility. And the circumstances here are such that a court&para;<br>could find that Janus Management made the statements&para;<br>in question.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent’s complaint sets forth the basic elements&para;<br>of a typical Rule 10b–5 “fraud on the market” claim. It&para;<br>alleges that Janus Management made statements that&para;<br>“created the misleading impression that” it “would&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The&para;<br>complaint adds that Janus Management knew that these&para;<br>“market timing” statements were false; that the&para;<br>statements were material; that the market, in pricing&para;<br>securities (including related securities) relied upon the&para;<br>statements; that as a result, when the truth came out&para;<br>(that Janus Management indeed permitted “market&para;<br>timing” in the Janus Fund), the price of relevant shares&para;<br>fell; and the false statements thereby caused respondent&para;<br>significant economic losses.

S. 148, 157 (2008) (identi­&para;<br>fying the elements of “a typical §10(b) private action”).&para;<br>The majority finds the complaint fatally flawed,&para;<br>however, because (1) Rule 10b–5 says that no “person”&para;<br>shall “directly or indirectly . . . make any untrue statement&para;<br>of a material fact,” (2) the statements at issue appeared in&para;<br>the Janus Fund’s prospectuses, and (3) only “the person or&para;<br>entity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ­&para;<br>ing its content and whether and how to communicate it”&para;<br>can “make” a false statement.

The English language does not&para;<br>impose upon the word “make” boundaries of the kind the&para;<br>majority finds determinative. Every day, hosts of corpo­&para;<br>rate officials make statements with content that more&para;<br>senior officials or the board of directors have “ultimate&para;<br>authority” to control. So do cabinet officials make state­&para;<br>ments about matters that the Constitution places within&para;<br>the ultimate authority of the President.

For example, as a matter of English, one can&para;<br>say that a national political party has made a statement&para;<br>even if the only written communication consists of uniform&para;<br>press releases issued in the name of local party branches;&para;<br>one can say that one foreign nation has made a statement&para;<br>even when the officials of a different nation (subject to its&para;<br>influence) speak about the matter; and one can say that&para;<br>the President has made a statement even if his press&para;<br>officer issues a communication, sometimes in the press&para;<br>officer’s own name. Practical matters related to context,&para;<br>including control, participation, and relevant audience,&para;<br>help determine who “makes” a statement and to whom&para;<br>that statement may properly be “attributed,” see ante, at&para;<br>11, n. 11—at least as far as ordinary English is concerned.&para;<br>Neither can the majority find support in any relevant&para;<br>precedent. The majority says that its rule “follows from&para;<br>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of&para;<br>Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994),” in which the Court&para;<br>“held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of action does not&para;<br>include suits against aiders and abettors.” Ante, at 7. But&para;<br>Central Bank concerns a different matter. And it no more&para;<br>requires the majority’s rule than free air travel for small&para;<br>children requires free air travel for adults.&para;<br>Central Bank is a case about secondary liability, liability&para;<br>attaching, not to an individual making a false statement,&para;<br>but to an individual helping someone else do so. Central&para;<br>Bank involved a bond issuer accused of having made&para;<br>materially false statements, which overstated the values&para;<br>of property that backed the bonds. Central Bank also&para;<br>involved a defendant that was a bank, serving as inden­&para;<br>ture trustee, which was supposed to check the bond is­&para;<br>suer’s valuations. The plaintiffs claimed that the bank&para;<br>delayed its valuation checks and thereby helped the issuer&para;<br>make its false statements credible.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Court concerned the bank’s liability—a secondary&para;<br>liability for “aiding and abetting” the bond issuer, who (on&para;<br>the theory set forth) was primarily liable.&para;<br>The Court made this clear. The question presented was&para;<br>“whether private civil liability under §10(b) extends . . . to&para;<br>those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive&para;<br>practice, but who aid and abet the violation.” 511 U. S., at&para;<br>167 (emphasis added). The Court wrote that “aiding and&para;<br>abetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the&para;<br>proscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to&para;<br>those who do.” Id., at 176 (emphasis added). The Court&para;<br>described civil law “aiding and abetting” as “ ‘know[ing]&para;<br>that the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and&para;<br>giv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the&para;<br>other . . . .’ ” Id., at 181 (quoting Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Torts §876(b) (1977); emphasis added). And it reviewed a&para;<br>Court of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of&para;<br>aiding and abetting as “(1) a primary violation of §10(b);&para;<br>(2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the exis­&para;<br>tence of the primary violation; and (3) substantial assis&para;<br>tance given to the primary violator by the aider and abet­&para;<br>tor.” 511 U. S., at 168 (emphasis added). Faced with this&para;<br>question, the Court answered that §10(b) and Rule 10b–5&para;<br>do not provide for this kind of “aiding and abetting” liabil­&para;<br>ity in private suits.&para;<br>By way of contrast, the present case is about primary&para;<br>liability—about individuals who allegedly themselves&para;<br>“make” materially false statements, not about those who&para;<br>help others to do so. The question is whether Janus Man­&para;<br>agement is primarily liable for violating the Act, not&para;<br>whether it simply helped others violate the Act. The&para;<br>Central Bank defendant concededly did not make the false&para;<br>statements in question (others did), while here the defen­&para;<br>dants allegedly did make those statements. And a rule&para;<br>(the majority’s rule) absolving those who allegedly did&para;<br>make false statements does not “follow from” a rule (Cen&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

Ante, at 7. Would it? The Court in Cen&para;<br>tral Bank specifically wrote that its holding did&para;<br>“not mean that secondary actors in the securities&para;<br>markets are always free from liability under the secu­&para;<br>rities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer,&para;<br>accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative de­&para;<br>vice or makes a material misstatement (or omission)&para;<br>on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may&para;<br>be liable as a primary violator under 10b–5, assuming&para;<br>all of the requirements for primary liability under&para;<br>Rule 10b–5 are met.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some empha­&para;<br>sis added).&para;<br>Thus, as far as Central Bank is concerned, depending upon&para;<br>the circumstances, board members, senior firm officials,&para;<br>officials tasked to develop a marketing document, large&para;<br>investors, or others (taken together or separately) all&para;<br>might “make” materially false statements subjecting&para;<br>themselves to primary liability. The majority’s rule does&para;<br>not protect, it extends, Central Bank’s holding of no­&para;<br>liability into new territory that Central Bank explicitly&para;<br>placed outside that holding. And by ignoring the language&para;<br>in which Central Bank did so, the majority’s rule itself&para;<br>undermines Central Bank. Where is the legal support for&para;<br>the majority’s “draw[ing] a clean line,” ante, at 7, n. 6, that&para;<br>so seriously conflicts with Central Bank? Indeed, where is&para;<br>the legal support for the majority’s suggestion that plain­&para;<br>tiffs must show some kind of “attribution” of a statement&para;<br>to a defendant, ante, at 11, n. 11—if it means plaintiffs&para;<br>must show, not only that the defendant “ma[d]e” the&para;<br>statement, but something more?&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

These arrangements enabled the&para;<br>cable television company to fool its accountants (and&para;<br>ultimately the public) into believing that it had more&para;<br>revenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really&para;<br>had. As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged&para;<br>letters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.&para;<br>Investors subsequently sued the cable television company,&para;<br>some of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment&para;<br>suppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged&para;<br>in a scheme to defraud securities purchasers. In respect to&para;<br>most of the defendants, investors identified allegedly&para;<br>materially false statements contained in the cable&para;<br>television company’s financial statements or similar documents. But in respect to the equipment suppliers, in­&para;<br>vestors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was&para;<br>in the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral&para;<br>conversations about the scheme.

It was [the cable&para;<br>company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled&para;<br>its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements;&para;<br>nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it&para;<br>necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to&para;<br>record the transactions as it did.” Id., at 161.&para;<br>Insofar as the equipment suppliers’ conduct was at issue,&para;<br>the fraudulent “arrangement . . . took place in the&para;<br>marketplace for goods and services, not in the investment&para;<br>sphere.” Id., at 166.&para;<br>It is difficult for me to see how Stoneridge “support[s]”&para;<br>the majority’s rule. Ante, at 7. No one in Stoneridge&para;<br>disputed the making of the relevant statements, the&para;<br>fraudulent contracts and the like.&para;<br>And no one in&para;<br>Stoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,&para;<br>in fact, the makers of the cable company’s misstatements.&para;<br>Rather, Stoneridge was concerned with whether the&para;<br>equipment suppliers’ separate statements were sufficiently&para;<br>disclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the&para;<br>basis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a&para;<br>different inquiry than whether statements acknowledged&para;<br>to have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

How then does Stoneridge support the&para;<br>majority’s new rule?&para;<br>The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid “a&para;<br>theory of liability similar to—but broader in application&para;<br>than”—§20(a)’s liability, for “ ‘[e]very person who, directly&para;<br>or indirectly, controls any person liable’ ” for violations of&para;<br>the securities laws. Ante, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S. C. A.&para;<br>§78t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)). But that is not so. This Court&para;<br>has explained that the possibility of an express remedy&para;<br>under the securities laws does not preclude a claim under&para;<br>§10(b). Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,&para;<br>388 (1983).&para;<br>More importantly, a person who is liable under §20(a)&para;<br>controls another “person” who is “liable” for a securities&para;<br>violation. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n. 2) (“Liability&para;<br>under §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some&para;<br>other provision of the Exchange Act”). We here examine&para;<br>whether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or&para;<br>they do not, control another person who is liable. That is&para;<br>to say, here, the liability of some “other person” is not at&para;<br>issue.&para;<br>And there is at least one significant category of cases&para;<br>that §10(b) may address that derivative forms of liability,&para;<br>such as under §20(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one&para;<br>actor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its&para;<br>misstatements. Here, it may well be that the Fund’s&para;<br>board of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the&para;<br>prospectuses. See, e.g., In re Lammert, Release No. 348,&para;<br>93 S. E. C.

See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave,&para;<br>Substantive Criminal Law §13.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M.&para;<br>Hale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to&para;<br>Crime, 89 U. Pa. L.

Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48–49 (1937).&para;<br>Indeed, under the majority’s rule it seems unlikely that&para;<br>the SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the&para;<br>authority Congress has granted it to pursue primary&para;<br>violators who “make” false statements or the authority&para;<br>that Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders&para;<br>and abettors to securities violations. See §104, 109 Stat.&para;<br>757 (codified at 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.))&para;<br>(granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).&para;<br>That is because the managers, not having “ma[d]e” the&para;<br>statement, would not be liable as principals and there&para;<br>would be no other primary violator they might have&para;<br>tried to “aid” or “abet.” Ibid.; SEC v.

We must still determine whether,&para;<br>in light of the complaint’s allegations, Janus Management&para;<br>could have “ma[d]e” the false statements in the&para;<br>prospectuses at issue. In my view, the answer to this&para;<br>question is “Yes.”&para;<br>The specific relationships alleged&para;<br>among Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the&para;<br>prospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus&para;<br>Management did “make” those statements.&para;<br>In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court&para;<br>and lower courts have made clear that at least sometimes&para;<br>corporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule&para;<br>10b–5 for having “ma[d]e” a materially false statement&para;<br>even when that statement appears in a document (or is&para;<br>made by a third person) that the officials do not legally&para;<br>control. In Herman &amp; MacLean, for example, this Court&para;<br>pointed out that “certain individuals who play a part in&para;<br>preparing the registration statement,” including corporate&para;<br>officers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable&para;<br>even where “they are not named as having prepared or&para;<br>certified” the registration statement. 459 U. S., at 386, n.&para;<br>22. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in&para;<br>Central Bank that a “lawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . .&para;<br>makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

S., at 191 (some emphasis added).&para;<br>Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surpris­&para;<br>ing that lower courts have found primary liability for&para;<br>actors without “ultimate authority” over issued state­&para;<br>ments. One court, for example, concluded that an ac­&para;<br>countant could be primarily liable for having “ma[d]e”&para;<br>false statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and&para;<br>certification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual&para;<br>reports, and other corporate materials for which he was&para;<br>not ultimately responsible.&para;<br>Anixter v. Home-Stake&para;<br>Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1225–1227 (CA10 1996). In&para;<br>a later case postdating Stoneridge, that court reaffirmed&para;<br>that an outside consultant could be primarily liable for&para;<br>having “ma[d]e” false statements, where he drafted&para;<br>fraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later&para;<br>reviewed and certified by the firm’s auditor, officers, and&para;<br>counsel. SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10&para;<br>2008). And another court found that a corporation’s chief&para;<br>financial officer could be held primarily liable as having&para;<br>“ma[d]e” misstatements that appeared in a form 10–K&para;<br>that she prepared but did not sign or file. McConville v.&para;<br>SEC, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).&para;<br>One can also easily find lower court cases explaining&para;<br>that corporate officials may be liable for having “ma[d]e”&para;<br>false statements where those officials use innocent&para;<br>persons as conduits through which the false statements&para;<br>reach the public (without necessarily attributing the false&para;<br>statements to the officials). See, e.g., In re Navarre Corp.&para;<br>Securities Litigation, 299 F. 3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liabil­&para;<br>ity may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to&para;<br>communicate false statements to market); In re Cabletron&para;<br>Systems, Inc., 311 F. 3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test&para;<br>requiring legal “control” over third parties making state­&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Supp. 2d 59, 75–&para;<br>76 (DC 2008).&para;<br>My conclusion also reflects the particular circumstances&para;<br>that the complaint alleges. The complaint states that&para;<br>“Janus Management, as investment advisor to the funds,&para;<br>is responsible for the day-to-day management of its&para;<br>investment portfolio and other business affairs of the&para;<br>funds. Janus Management furnishes advice and recom­&para;<br>mendations concerning the funds’ investments, as well as&para;<br>administrative, compliance and accounting services for the&para;<br>funds.” Complaint ¶18, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Each of&para;<br>the Fund’s 17 officers was a vice president of Janus&para;<br>Management. App. 250a–258a.
