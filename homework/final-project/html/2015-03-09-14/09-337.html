A.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–337.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 21, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Krupski sought compensation for injuries she suffered on a&para;<br>cruise ship. Her passenger ticket, which was issued by Costa Cruise&para;<br>Lines, identified respondent Costa Crociere S. p. A. as the carrier; re&para;<br>quired an injured party to submit to the carrier or its agent written&para;<br>notice of a claim; required any lawsuit to be filed within one year of&para;<br>the injury; and designated a specific Federal District Court as the ex&para;<br>clusive forum for lawsuits such as Krupski’s. The front of the ticket&para;<br>listed Costa Cruise’s Florida address and made references to “Costa&para;<br>Cruises.” After Krupski’s attorney notified Costa Cruise of her&para;<br>claims but did not reach a settlement, Krupski filed a diversity negli&para;<br>gence action against Costa Cruise. Over the next several months—&para;<br>after the limitations period had expired—Costa Cruise brought Costa&para;<br>Crociere’s existence to Krupski’s attention three times, including in&para;<br>its motion for summary judgment, in which it stated that Costa Cro&para;<br>ciere was the proper defendant. Krupski responded and moved to&para;<br>amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant. The Dis&para;<br>trict Court denied Costa Cruise’s summary judgment motion without&para;<br>prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend. After she served&para;<br>Costa Crociere with an amended complaint, the court dismissed&para;<br>Costa Cruise from the case. Thereafter, Costa Crociere—represented&para;<br>by the same counsel as Costa Cruise—moved to dismiss, contending&para;<br>that the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirements of Fed&para;<br>eral Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), which governs when an amended&para;<br>pleading “relates back” to the date of a timely filed original pleading&para;<br>and is thus timely even though it was filed outside an applicable limi&para;<br>tations period. The Rule requires, inter alia, that within the Rule&para;<br>4(m) 120-day period for service after a complaint is filed, the newly&para;<br>named defendant “knew or should have known that the action would&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper&para;<br>party’s identity.” Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court found this&para;<br>condition fatal to Krupski’s attempt to relate back. It concluded that&para;<br>she had not made a mistake about the proper party’s identity be&para;<br>cause, although Costa Cruise had disclosed Costa Crociere’s role in&para;<br>several court filings, she nonetheless delayed for months filing an&para;<br>amended complaint. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that&para;<br>Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere’s iden&para;<br>tity as a potential party because she furnished the ticket identifying&para;<br>it to her counsel well before the limitations period ended. It was&para;<br>therefore appropriate to treat her as having chosen to sue one poten&para;<br>tial party over another. Additionally, the court held that relation&para;<br>back was not appropriate because of Krupski’s undue delay in seek&para;<br>ing to amend the complaint.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party&para;<br>to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party’s&para;<br>knowledge or timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading. Pp. 7–18.&para;<br>(a) The Rule’s text does not support the Eleventh Circuit’s decision&para;<br>to rely on the plaintiff’s knowledge in denying relation back. The&para;<br>question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or&para;<br>should have known Costa Crociere’s identity as the proper defendant,&para;<br>but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known during the&para;<br>Rule 4(m) period that it would have been named as the defendant but&para;<br>for an error. The plaintiff’s information is relevant only if it bears on&para;<br>the defendant’s understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mis&para;<br>take regarding the proper party’s identity. It would be error to con&para;<br>flate knowledge of a party’s existence with the absence of mistake.&para;<br>That a plaintiff knows of a party’s existence does not preclude her&para;<br>from making a mistake with respect to that party’s identity. Making&para;<br>a deliberate choice to sue one party over another while understand&para;<br>ing the factual and legal differences between the two parties may be&para;<br>the antithesis of making a mistake, but that does not mean that any&para;<br>time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to&para;<br>sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe&para;<br>that the plaintiff made no mistake. A plaintiff might know that the&para;<br>prospective defendant exists but nonetheless choose to sue a different&para;<br>defendant based on a misunderstanding about the proper party’s&para;<br>identity. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not fore&para;<br>close a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied. This read&para;<br>ing is consistent with relation back’s purpose of balancing the defen&para;<br>dant’s interests protected by the statute of limitations with the&para;<br>preference of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and&para;<br>Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits. It is also&para;<br>consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C). And it is not fore&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>closed by Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 U. S. 460. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(b) The Eleventh Circuit also erred in ruling that Krupski’s undue&para;<br>delay in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended com&para;<br>plaint justified its denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C). The&para;<br>Rule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation&para;<br>back, and the plaintiff’s diligence is not among them. Moreover, it&para;<br>mandates relation back once its requirements are satisfied; it does&para;<br>not leave that decision to the district court’s equitable discretion. Its&para;<br>mandatory nature is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry&para;<br>under Rule 15(a), which gives a district court discretion to decide&para;<br>whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading before trial. See&para;<br>Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182. Rule 15(c)(1)(C) permits a court&para;<br>to examine a plaintiff’s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but only&para;<br>to the extent the plaintiff’s postfiling conduct informs the prospective&para;<br>defendant’s understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a&para;<br>“mistake concerning the proper party’s identity.” The plaintiff’s post&para;<br>filing conduct is otherwise immaterial to the relation-back question.&para;<br>Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(c) Under these principles, the courts below erred in denying rela&para;<br>tion back. Because the original complaint (of which Costa Crociere&para;<br>had constructive notice) made clear that Krupski meant to sue the&para;<br>company that “owned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled”&para;<br>the ship on which she was injured and also indicated (mistakenly)&para;<br>that Costa Cruise performed those roles, Costa Crociere should have&para;<br>known that it avoided suit within the limitations period only because&para;<br>of Krupski’s misunderstanding about which “Costa” entity was in&para;<br>charge of the ship—clearly a “mistake concerning the proper party’s&para;<br>identity.” That Krupski may have known the ticket’s contents does&para;<br>not foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood cru&para;<br>cial facts regarding the two companies’ identities. Especially because&para;<br>the face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,&para;<br>respondent’s contention that it was entitled to think she made no&para;<br>mistake is not persuasive. Moreover, respondent has articulated no&para;<br>strategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing&para;<br>in suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief. Noth&para;<br>ing in Krupski’s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that&para;<br>she failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a&para;<br>mistake. The interrelationship between Costa Cruise and Costa Cro&para;<br>ciere and their similar names heighten the expectation that Costa&para;<br>Crociere should suspect a mistake when Costa Cruise is named in a&para;<br>complaint actually describing Costa Crociere’s activities. In addition,&para;<br>Costa Crociere’s own actions contributed to passenger confusion over&para;<br>“the proper party”: The front of the ticket advertises that “Costa&para;<br>Cruises” has achieved a certification of quality without clarifying&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v.

Where an amended pleading changes a party&para;<br>or a party’s name, the Rule requires, among other things,&para;<br>that “the party to be brought in by amendment . . . knew&para;<br>or should have known that the action would have been&para;<br>brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper&para;<br>party’s identity.” Rule 15(c)(1)(C). In this case, the Court&para;<br>of Appeals held that Rule 15(c) was not satisfied because&para;<br>the plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper&para;<br>defendant before filing her original complaint. The court&para;<br>also held that relation back was not appropriate because&para;<br>the plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend. We&para;<br>hold that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on&para;<br>what the party to be added knew or should have known,&para;<br>not on the amending party’s knowledge or its timeliness in&para;<br>seeking to amend the pleading. Accordingly, we reverse&para;<br>the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>On February 21, 2007, petitioner, Wanda Krupski,&para;<br>tripped over a cable and fractured her femur while she&para;<br>was on board the cruise ship Costa Magica. Upon her&para;<br>return home, she acquired counsel and began the process&para;<br>of seeking compensation for her injuries. Krupski’s pas&para;<br>senger ticket—which explained that it was the sole con&para;<br>tract between each passenger and the carrier, App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 37a—included a variety of requirements for&para;<br>obtaining damages for an injury suffered on board one of&para;<br>the carrier’s ships. The ticket identified the carrier as&para;<br>“Costa Crociere S. p. A., an Italian corporation, and all&para;<br>Vessels and other ships owned, chartered, operated,&para;<br>marketed or provided by Costa Crociere, S. p. A., and&para;<br>all officers, staff members, crew members, independ&para;<br>ent contractors, medical providers, concessionaires, pi&para;<br>lots, suppliers, agents and assigns onboard said Ves&para;<br>sels, and the manufacturers of said Vessels and all&para;<br>their component parts.” Id., at 27a.&para;<br>The ticket required an injured party to submit “written&para;<br>notice of the claim with full particulars . . . to the carrier&para;<br>or its duly authorized agent within 185 days after the date&para;<br>of injury.” Id., at 28a. The ticket further required any&para;<br>lawsuit to be “filed within one year after the date of in&para;<br>jury” and to be “served upon the carrier within 120 days&para;<br>after filing.” Ibid. For cases arising from voyages depart&para;<br>ing from or returning to a United States port in which the&para;<br>amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, the ticket desig&para;<br>nated the United States District Court for the Southern&para;<br>District of Florida in Broward County, Florida, as the&para;<br>exclusive forum for a lawsuit. Id., at 36a. The ticket&para;<br>extended the “defenses, limitations and exceptions . . . that&para;<br>may be invoked by the CARRIER” to “all persons who may&para;<br>act on behalf of the CARRIER or on whose behalf the&para;<br>CARRIER may act,” including “the CARRIER’s parents,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, representa&para;<br>tives, agents, employees, servants, concessionaires and&para;<br>contractors” as well as “Costa Cruise Lines N. V.,” identi&para;<br>fied as the “sales and marketing agent for the CARRIER&para;<br>and the issuer of this Passage Ticket Contract.” Id., at&para;<br>29a. The front of the ticket listed Costa Cruise Lines’&para;<br>address in Florida and stated that an entity called “Costa&para;<br>Cruises” was “the first cruise company in the world” to&para;<br>obtain a certain certification of quality. Id., at 25a.&para;<br>On July 2, 2007, Krupski’s counsel notified Costa Cruise&para;<br>Lines of Krupski’s claims. App. 69–70. On July 9, 2007,&para;<br>the claims administrator for Costa Cruise requested addi&para;<br>tional information from Krupski “[i]n order to facilitate&para;<br>our future attempts to achieve a pre-litigation settlement.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a–24a. The parties were unable to&para;<br>reach a settlement, however, and on February 1, 2008—&para;<br>three weeks before the 1-year limitations period expired—&para;<br>Krupski filed a negligence action against Costa Cruise,&para;<br>invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District&para;<br>Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint&para;<br>alleged that Costa Cruise “owned, operated, managed,&para;<br>supervised and controlled” the ship on which Krupski had&para;<br>injured herself; that Costa Cruise had extended to its&para;<br>passengers an invitation to enter onto the ship; and that&para;<br>Costa Cruise owed Krupski a duty of care, which it&para;<br>breached by failing to take steps that would have pre&para;<br>vented her accident. App. 23–26. The complaint further&para;<br>stated that venue was proper under the passenger ticket’s&para;<br>forum selection clause and averred that, by the July 2007&para;<br>notice of her claims, Krupski had complied with the&para;<br>ticket’s presuit requirements. Id., at 23. Krupski served&para;<br>Costa Cruise on February 4, 2008.&para;<br>Over the next several months—after the limitations&para;<br>period had expired—Costa Cruise brought Costa Croci&para;<br>ere’s existence to Krupski’s attention three times. First,&para;<br>on February 25, 2008, Costa Cruise filed its answer, as&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>serting that it was not the proper defendant, as it was&para;<br>merely the North American sales and marketing agent for&para;<br>Costa Crociere, which was the actual carrier and vessel&para;<br>operator. Id., at 31. Second, on March 20, 2008, Costa&para;<br>Cruise listed Costa Crociere as an interested party in its&para;<br>corporate disclosure statement. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.&para;<br>Finally, on May 6, 2008, Costa Cruise moved for summary&para;<br>judgment, again stating that Costa Crociere was the&para;<br>proper defendant. App. 5, 33–38.&para;<br>On June 13, 2008, Krupski responded to Costa Cruise’s&para;<br>motion for summary judgment, arguing for limited discov&para;<br>ery to determine whether Costa Cruise should be dis&para;<br>missed. According to Krupski, the following sources of&para;<br>information led her to believe Costa Cruise was the re&para;<br>sponsible party: The travel documents prominently identi&para;<br>fied Costa Cruise and gave its Florida address; Costa&para;<br>Cruise’s Web site listed Costa Cruise in Florida as the&para;<br>United States office for the Italian company Costa Croci&para;<br>ere; and the Web site of the Florida Department of State&para;<br>listed Costa Cruise as the only “Costa” company registered&para;<br>to do business in that State. Id., at 43–45, 56–59. Krup&para;<br>ski also observed that Costa Cruise’s claims administrator&para;<br>had responded to her claims notification without indicat&para;<br>ing that Costa Cruise was not a responsible party. Id., at&para;<br>45. With her response, Krupski simultaneously moved to&para;<br>amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defen&para;<br>dant. Id., at 41–42, 52–54.&para;<br>On July 2, 2008, after oral argument, the District Court&para;<br>denied Costa Cruise’s motion for summary judgment&para;<br>without prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend,&para;<br>ordering that Krupski effect proper service on Costa Cro&para;<br>ciere by September 16, 2008. Id., at 71–72. Complying&para;<br>with the court’s deadline, Krupski filed an amended com&para;<br>plaint on July 11, 2008, and served Costa Crociere on&para;<br>August 21, 2008. Id., at 73, 88–89. On that same date,&para;<br>the District Court issued an order dismissing Costa Cruise&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from the case pursuant to the parties’ joint stipulation,&para;<br>Krupski apparently having concluded that Costa Cruise&para;<br>was correct that it bore no responsibility for her injuries.&para;<br>Id., at 85–86.&para;<br>Shortly thereafter, Costa Crociere—represented by the&para;<br>same counsel who had represented Costa Cruise, compare&para;<br>id., at 31, with id., at 100—moved to dismiss, contending&para;<br>that the amended complaint did not relate back under&para;<br>Rule 15(c) and was therefore untimely. The District Court&para;<br>agreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a–22a. Rule 15(c), the&para;<br>court explained, imposes three requirements before an&para;<br>amended complaint against a newly named defendant can&para;<br>relate back to the original complaint. First, the claim&para;<br>against the newly named defendant must have arisen “out&para;<br>of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or&para;<br>attempted to be set out—in the original pleading.” Fed.&para;<br>Rules Civ. Proc. 15(c)(1)(B), (C). Second, “within the&para;<br>period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and&para;<br>complaint” (which is ordinarily 120 days from when the&para;<br>complaint is filed, see Rule 4(m)), the newly named defen&para;<br>dant must have “received such notice of the action that it&para;<br>will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.” Rule&para;<br>15(c)(1)(C)(i). Finally, the plaintiff must show that, within&para;<br>the Rule 4(m) period, the newly named defendant “knew&para;<br>or should have known that the action would have been&para;<br>brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper&para;<br>party’s identity.” Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).&para;<br>The first two conditions posed no problem, the court&para;<br>explained: The claim against Costa Crociere clearly in&para;<br>volved the same occurrence as the original claim against&para;<br>Costa Cruise, and Costa Crociere had constructive notice&para;<br>of the action and had not shown that any unfair prejudice&para;<br>would result from relation back. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>14a–18a. But the court found the third condition fatal to&para;<br>Krupski’s attempt to relate back, concluding that Krupski&para;<br>had not made a mistake concerning the identity of the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>proper party. Id., at 18a–21a. Relying on Eleventh Cir&para;<br>cuit precedent, the court explained that the word “mis&para;<br>take” should not be construed to encompass a deliberate&para;<br>decision not to sue a party whose identity the plaintiff&para;<br>knew before the statute of limitations had run. Because&para;<br>Costa Cruise informed Krupski that Costa Crociere was&para;<br>the proper defendant in its answer, corporate disclosure&para;<br>statement, and motion for summary judgment, and yet&para;<br>Krupski delayed for months in moving to amend and then&para;<br>in filing an amended complaint, the court concluded that&para;<br>Krupski knew of the proper defendant and made no&para;<br>mistake.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unpublished per&para;<br>curiam opinion. Krupski v. Costa Cruise Lines, N. V.,&para;<br>LLC, 330 Fed. Appx. 892 (2009). Rather than relying on&para;<br>the information contained in Costa Cruise’s filings, all of&para;<br>which were made after the statute of limitations had&para;<br>expired, as evidence that Krupski did not make a mistake,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals noted that the relevant information&para;<br>was located within Krupski’s passenger ticket, which she&para;<br>had furnished to her counsel well before the end of the&para;<br>limitations period. Because the ticket clearly identified&para;<br>Costa Crociere as the carrier, the court stated, Krupski&para;<br>either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere’s&para;<br>identity as a potential party.1 It was therefore appropri&para;<br>ate to treat Krupski as having chosen to sue one potential&para;<br>party over another. Alternatively, even assuming that she&para;<br>first learned of Costa Crociere’s identity as the correct&para;<br>party from Costa Cruise’s answer, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Court of Appeals stated that it was “imput[ing]” knowledge to&para;<br>Krupski. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. Petitioner uses the terms “imputed&para;<br>knowledge” and “constructive knowledge” interchangeably in her brief,&para;<br>while respondent addresses only actual knowledge. Because we reject&para;<br>the Court of Appeals’ focus on the plaintiff’s knowledge in the first&para;<br>instance, see infra, at 8–13, the distinction among these types of&para;<br>knowledge is not relevant to our resolution of this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

In light of this delay, the Court of Appeals concluded&para;<br>that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in&para;<br>denying relation back.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve tension among the&para;<br>Circuits over the breadth of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii),2 558 U.

We consider each reason&para;<br>in turn.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court of Appeals first decided that Krupski either&para;<br>knew or should have known of the proper party’s identity&para;<br>and thus determined that she had made a deliberate&para;<br>choice instead of a mistake in not naming Costa Crociere&para;<br>as a party in her original pleading. 330 Fed. Appx., at&para;<br>895. By focusing on Krupski’s knowledge, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals chose the wrong starting point. The question&para;<br>under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or&para;<br>should have known the identity of Costa Crociere as the&para;<br>proper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or&para;<br>should have known that it would have been named as a&para;<br>defendant but for an error. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) asks what&para;<br>the prospective defendant knew or should have known&para;<br>during the Rule 4(m) period, not what the plaintiff knew&para;<br>or should have known at the time of filing her original&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>complaint.3&para;<br>Information in the plaintiff’s possession is relevant only&para;<br>if it bears on the defendant’s understanding of whether&para;<br>the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party’s&para;<br>identity. For purposes of that inquiry, it would be error to&para;<br>conflate knowledge of a party’s existence with the absence&para;<br>of mistake. A mistake is “[a]n error, misconception, or&para;<br>misunderstanding; an erroneous belief.” Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 1092 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining “mis&para;<br>take” as “a misunderstanding of the meaning or implica&para;<br>tion of something”; “a wrong action or statement proceed&para;<br>ing from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or&para;<br>inattention”; “an erroneous belief”; or “a state of mind not&para;<br>in accordance with the facts”). That a plaintiff knows of a&para;<br>party’s existence does not preclude her from making a&para;<br>mistake with respect to that party’s identity. A plaintiff&para;<br>may know that a prospective defendant—call him party&para;<br>A—exists, while erroneously believing him to have the&para;<br>status of party B. Similarly, a plaintiff may know gener&para;<br>ally what party A does while misunderstanding the roles&para;<br>that party A and party B played in the “conduct, transac&para;<br>tion, or occurrence” giving rise to her claim. If the plaintiff&para;<br>sues party B instead of party A under these circum&para;<br>stances, she has made a “mistake concerning the proper&para;<br>party’s identity” notwithstanding her knowledge of the&para;<br>existence of both parties. The only question under Rule&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Rule 15(c)(1)(C) speaks generally of an amendment to a “pleading”&para;<br>that changes “the party against whom a claim is asserted,” and it&para;<br>therefore is not limited to the circumstance of a plaintiff filing an&para;<br>amended complaint seeking to bring in a new defendant. Nevertheless,&para;<br>because the latter is the “typical case” of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)’s applicability,&para;<br>see 3 Moore’s Federal Practice §15.19[2] (3d ed. 2009), we use this&para;<br>circumstance as a shorthand throughout this opinion. See also id.,&para;<br>§15.19[3][a]; Advisory Committee’s 1966 Notes on Fed. Rule Civ.&para;<br>Proc. 15, 28 U. S. C.

A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>15(c)(1)(C)(ii), then, is whether party A knew or should&para;<br>have known that, absent some mistake, the action would&para;<br>have been brought against him.&para;<br>Respondent urges that the key issue under Rule&para;<br>15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is whether the plaintiff made a deliberate&para;<br>choice to sue one party over another. Brief for Respondent&para;<br>11–16. We agree that making a deliberate choice to sue&para;<br>one party instead of another while fully understanding the&para;<br>factual and legal differences between the two parties is the&para;<br>antithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper&para;<br>party’s identity. We disagree, however, with respondent’s&para;<br>position that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence&para;<br>of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the&para;<br>proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plain&para;<br>tiff made no mistake. The reasonableness of the mistake&para;<br>is not itself at issue. As noted, a plaintiff might know that&para;<br>the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless harbor a&para;<br>misunderstanding about his status or role in the events&para;<br>giving rise to the claim at issue, and she may mistakenly&para;<br>choose to sue a different defendant based on that misim&para;<br>pression. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice does&para;<br>not foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been&para;<br>satisfied.&para;<br>This reading is consistent with the purpose of relation&para;<br>back: to balance the interests of the defendant protected&para;<br>by the statute of limitations with the preference expressed&para;<br>in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and&para;<br>Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their mer&para;<br>its. See, e.g., Advisory Committee’s 1966 Notes 122; 3&para;<br>Moore’s Federal Practice §§15.02[1], 15.19[3][a] (3d ed.&para;<br>2009). A prospective defendant who legitimately believed&para;<br>that the limitations period had passed without any at&para;<br>tempt to sue him has a strong interest in repose. But&para;<br>repose would be a windfall for a prospective defendant&para;<br>who understood, or who should have understood, that he&para;<br>escaped suit during the limitations period only because&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the plaintiff misunderstood a crucial fact about his iden&para;<br>tity. Because a plaintiff’s knowledge of the existence of a&para;<br>party does not foreclose the possibility that she has made&para;<br>a mistake of identity about which that party should have&para;<br>been aware, such knowledge does not support that party’s&para;<br>interest in repose.&para;<br>Our reading is also consistent with the history of Rule&para;<br>15(c)(1)(C). That provision was added in 1966 to respond&para;<br>to a recurring problem in suits against the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment, particularly in the Social Security context.&para;<br>Advisory Committee’s 1966 Notes 122. Individuals who&para;<br>had filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative&para;<br>denial of benefits often failed to name the party identified&para;<br>in the statute as the proper defendant—the current Secre&para;<br>tary of what was then the Department of Health, Educa&para;<br>tion, and Welfare—and named instead the United States;&para;<br>the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare itself;&para;<br>the nonexistent “Federal Security Administration”; or a&para;<br>Secretary who had recently retired from office. Ibid. By&para;<br>the time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes, the&para;<br>statute of limitations in many cases had expired, and the&para;<br>district courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the&para;<br>ground that the amended complaints would not relate&para;<br>back. Rule 15(c) was therefore “amplified to provide a&para;<br>general solution” to this problem. Ibid. It is conceivable&para;<br>that the Social Security litigants knew or reasonably&para;<br>should have known the identity of the proper defendant&para;<br>either because of documents in their administrative cases&para;<br>or by dint of the statute setting forth the filing require&para;<br>ments. See 42 U. S. C. §405(g) (1958 ed., Supp. III).&para;<br>Nonetheless, the Advisory Committee clearly meant their&para;<br>filings to qualify as mistakes under the Rule.&para;<br>Respondent suggests that our decision in Nelson v.&para;<br>Adams USA, Inc., 529 U. S. 460 (2000), forecloses the&para;<br>reading of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) we adopt today. We dis&para;<br>agree. In that case, Adams USA, Inc. (Adams), had ob&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tained an award of attorney’s fees against the corporation&para;<br>of which Donald Nelson was the president and sole share&para;<br>holder. After Adams became concerned that the corpora&para;<br>tion did not have sufficient funds to pay the award, Adams&para;<br>sought to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party and&para;<br>simultaneously moved to amend the judgment to hold&para;<br>Nelson responsible. The District Court granted both&para;<br>motions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,&para;<br>holding that the requirements of due process, as codified&para;<br>in Rules 12 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,&para;<br>demand that an added party have the opportunity to&para;<br>respond before judgment is entered against him. Id., at&para;<br>465–467. In a footnote explaining that relation back does&para;<br>not deny the added party an opportunity to respond to the&para;<br>amended pleading, we noted that the case did not arise&para;<br>under the “mistake clause” of Rule 15(c):4 “Respondent&para;<br>Adams made no such mistake. It knew of Nelson’s role&para;<br>and existence and, until it moved to amend its pleading,&para;<br>chose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against&para;<br>[Nelson’s company].” Id., at 467, n. 1.&para;<br>Contrary to respondent’s claim, Nelson does not suggest&para;<br>that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) cannot be satisfied if a plaintiff&para;<br>knew of the prospective defendant’s existence at the time&para;<br>she filed her original complaint. In that case, there was&para;<br>nothing in the initial pleading suggesting that Nelson was&para;<br>an intended party, while there was evidence in the record&para;<br>(of which Nelson was aware) that Adams sought to add&para;<br>him only after learning that the company would not be&para;<br>able to satisfy the judgment. Id., at 463–464. This evi&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The “mistake clause” at the time we decided Nelson was set forth in&para;<br>Rule 15(c)(3). 529 U. S., at 467, n. 1; 528 F. R. D. 525, 529 (1991). Rule&para;<br>15(c) was renumbered in 2007 without substantive change “as part of&para;<br>the general restyling of the Civil Rules,” at which time it received its&para;<br>current placement in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). Advisory Committee’s 2007&para;<br>Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 37 (2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. II).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

We said, after all, that&para;<br>Adams knew of Nelson’s “role” as well as his existence.&para;<br>Id., at 467, n. 1. Read in context, the footnote in Nelson is&para;<br>entirely consistent with our understanding of the Rule:&para;<br>When the original complaint and the plaintiff’s conduct&para;<br>compel the conclusion that the failure to name the pro&para;<br>spective defendant in the original complaint was the result&para;<br>of a fully informed decision as opposed to a mistake con&para;<br>cerning the proper defendant’s identity, the requirements&para;<br>of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are not met. This conclusion is in&para;<br>keeping with our rejection today of the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>reliance on the plaintiff’s knowledge to deny relation back.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court of Appeals offered a second reason why Krup&para;<br>ski’s amended complaint did not relate back: Krupski had&para;<br>unduly delayed in seeking to file, and in eventually filing,&para;<br>an amended complaint. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals offered no support for its view that a&para;<br>plaintiff’s dilatory conduct can justify the denial of relation&para;<br>back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), and we find none. The Rule&para;<br>plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for&para;<br>relation back, and the amending party’s diligence is not&para;<br>among them. Moreover, the Rule mandates relation back&para;<br>once the Rule’s requirements are satisfied; it does not&para;<br>leave the decision whether to grant relation back to the&para;<br>district court’s equitable discretion. See Rule 15(c)(1) (“An&para;<br>amendment . . . relates back . . . when” the three listed&para;<br>requirements are met (emphasis added)).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The mandatory nature of the inquiry for relation back&para;<br>under Rule 15(c) is particularly striking in contrast to the&para;<br>inquiry under Rule 15(a), which sets forth the circum&para;<br>stances in which a party may amend its pleading before&para;<br>trial. By its terms, Rule 15(a) gives discretion to the&para;<br>district court in deciding whether to grant a motion to&para;<br>amend a pleading to add a party or a claim. Following an&para;<br>initial period after filing a pleading during which a party&para;<br>may amend once “as a matter of course,” “a party may&para;<br>amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written&para;<br>consent or the court’s leave,” which the court “should&para;<br>freely give . . . when justice so requires.” Rules 15(a)(1)–&para;<br>(2). We have previously explained that a court may con&para;<br>sider a movant’s “undue delay” or “dilatory motive” in&para;<br>deciding whether to grant leave to amend under Rule&para;<br>15(a). Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962). As the&para;<br>contrast between Rule 15(a) and Rule 15(c) makes clear,&para;<br>however, the speed with which a plaintiff moves to amend&para;<br>her complaint or files an amended complaint after obtain&para;<br>ing leave to do so has no bearing on whether the amended&para;<br>complaint relates back. Cf. 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M.&para;<br>Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §1498, pp. 142–143,&para;<br>and nn. 49–50 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2010).&para;<br>Rule 15(c)(1)(C) does permit a court to examine a plain&para;<br>tiff’s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but not in the&para;<br>way or for the purpose respondent or the Court of Appeals&para;<br>suggests. As we have explained, the question under Rule&para;<br>15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is what the prospective defendant reasona&para;<br>bly should have understood about the plaintiff’s intent in&para;<br>filing the original complaint against the first defendant.&para;<br>To the extent the plaintiff’s postfiling conduct informs the&para;<br>prospective defendant’s understanding of whether the&para;<br>plaintiff initially made a “mistake concerning the proper&para;<br>party’s identity,” a court may consider the conduct. Cf.&para;<br>Leonard v. Parry, 219 F. 3d 25, 29 (CA1 2000) (“[P]ost&para;<br>filing events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiff’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The plaintiff’s postfiling&para;<br>conduct is otherwise immaterial to the question whether&para;<br>an amended complaint relates back.5&para;<br>C&para;<br>Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we&para;<br>think it clear that the courts below erred in denying rela&para;<br>tion back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court&para;<br>held that Costa Crociere had “constructive notice” of&para;<br>Krupski’s complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 15a–17a. Costa Crociere has not challenged&para;<br>this finding. Because the complaint made clear that Krup&para;<br>ski meant to sue the company that “owned, operated,&para;<br>managed, supervised and controlled” the ship on which&para;<br>she was injured, App. 23, and also indicated (mistakenly)&para;<br>that Costa Cruise performed those roles, id., at 23–27,&para;<br>Costa Crociere should have known, within the Rule 4(m)&para;<br>period, that it was not named as a defendant in that com&para;<br>plaint only because of Krupski’s misunderstanding about&para;<br>which “Costa” entity was in charge of the ship—clearly a&para;<br>“mistake concerning the proper party’s identity.”&para;<br>Respondent contends that because the original com&para;<br>plaint referred to the ticket’s forum requirement and&para;<br>presuit claims notification procedure, Krupski was clearly&para;<br>aware of the contents of the ticket, and because the ticket&para;<br>identified Costa Crociere as the carrier and proper party&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Similarly,&para;<br>&para;<br>we reject respondent’s suggestion that Rule 15(c) requires&para;<br>a plaintiff to move to amend her complaint or to file and serve an&para;<br>amended complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i)&para;<br>simply requires that the prospective defendant has received sufficient&para;<br>“notice of the action” within the Rule 4(m) period that he will not be&para;<br>prejudiced in defending the case on the merits. The Advisory Commit&para;<br>tee Notes to the 1966 Amendment clarify that “the notice need not be&para;<br>formal.” Advisory Committee’s 1966 Notes 122.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>KRUPSKI v.

Brief for Respondent 13. As we have&para;<br>explained, however, that Krupski may have known the&para;<br>contents of the ticket does not foreclose the possibility that&para;<br>she nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the&para;<br>two companies’ identities. Especially because the face of&para;<br>the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,&para;<br>respondent’s contention is not persuasive. Moreover,&para;<br>respondent has articulated no strategy that it could rea&para;<br>sonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a&para;<br>defendant that was legally unable to provide relief.&para;<br>Respondent also argues that Krupski’s failure to move&para;<br>to amend her complaint during the Rule 4(m) period&para;<br>shows that she made no mistake in that period. Id., at&para;<br>13–14. But as discussed, any delay on Krupski’s part is&para;<br>relevant only to the extent it may have informed Costa&para;<br>Crociere’s understanding during the Rule 4(m) period of&para;<br>whether she made a mistake originally. Krupski’s failure&para;<br>to add Costa Crociere during the Rule 4(m) period is not&para;<br>sufficient to make reasonable any belief that she had&para;<br>made a deliberate and informed decision not to sue Costa&para;<br>Crociere in the first instance.6 Nothing in Krupski’s con&para;<br>duct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed&para;<br>to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a&para;<br>mistake.&para;<br>It is also worth noting that Costa Cruise and Costa&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The Court of Appeals concluded that Krupski was not diligent&para;<br>merely because she did not seek leave to add Costa Crociere until 133&para;<br>days after she filed her original complaint and did not actually file an&para;<br>amended complaint for another a month after that. 330 Fed.

In addition, Costa Crociere’s own actions contrib&para;<br>uted to passenger confusion over “the proper party” for a&para;<br>lawsuit.
