TEXAS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1438. Argued November 2, 2010—Decided April 20, 2011&para;<br>After this Court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of&para;<br>1993 was unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments&para;<br>because it exceeded Congress’ power under §5 of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, Congress&para;<br>passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of&para;<br>2000 (RLUIPA) pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce&para;<br>Clause authority. RLUIPA targets two areas of state and local ac&para;<br>tion: land–use regulation, RLUIPA §2, 42 U. S. C. §2000cc, and re&para;<br>strictions on the religious exercise of institutionalized persons,&para;<br>RLUIPA §3, §2000cc–1. It also provides an express private cause of&para;<br>action for “appropriate relief against a government,” §2000cc–2(a),&para;<br>including, inter alia, States, their instrumentalities and officers, and&para;<br>persons acting under color of state law, §2000cc–5(4)(A).&para;<br>Petitioner Sossamon, a Texas prison inmate, sued respondents, the&para;<br>State and prison officials, seeking injunctive and monetary relief un&para;<br>der RLUIPA for prison policies that prevented inmates from attend&para;<br>ing religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infrac&para;<br>tions and that barred use of the prison chapel for religious worship.&para;<br>Granting respondents summary judgment, the District Court held&para;<br>that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon’s claims for monetary re&para;<br>lief. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the statutory phrase&para;<br>“appropriate relief against a government” did not unambiguously no&para;<br>tify Texas that its acceptance of federal funds was conditioned on a&para;<br>waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for monetary relief.&para;<br>Held: States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their&para;<br>sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under&para;<br>RLUIPA. Pp. 4–14.&para;<br>(a) Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important constitu&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v. TEXAS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tional limitation on the power of the federal courts. See Pennhurst&para;<br>State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98. This&para;<br>Court has consistently made clear that “federal jurisdiction over suits&para;<br>against unconsenting States ‘was not contemplated by the Constitu&para;<br>tion when establishing the judicial power of the United States.’ ”&para;<br>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54. A State, however,&para;<br>may choose to waive its immunity. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436,&para;<br>447–448. The “ ‘test for determining whether [it has done so] is a&para;<br>stringent one.’ ” College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsec­&para;<br>ondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675. The State’s consent to&para;<br>suit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the relevant statute’s text.&para;<br>Pennhurst, supra, at 99. A waiver “will be strictly construed, in&para;<br>terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S.&para;<br>187, 192. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) RLUIPA’s authorization of “appropriate relief against a gov&para;<br>ernment,” is not an unequivocal expression of state consent. Pp. 6–&para;<br>10.&para;<br>(1) “Appropriate relief” is open-ended and ambiguous about the&para;<br>relief it includes. “Appropriate” is inherently context-dependent.&para;<br>And the context here—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests,&para;<br>if anything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or “proper.”&para;<br>See Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535&para;<br>U. S. 743, 765. Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple&para;<br>plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this&para;<br>Court will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immu&para;<br>nity. Sossamon’s and Texas’ conflicting plausible arguments about&para;<br>whether immunity is preserved here demonstrate that “appropriate&para;<br>relief” in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that the Court may&para;<br>conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivo&para;<br>cally expressed intent to waive their immunity. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(2) The Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate relief” in Franklin&para;<br>v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and Barnes v. Gor­&para;<br>man, 536 U. S. 181, does not compel a contrary conclusion. In those&para;<br>cases, where there was no express congressional intent to limit reme&para;<br>dies available against municipal entities under an implied right of&para;<br>action, the Court presumed that compensatory damages were avail&para;<br>able. Franklin, supra, at 73. But that presumption is irrelevant to&para;<br>construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity,&para;<br>where the question is not whether Congress has given clear direction&para;<br>that it intends to exclude a damages remedy, but whether it has&para;<br>given clear direction that it intends to include a damages remedy.&para;<br>Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(c) Sossamon mistakenly contends that Congress’ enactment of&para;<br>RLUIPA §3 pursuant to the Spending Clause put the States on notice&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legis&para;<br>lation operates as a contract and damages are always available for a&para;<br>breach of contract. While acknowledging the contract-law analogy,&para;<br>this Court has been clear “not [to] imply . . . that suits under Spend&para;<br>ing Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law prin&para;<br>ciples apply to all issues that they raise,” Barnes, supra, at 188, n. 2,&para;<br>or to rely on that analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist&para;<br>under nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability&para;<br>against the States. Applying ordinary contract principles here would&para;<br>also make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique:&para;<br>They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to en&para;<br>force compliance. More fundamentally, Sossamon’s implied-contract&para;<br>remedy cannot be squared with the rule that a sovereign immunity&para;<br>waiver must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the relevant&para;<br>statute’s text. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>(d) Sossamon also errs in arguing that Texas was put on notice that&para;<br>it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA by §1003 of the Rehabili&para;<br>tation Act Amendments of 1986, which expressly waives state sover&para;<br>eign immunity for violations of “section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act&para;<br>of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Dis&para;<br>crimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the&para;<br>provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by&para;<br>recipients of Federal financial assistance,” 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7.&para;<br>Even if such a residual clause could constitute an unequivocal textual&para;<br>waiver, RLUIPA §3—which prohibits “substantial burden[s]” on reli&para;<br>gious exercise—is not unequivocally a “statute prohibiting discrimi&para;<br>nation” within §1003’s meaning. All the statutory provisions enu&para;<br>merated in §1003 explicitly prohibit discrimination; a State might&para;<br>reasonably conclude that the residual clause, strictly construed, cov&para;<br>ers only provisions using the term “discrimination.” Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>560 F. 3d 316, affirmed.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

Smith, 494 U. S.&para;<br>872 (1990). Congress first enacted the Religious Freedom&para;<br>Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000bb et seq., with which it intended to “restore&para;<br>the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v.&para;<br>Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406&para;<br>U.

TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>generally Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União&para;<br>do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 424 (2006). We held RFRA&para;<br>unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments&para;<br>because it exceeded Congress’ power under §5 of the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.&para;<br>507 (1997).&para;<br>Congress responded by enacting RLUIPA pursuant to&para;<br>its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.&para;<br>RLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA—which&para;<br>continues to apply to the Federal Government—but&para;<br>RLUIPA is less sweeping in scope. See Cutter v. Wilkin­&para;<br>son, 544 U. S. 709, 715 (2005). It targets two areas of&para;<br>state and local action: land-use regulation, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000cc (RLUIPA §2), and restrictions on the religious&para;<br>exercise of institutionalized persons, §2000cc–1 (RLUIPA&para;<br>§3).&para;<br>Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that “[n]o government&para;<br>shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exer&para;<br>cise” of an institutionalized person unless, as in RFRA, the&para;<br>government demonstrates that the burden “is in further&para;<br>ance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the&para;<br>least restrictive means of furthering” that interest.&para;<br>§2000cc–1(a); cf. §§2000bb–1(a), (b). As relevant here, §3&para;<br>applies “in any case” in which “the substantial burden is&para;<br>imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal&para;<br>financial assistance.”1 §2000cc–1(b)(1).&para;<br>RLUIPA also includes an express private cause of action&para;<br>that is taken from RFRA: “A person may assert a violation&para;<br>of [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding&para;<br>and obtain appropriate relief against a government.”&para;<br>§2000cc–2(a); cf. §2000bb–1(c). For purposes of this provi&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 No party contends that the Commerce Clause permitted Congress to&para;<br>address the alleged burden on religious exercise at issue in this case.&para;<br>See 42 U.

We therefore do&para;<br>not address those issues.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

In 2006, Sos&para;<br>samon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials&para;<br>in their official capacities under RLUIPA’s private cause of&para;<br>action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. Sossamon&para;<br>alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a&para;<br>policy preventing inmates from attending religious ser&para;<br>vices while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions;&para;<br>and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for reli&para;<br>gious worship. The District Court granted summary&para;<br>judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant&para;<br>here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon’s claims&para;<br>for monetary relief.2 See 713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 662–663&para;<br>(WD Tex. 2007).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 560&para;<br>F. 3d 316, 329 (2009). Acknowledging that Congress&para;<br>enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the&para;<br>court determined that Texas had not waived its sovereign&para;<br>immunity by accepting federal funds. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals strictly construed the text of RLUIPA’s cause of&para;<br>action in favor of the State and concluded that the statu&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The District Court also denied injunctive relief. 713 F.

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that&para;<br>Sossamon’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction&para;<br>policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after&para;<br>Sossamon filed a prison grievance. 560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009). The&para;<br>Court of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon’s&para;<br>chapel-use policy claim, id., at 331–335, although the Robertson Unit&para;<br>later amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend&para;<br>scheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety&para;<br>precautions.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v.

Id., at 330–331. We granted&para;<br>certiorari to resolve a division of authority among the&para;<br>courts of appeals on this question.3 560 U.

See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal­&para;<br>derman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). For over a century now,&para;<br>this Court has consistently made clear that “federal juris&para;<br>diction over suits against unconsenting States ‘was not&para;<br>contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the&para;<br>judicial power of the United States.’ ” Seminole Tribe of&para;<br>Fla. v.

A State, however, may choose to waive&para;<br>its immunity in federal court at its pleasure. Clark v.&para;<br>Barnard, 108 U.

Florida Prepaid&para;<br>Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675 (1999)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). A State’s consent to&para;<br>suit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the text of the&para;<br>relevant statute. Pennhurst State School and Hospital,&para;<br>supra, at 99; see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473&para;<br>U. S. 234, 238, n. 1, 239–240 (1985). Only by requiring&para;<br>this “clear declaration” by the State can we be “certain&para;<br>that the State in fact consents to suit.” College Savings&para;<br>Bank, 527 U. S., at 680. Waiver may not be implied. Id.,&para;<br>at 682.&para;<br>For these reasons, a waiver of sovereign immunity “will&para;<br>be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the&para;<br>sovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U.

Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503&para;<br>U. S. 30, 37 (1992) (equating the “unequivocal expression” principle&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v.

Similarly, a waiver&para;<br>of sovereign immunity to other types of relief does not&para;<br>waive immunity to damages: “[T]he waiver of sovereign&para;<br>immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary&para;<br>claims.” Lane, supra, at 192; cf. United States v. Nordic&para;<br>Village, 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (construing an ambiguous&para;<br>waiver of sovereign immunity to permit equitable but not&para;<br>monetary claims); Hoffman v.

TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1989) (holding that “a permissible inference” is not the&para;<br>necessary “unequivocal declaration” that States were&para;<br>intended to be subject to damages actions); Nordic Village,&para;<br>supra, at 37 (holding that the existence of “plausible”&para;<br>interpretations that would not permit recovery “is enough&para;<br>to establish that a reading imposing monetary liability on&para;<br>the Government is not ‘unambiguous’ and therefore should&para;<br>not be adopted”). That is the case here.&para;<br>Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly&para;<br>limits the United States to “injunctive or declaratory&para;<br>relief ” to enforce the statute, the phrase “appropriate re&para;<br>lief ” in the private cause of action necessarily must be&para;<br>broader. 42 U. S. C. §2000cc–2(f). Texas responds that,&para;<br>because the State has no immunity defense to a suit&para;<br>brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to&para;<br>exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in&para;<br>the context of private suits. Further, the private cause of&para;<br>action provides that a person may assert a violation of the&para;<br>statute “as a claim or defense.” §2000cc–2(a) (emphasis&para;<br>added). Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is&para;<br>not “appropriate relief ” for a successful defense, Texas&para;<br>explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to&para;<br>those forms of relief would make no sense.&para;<br>Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires&para;<br>that it be “construed in favor of a broad protection of&para;<br>religious exercise.” §2000cc–3(g). Texas responds that&para;<br>this provision is best read as addressing the substantive&para;<br>standards in the statute, not the scope of “appropriate&para;<br>relief.” Texas also highlights Congress’ choice of the word&para;<br>“relief,” which it argues primarily connotes equitable&para;<br>relief. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999)&para;<br>(defining “relief ” as “[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable&para;<br>in nature . . . , that a party asks of a court”).&para;<br>These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase&para;<br>“appropriate relief ” in RLUIPA is not so free from ambigu&para;<br>ity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60&para;<br>(1992), and Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181 (2002), does&para;<br>not compel a contrary conclusion. In those cases, the&para;<br>Court addressed what remedies are available against&para;<br>municipal entities under the implied right of action to&para;<br>enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,&para;<br>§202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and&para;<br>§504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With no statutory&para;<br>text to interpret, the Court “presume[d] the availability of&para;<br>all appropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d] expressly&para;<br>indicated otherwise.” Franklin, 503 U. S., at 66. The&para;<br>Court described the presumption as “[t]he general rule”&para;<br>that “the federal courts have the power to award any&para;<br>appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought&para;<br>pursuant to a federal statute.” Id., at 70–71 (emphasis&para;<br>added); see Barnes, supra, at 185 (quoting Franklin, su­&para;<br>pra, at 73). Finding no express congressional intent to&para;<br>limit the remedies available under the implied right of&para;<br>action, the Court held that compensatory damages were&para;<br>available. Franklin, supra, at 73.&para;<br>The presumption in Franklin and Barnes is irrelevant to&para;<br>construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign&para;<br>immunity. See Lane, supra, at 196 (“[R]eliance on Frank­&para;<br>lin . . . is misplaced” in determining whether damages are&para;<br>available against the Federal Government). The question&para;<br>here is not whether Congress has given clear direction&para;<br>that it intends to exclude a damages remedy, see Franklin,&para;<br>supra, at 70–71, but whether Congress has given clear&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v. TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>direction that it intends to include a damages remedy.&para;<br>The text must “establish unambiguously that the waiver&para;<br>extends to monetary claims.” Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at&para;<br>34. In Franklin and Barnes, congressional silence had an&para;<br>entirely different implication than it does here. Whatever&para;<br>“appropriate relief ” might have meant in those cases does&para;<br>not translate to this context.6&para;<br>B&para;<br>Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted §3 of&para;<br>RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States&para;<br>were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for&para;<br>damages. He argues that Spending Clause legislation&para;<br>operates as a contract and damages are always available&para;<br>relief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explic&para;<br>itly includes a damages remedy or not. Relying on Barnes&para;<br>and Franklin, he asserts that all recipients of federal&para;<br>funding are “ ‘generally on notice that [they are] subject&para;<br>. . . to those remedies traditionally available in suits for&para;<br>breach of contract,’ ” including compensatory damages.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 27 (quoting Barnes, 536 U.

Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court&para;<br>had no occasion to consider sovereign immunity. Liability against&para;<br>nonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be&para;<br>liable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.&para;<br>Moreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to&para;<br>include damages relief against the Federal Government or the States&para;<br>and so could have signaled to the States that damages are not “appro&para;<br>priate relief ” under RLUIPA. See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp.&para;<br>384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v.&para;<br>New York, 954 F.

We have not relied on the&para;<br>Spending Clause contract analogy to expand liability&para;<br>beyond what would exist under non-spending statutes,&para;<br>much less to extend monetary liability against the States,&para;<br>as Sossamon would have us do. In fact, in Barnes and&para;<br>Franklin, the Court discussed the Spending Clause con&para;<br>text only as a potential limitation on liability. See Barnes,&para;<br>supra, at 187–188; Franklin, supra, at 74–75.&para;<br>In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here&para;<br>would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign&para;<br>are unique. They do not traditionally confer a right of&para;<br>action for damages to enforce compliance: “ ‘The contracts&para;<br>between a Nation and an individual are only binding on&para;<br>the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to&para;<br>compulsive force. They confer no right of action independ&para;<br>ent of the sovereign will.’ ” Lynch v. United States, 292&para;<br>U. S. 571, 580–581 (1934) (quoting The Federalist, No. 81,&para;<br>at 511 (A. Hamilton)).7&para;<br>More fundamentally, Sossamon’s implied-contract&para;<br>remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstand&para;<br>ing rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be&para;<br>expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the rele&para;<br>vant statute. It would be bizarre to create an “unequivocal&para;<br>statement” rule and then find that every Spending Clause&para;<br>enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule&para;<br>because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against&para;<br>the States. The requirement of a clear statement in the&para;<br>text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically&para;<br>considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally&para;<br>legislated on the matter. Cf. Spector v. Norwegian Cruise&para;<br>Line Ltd., 545 U. S. 119, 139 (2005) (plurality opinion)&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Of course, the Federal Government has, by statute, waived its sov&para;<br>ereign immunity to damages for breach of contract in certain contexts.&para;<br>See, e.g., 28 U.

TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(“[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by&para;<br>broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic&para;<br>inadvertently or without due deliberation”). Without such&para;<br>a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States,&para;<br>federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sover&para;<br>eign immunity.8&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Sossamon also argues that §1003 of the Rehabilitation&para;<br>Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7, independ&para;<br>ently put the State on notice that it could be sued for&para;<br>damages under RLUIPA. That provision expressly waives&para;<br>state sovereign immunity for violations of “section 504 of&para;<br>the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education&para;<br>Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975,&para;<br>title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of&para;<br>any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by&para;<br>recipients of Federal financial assistance.” §2000d–7(a)(1)&para;<br>(emphasis added). Section 1003 makes “remedies (includ&para;<br>ing remedies both at law and in equity) . . . available for&para;<br>such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are&para;<br>available for such a violation in the suit against any public&para;<br>or private entity other than a State.” §2000d–7(a)(2).&para;<br>Sossamon contends that §3 of RLUIPA falls within the&para;<br>residual clause of §1003 and therefore §1003 waives Texas’&para;<br>sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent finds our decision “difficult to understand,” post, at 6&para;<br>(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court’s&para;<br>precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent&para;<br>gives astonishingly short shrift. The dissent instead concerns itself&para;<br>primarily with “general remedies principles.” Post, at 1. The essence of&para;<br>sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government&para;<br>differ from “general remedies principles” applicable to private litigants.&para;<br>See, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 196 (1996) (calling it a “crucial&para;<br>point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign&para;<br>immunity places the . . .

This distinction is espe&para;<br>cially conspicuous in light of §2 of RLUIPA, in which&para;<br>Congress expressly prohibited “land use regulation[s] that&para;<br>discriminat[e] . . . on the basis of religion.” §2000cc(b)(2).&para;<br>A waiver of sovereign immunity must be “strictly con&para;<br>strued, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.”&para;<br>Lane, 518 U.

In arguing that&para;<br>“a waiver of sovereign immunity to other types of relief&para;<br>does not waive immunity to damages,” ante, at 6 (empha&para;<br>sis added), the majority appears to accept that equitable&para;<br>relief is available to RLUIPA plaintiffs. See Madison, 474&para;<br>F. 3d, at 131 (holding that a RLUIPA plaintiff’s “claims for&para;<br>equitable relief are not barred by the Eleventh Amend&para;<br>ment”); cf. 560 F. 3d 316, 331, 336 (CA5 2009) (reversing&para;<br>the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Texas&para;<br>on one of petitioner’s RLUIPA claims for declaratory and&para;<br>injunctive relief ). The explanation for the majority’s&para;<br>implicit acceptance of suits for injunctive and declaratory&para;<br>relief is obvious enough: It would be a particularly curious&para;<br>reading of the statute to conclude that Congress’ express&para;<br>provision of a private right of action to seek “appropriate&para;<br>relief” against “a State” nonetheless left plaintiffs suing&para;<br>for state violations of RLUIPA with no available relief.&para;<br>It is not apparent, however, why the phrase “appropri&para;<br>ate relief” is too ambiguous to secure a waiver of state&para;<br>sovereign immunity with respect to damages but is clear&para;<br>enough as to injunctive and other forms of equitable relief.&para;<br>The majority appears to believe that equitable relief is a&para;<br>“suitable” or “proper” remedy for a state violation of&para;<br>RLUIPA’s substantive provisions but monetary relief is&para;<br>not; therefore, a state official reading the “open-ended and&para;<br>ambiguous” phrase “appropriate relief” will be unaware&para;<br>that it includes damages but fully apprised that it makes&para;<br>equitable relief available. See ante, at 6–7. But sovereign&para;<br>immunity is not simply a defense against certain classes of&para;<br>remedies—it is a defense against being sued at all. See,&para;<br>e.g., Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports&para;<br>Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002). As a result, there is&para;<br>no inherent reason why the phrase “appropriate relief”&para;<br>would provide adequate notice as to equitable remedies&para;<br>but not as to monetary ones. In fact, as discussed earlier,&para;<br>in light of general remedies principles the presumption&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v. TEXAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>arguably should be the reverse. See supra, at 4–6.&para;<br>The majority suggests that equitable relief is the sole&para;<br>“appropriate relief” for statutory violations “where the&para;<br>defendant is a sovereign.” Ante, at 6–7. There can be&para;<br>little doubt, however, that the “appropriateness” of relief&para;<br>to be afforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by&para;<br>the nature of the injury to his legal rights. See Franklin,&para;<br>503 U. S., at 76 (concluding that monetary damages were&para;<br>“appropriate” because equitable relief offered no redress&para;<br>for the injury suffered); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433&para;<br>U. S. 267, 280 (1977) (“[T]he nature of the . . . remedy is to&para;<br>be determined by the nature and scope of the . . . viola&para;<br>tion”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (“[W]here&para;<br>federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been&para;<br>the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to&para;<br>adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief”).&para;<br>In support of its proposition the majority cites only to a&para;<br>case in which we expressly rejected the argument that&para;<br>state sovereign immunity operates differently according to&para;<br>what type of relief is sought. See Federal Maritime, 535&para;<br>U. S., at 765 (“[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of&para;<br>whether a private plaintiff’s suit is for monetary damages&para;<br>or some other type of relief”); cf. id., at 769 (“[T]he primary&para;<br>function of sovereign immunity is not to protect state&para;<br>treasuries, but to afford the States the dignity and respect&para;<br>due sovereign entities” (citation omitted)). Nor is the basis&para;<br>for the majority’s view apparent from the other cases that&para;<br>it cites.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 In&para;<br>&para;<br>Lane v. Peña, 518 U.

S. 96 (1989), we simply reaffirmed the&para;<br>principle that a sovereign’s liability for damages must be unambigu&para;<br>ously expressed in the statute purporting to waive immunity; as dem&para;<br>onstrated above, RLUIPA satisfies this requirement. The majority&para;<br>tellingly relies on the dissent’s assertion in West v. Gibson, 527 U. S.&para;<br>212 (1999), that the phrase “appropriate remedies” was too ambiguous&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The majority’s additional arguments in support of its&para;<br>holding also fail to persuade. The majority contends that&para;<br>the use of a “context-dependent” word like “appropriate”&para;<br>necessarily renders the provision ambiguous. Ante, at 7.&para;<br>But the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may&para;<br>vary depending on the particular injury to be addressed in&para;<br>a given case does not render §2000cc–2(a) ambiguous; it&para;<br>simply means that Congress meant for that provision to be&para;<br>comprehensive. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections&para;<br>v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[T]he fact that&para;<br>a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anti&para;<br>cipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It&para;<br>demonstrates breadth” (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted)); cf. West v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212, 217–218 (1999)&para;<br>(holding that the phrase “appropriate remedies” in 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000e–16(b) includes remedies not expressly&para;<br>enumerated).&para;<br>Next, the majority repeats Texas’s dictionary-based&para;<br>contention that in using the word “relief” Congress meant&para;<br>to “connot[e] equitable relief.” Ante, at 8. This proposition&para;<br>suffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the&para;<br>dictionary to which the majority cites. See Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (“relief: . . . Also termed&para;<br>remedy”); id., at 1296 (“remedy: . . . The means of enforc&para;<br>ing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong; legal or&para;<br>equitable relief” (emphasis added)). Second, it is inconsis&para;<br>tent with our precedent. See Barnes, 536 U. S., at 185–&para;<br>187 (noting that “appropriate relief” includes monetary&para;<br>and injunctive relief ). Third, it is undermined by the fact&para;<br>that, on numerous occasions, Congress has deemed it&para;<br>necessary to specify that “relief” includes injunctive and&para;<br>other equitable relief. See 16 U. S. C. §973i(e) (authoriz&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>to waive sovereign immunity to monetary relief. See id., at 226 (opin&para;<br>ion of KENNEDY, J.). Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not&para;<br>&para;<br>mandate the conclusion it draws today. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v. TEXAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing the Attorney General to “commence a civil action&para;<br>for appropriate relief, including permanent or temporary injunction”); see also 2 U. S. C. §437g(a)(6)(A); 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1324a(f)(2); 12 U. S. C. §1715z–4a(b); 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§6309(a). If the term “relief” already connotes equitable&para;<br>relief—and only equitable relief—additional explication is&para;<br>redundant.&para;<br>Finally, the majority asserts that because the parties to&para;<br>this case advance opposing “plausible arguments” regard&para;<br>ing the correct interpretation of RLUIPA’s text, we must&para;<br>conclude that the statute is ambiguous. Ante, at 8–9. This&para;<br>view of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descrip&para;<br>tive matter. See, e.g., Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U. S. 379,&para;<br>390 (2009) (reviewing the parties’ conflicting textual in&para;<br>terpretations of a statute but concluding that it was un&para;<br>ambiguous nonetheless). Moreover, I cannot agree with&para;<br>the majority that our capacity to interpret authoritatively&para;<br>the text of a federal statute is held hostage to the litigants’&para;<br>strategic arguments. If this were true, there would be few&para;<br>cases in which we would be able to decide that a statute&para;<br>was unambiguous.&para;<br>In sum, the majority’s conclusion that States accepting&para;<br>federal funds have not consented to suit for monetary&para;<br>relief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availabil&para;<br>ity of such relief is evident in light of RLUIPA’s plain&para;<br>terms and the principles animating our relevant prece&para;<br>dents. In so holding, the majority discovers ambiguity&para;<br>where none is to be found.&para;<br>II&para;<br>There is another reason to question the soundness of&para;<br>today’s decision. The Court’s reading of §2000cc–2(a)&para;<br>severely undermines Congress’ unmistakably stated intent&para;<br>in passing the statute: to afford “broad protection of reli&para;<br>gious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>terms of [the statute] and the Constitution.” §2000cc–3(g).&para;<br>I find it improbable that, in light of this express statutory&para;<br>purpose and the history of “long-running congressional&para;<br>efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection&para;<br>from government-imposed burdens,” Cutter v. Wilkinson,&para;<br>544 U. S. 709, 714 (2005), state officials would read&para;<br>RLUIPA’s relief provision in the same limited manner the&para;<br>majority does.5&para;<br>As the majority acknowledges, RLUIPA was Congress’&para;<br>second attempt to guarantee by statute the “broad protec&para;<br>tion” of religious exercise that we found to be unwarranted&para;<br>as a constitutional matter in Employment Div., Dept. of&para;<br>Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990).&para;<br>As we have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA&para;<br>Congress was clearly concerned that state institutions&para;<br>regularly imposed “frivolous or arbitrary barriers im&para;<br>ped[ing] institutionalized persons’ religious exercise.”&para;<br>Cutter, 544 U. S., at 716 (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted); see also 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) (joint&para;<br>statement of Sen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA)&para;<br>(“Whether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of&para;<br>resources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 I agree with the majority’s conclusion that, because Section 3 of&para;<br>RLUIPA, addressing the rights of institutionalized persons, is not a&para;<br>“provisio[n] of [a] . . . Federal statute prohibiting discrimination” within&para;<br>the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000d–7(a)(1), the latter statute’s waiver provision does not put the&para;<br>States on notice that they can be sued for damages under RLUIPA. See&para;<br>ante, at 12–14. It bears noting, however, that Section 2 of RLUIPA&para;<br>explicitly prohibits discrimination in land use regulation.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§2000cc(b)(2) (“No government shall impose or implement a land use&para;<br>regulation that discriminates . . . on the basis of religion or religious&para;<br>denomination”). As a result, the majority’s decision in this case means&para;<br>that some RLUIPA plaintiffs will be able to seek monetary damages&para;<br>against a State and others will not, even though RLUIPA’s provision of&para;<br>“appropriate relief ” applies equally to suits for violations of the terms&para;<br>of both Section 2 and Section 3.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SOSSAMON v.

(“Institutional&para;<br>residents’ rights to practice their faith is at the mercy of&para;<br>those running the institution . . .”). It is difficult to believe&para;<br>that Congress would have devoted such care and effort to&para;<br>establishing significant statutory protections for religious&para;<br>exercise and specifically extended those protections to&para;<br>persons in state institutions, yet withheld from plaintiffs a&para;<br>crucial tool for securing the rights the statute guarantees.&para;<br>By depriving prisoners of a damages remedy for viola&para;<br>tions of their statutory rights, the majority ensures that&para;<br>plaintiffs suing state defendants under RLUIPA will be&para;<br>forced to seek enforcement of those rights with one hand&para;<br>tied behind their backs. Most obviously, the majority’s&para;<br>categorical denial of monetary relief means that a plaintiff&para;<br>who prevails on the merits of his claim that a State has&para;<br>substantially burdened his religious exercise will often be&para;<br>denied redress for the injury he has suffered, because in&para;<br>many instances “prospective relief accords . . . no remedy&para;<br>at all.” Franklin, 503 U. S., at 76; see H. R. Rep. No. 102–&para;<br>40, pt. 2, p. 25 (1991) (Report of Committee on the Judici&para;<br>ary on the Civil Rights Act of 1991) (“The limitation of&para;<br>relief under Title VII to equitable remedies often means&para;<br>that victims . . . may not recover for the very real effects of&para;<br>the [statutory violation]”).

Absent a damages remedy, longstand&para;<br>ing RLUIPA challenges may well be dismissed for lack of a&para;<br>case or controversy conferring Article III jurisdiction on&para;<br>the federal court.
