PHELPS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–751.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 6, 2010—Decided March 2, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>For the past 20 years, the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church&para;<br>has picketed military funerals to communicate its belief that God&para;<br>hates the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particu&para;<br>larly in America’s military. The church’s picketing has also con&para;<br>demned the Catholic Church for scandals involving its clergy. Fred&para;<br>Phelps, who founded the church, and six Westboro Baptist parishion&para;<br>ers (all relatives of Phelps) traveled to Maryland to picket the funeral&para;<br>of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq in&para;<br>the line of duty. The picketing took place on public land approxi&para;<br>mately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held, in ac&para;<br>cordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers. The&para;<br>picketers peacefully displayed their signs—stating, e.g., “Thank God&para;<br>for Dead Soldiers,” “Fags Doom Nations,” “America is Doomed,”&para;<br>“Priests Rape Boys,” and “You’re Going to Hell”—for about 30 min&para;<br>utes before the funeral began. Matthew Snyder’s father (Snyder), pe&para;<br>titioner here, saw the tops of the picketers’ signs when driving to the&para;<br>funeral, but did not learn what was written on the signs until watch&para;<br>ing a news broadcast later that night.&para;<br>Snyder filed a diversity action against Phelps, his daughters—who&para;<br>participated in the picketing—and the church (collectively Westboro)&para;<br>alleging, as relevant here, state tort claims of intentional infliction of&para;<br>emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy. A&para;<br>jury held Westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and&para;<br>punitive damages. Westboro challenged the verdict as grossly exces&para;<br>sive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the&para;<br>First Amendment fully protected its speech. The District Court re&para;<br>duced the punitive damages award, but left the verdict otherwise in&para;<br>tact. The Fourth Circuit reversed, concluding that Westboro’s state&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ments were entitled to First Amendment protection because those&para;<br>statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably&para;<br>false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The First Amendment shields Westboro from tort liability for its&para;<br>picketing in this case. Pp. 5–15.&para;<br>(a) The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment can serve as a&para;<br>defense in state tort suits, including suits for intentional infliction of&para;<br>emotional distress. Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46,&para;<br>50-51. Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro li&para;<br>able for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is&para;<br>of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances&para;<br>of the case. “[S]peech on public issues occupies the ‘ “highest rung of&para;<br>the hierarchy of First Amendment values” ’ and is entitled to special&para;<br>protection.” Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145. Although the&para;<br>boundaries of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern&para;<br>are not well defined, this Court has said that speech is of public con&para;<br>cern when it can “be fairly considered as relating to any matter of po&para;<br>litical, social, or other concern to the community,” id., at 146, or when&para;<br>it “is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the&para;<br>public,” San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 83–84. A statement’s argua&para;<br>bly “inappropriate or controversial character . . . is irrelevant to the&para;<br>question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.” Rankin v.&para;<br>McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>To determine whether speech is of public or private concern, this&para;<br>Court must independently examine the “ ‘content, form, and con&para;<br>text,’ ” of the speech “ ‘as revealed by the whole record.’ ” Dun &amp;&para;<br>Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 761. In&para;<br>considering content, form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it&para;<br>is necessary to evaluate all aspects of the speech. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>The “content” of Westboro’s signs plainly relates to public, rather&para;<br>than private, matters. The placards highlighted issues of public im&para;<br>port—the political and moral conduct of the United States and its&para;<br>citizens, the fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and&para;<br>scandals involving the Catholic clergy—and Westboro conveyed its&para;<br>views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public&para;<br>audience as possible. Even if a few of the signs were viewed as con&para;<br>taining messages related to a particular individual, that would not&para;<br>change the fact that the dominant theme of Westboro’s demonstra&para;<br>tion spoke to broader public issues. P. 8.&para;<br>The “context” of the speech—its connection with Matthew Snyder’s&para;<br>funeral—cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro’s speech.&para;<br>The signs reflected Westboro’s condemnation of much in modern soci&para;<br>ety, and it cannot be argued that Westboro’s use of speech on public&para;<br>issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Snyder from liability. Westboro had been actively engaged in speak&para;<br>ing on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became&para;<br>aware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that the&para;<br>picketing did not represent Westboro’s honestly held beliefs on public&para;<br>issues. Westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase&para;<br>publicity for its views, and its speech may have been particularly&para;<br>hurtful to Snyder. That does not mean that its speech should be af&para;<br>forded less than full First Amendment protection under the circum&para;<br>stances of this case. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>That said, “ ‘[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all&para;<br>places and at all times.’ ” Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 479.&para;<br>Westboro’s choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not&para;<br>beyond the Government’s regulatory reach—it is “subject to reason&para;<br>able time, place, or manner restrictions.” Clark v. Community for&para;<br>Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293. The facts here are quite&para;<br>different, however, both with respect to the activity being regulated&para;<br>and the means of restricting those activities, from the few limited&para;<br>situations where the Court has concluded that the location of tar&para;<br>geted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed&para;<br>content neutral. Frisby, supra, at 477; Madsen v. Women’s Health&para;<br>Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 768, distinguished. Maryland now has a&para;<br>law restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the&para;<br>time of these events, so this Court has no occasion to consider&para;<br>whether that law is a “reasonable time, place, or manner restric&para;<br>tio[n]” under the standards announced by this Court. Clark, supra,&para;<br>at 293. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>The “special protection” afforded to what Westboro said, in the&para;<br>whole context of how and where it chose to say it, cannot be overcome&para;<br>by a jury finding that the picketing was “outrageous” for purposes of&para;<br>applying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional dis&para;<br>tress. That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish&para;<br>Westboro for its views on matters of public concern. For all these&para;<br>reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for inten&para;<br>tional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside. Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>(b) Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclu&para;<br>sion. He argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his&para;<br>son’s funeral, but the captive audience doctrine—which has been ap&para;<br>plied sparingly, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736–&para;<br>738; Frisby, supra, at 484–485—should not be expanded to the cir&para;<br>cumstances here. Westboro stayed well away from the memorial ser&para;<br>vice, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers’ signs,&para;<br>and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the fu&para;<br>neral service itself. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(c) Because the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for in&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclu&para;<br>sion—the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accom&para;<br>plish—Snyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those&para;<br>torts. P. 14.&para;<br>(d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public prop&para;<br>erty, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of lo&para;<br>cal officials. It did not disrupt Mathew Snyder’s funeral, and its&para;<br>choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its&para;<br>speech. Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful&para;<br>speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled,&para;<br>Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this&para;<br>case.

The picket signs reflected the&para;<br>church’s view that the United States is overly tolerant of&para;<br>sin and that God kills American soldiers as punishment.&para;<br>The question presented is whether the First Amendment&para;<br>shields the church members from tort liability for their&para;<br>speech in this case.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Fred Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church in&para;<br>Topeka, Kansas, in 1955. The church’s congregation&para;<br>believes that God hates and punishes the United States&para;<br>for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in Amer&para;<br>ica’s military. The church frequently communicates its&para;<br>views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more&para;<br>than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have&para;<br>publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600&para;<br>funerals.

PHELPS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in&para;<br>Iraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder’s father&para;<br>selected the Catholic church in the Snyders’ hometown of&para;<br>Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son’s funeral.&para;<br>Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location&para;<br>of the service.&para;<br>Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder’s funeral and&para;<br>decided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro&para;<br>Baptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of&para;<br>his grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial&para;<br>service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on&para;<br>public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland&para;<br>State House, the United States Naval Academy, and&para;<br>Matthew Snyder’s funeral. The Westboro picketers car&para;<br>ried signs that were largely the same at all three locations.&para;<br>They stated, for instance: “God Hates the USA/Thank God&para;<br>for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,”&para;<br>“Thank God for IEDs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,”&para;<br>“Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,”&para;<br>“You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.”&para;<br>The church had notified the authorities in advance of its&para;<br>intent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the picket&para;<br>ers complied with police instructions in staging their&para;<br>demonstration. The picketing took place within a 10- by&para;<br>25-foot plot of public land adjacent to a public street,&para;<br>behind a temporary fence. App. to Brief for Appellants&para;<br>in No. 08–1026 (CA4), pp. 2282–2285 (hereinafter App.).&para;<br>That plot was approximately 1,000 feet from the church&para;<br>where the funeral was held. Several buildings separated&para;<br>the picket site from the church. Id., at 3758. The West&para;<br>boro picketers displayed their signs for about 30 minutes&para;<br>before the funeral began and sang hymns and recited&para;<br>Bible verses. None of the picketers entered church prop&para;<br>erty or went to the cemetery. They did not yell or use&para;<br>profanity, and there was no violence associated with the&para;<br>picketing.

Although Snyder testified that he could&para;<br>see the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral,&para;<br>he did not see what was written on the signs until later&para;<br>that night, while watching a news broadcast covering the&para;<br>event. Id., at 2084–2086.1&para;<br>B&para;<br>Snyder filed suit against Phelps, Phelps’s daughters,&para;<br>and the Westboro Baptist Church (collectively Westboro or&para;<br>the church) in the United States District Court for the&para;<br>District of Maryland under that court’s diversity jurisdic&para;<br>tion. Snyder alleged five state tort law claims: defama&para;<br>tion, publicity given to private life, intentional infliction of&para;<br>emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil&para;<br>conspiracy.&para;<br>Westboro moved for summary judgment&para;<br>contending, in part, that the church’s speech was insu&para;<br>lated from liability by the First Amendment. See 533&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 567, 570 (Md. 2008).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 A few weeks after the funeral, one of the picketers posted a message&para;<br>on Westboro’s Web site discussing the picketing and containing relig&para;<br>iously oriented denunciations of the Snyders, interspersed among&para;<br>lengthy Bible quotations. Snyder discovered the posting, referred to by&para;<br>the parties as the “epic,” during an Internet search for his son’s name.&para;<br>The epic is not properly before us and does not factor in our analysis.&para;<br>Although the epic was submitted to the jury and discussed in the courts&para;<br>below, Snyder never mentioned it in his petition for certiorari. See Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. i (“Snyder’s claim arose out of Phelps’ intentional acts at&para;<br>Snyder’s son’s funeral” (emphasis added)); this Court’s Rule 14.1(g)&para;<br>(petition must contain statement “setting out the facts material to&para;<br>consideration of the question presented”). Nor did Snyder respond to&para;<br>the statement in the opposition to certiorari that “[t]hough the epic was&para;<br>asserted as a basis for the claims at trial, the petition . . . appears to be&para;<br>addressing only claims based on the picketing.” Brief in Opposition 9.&para;<br>Snyder devoted only one paragraph in the argument section of his&para;<br>opening merits brief to the epic. Given the foregoing and the fact that&para;<br>an Internet posting may raise distinct issues in this context, we decline&para;<br>to consider the epic in deciding this case. See Ontario v. Quon, 560&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ – ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10–12).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court awarded Westboro summary judg&para;<br>ment on Snyder’s claims for defamation and publicity&para;<br>given to private life, concluding that Snyder could not&para;<br>prove the necessary elements of those torts. Id., at 572–&para;<br>573. A trial was held on the remaining claims. At trial,&para;<br>Snyder described the severity of his emotional injuries.&para;<br>He testified that he is unable to separate the thought of&para;<br>his dead son from his thoughts of Westboro’s picketing,&para;<br>and that he often becomes tearful, angry, and physically ill&para;<br>when he thinks about it. Id., at 588–589. Expert wit&para;<br>nesses testified that Snyder’s emotional anguish had&para;<br>resulted in severe depression and had exacerbated pre&para;<br>existing health conditions.&para;<br>A jury found for Snyder on the intentional infliction of&para;<br>emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil&para;<br>conspiracy claims, and held Westboro liable for $2.9 mil&para;<br>lion in compensatory damages and $8 million in punitive&para;<br>damages. Westboro filed several post-trial motions, in&para;<br>cluding a motion contending that the jury verdict was&para;<br>grossly excessive and a motion seeking judgment as a&para;<br>matter of law on all claims on First Amendment grounds.&para;<br>The District Court remitted the punitive damages award&para;<br>to $2.1 million, but left the jury verdict otherwise intact.&para;<br>Id., at 597.&para;<br>In the Court of Appeals, Westboro’s primary argument&para;<br>was that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter&para;<br>of law because the First Amendment fully protected West&para;<br>boro’s speech. The Court of Appeals agreed. 580 F. 3d&para;<br>206, 221 (CA4 2009). The court reviewed the picket signs&para;<br>and concluded that Westboro’s statements were entitled to&para;<br>First Amendment protection because those statements&para;<br>were on matters of public concern, were not provably false,&para;<br>and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.&para;<br>Id., at 222–224.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 One judge concurred in the judgment on the ground that Snyder had&para;<br>failed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to support a jury verdict&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Dun &amp; Bradstreet, supra, at 760 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>We noted a short time ago, in considering whether&para;<br>public employee speech addressed a matter of public con&para;<br>cern, that “the boundaries of the public concern test are&para;<br>not well defined.” San Diego v.

As in other First Amendment cases, the court is&para;<br>obligated “to ‘make an independent examination of the&para;<br>whole record’ in order to make sure that ‘the judgment&para;<br>does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of&para;<br>free expression.’ ” Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of&para;<br>United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499 (1984) (quoting New&para;<br>York Times, supra, at 284–286). In considering content,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is neces&para;<br>sary to evaluate all the circumstances of the speech, in&para;<br>cluding what was said, where it was said, and how it was&para;<br>said.&para;<br>The “content” of Westboro’s signs plainly relates to&para;<br>broad issues of interest to society at large, rather than&para;<br>matters of “purely private concern.” Dun &amp; Bradstreet,&para;<br>supra, at 759.&para;<br>The placards read “God Hates the&para;<br>USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t&para;<br>Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Fag Troops,”&para;<br>“Semper Fi Fags,” “God Hates Fags,” “Maryland Taliban,”&para;<br>“Fags Doom Nations,” “Not Blessed Just Cursed,” “Thank&para;<br>God for Dead Soldiers,” “Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape&para;<br>Boys,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.” App.&para;<br>3781–3787. While these messages may fall short of&para;<br>refined social or political commentary, the issues they&para;<br>highlight—the political and moral conduct of the United&para;<br>States and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexual&para;<br>ity in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic&para;<br>clergy—are matters of public import. The signs certainly&para;<br>convey Westboro’s position on those issues, in a manner&para;<br>designed, unlike the private speech in Dun &amp; Bradstreet,&para;<br>to reach as broad a public audience as possible. And even&para;<br>if a few of the signs—such as “You’re Going to Hell” and&para;<br>“God Hates You”—were viewed as containing messages&para;<br>related to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically,&para;<br>that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and&para;<br>dominant theme of Westboro’s demonstration spoke to&para;<br>broader public issues.&para;<br>Apart from the content of Westboro’s signs, Snyder&para;<br>contends that the “context” of the speech—its connection&para;<br>with his son’s funeral—makes the speech a matter of&para;<br>private rather than public concern. The fact that West&para;<br>boro spoke in connection with a funeral, however, cannot&para;<br>by itself transform the nature of Westboro’s speech.&para;<br>Westboro’s signs, displayed on public land next to a public&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>street, reflect the fact that the church finds much to con&para;<br>demn in modern society. Its speech is “fairly characterized&para;<br>as constituting speech on a matter of public concern,”&para;<br>Connick, 461 U. S., at 146, and the funeral setting does&para;<br>not alter that conclusion.&para;<br>Snyder argues that the church members in fact mounted&para;<br>a personal attack on Snyder and his family, and then&para;<br>attempted to “immunize their conduct by claiming that&para;<br>they were actually protesting the United States’ tolerance&para;<br>of homosexuality or the supposed evils of the Catholic&para;<br>Church.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 10. We are not con&para;<br>cerned in this case that Westboro’s speech on public mat&para;<br>ters was in any way contrived to insulate speech on a&para;<br>private matter from liability. Westboro had been actively&para;<br>engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its pick&para;<br>eting long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and&para;<br>there can be no serious claim that Westboro’s picketing&para;<br>did not represent its “honestly believed” views on public&para;<br>issues. Garrison, 379 U. S., at 73. There was no pre&para;<br>existing relationship or conflict between Westboro and&para;<br>Snyder that might suggest Westboro’s speech on public&para;<br>matters was intended to mask an attack on Snyder over a&para;<br>private matter. Contrast Connick, supra, at 153 (finding&para;<br>public employee speech a matter of private concern when&para;<br>it was “no coincidence that [the speech] followed upon the&para;<br>heels of [a] transfer notice” affecting the employee).&para;<br>Snyder goes on to argue that Westboro’s speech should&para;<br>be afforded less than full First Amendment protection “not&para;<br>only because of the words” but also because the church&para;<br>members exploited the funeral “as a platform to bring&para;<br>their message to a broader audience.” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>44, 40. There is no doubt that Westboro chose to stage its&para;<br>picketing at the Naval Academy, the Maryland State&para;<br>House, and Matthew Snyder’s funeral to increase publicity&para;<br>for its views and because of the relation between those&para;<br>sites and its views—in the case of the military funeral,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>because Westboro believes that God is killing American&para;<br>soldiers as punishment for the Nation’s sinful policies.&para;<br>Westboro’s choice to convey its views in conjunction with&para;<br>Matthew Snyder’s funeral made the expression of those&para;<br>views particularly hurtful to many, especially to Mat&para;<br>thew’s father. The record makes clear that the applicable&para;<br>legal term—“emotional distress”—fails to capture fully the&para;<br>anguish Westboro’s choice added to Mr. Snyder’s already&para;<br>incalculable grief. But Westboro conducted its picketing&para;<br>peacefully on matters of public concern at a public place&para;<br>adjacent to a public street. Such space occupies a “special&para;<br>position in terms of First Amendment protection.” United&para;<br>States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180 (1983). “[W]e have&para;<br>repeatedly referred to public streets as the archetype of a&para;<br>traditional public forum,” noting that “ ‘[t]ime out of mind’&para;<br>public streets and sidewalks have been used for public&para;<br>assembly and debate.” Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474,&para;<br>480 (1988).4&para;<br>That said, “[e]ven protected speech is not equally per&para;<br>missible in all places and at all times.” Id., at 479 (quot&para;<br>ing Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,&para;<br>473 U. S. 788, 799 (1985)). Westboro’s choice of where and&para;<br>when to conduct its picketing is not beyond the Govern&para;<br>ment’s regulatory reach—it is “subject to reasonable time,&para;<br>place, or manner restrictions” that are consistent with the&para;<br>standards announced in this Court’s precedents. Clark v.&para;<br>Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293&para;<br>(1984). Maryland now has a law imposing restrictions on&para;<br>funeral picketing, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §10–205&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent is wrong to suggest that the Court considers a public&para;<br>street “a free-fire zone in which otherwise actionable verbal attacks are&para;<br>shielded from liability.” Post, at 10–11. The fact that Westboro con&para;<br>ducted its picketing adjacent to a public street does not insulate the&para;<br>speech from liability, but instead heightens concerns that what is at&para;<br>issue is an effort to communicate to the public the church’s views on&para;<br>matters of public concern. That is why our precedents so clearly&para;<br>recognize the special significance of this traditional public forum.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(Lexis Supp. 2010), as do 43 other States and the Federal&para;<br>Government. See Brief for American Legion as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 18–19, n. 2 (listing statutes). To the extent these&para;<br>laws are content neutral, they raise very different ques&para;<br>tions from the tort verdict at issue in this case. Mary&para;<br>land’s law, however, was not in effect at the time of the&para;<br>events at issue here, so we have no occasion to consider&para;<br>how it might apply to facts such as those before us, or&para;<br>whether it or other similar regulations are constitutional.5&para;<br>We have identified a few limited situations where the&para;<br>location of targeted picketing can be regulated under&para;<br>provisions that the Court has determined to be content&para;<br>neutral. In Frisby, for example, we upheld a ban on such&para;<br>picketing “before or about” a particular residence, 487&para;<br>U. S., at 477. In Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc.,&para;<br>we approved an injunction requiring a buffer zone between&para;<br>protesters and an abortion clinic entrance. 512 U. S. 753,&para;<br>768 (1994). The facts here are obviously quite different,&para;<br>both with respect to the activity being regulated and the&para;<br>means of restricting those activities.&para;<br>Simply put, the church members had the right to be&para;<br>where they were. Westboro alerted local authorities to its&para;<br>funeral protest and fully complied with police guidance on&para;<br>where the picketing could be staged. The picketing was&para;<br>conducted under police supervision some 1,000 feet from&para;<br>the church, out of the sight of those at the church. The&para;<br>protest was not unruly; there was no shouting, profanity,&para;<br>or violence.&para;<br>The record confirms that any distress occasioned by&para;<br>Westboro’s picketing turned on the content and viewpoint&para;<br>of the message conveyed, rather than any interference&para;<br>with the funeral itself. A group of parishioners standing&para;<br>at the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The Maryland law prohibits picketing within 100 feet of a funeral&para;<br>service or funeral procession; Westboro’s picketing would have complied&para;<br>with that restriction.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>said “God Bless America” and “God Loves You,” would not&para;<br>have been subjected to liability. It was what Westboro&para;<br>said that exposed it to tort damages.&para;<br>Given that Westboro’s speech was at a public place on a&para;<br>matter of public concern, that speech is entitled to “special&para;<br>protection” under the First Amendment. Such speech&para;<br>cannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or&para;<br>arouses contempt. “If there is a bedrock principle underly&para;<br>ing the First Amendment, it is that the government may&para;<br>not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because&para;<br>society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.”&para;<br>Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989). Indeed, “the&para;<br>point of all speech protection . . . is to shield just those&para;<br>choices of content that in someone’s eyes are misguided, or&para;<br>even hurtful.” Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and&para;<br>Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 574 (1995).&para;<br>The jury here was instructed that it could hold Westboro&para;<br>liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress based&para;<br>on a finding that Westboro’s picketing was “outrageous.”&para;<br>“Outrageousness,” however, is a highly malleable standard&para;<br>with “an inherent subjectiveness about it which would&para;<br>allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors’&para;<br>tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a&para;<br>particular expression.” Hustler, 485 U. S., at 55 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). In a case such as this, a jury is&para;<br>“unlikely to be neutral with respect to the content of [the]&para;<br>speech,” posing “a real danger of becoming an instrument&para;<br>for the suppression of . . . ‘vehement, caustic, and some&para;<br>times unpleasan[t]’ ” expression. Bose Corp., 466 U. S., at&para;<br>510 (quoting New York Times, 376 U. S., at 270). Such a&para;<br>risk is unacceptable; “in public debate [we] must tolerate&para;<br>insulting, and even outrageous, speech in order to provide&para;<br>adequate ‘breathing space’ to the freedoms protected by&para;<br>the First Amendment.” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 322&para;<br>(1988) (some internal quotation marks omitted). What&para;<br>Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>chose to say it, is entitled to “special protection” under the&para;<br>First Amendment, and that protection cannot be overcome&para;<br>by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous.&para;<br>For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort&para;<br>liability on Westboro for intentional infliction of emotional&para;<br>distress must be set aside.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The jury also found Westboro liable for the state law&para;<br>torts of intrusion upon seclusion and civil conspiracy. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals did not examine these torts independ&para;<br>ently of the intentional infliction of emotional distress tort.&para;<br>Instead, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court&para;<br>wholesale, holding that the judgment wrongly “attache[d]&para;<br>tort liability to constitutionally protected speech.” 580&para;<br>F. 3d, at 226.&para;<br>Snyder argues that even assuming Westboro’s speech&para;<br>is entitled to First Amendment protection generally, the&para;<br>church is not immunized from liability for intrusion upon&para;<br>seclusion because Snyder was a member of a captive audi&para;<br>ence at his son’s funeral. Brief for Petitioner 45–46. We&para;<br>do not agree. In most circumstances, “the Constitution&para;<br>does not permit the government to decide which types of&para;<br>otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to&para;<br>require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.&para;<br>Rather, . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to&para;<br>avoid further bombardment of [his] sensibilities simply by&para;<br>averting [his] eyes.” Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S.&para;<br>205, 210–211 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>As a result, “[t]he ability of government, consonant with&para;<br>the Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect&para;<br>others from hearing it is . . . dependent upon a showing&para;<br>that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an&para;<br>essentially intolerable manner.” Cohen v. California, 403&para;<br>U. S. 15, 21 (1971).&para;<br>As a general matter, we have applied the captive audi&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ence doctrine only sparingly to protect unwilling listeners&para;<br>from protected speech. For example, we have upheld a&para;<br>statute allowing a homeowner to restrict the delivery of&para;<br>offensive mail to his home, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept.,&para;<br>397 U. S. 728, 736–738 (1970), and an ordinance prohibit&para;<br>ing picketing “before or about” any individual’s residence,&para;<br>Frisby, 487 U. S., at 484–485.&para;<br>Here, Westboro stayed well away from the memorial&para;<br>service. Snyder could see no more than the tops of the&para;<br>signs when driving to the funeral. And there is no indica&para;<br>tion that the picketing in any way interfered with the&para;<br>funeral service itself. We decline to expand the captive&para;<br>audience doctrine to the circumstances presented here.&para;<br>Because we find that the First Amendment bars Snyder&para;<br>from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional dis&para;<br>tress or intrusion upon seclusion—the alleged unlawful&para;<br>activity Westboro conspired to accomplish—we must&para;<br>likewise hold that Snyder cannot recover for civil conspir&para;<br>acy based on those torts.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Our holding today is narrow. We are required in First&para;<br>Amendment cases to carefully review the record, and the&para;<br>reach of our opinion here is limited by the particular facts&para;<br>before us. As we have noted, “the sensitivity and signifi&para;<br>cance of the interests presented in clashes between First&para;<br>Amendment and [state law] rights counsel relying on&para;<br>limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the&para;<br>appropriate context of the instant case.” Florida Star v.&para;<br>B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 533 (1989).&para;<br>Westboro believes that America is morally flawed; many&para;<br>Americans might feel the same about Westboro. West&para;<br>boro’s funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its con&para;<br>tribution to public discourse may be negligible. But&para;<br>Westboro addressed matters of public import on public&para;<br>property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>guidance of local officials. The speech was indeed planned&para;<br>to coincide with Matthew Snyder’s funeral, but did not&para;<br>itself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro’s choice to con&para;<br>duct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the&para;<br>nature of its speech.&para;<br>Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move&para;<br>them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and—as it did here—&para;<br>inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react&para;<br>to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we&para;<br>have chosen a different course—to protect even hurtful&para;<br>speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle&para;<br>public debate. That choice requires that we shield West&para;<br>boro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.&para;<br>The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Both Matthew and petitioner&para;<br>were private figures,16 and this attack was not speech on a&para;<br>matter of public concern. While commentary on the Cath&para;<br>olic Church or the United States military constitutes&para;<br>speech on matters of public concern, speech regarding&para;<br>Matthew Snyder’s purely private conduct does not.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER provides an apt analogy to a case in&para;<br>which the First Amendment would permit recovery in tort&para;<br>for a verbal attack:&para;<br>“[S]uppose that A were physically to assault B, know&para;<br>ing that the assault (being newsworthy) would provide&para;<br>A with an opportunity to transmit to the public his&para;<br>views on a matter of public concern.

PHELPS&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>reasons, but none is sound.&para;<br>First—and most important—the Court finds that “the&para;<br>overall thrust and dominant theme of [their] demonstra&para;<br>tion spoke to” broad public issues. Ante, at 8. As I have&para;<br>attempted to show, this portrayal is quite inaccurate;&para;<br>respondents’ attack on Matthew was of central impor&para;<br>tance. But in any event, I fail to see why actionable&para;<br>speech should be immunized simply because it is inter&para;<br>spersed with speech that is protected. The First Amend&para;<br>ment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are&para;<br>interspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters&para;<br>of public concern, and there is no good reason why respon&para;<br>dents’ attack on Matthew Snyder and his family should be&para;<br>treated differently.&para;<br>Second, the Court suggests that respondents’ personal&para;<br>attack on Matthew Snyder is entitled to First Amendment&para;<br>protection because it was not motivated by a private&para;<br>grudge, see ante, at 9, but I see no basis for the strange&para;<br>distinction that the Court appears to draw. Respondents’&para;<br>motivation—“to increase publicity for its views,” ibid.—did&para;<br>not transform their statements attacking the character&para;<br>of a private figure into statements that made a contri&para;<br>bution to debate on matters of public concern. Nor did&para;<br>their publicity-seeking motivation soften the sting of their&para;<br>attack. And as far as culpability is concerned, one might&para;<br>well think that wounding statements uttered in the heat&para;<br>of a private feud are less, not more, blameworthy than&para;<br>similar statements made as part of a cold and calculated&para;<br>strategy to slash a stranger as a means of attracting pub&para;<br>lic attention.&para;<br>Third, the Court finds it significant that respondents’&para;<br>protest occurred on a public street, but this fact alone&para;<br>should not be enough to preclude IIED liability. To be&para;<br>sure, statements made on a public street may be less&para;<br>likely to satisfy the elements of the IIED tort than state&para;<br>ments made on private property, but there is no reason&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>why a public street in close proximity to the scene of a&para;<br>funeral should be regarded as a free-fire zone in which&para;<br>otherwise actionable verbal attacks are shielded from&para;<br>liability. If the First Amendment permits the States to&para;<br>protect their residents from the harm inflicted by such&para;<br>attacks—and the Court does not hold otherwise—then the&para;<br>location of the tort should not be dispositive. A physical&para;<br>assault may occur without trespassing; it is no defense&para;<br>that the perpetrator had “the right to be where [he was].”&para;<br>See ante, at 11. And the same should be true with respect&para;<br>to unprotected speech. Neither classic “fighting words”&para;<br>nor defamatory statements are immunized when they&para;<br>occur in a public place, and there is no good reason to treat&para;<br>a verbal assault based on the conduct or character of a&para;<br>private figure like Matthew Snyder any differently.&para;<br>One final comment about the opinion of the Court is in&para;<br>order. The Court suggests that the wounds inflicted by&para;<br>vicious verbal assaults at funerals will be prevented or at&para;<br>least mitigated in the future by new laws that restrict&para;<br>picketing within a specified distance of a funeral. See&para;<br>ante, at 10–11. It is apparent, however, that the enact&para;<br>ment of these laws is no substitute for the protection&para;<br>provided by the established IIED tort; according to the&para;<br>Court, the verbal attacks that severely wounded petitioner&para;<br>in this case complied with the new Maryland law regulat&para;<br>ing funeral picketing. See ante, at 11, n. 5. And there is&para;<br>absolutely nothing to suggest that Congress and the state&para;<br>legislatures, in enacting these laws, intended them to&para;<br>displace the protection provided by the well-established&para;<br>IIED tort.&para;<br>The real significance of these new laws is not that they&para;<br>obviate the need for IIED protection. Rather, their enact&para;<br>ment dramatically illustrates the fundamental point that&para;<br>funerals are unique events at which special protection&para;<br>against emotional assaults is in order. At funerals, the&para;<br>emotional well-being of bereaved relatives is particularly&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v.

Allowing family members to have a few&para;<br>hours of peace without harassment does not undermine&para;<br>public debate. I would therefore hold that, in this setting,&para;<br>the First Amendment permits a private figure to recover&para;<br>for the intentional infliction of emotional distress caused&para;<br>by speech on a matter of private concern.&para;<br>V&para;<br>In reversing the District Court judgment in favor of&para;<br>petitioner, the Court of Appeals relied on several grounds&para;<br>not discussed in the opinion of this Court or in the sepa&para;<br>rate opinion supporting affirmance. I now turn briefly to&para;<br>those issues.&para;<br>First, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court&para;<br>erred by allowing the jury to decide whether respondents’&para;<br>speech was “ ‘directed specifically at the Snyder family.’ ”&para;<br>580 F. 3d, at 221. It is not clear whether the Court of&para;<br>Appeals thought that this was a question for the trial&para;<br>judge alone or a question on which the judge had to make&para;<br>a preliminary ruling before sending it to the jury. In&para;<br>either event, however, the submission of this question to&para;<br>the jury was not reversible error because, as explained&para;<br>above, it is clear that respondents’ statements targeted the&para;<br>Snyders.&para;<br>Second, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge&para;<br>went astray in allowing the jury to decide whether re&para;<br>spondents’ speech was so “ ‘offensive and shocking as to&para;<br>not be entitled to First Amendment protection.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>This instruction also did respondents no harm. Because&para;<br>their speech did not relate to a matter of public concern, it&para;<br>was not protected from liability by the First Amendment,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and the only question for the jury was whether the ele&para;<br>ments of the IIED tort were met.&para;<br>Third, the Court of Appeals appears to have concluded&para;<br>that the First Amendment does not permit an IIED plain&para;<br>tiff to recover for speech that cannot reasonably be inter&para;<br>preted as stating actual facts about an individual. See id.,&para;<br>at 222. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>relied on two of our cases—Milkovich v. Lorain Journal&para;<br>Co., 497 U. S. 1 (1990), and Hustler, 485 U. S. 46—but&para;<br>neither supports the broad proposition that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals adopted.&para;<br>Milkovich was a defamation case, and falsity is an ele&para;<br>ment of defamation. Nothing in Milkovich even hints that&para;<br>the First Amendment requires that this defamation ele&para;<br>ment be engrafted onto the IIED tort.&para;<br>Hustler did involve an IIED claim, but the plaintiff&para;<br>there was a public figure, and the Court did not suggest&para;<br>that its holding would also apply in a case involving a&para;<br>private figure. Nor did the Court suggest that its holding&para;<br>applied across the board to all types of IIED claims. In&para;<br>stead, the holding was limited to “publications such as the&para;<br>one here at issue,” namely, a caricature in a magazine.&para;<br>485 U. S., at 56. Unless a caricature of a public figure can&para;<br>reasonably be interpreted as stating facts that may be&para;<br>proved to be wrong, the caricature does not have the same&para;<br>potential to wound as a personal verbal assault on a vul&para;<br>nerable private figure.&para;<br>Because I cannot agree either with the holding of this&para;<br>Court or the other grounds on which the Court of Appeals&para;<br>relied, I would reverse the decision below and remand for&para;<br>further proceedings.17&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 The Court affirms the decision of the Fourth Circuit with respect to&para;<br>petitioner’s claim of intrusion upon seclusion on a ground not addressed&para;<br>by the Fourth Circuit. I would not reach out to decide that issue but&para;<br>would instead leave it for the Fourth Circuit to decide on remand. I&para;<br>would likewise allow the Fourth Circuit on remand to decide whether&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SNYDER v. PHELPS &para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>VI &para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents’ outrageous conduct caused petitioner&para;<br>great injury, and the Court now compounds that injury by&para;<br>depriving petitioner of a judgment that acknowledges the&para;<br>wrong he suffered.&para;<br>In order to have a society in which public issues can be&para;<br>openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow&para;<br>the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner. I&para;<br>therefore respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>the judgment on the claim of civil conspiracy can survive in light of the&para;<br>&para;<br>ultimate disposition of the IIED and intrusion upon seclusion claims. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
