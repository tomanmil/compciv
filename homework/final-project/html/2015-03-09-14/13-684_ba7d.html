Bank of America replied, refusing to acknowledge the rescission’s validity. One year and one day&para;<br>later, the Jesinoskis filed suit in federal court, seeking a declaration&para;<br>of rescission and damages. The District Court entered judgment on&para;<br>the pleadings for respondents, concluding that a borrower can exercise the Truth in Lending Act’s right to rescind a loan, see 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1635(a), (f), only by filing a lawsuit within three years of the date&para;<br>the loan was consummated. The Jesinoskis’ complaint, filed four&para;<br>years and one day after the loan’s consummation, was ineffective.&para;<br>The Eighth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: A borrower exercising his right to rescind under the Act need only&para;<br>provide written notice to his lender within the 3-year period, not file&para;<br>suit within that period. Section 1635(a)’s unequivocal terms—a borrower “shall have the right to rescind . . . by notifying the creditor . . .&para;<br>of his intention to do so” (emphasis added)—leave no doubt that rescission is effected when the borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to rescind. This conclusion is not altered by §1635(f), which&para;<br>states when the right to rescind must be exercised, but says nothing&para;<br>about how that right is exercised. Nor does §1635(g)—which states&para;<br>that “in addition to rescission the court may award relief . . . not relating to the right to rescind”—support respondents’ view that rescission is necessarily a consequence of judicial action.

The question presented is whether&para;<br>a borrower exercises this right by providing written notice to his lender, or whether he must also file a lawsuit&para;<br>before the 3-year period elapses.&para;<br>On February 23, 2007, petitioners Larry and Cheryle&para;<br>Jesinoski refinanced the mortgage on their home by borrowing $611,000 from respondent Countrywide Home&para;<br>Loans, Inc. Exactly three years later, on February 23,&para;<br>2010, the Jesinoskis mailed respondents a letter purporting to rescind the loan. Respondent Bank of America&para;<br>Home Loans replied on March 12, 2010, refusing to&para;<br>acknowledge the validity of the rescission. On February&para;<br>24, 2011, the Jesinoskis filed suit in Federal District Court&para;<br>seeking a declaration of rescission and damages.&para;<br>Respondents moved for judgment on the pleadings,&para;<br>which the District Court granted. The court concluded&para;<br>that the Act requires a borrower seeking rescission to file&para;<br>a lawsuit within three years of the transaction’s consum-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JESINOSKI v. COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mation. Although the Jesinoskis notified respondents of&para;<br>their intention to rescind within that time, they did not&para;<br>file their first complaint until four years and one day after&para;<br>the loan’s consummation. 2012 WL 1365751, *3 (D Minn.,&para;<br>Apr. 19, 2012). The Eighth Circuit affirmed. 729 F. 3d&para;<br>1092, 1093 (2013) (per curiam).&para;<br>Congress passed the Truth in Lending Act, 82 Stat. 146,&para;<br>as amended, to help consumers “avoid the uninformed use&para;<br>of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate&para;<br>and unfair credit billing.” 15 U. S. C. §1601(a). To this&para;<br>end, the Act grants borrowers the right to rescind a loan&para;<br>“until midnight of the third business day following the&para;<br>consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the&para;<br>[disclosures required by the Act], whichever is later, by&para;<br>notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of&para;<br>the [Federal Reserve] Board, of his intention to do so.”&para;<br>§1635(a) (2006 ed.).* This regime grants borrowers an&para;<br>unconditional right to rescind for three days, after which&para;<br>they may rescind only if the lender failed to satisfy the&para;<br>Act’s disclosure requirements. But this conditional right&para;<br>to rescind does not last forever. Even if a lender never&para;<br>makes the required disclosures, the “right of rescission&para;<br>shall expire three years after the date of consummation of&para;<br>the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever&para;<br>comes first.” §1635(f). The Eighth Circuit’s affirmance in&para;<br>the present case rested upon its holding in Keiran v. Home&para;<br>Capital, Inc., 720 F. 3d 721, 727–728 (2013) that, unless a&para;<br>borrower has filed a suit for rescission within three years&para;<br>of the transaction’s consummation, §1635(f) extinguishes&para;<br>the right to rescind and bars relief.&para;<br>That was error. Section 1635(a) explains in unequivocal&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Following the events in this case, Congress transferred the authority to promulgate rules implementing the Act to the Consumer Finance&para;<br>Protection Bureau. See Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer&para;<br>Protection Act, §§1061(b)(1), 1100A(2), 1100H, 124 Stat. 2036, 2107,&para;<br>2113.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>terms how the right to rescind is to be exercised: It provides that a borrower “shall have the right to rescind . . .&para;<br>by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of&para;<br>the Board, of his intention to do so” (emphasis added). The&para;<br>language leaves no doubt that rescission is effected when&para;<br>the borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to rescind. It follows that, so long as the borrower notifies&para;<br>within three years after the transaction is consummated,&para;<br>his rescission is timely. The statute does not also require&para;<br>him to sue within three years.&para;<br>Nothing in §1635(f) changes this conclusion. Although&para;<br>§1635(f) tells us when the right to rescind must be exercised, it says nothing about how that right is exercised.&para;<br>Our observation in Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523 U. S.&para;<br>410, 417 (1998), that §1635(f) “govern[s] the life of the&para;<br>underlying right” is beside the point. That case concerned&para;<br>a borrower’s attempt to rescind in the course of a foreclosure proceeding initiated six years after the loan’s consummation. We concluded only that there was “no federal&para;<br>right to rescind, defensively or otherwise, after the 3-year&para;<br>period of §1635(f) has run,” id., at 419, not that there was&para;<br>no rescission until a suit is filed.&para;<br>Respondents do not dispute that §1635(a) requires only&para;<br>written notice of rescission. Indeed, they concede that&para;<br>written notice suffices to rescind a loan within the first&para;<br>three days after the transaction is consummated. They&para;<br>further concede that written notice suffices after that&para;<br>period if the parties agree that the lender failed to make&para;<br>the required disclosures. Respondents argue, however,&para;<br>that if the parties dispute the adequacy of the disclosures—and thus the continued availability of the right to&para;<br>rescind—then written notice does not suffice.&para;<br>Section 1635(a) nowhere suggests a distinction between&para;<br>disputed and undisputed rescissions, much less that a&para;<br>lawsuit would be required for the latter. In an effort to&para;<br>sidestep this problem, respondents point to a neighboring&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JESINOSKI v. COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>provision, §1635(g), which they believe provides support&para;<br>for their interpretation of the Act. Section 1635(g) states&para;<br>merely that, “[i]n any action in which it is determined that&para;<br>a creditor has violated this section, in addition to rescission the court may award relief under section 1640 of this&para;<br>title for violations of this subchapter not relating to the&para;<br>right to rescind.” Respondents argue that the phrase&para;<br>“award relief ” “in addition to rescission” confirms that&para;<br>rescission is a consequence of judicial action. But the fact&para;<br>that it can be a consequence of judicial action when&para;<br>§1635(g) is triggered in no way suggests that it can only&para;<br>follow from such action. The Act contemplates various&para;<br>situations in which the question of a lender’s compliance&para;<br>with the Act’s disclosure requirements may arise in a&para;<br>lawsuit—for example, a lender’s foreclosure action in&para;<br>which the borrower raises inadequate disclosure as an&para;<br>affirmative defense. Section 1635(g) makes clear that a&para;<br>court may not only award rescission and thereby relieve&para;<br>the borrower of his financial obligation to the lender, but&para;<br>may also grant any of the remedies available under §1640&para;<br>(including statutory damages). It has no bearing upon&para;<br>whether and how borrower-rescission under §1635(a) may&para;<br>occur.&para;<br>Finally, respondents invoke the common law. It is true&para;<br>that rescission traditionally required either that the rescinding party return what he received before a rescission&para;<br>could be effected (rescission at law), or else that a court&para;<br>affirmatively decree rescission (rescission in equity). 2 D.&para;<br>Dobbs, Law of Remedies §9.3(3), pp. 585–586 (2d ed.&para;<br>1993). It is also true that the Act disclaims the commonlaw condition precedent to rescission at law that the borrower tender the proceeds received under the transaction.&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §1635(b). But the negation of rescission-atlaw’s tender requirement hardly implies that the Act&para;<br>codifies rescission in equity. Nothing in our jurisprudence,&para;<br>and no tool of statutory interpretation, requires that a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>congressional Act must be construed as implementing its&para;<br>closest common-law analogue. Cf. Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp;&para;<br>Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108–109 (1991).&para;<br>The clear import of §1635(a) is that a borrower need only&para;<br>provide written notice to a lender in order to exercise his&para;<br>right to rescind. To the extent §1635(b) alters the traditional process for unwinding such a unilaterally rescinded&para;<br>transaction, this is simply a case in which statutory law&para;<br>modifies common-law practice.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Jesinoskis mailed respondents written notice of&para;<br>their intention to rescind within three years of their loan’s&para;<br>consummation. Because this is all that a borrower must&para;<br>do in order to exercise his right to rescind under the Act,&para;<br>the court below erred in dismissing the complaint. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit and&para;<br>remand the case for further proceedings consistent with&para;<br>this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
