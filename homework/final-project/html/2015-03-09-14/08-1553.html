REGAL-&para;<br>&para;<br>BELOIT CORP. ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1553. Argued March 24, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010*&para;<br>Respondents (cargo owners) delivered to petitioners in No. 08–1553&para;<br>(“K” Line) goods for shipping from China to inland United States des&para;<br>tinations. “K” Line issued them four through bills of lading, i.e., bills&para;<br>of lading covering both the ocean and inland portions of transport in&para;<br>a single document. As relevant here, the bills contain a “Himalaya&para;<br>Clause,” which extends the bills’ defenses and liability limitations to&para;<br>subcontractors; permit “K” Line to subcontract to complete the jour&para;<br>ney; provide that the entire journey is governed by the Carriage of&para;<br>Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which regulates bills of lading issued by&para;<br>ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade; and designate a Tokyo court&para;<br>as the venue for any dispute. “K” Line arranged the journey, subcon&para;<br>tracting with petitioner in No. 08–1554 (Union Pacific) for rail ship&para;<br>ment in the United States. The cargo was shipped in “K” Line ves&para;<br>sels to California and then loaded onto a Union Pacific train. A&para;<br>derailment along the inland route allegedly destroyed the cargo. Ul&para;<br>timately, the Federal District Court granted the motion of Union Pa&para;<br>cific and “K” Line to dismiss the cargo owners’ suits against them&para;<br>based on the parties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit reversed, concluding that that clause was trumped by the Car&para;<br>mack Amendment governing bills of lading issued by domestic rail&para;<br>carriers, which applied to the inland portion of the shipment.&para;<br>Held: Because the Carmack Amendment does not apply to a shipment&para;<br>originating overseas under a single through bill of lading, the parties’&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. RegalBeloit Corp. et al., also on certiorari to the same Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>agreement to litigate these cases in Tokyo is binding. Pp. 4–21.&para;<br>(a) COGSA, which “K” Line and Union Pacific contend governs&para;<br>these cases, requires a carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill con&para;<br>taining specified terms. It does not limit the parties’ ability to adopt&para;<br>forum-selection clauses. It only applies to shipments from United&para;<br>States ports to foreign ports and vice versa, but permits parties to ex&para;<br>tend certain of its terms “by contract” to cover “the entire period in&para;<br>which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s] responsibility, includ&para;<br>ing [a] period of inland . . . transport.” Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.&para;<br>James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 29. The Carmack Amend&para;<br>ment, on which respondents rely, requires a domestic rail carrier that&para;<br>“receives [property] for transportation under this part” to issue a bill&para;<br>of lading. 49 U. S. C. §11706(a). “[T]his part” refers to the Surface&para;<br>Transportation Board’s (STB’s) jurisdiction over domestic rail trans&para;<br>portation. See §10501(b). Carmack assigns liability for damage on&para;<br>the rail route to “receiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail car&para;<br>rier[s],” regardless of which carrier caused the damage. §11706(a).&para;<br>Its purpose is to relieve cargo owners “of the burden of searching out&para;<br>a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carri&para;<br>ers handling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v. Thompson,&para;<br>339 U. S. 113, 119. Thus, it constrains carriers’ ability to limit liabil&para;<br>ity by contract, §11706(c), and limits the parties’ choice of venue to&para;<br>federal and state courts. §11706(d)(1). Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) In Kirby, as in these cases, an ocean shipping company issued a&para;<br>through bill of lading that extended COGSA’s terms to the inland&para;<br>segment, and the property was damaged during the inland rail por&para;<br>tion. This Court held that the through bill’s terms governed under&para;<br>federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state laws, 543 U. S.,&para;<br>at 23–27, explaining that “so long as a bill of lading requires substan&para;<br>tial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime&para;<br>commerce,” id., at 27, and adding that “[a]pplying state law . . . would&para;<br>undermine the uniformity of general maritime law,” id., at 28, and&para;<br>defeat COGSA’s apparent purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting&para;<br>in contracts for carriage by sea,” ibid. Here, as in Kirby, “K” Line is&para;<br>sued through bills under COGSA, in maritime commerce, and ex&para;<br>tended its terms to the journey’s inland domestic segment. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(c) The Carmack Amendment’s text, history, and purposes make&para;<br>clear that it does not require a different result. Pp. 8–21.&para;<br>(1) Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into receiving, de&para;<br>livering, and connecting rail carriers. Its first sentence requires a&para;<br>compliant bill of lading (1) if a rail carrier provid[es] transportation&para;<br>or service subject to the [STB’s] jurisdiction” and (2) if that carrier&para;<br>“receives” the property “for transportation . . . .” 11706(a). It thus&para;<br>requires the receiving rail carrier—but not the delivering or connect&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ing rail carrier—to issue a bill of lading. This conclusion is consistent&para;<br>with statute’s text and this Court’s precedent. See St. Louis, I. M. &amp;&para;<br>S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 595, 604. A receiving rail carrier&para;<br>is the initial carrier, which “receives” the property for domestic rail&para;<br>transportation at the journey’s point of origin. If the Carmack’s bill&para;<br>of lading requirement referred not to the initial carrier, but to any&para;<br>carrier “receiving” the property from another carrier, then every car&para;<br>rier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill.&para;<br>This would be contrary to Carmack’s purpose of making the receiving&para;<br>and delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill for damage&para;<br>caused by any carrier within a single course of shipment. This con&para;<br>clusion is consistent with Mexican Light &amp; Power Co. v. Texas Mexi&para;<br>can R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, where the Court held that a bill of lading&para;<br>issued by a subsequent rail carrier when the “initial carrier” has is&para;<br>sued a through bill is “void” unless it “represents the initiation of a&para;<br>new shipment,” id., at 733–734. And Reider, supra, is not to the con&para;<br>trary. There, absent a through bill of lading, the original journey&para;<br>from Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans, and the first&para;<br>rail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier for&para;<br>Carmack purposes. Id., at 117. Carmack’s second sentence estab&para;<br>lishes that it applies only to transport of property for which a receiv&para;<br>ing carrier is required to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether&para;<br>that carrier actually issues such a bill. See §11706(a). Thus, Car&para;<br>mack applies only if the journey begins with a receiving rail carrier&para;<br>that had to issue a compliant bill of lading, not if the property is re&para;<br>ceived at an overseas location under a through bill that covers trans&para;<br>port into an inland location in this country. The initial carrier in that&para;<br>instance receives the property at the shipment’s point of origin for&para;<br>overseas multimodal import transport, not domestic rail transport.&para;<br>Carmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of lading because “K”&para;<br>Line was not a receiving rail carrier. That it chose to use rail trans&para;<br>port to complete one segment of the journey under its “essentially&para;<br>maritime” contracts, Kirby, supra, at 24, does not put it within Car&para;<br>mack’s reach. Union Pacific, which the cargo owners concede was a&para;<br>mere delivering carrier that did not have to issue its own Carmack&para;<br>bill of lading, was also not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack.&para;<br>Because the Ninth Circuit ignored Carmack’s “receive[d] . . . for&para;<br>transportation” limitation, it reached the wrong conclusion. Its con&para;<br>clusion is also an awkward fit with Carmack’s venue provisions,&para;<br>which presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a&para;<br>judicial district within the United States. If “K” Line were a receiv&para;<br>ing carrier in a case with a “point of origin” in China, there would be&para;<br>no place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since China is not within a&para;<br>judicial district “of the United States or in a State Court.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§11706(d)(1). Pp. 8–15.&para;<br>(2) Carmack’s statutory history supports this conclusion. None of&para;<br>its legislative versions—the original 1906 statute or the amended&para;<br>1915, 1978, or 1995 ones—have applied to the inland domestic rail&para;<br>segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.&para;<br>Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>(3) This interpretation also attains the most consistency between&para;<br>Carmack and COGSA. Applying Carmack to the inland segment of&para;<br>an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill&para;<br>would undermine Carmack’s purposes, which are premised on the&para;<br>view that a shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage is&para;<br>the responsibility of both receiving and delivering carriers. Under&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation, there might be no venue in which&para;<br>to sue the receiving carrier. That interpretation would also under&para;<br>mine COGSA and international, container-based multimodal trans&para;<br>port: COGSA’s liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is&para;<br>damaged at sea and Carmack’s rules almost always would apply&para;<br>when the damage occurs on land. Moreover, applying Carmack to in&para;<br>ternational import shipping transport would undermine COGSA’s&para;<br>purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by&para;<br>sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29. The cargo owners’ contrary policy argu&para;<br>ments are unavailing.

The voyage here in&para;<br>cluded ocean transit followed by transfer to a rail carrier&para;<br>in this country. The Court addressed similar factual&para;<br>circumstances in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. James N.&para;<br>Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14 (2004). In that case the&para;<br>terms of a through bill were controlled by federal maritime&para;<br>law and by a federal statute known as the Carriage of&para;<br>Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), note following 46 U. S. C.&para;<br>§30701. Kirby held that bill of lading provisions permissi&para;<br>ble under COGSA can be invoked by a domestic rail car&para;<br>rier, despite contrary state law.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The instant cases present a question neither raised nor&para;<br>addressed in Kirby. It is whether the terms of a through&para;<br>bill of lading issued abroad by an ocean carrier can apply&para;<br>to the domestic part of the import’s journey by a rail car&para;<br>rier, despite prohibitions or limitations in another federal&para;<br>statute. That statute is known as the Carmack Amend&para;<br>ment and it governs the terms of bills of lading issued by&para;<br>domestic rail carriers. 49 U. S. C. §11706(a).&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondents Regal-Beloit Corporation, Victory Fire&para;<br>works, Inc., PICC Property &amp; Casualty Company Ltd., and&para;<br>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. are cargo&para;<br>owners or insurance firms that paid losses to cargo owners&para;<br>and succeeded to their rights, all referred to as “cargo&para;<br>owners.” To ship their goods from China to inland desti&para;<br>nations in the Midwestern United States, the cargo own&para;<br>ers delivered the goods in China to petitioners in No. 08–&para;<br>1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd., and its agent “K” Line&para;<br>America, Inc., both referred to as “K” Line. All agree the&para;<br>relevant contract terms governing the shipment are con&para;<br>tained in four through bills of lading “K” Line issued to the&para;<br>cargo owners. The bills of lading covered the entire course&para;<br>of shipment.&para;<br>The bills required “K” Line to arrange delivery of the&para;<br>goods from China to their final destinations in the United&para;<br>States, by any mode of transportation of “K” Line’s choos&para;<br>ing. A bill of lading “records that a carrier has received&para;<br>goods from the party that wishes to ship them, states the&para;<br>terms of carriage, and serves as evidence of the contract&para;<br>for carriage.” Kirby, 543 U. S., at 18–19. A through bill&para;<br>of lading covers both the ocean and inland portions of the&para;<br>transport in a single document. Id., at 25–26.&para;<br>“K” Line’s through bills contain five relevant provisions.&para;<br>First, they include a so-called “Himalaya Clause,” which&para;<br>extends the bills’ defenses and limitations on liability to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>parties that sign subcontracts to perform services contem&para;<br>plated by the bills. See id., at 20, and n. 2. Second, the&para;<br>bills permit “K” Line “to sub-contract on any terms what&para;<br>soever” for the completion of the journey. App. 145.&para;<br>Third, the bills provide that COGSA’s terms govern the&para;<br>entire journey. Fourth, the bills require that any dispute&para;<br>will be governed by Japanese law. Fifth, the bills state&para;<br>that any action relating to the carriage must be brought in&para;<br>“Tokyo District Court in Japan.” Id., at 144. The forum&para;<br>selection provision in the last clause gives rise to the&para;<br>dispute here.&para;<br>“K” Line, pursuant to the bills of lading, arranged for&para;<br>the entire journey. It subcontracted with petitioner in No.&para;<br>08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Company, for rail ship&para;<br>ment in the United States. The goods were to be shipped&para;<br>in a “K” Line vessel to a port in Long Beach, California,&para;<br>and then transferred to Union Pacific for rail carriage to&para;<br>the final destinations.&para;<br>In March and April 2005, the cargo owners brought four&para;<br>different container shipments to “K” Line vessels in Chi&para;<br>nese ports. All parties seem to assume that “K” Line&para;<br>safely transported the cargo across the Pacific Ocean to&para;<br>California. The containers were then loaded onto a Union&para;<br>Pacific train and that train, or some other train operated&para;<br>by Union Pacific, derailed in Tyrone, Oklahoma, allegedly&para;<br>destroying the cargo.&para;<br>The cargo owners filed four separate lawsuits in the&para;<br>Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The&para;<br>suit named “K” Line and Union Pacific as defendants.&para;<br>Union Pacific removed the suits to the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Central District of California. Union&para;<br>Pacific and “K” Line then moved to dismiss based on the&para;<br>parties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The District Court&para;<br>granted the motion to dismiss. It decided that the forum&para;<br>selection clause was reasonable and applied to Union&para;<br>Pacific pursuant to the Himalaya Clause in “K” Line’s bills&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of lading. 462 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1102–1103 (2006).&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit reversed and remanded. 557 F. 3d 985 (2009). The&para;<br>court concluded that the Carmack Amendment applied to&para;<br>the inland portion of an international shipment under a&para;<br>through bill of lading and thus trumped the parties’ fo&para;<br>rum-selection clause. Id., at 994–995. The court noted&para;<br>that this view was consistent with the position taken by&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see id., at 994&para;<br>(citing Sompo Japan Ins. Co. of Am. v. Union Pacific R.&para;<br>Co., 456 F. 3d 54 (2006)), but inconsistent with the views&para;<br>of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh,&para;<br>and Eleventh Circuits, see 557 F. 3d, at 994 (citing Shao v.&para;<br>Link Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., 986 F. 2d 700 (CA4 1993);&para;<br>American Road Serv.

Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Sea Star Line, LLC,&para;<br>458 F. 3d 1288 (CA11 2006)). This Court granted certio&para;<br>rari to address whether Carmack applies to the inland&para;<br>segment of an overseas import shipment under a through&para;<br>bill of lading. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Before turning to Carmack, a brief description of&para;<br>COGSA is in order; for “K” Line’s and Union Pacific’s&para;<br>primary contention is that COGSA, not Carmack, controls.&para;<br>COGSA governs the terms of bills of lading issued by&para;<br>ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade. 49 Stat. 1207, as&para;<br>amended, note following 46 U. S. C. §30701, p. 1178. It&para;<br>requires each carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill that&para;<br>contains certain terms. §3(3)–(8), at 1178–1179. Although&para;<br>COGSA imposes some limitations on the parties’ authority&para;<br>to adjust liability, it does not limit the parties’ ability to&para;<br>adopt forum-selection clauses. See Vimar Seguros y&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 537–&para;<br>539 (1995). By its terms, COGSA only applies to ship&para;<br>ments from United States ports to ports of foreign coun&para;<br>tries and vice versa. §§1(e), 13, at 1178, 1180. The stat&para;<br>ute, however, allows parties “the option of extending&para;<br>[certain COGSA terms] by contract” to cover “the entire&para;<br>period in which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s]&para;<br>responsibility, including [a] period of . . . inland transport.”&para;<br>Kirby, 543 U. S., at 29 (citing COGSA §7, at 1180). Ocean&para;<br>carriers, who often must issue COGSA bills of lading, are&para;<br>regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (Maritime&para;<br>Commission), which is responsible for oversight over&para;<br>“common carriage of goods by water in . . . foreign com&para;<br>merce.” 46 U. S. C. §40101(1).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The next statute to consider is the Carmack Amend&para;<br>ment, §7, 34 Stat. 595, which governs the terms of bills of&para;<br>lading issued by domestic rail carriers. Carmack was first&para;<br>enacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Com&para;<br>merce Act, 24 Stat. 379. The Carmack Amendment has&para;<br>been altered and recodified over the last century. It now&para;<br>provides, in relevant part, as follows:&para;<br>“(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service&para;<br>subject to the jurisdiction of the [Surface Transporta&para;<br>tion Board (STB)] under this part shall issue a receipt&para;<br>or bill of lading for property it receives for transporta&para;<br>tion under this part. That rail carrier and any other&para;<br>carrier that delivers the property and is providing&para;<br>transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of&para;<br>the [STB] under this part are liable to the person enti&para;<br>tled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The&para;<br>liability imposed under this subsection is for the ac&para;<br>tual loss or injury to the property caused by—&para;<br>“(1) the receiving rail carrier;&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“(2) the delivering rail carrier; or&para;<br>“(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route&para;<br>the property is transported in the United States or&para;<br>from a place in the United States to a place in an&para;<br>adjacent foreign country when transported under a&para;<br>through bill of lading.&para;<br>“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not af&para;<br>fect the liability of a rail carrier.” 49 U. S. C. §11706;&para;<br>see also §14706(a) (motor carriers).&para;<br>The Carmack Amendment thus requires a rail carrier&para;<br>that “receives [property] for transportation under this&para;<br>part” to issue a bill of lading. §11706(a). The provision&para;<br>“this part” refers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail&para;<br>transportation within the United States. See §10501&para;<br>(2006 ed. and Supp. II). The STB is the successor to the&para;<br>Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The STB has&para;<br>“exclusive” jurisdiction to regulate “transportation by rail&para;<br>carriers” between places in the United States as well as&para;<br>between a place “in the United States and a place in a&para;<br>foreign country.” §10501(a)(2)(F), (b) (2006 ed.). Regu&para;<br>lated rail carriers must provide transportation subject to&para;<br>STB rail carrier jurisdiction “on reasonable request,”&para;<br>§11101(a), at reasonable rates,&para;<br>§§10702, 10707(b),&para;<br>11101(a), (e).&para;<br>In cases where it applies, Carmack imposes upon “re&para;<br>ceiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail carrier[s]”&para;<br>liability for damage caused during the rail route under the&para;<br>bill of lading, regardless of which carrier caused the dam&para;<br>age. §11706(a). Carmack’s purpose is to relieve cargo&para;<br>owners “of the burden of searching out a particular negli&para;<br>gent carrier from among the often numerous carriers&para;<br>handling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v.&para;<br>Thompson, 339 U. S. 113, 119 (1950). To help achieve this&para;<br>goal, Carmack constrains carriers’ ability to limit liability&para;<br>by contract. §11706(c).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Carmack also limits the parties’ ability to choose the&para;<br>venue of their suit:&para;<br>“(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be&para;<br>brought in a district court of the United States or in a&para;<br>State court.&para;<br>“(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be&para;<br>brought—&para;<br>“(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judi&para;<br>cial district in which the point of origin is located;&para;<br>“(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judi&para;<br>cial district in which the principal place of business&para;<br>of the person bringing the action is located if the de&para;<br>livering carrier operates a railroad or a route&para;<br>through such judicial district, or in the judicial dis&para;<br>trict in which the point of destination is located; and&para;<br>“(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the&para;<br>loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such&para;<br>loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.” §11706.&para;<br>For purposes of these cases, it can be assumed that if&para;<br>Carmack’s terms apply to the bills of lading here, the&para;<br>cargo owners would have a substantial argument that the&para;<br>Tokyo forum-selection clause in the bills is pre-empted by&para;<br>Carmack’s venue provisions. The parties argue about&para;<br>whether they may contract out of Carmack’s venue provi&para;<br>sions and other requirements, see §§10502, 10709; but in&para;<br>light of the disposition and ruling to follow, those matters&para;<br>need not be discussed or further explored.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In Kirby, an ocean shipping company issued a through&para;<br>bill of lading, agreeing to deliver cargo from Australia to&para;<br>Alabama. Like the through bills in the present cases, the&para;<br>Kirby bill extended COGSA’s terms to the inland segment&para;<br>under a Himalaya Clause. There, as here, the property&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was damaged by a domestic rail carrier during the inland&para;<br>rail portion. 543 U. S., at 19–20.&para;<br>Kirby held that the through bill’s terms governed under&para;<br>federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state&para;<br>laws. Id., at 23–27. Kirby explained that “so long as a bill&para;<br>of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its&para;<br>purpose is to effectuate maritime commerce.” Id., at 27.&para;<br>The Court added that “[a]pplying state law to cases like&para;<br>this one would undermine the uniformity of general mari&para;<br>time law.” Id., at 28. “Confusion and inefficiency will&para;<br>inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a&para;<br>given contract’s meaning.” Id., at 29. The Court noted&para;<br>that its conclusion “reinforce[d] the liability regime Con&para;<br>gress established in COGSA,” and explained that COGSA&para;<br>allows parties to extend its terms to an inland portion of a&para;<br>journey under a through bill of lading. Ibid. Finally, the&para;<br>Court concluded that a contrary holding would defeat “the&para;<br>apparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient con&para;<br>tracting in contracts for carriage by sea.” Ibid.&para;<br>Much of what the Court said in Kirby applies to the&para;<br>present cases. “K” Line issued the through bills under&para;<br>COGSA, in maritime commerce. Congress considered&para;<br>such international through bills and decided to permit&para;<br>parties to extend COGSA’s terms to the inland domestic&para;<br>segment of the journey. The cargo owners and “K” Line&para;<br>did exactly that in these cases, agreeing in the through&para;<br>bills to require that any suit be brought in Tokyo.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The cargo owners argue that the Carmack Amendment,&para;<br>which has its own venue provisions and was not discussed&para;<br>in Kirby, requires a different result. In particular they&para;<br>argue that Carmack applies to the domestic inland seg&para;<br>ment of the carriage here, so the Tokyo forum-selection&para;<br>clause is inapplicable. For the reasons set forth below,&para;<br>this contention must be rejected. Instructed by the text,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>history, and purposes of Carmack, the Court now holds&para;<br>that the amendment does not apply to a shipment origi&para;<br>nating overseas under a single through bill of lading. As&para;<br>in Kirby, the terms of the bill govern the parties’ rights.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The text of the statute charts the analytic course. Car&para;<br>mack divides the realm of rail carriers into three parts:&para;<br>(1) receiving rail carriers; (2) delivering rail carriers; and&para;<br>(3) connecting rail carriers. A “receiving rail carrier” is&para;<br>one that “provid[es] transportation or service . . . for prop&para;<br>erty it receives for transportation under this part.”&para;<br>§11706(a); see §11706(a)(1). The provision “this part”&para;<br>refers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail transportation&para;<br>within the United States. See §10501. A “delivering rail&para;<br>carrier” “delivers the property and is providing transporta&para;<br>tion or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB]&para;<br>under this part.” §11706(a); see §11706(a)(2). A connect&para;<br>ing rail carrier is “another rail carrier over whose line or&para;<br>route the property is transported in the United States or&para;<br>from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent&para;<br>foreign country when transported under a through bill of&para;<br>lading.” §11706(a)(3).&para;<br>A rail carrier’s obligation to issue a Carmack-compliant&para;<br>bill of lading is determined by Carmack’s first sentence:&para;<br>“A rail carrier providing transportation or service sub&para;<br>ject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part&para;<br>shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it re&para;<br>ceives for transportation under this part.” §11706(a).&para;<br>This critical first sentence requires a Carmack-compliant&para;<br>bill of lading if two conditions are satisfied. First, the rail&para;<br>carrier must “provid[e] transportation or service subject to&para;<br>the jurisdiction of the [STB].” Second, that carrier must&para;<br>“receiv[e]” the property “for transportation under this&para;<br>part,” where “this part” is the STB’s jurisdiction over&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>domestic rail transport. Carmack thus requires the re&para;<br>ceiving rail carrier—but not the delivering or connecting&para;<br>rail carrier—to issue a bill of lading. As explained below,&para;<br>ascertaining the shipment’s point of origin is critical to&para;<br>deciding whether the shipment includes a receiving rail&para;<br>carrier.&para;<br>The conclusion that Carmack’s bill of lading require&para;<br>ment only applies to the receiving rail carrier is dictated&para;<br>by the text and is consistent with this Court’s precedent.&para;<br>See St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592,&para;<br>604 (1917) (explaining that Carmack “requires the receiv&para;<br>ing carrier to issue a through bill of lading”). A receiving&para;<br>rail carrier is the initial carrier, which “receives” the&para;<br>property for domestic rail transportation at the journey’s&para;<br>point of origin. §11706(a). If Carmack’s bill of lading&para;<br>requirement did not refer to the initial carrier, but rather&para;<br>to any rail carrier that in the colloquial sense “received”&para;<br>the property from another carrier, then every carrier&para;<br>during the shipment would have to issue its own separate&para;<br>bill. This would be altogether contrary to Carmack’s&para;<br>purpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers&para;<br>liable under a single, initial bill of lading for damage&para;<br>caused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.&para;<br>This Court’s decision in Mexican Light &amp; Power Co. v.&para;<br>Texas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731 (1947), supports the&para;<br>conclusion that only the receiving rail carrier must issue a&para;<br>Carmack bill of lading. There, a subsequent rail carrier in&para;<br>an export shipment from the United States to Mexico&para;<br>issued its own separate bill of lading at the U. S.-Mexico&para;<br>border. The second bill differed from the through bill&para;<br>issued by the “initial carrier,” id., at 733, (that is, the&para;<br>receiving carrier) at the inland point of origin. The Court&para;<br>held that Carmack, far from requiring nonreceiving carri&para;<br>ers to issue their separate bills of lading, makes any sub&para;<br>sequent bill “void” unless the “so-called second bill of&para;<br>lading represents the initiation of a new shipment.” Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>734.&para;<br>The Court’s decision in Reider v. Thompson, 339 U. S.&para;<br>113, is not to the contrary. That case involved goods&para;<br>originating in Argentina, bound for an inland location in&para;<br>the United States. The Court in Reider determined that&para;<br>because there was no through bill of lading, the original&para;<br>journey from Argentina terminated at the port of New&para;<br>Orleans. Thus, the first rail carrier in the United States&para;<br>was the receiving rail carrier and had to issue a Carmack&para;<br>bill of lading. Id., at 117. And because that carrier had to&para;<br>issue a separate bill of lading, it was not liable for damage&para;<br>done during the ocean-based portion of the shipment. Id.,&para;<br>at 118–119. Notably, neither Mexican Light nor Reider&para;<br>addressed the situation in the present cases, where the&para;<br>shipment originates overseas under a through bill of lad&para;<br>ing. And, for this reason, neither case discussed COGSA.&para;<br>The Carmack Amendment’s second sentence establishes&para;<br>when Carmack liability applies:&para;<br>“[The receiving rail carrier referred to in the first sen&para;<br>tence] and any other carrier that delivers the property&para;<br>and is providing transportation or service subject to&para;<br>the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable&para;<br>to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or&para;<br>bill of lading.” §11706(a)&para;<br>Thus, the receiving and delivering rail carriers are subject&para;<br>to liability only when damage is done to this “property,”&para;<br>that is to say, to property for which Carmack’s first sen&para;<br>tence requires the receiving rail carrier to issue a bill of&para;<br>lading. Ibid. Put another way, Carmack applies only to&para;<br>transport of property for which Carmack requires a receiv&para;<br>ing carrier to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether&para;<br>that carrier erroneously fails to issue such a bill. See ibid.&para;<br>(“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect&para;<br>the liability of a rail carrier”). The language in some of the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals’ decisions, which were rejected by the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Appeals in the opinion now under review, could&para;<br>be read to imply that Carmack applies only if a rail carrier&para;<br>actually issued a separate domestic bill of lading. See,&para;<br>e.g., Atladis, 458 F. 3d, at 1291–1294; American Road, 348&para;<br>F. 3d, at 568; Shao, 986 F. 2d, at 703; Capitol Converting,&para;<br>965 F. 2d, at 394. This may have led to some confusion.&para;<br>The decisive question is not whether the rail carrier in fact&para;<br>issued a Carmack bill but rather whether that carrier was&para;<br>required to issue a bill by Carmack’s first sentence.&para;<br>The above principles establish that for Carmack’s provi&para;<br>sions to apply the journey must begin with a receiving rail&para;<br>carrier, which would have to issue a Carmack-compliant&para;<br>bill of lading. It follows that Carmack does not apply if&para;<br>the property is received at an overseas location under a&para;<br>through bill that covers the transport into an inland loca&para;<br>tion in the United States. In such a case, there is no&para;<br>receiving rail carrier that “receives” the property “for&para;<br>[domestic rail] transportation,” §11706(a), and thus no&para;<br>carrier that must issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading.&para;<br>The initial carrier in that instance receives the property at&para;<br>the shipment’s point of origin for overseas multimodal&para;<br>import transport, not for domestic rail transport. (Today’s&para;<br>decision need not address the instance where goods are&para;<br>received at a point in the United States for export. Nor is&para;<br>it necessary to decide if Carmack applies to goods initially&para;<br>received in Canada or Mexico, for import into the United&para;<br>States. See infra, at 16.)&para;<br>The present cases illustrate the operation of these prin&para;<br>ciples. Carmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of&para;<br>lading because “K” Line was not a receiving rail carrier.&para;<br>“K” Line obtained the cargo in China for overseas trans&para;<br>port across an ocean and then to inland destinations in the&para;<br>United States. “K” Line shipped this property under&para;<br>COGSA-authorized through bills of lading. See supra, at&para;<br>4–5. That “K” Line chose to use rail transport to complete&para;<br>one segment of the journey under these “essentially mari&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>time” contracts, Kirby, 543 U. S., at 24, does not put “K”&para;<br>Line within Carmack’s reach and thus does not require it&para;<br>to issue Carmack bills of lading.&para;<br>As for Union Pacific, it was also not a receiving rail&para;<br>carrier under Carmack. The cargo owners conceded at&para;<br>oral argument that, even under their theory, Union Pacific&para;<br>was a mere delivering carrier, which did not have to issue&para;<br>its own Carmack bill of lading. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 39.&para;<br>This was a necessary concession. A carrier does not be&para;<br>come a receiving carrier simply by accepting goods for&para;<br>further transport from another carrier in the middle of an&para;<br>international shipment under a through bill. After all,&para;<br>Union Pacific was not the “initial carrier” for the carriage.&para;<br>Mexican Light, 331 U. S., at 733.&para;<br>If a carrier like Union Pacific, which acts as a connect&para;<br>ing or delivering carrier during an international through&para;<br>shipment, was, counterintuitively, a receiving carrier&para;<br>under Carmack, this would in effect outlaw through ship&para;<br>ments under a single bill of lading. This is because a&para;<br>carriage like the one in the present case would require two&para;<br>bills of lading: one that the overseas carrier (here, “K”&para;<br>Line) issues to the cargo owners under COGSA, and a&para;<br>second one that the first domestic rail carrier (here, Union&para;<br>Pacific) issues to the overseas carrier under Carmack.&para;<br>Kirby noted “the popularity of ‘through’ bills of lading, in&para;<br>which cargo owners can contract for transportation across&para;<br>oceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.”&para;<br>543 U. S., at 25–26. The Court sees no reason to read&para;<br>COGSA and Carmack to outlaw this efficient mode of&para;<br>international shipping by requiring these journeys to have&para;<br>multiple bills of lading. In addition, if Union Pacific had&para;<br>to issue a Carmack bill of lading to “K” Line, it is unclear&para;<br>whether the cargo owners (the parties Carmack is de&para;<br>signed to protect) would be able to sue under the terms&para;<br>governing that bill, especially in light of their different&para;<br>through bill with “K” Line. These difficulties are reason&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>enough to reject this novel interpretation of Carmack,&para;<br>which was neither urged by any party nor adopted by any&para;<br>authority that has been called to this Court’s attention.&para;<br>This would be a quite different case if, as in Reider, the&para;<br>bills of lading for the overseas transport ended at this&para;<br>country’s ports and the cargo owners then contracted with&para;<br>Union Pacific to complete a new journey to an inland&para;<br>destination in the United States. Under those circum&para;<br>stances, Union Pacific would have been the receiving rail&para;<br>carrier and would have been required to issue a separate&para;<br>Carmack-compliant bill of lading to the cargo owners. See&para;<br>Reider, 339 U. S., at 117 (“If the various parties dealing&para;<br>with this shipment separated the carriage into distinct&para;<br>portions by their contracts, it is not for courts judicially to&para;<br>meld the portions into something they are not”).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals interpreted Carmack as applying&para;<br>to any domestic rail segment of an overseas shipment,&para;<br>regardless of whether Carmack required a bill of lading.&para;<br>The court rested on the assumption that “[STB]’s jurisdic&para;<br>tion . . . is coextensive with Carmack’s coverage.” 557&para;<br>F. 3d, at 992. Yet, as explained above, Carmack applies&para;<br>only to shipments for which Carmack requires a bill of&para;<br>lading; that is to say, to shipments that start with a car&para;<br>rier that is both subject to the STB’s jurisdiction and&para;<br>“receives [the property] for [domestic rail] transportation.”&para;<br>The Court of Appeals ignored this “receive[d] . . . for trans&para;<br>portation” limitation and so reached the wrong conclusion.&para;<br>See, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339&para;<br>(1979) (courts are “obliged to give effect, if possible, to&para;<br>every word Congress used”).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ conclusion is also an awkward fit&para;<br>with Carmack’s venue provisions. Under Carmack, a suit&para;<br>against the “originating” (that is, receiving) rail carrier&para;<br>that has not actually caused the damage to the goods “may&para;<br>only be brought . . . in the judicial district in which the&para;<br>point of origin is located.” §11706(d)(2)(A), (A)(i). Suit&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>against either a delivering carrier or any carrier that&para;<br>caused the damage, by contrast, may be brought in vari&para;<br>ous other districts. See §11706(d)(2)(B), (C). “[J]udicial&para;<br>district” refers to “district court of the United States or in&para;<br>a State Court.” §11706(d)(1). Carmack’s venue provisions&para;<br>presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in&para;<br>a judicial district within the United States. Here, the&para;<br>journey’s “point of origin” was China, so Carmack’s venue&para;<br>provisions reinforce the interpretation that Carmack does&para;<br>not apply to this carriage.&para;<br>Indeed, if “K” Line were a receiving carrier in a case&para;<br>where the journey’s “point of origin” was China, there&para;<br>would be no place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since&para;<br>China is not within a judicial district “of the United States&para;<br>or in a State court.” Ibid. Carmack’s original premise is&para;<br>that the receiving carrier is liable for damage caused by&para;<br>the other carriers in the delivery chain. This premise&para;<br>would be defeated if there were no venue in which to sue&para;<br>the receiving rail carrier, as opposed to suing a different&para;<br>carrier under one of Carmack’s other venue provisions and&para;<br>then naming the receiving carrier as a codefendant. The&para;<br>far more likely conclusion is that “K” Line is not a receiv&para;<br>ing rail carrier at all under Carmack, and thus Carmack,&para;<br>including its venue provisions, does not apply to property&para;<br>shipped under “K” Line’s through bills. True, if the sole&para;<br>question were one of venue, suit could still be brought&para;<br>against the carrier that caused the damage or the deliver&para;<br>ing carrier. But the issue need not be explored here, for,&para;<br>as the Court holds, Carmack is inapplicable in these cases.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Carmack’s statutory history supports the conclusion&para;<br>that it does not apply to a shipment originating overseas&para;<br>under a through bill. None of Carmack’s legislative ver&para;<br>sions have applied to the inland domestic rail segment of&para;<br>an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted Carmack in 1906, as an amendment&para;<br>to the Interstate Commerce Act. At that time, the amend&para;<br>ment’s provisions applied only to “property for transporta&para;<br>tion from a point in one State to a point in another State.”&para;<br>§7, 34 Stat. 595. Congress amended Carmack in 1915, §1,&para;<br>38 Stat. 1197, and the relevant language remained un&para;<br>changed until Carmack was recodified in 1978. Under the&para;<br>pre-1978 language, Carmack’s bill of lading provisions&para;<br>applied not only to wholly domestic rail transport but also&para;<br>to cargo “receive[d] . . . for transportation” “from any point&para;<br>in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign&para;<br>country.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976 ed.).&para;<br>Even if there could be some argument that the Carmack&para;<br>Amendment before 1978 applied to imports from Canada&para;<br>and Mexico because the phrase “from . . . to” could also&para;<br>mean “between,” cf. Reider, supra, at 118 (explicitly not&para;<br>deciding this issue), the Court is unaware of any authority&para;<br>holding that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied&para;<br>to cargo originating from nonadjacent overseas countries&para;<br>under a through bill. See, e.g., In re The Cummins&para;<br>Amendment, 33 I. C. C. 682, 693 (1915); Brief for Respon&para;<br>dents 8 (effectively conceding this point).&para;<br>In 1978, Congress adopted the Carmack Amendment in&para;<br>largely its current form. §1, 92 Stat. 1337. Congress in&para;<br>the statute itself stated that it was recodifying Carmack&para;<br>and instructed that this recodification “may not be con&para;<br>strued as making a substantive change in the la[w].”&para;<br>§3(a), id., at 1466; see Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Okla&para;<br>homa Tax Comm’n, 481 U. S. 454, 457, n. 1 (1987). By&para;<br>interpreting the current version of the Carmack Amend&para;<br>ment to cover cargo originating overseas, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals disregarded this direction and dramatically ex&para;<br>panded Carmack’s scope beyond its historical coverage.&para;<br>Finally, in 1995, Congress reenacted Carmack. But that&para;<br>reenactment evidenced no intent to affect the substantive&para;<br>change that Court of Appeals’ decision would entail. See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§102(a), 109 Stat. 847–849. There is no claim that the&para;<br>1995 statute altered Carmack’s text in any manner rele&para;<br>vant here, as that reenactment merely indented subsec&para;<br>tions of Carmack for readability. Cf. United States v.&para;<br>O’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14)&para;<br>(“[C]urrent legislative drafting guidelines . . . advise draft&para;<br>ers to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate&para;<br>subsections that can be read more easily”).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Where the text permits, congressional enactments&para;<br>should be construed to be consistent with one another.&para;<br>And the interpretation of Carmack the Court now adopts&para;<br>attains the most consistency between Carmack and&para;<br>COGSA. First, applying Carmack to the inland segment&para;<br>of an international carriage originating overseas under a&para;<br>through bill would undermine Carmack’s purposes. Car&para;<br>mack is premised on the view that the shipment has a&para;<br>single bill of lading and any damage during the journey is&para;<br>the responsibility of both the receiving and the delivering&para;<br>carrier. See supra, at 6. Yet, under the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>interpretation of Carmack, there would often be no venue&para;<br>in which to sue the receiving carrier. See supra, at 14–15.&para;<br>Applying two different bill of lading regimes to the same&para;<br>through shipment would undermine COGSA and interna&para;<br>tional, container-based multimodal transport. As Kirby&para;<br>explained, “[t]he international transportation industry&para;<br>‘clearly has moved into a new era—the age of multimo&para;<br>dalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all&para;<br>available modes of transportation by air, water, and&para;<br>land.’ ” 543 U. S., at 25 (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admi&para;<br>ralty and Maritime Law 589 (4th ed. 2004)). If Carmack&para;<br>applied to an inland segment of a shipment from overseas&para;<br>under a through bill, then one set of liability and venue&para;<br>rules would apply when cargo is damaged at sea (COGSA)&para;<br>and another almost always would apply when the damage&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>occurs on land (Carmack). Rather than making claims by&para;<br>cargo owners easier to resolve, a court would have to&para;<br>decide where the damage occurred to determine which law&para;<br>applied. As a practical matter, this requirement often&para;<br>could not be met; for damage to the content of containers&para;<br>can occur when the contents are damaged by rough han&para;<br>dling, seepage, or theft, at some unknown point. See H.&para;<br>Kindred &amp; M. Brooks, Multimodal Transport Rules 143&para;<br>(1997). Indeed, adopting the Court of Appeals’ approach&para;<br>would seem to require rail carriers to open containers at&para;<br>the port to check if damage has been done during the sea&para;<br>voyage. This disruption would undermine international&para;<br>container-based transport. The Court will not read Con&para;<br>gress’ nonsubstantive recodification of Carmack in 1978 to&para;<br>create such a drastic sea change in practice in this area.&para;<br>Applying Carmack’s provisions to international import&para;<br>shipping transport would also undermine the “purpose of&para;<br>COGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for&para;<br>carriage by sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29. These cases provide&para;<br>an apt illustration. The sophisticated cargo owners here&para;<br>agreed to maritime bills of lading that applied to the&para;<br>inland segment through the Himalaya Clause and author&para;<br>ized “K” Line to subcontract for that inland segment “on&para;<br>any terms whatsoever.” The cargo owners thus made the&para;<br>decision to select “K” Line as a single company for their&para;<br>through transportation needs, rather than contracting for&para;<br>rail services themselves. The through bills provided the&para;<br>liability and venue rules for the foreseeable event that the&para;<br>cargo was damaged during carriage. Indeed, the cargo&para;<br>owners obtained separate insurance to protect against any&para;<br>excess loss. The forum-selection clause the parties agreed&para;<br>upon is “an indispensable element in international trade,&para;<br>commerce, and contracting” because it allows parties to&para;<br>“agre[e] in advance on a forum acceptable” to them.

First,&para;<br>any speculation that not applying Carmack to inland&para;<br>segments of overseas shipments will cause severe prob&para;<br>lems is refuted by that fact that Carmack even arguably&para;<br>did not govern the inland portion of such shipments from&para;<br>its enactment in 1906 until its nonsubstantive recodifica&para;<br>tion in 1978. See supra, at 15–17.

Rail carriers like Union Pacific, furthermore, remain&para;<br>subject to the STB’s regulation to the extent they operate&para;<br>within the United States. See supra, at 13–14. It is nota&para;<br>ble that although the STB has jurisdiction to regulate the&para;<br>rates of such carriers, even when the carriage is not gov&para;<br>erned by the Carmack Amendment, STB has exercised its&para;<br>authority to exempt from certain regulations service pro&para;<br>vided by a rail carrier “as part of a continuous intermodal&para;<br>freight movement,” 49 CFR §1090.2 (2009), like the jour&para;<br>ney at issue in these cases, see ibid.

Unless they have&para;<br>permissibly contracted around Carmack’s requirements,&para;<br>rail carriers in the United States such as petitioner Union&para;<br>Pacific are subject to those requirements, even though&para;<br>ocean carriers such as petitioner “K” Line are not.

Because I believe Carmack&para;<br>provides the default legal regime for rail transportation of&para;<br>cargo within the United States, regardless of whether the&para;<br>shipment originated abroad, I would reach the second&para;<br>question presented: whether Union Pacific was free to opt&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

Section 11706(a) states as follows:&para;<br>“A rail carrier providing transportation or service&para;<br>subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part&para;<br>shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it re­&para;<br>ceives for transportation under this part.

L. &amp; Com. 1, 13 (2009)&para;<br>(hereinafter Train Wrecks).&para;<br>The first sentence of&para;<br>§11706(a) sets forth the circumstances in which a receiv­&para;<br>ing rail carrier must issue a bill of lading: when property&para;<br>is first “receive[d]” for domestic transportation. This&para;<br>sentence does not define the full scope of Carmack liabil­&para;<br>ity, however, as the penultimate sentence of §11706(a)&para;<br>makes the absence of a bill of lading ultimately immate­&para;<br>rial to the question of Carmack liability. Instead, the&para;<br>second sentence of §11706(a) establishes Carmack’s ex­&para;<br>pansive scope, explaining which carriers are subject to&para;<br>Carmack liability: not only the rail carrier that receives&para;<br>the property, but also “any other carrier that delivers the&para;<br>property and is providing transportation or service subject&para;<br>to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part.” Criti­&para;<br>cally, that a rail carrier’s provision of “transportation or&para;<br>service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board” is the&para;<br>criterion that establishes liability under Carmack demon­&para;<br>strates that Carmack’s scope must be considered in tan­&para;<br>dem with the provision describing the Board’s jurisdiction&para;<br>over rail carriage.&para;<br>Under that provision, the Board has authority “over&para;<br>transportation by rail carrier,” either when that transpor­&para;<br>tation is “only by railroad” or when it is “by railroad and&para;<br>water, when the transportation is under common control,&para;<br>management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or&para;<br>shipment.” §10501(a)(1). Board jurisdiction over trans­&para;<br>portation by rail carrier “applies only to transportation in&para;<br>the United States,” not to transportation abroad.&para;<br>§10501(a)(2). Within the United States, however, Board&para;<br>jurisdiction exists broadly whenever that transportation is&para;<br>“between,” inter alia, “a place in . . . a State and a place in&para;<br>the same or another State as part of the interstate rail&para;<br>network,” “a place in . . . the United States and another&para;<br>place in the United States through a foreign country,” or&para;<br>“a place in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>country.” §§10501(a)(2)(A), (E), (F).&para;<br>With the jurisdictional framework in mind, I return to&para;<br>the final sentences of Carmack, §11706. The third sen­&para;<br>tence clarifies that liability under Carmack is imposed&para;<br>upon (1) “the receiving rail carrier” (which, under the first&para;<br>sentence of §11706(a) and the definition of the Board’s&para;<br>jurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in §10501(a), is the&para;<br>rail carrier that first receives the property for transporta­&para;<br>tion in the United States); (2) “the delivering rail carrier”&para;<br>(which, under the last sentence of §11706(a) and the&para;<br>Board’s jurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in&para;<br>§10501(a), is the final rail carrier providing the long­&para;<br>distance transportation “nearest the destination” in the&para;<br>United States); and (3) “another rail carrier over whose&para;<br>line or route the property is transported in the United&para;<br>States or from a place in the United States to a place in an&para;<br>adjacent foreign country when transported under a&para;<br>through bill of lading.” §11706(a). This last phrase in&para;<br>§11706(a)(3) serves two functions. It ensures that, where&para;<br>the entire rail transportation is “[with]in the United&para;<br>States,” any connecting rail carrier between the point at&para;<br>which the goods were received and the point at which the&para;<br>goods were delivered is liable under Carmack. It also&para;<br>ensures that, where the final destination of the goods is in&para;<br>Canada or Mexico, such that there is no domestic “deliver­&para;<br>ing” carrier, a connecting carrier taking on the goods in&para;<br>the United States will remain subject to Carmack as it&para;<br>travels toward its foreign destination while still in the&para;<br>United States. (As noted, the jurisdictional provision,&para;<br>incorporated by reference in §11706(a), is limited to&para;<br>“transportation in the United States,” §10501(a)(2).)&para;<br>The language of Carmack thus announces an expansive&para;<br>intent to provide the liability regime for rail carriage of&para;<br>property within the United States. Once a first domestic&para;<br>rail carrier subject to the Board’s jurisdiction receives&para;<br>property in the United States, Carmack attaches, regard­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>less of where the property originated. Carmack then&para;<br>applies to any other rail carrier subject to the Board’s&para;<br>jurisdiction in the chain of transportation, no matter&para;<br>whether the ultimate destination of the property is in the&para;<br>United States or elsewhere, for the period the carrier is&para;<br>traveling within the United States.&para;<br>It seems to me plain that, under these broadly inclusive&para;<br>provisions, Carmack governs rail carriers such as Union&para;<br>Pacific for any transportation of cargo within the United&para;<br>States, whether or not their domestic transportation is&para;<br>part of a multimodal international shipment, and whether&para;<br>or not they actually issued a domestic bill of lading. There&para;<br>is no question that Union Pacific is a “rail carrier” that is&para;<br>“subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.” §11706(a). It&para;<br>“receive[d]” the cargo, ibid., in California for domestic&para;<br>transportation to four different domestic inland loca­&para;<br>tions—i.e., “between a place in . . . a State and a place in&para;<br>. . . another State,” §10501(a)(2)(A)—while the shipment&para;<br>itself was transported “between a place in . . . the United&para;<br>States and a place in a foreign country,” §10501(a)(2)(F).&para;<br>Union Pacific should have issued a bill of lading for the&para;<br>cargo it received, but its failure to do so does not shield it&para;<br>from liability, as §11706(a) makes clear. Carmack there­&para;<br>fore provides the legal regime governing Union Pacific’s&para;<br>rail transportation in these cases.&para;<br>Carmack does not, however, govern ocean carriers such&para;<br>as “K” Line, because such carriers are not “rail carrier[s]&para;<br>providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdic­&para;<br>tion of the Board.” §11706(a). The ICA defines a “rail&para;<br>carrier” as “a person providing common carrier railroad&para;<br>transportation for compensation.” §10102(5). To resolve&para;<br>whether “K” Line meets this definition, I would apply the&para;<br>STB’s well established test and ask whether it “conduct[s]&para;<br>rail operations” and “ ‘hold[s] out’ that service to the pub­&para;<br>lic.” Assoc. of P&amp;C Dock Longshoremen v.

Cf. ante, at 10, 12. The two&para;<br>cases the majority cites for this proposition are inapposite,&para;<br>as neither addresses an international, multimodal ship­&para;<br>ment in which the first leg of the trip was by ocean.2 In&para;<br>St. Louis, I.

But nothing in these&para;<br>cases, and nothing in Carmack itself, requires that the&para;<br>“receiving carrier” take the goods from the shipper at the&para;<br>shipment’s point of origin.3&para;<br>Instead, these cases are compatible with my view that&para;<br>the “receiving carrier” is any rail carrier that first receives&para;<br>cargo for transportation in the United States.

Thompson, 339 U. S. 113 (1950), further supports this&para;<br>reading. There we explained that the test for Carmack&para;<br>applicability “is not where the shipment originated, but&para;<br>where the obligation of the carrier as receiving carrier&para;<br>originated.” Id., at 117. Because Carmack applies to&para;<br>domestic rail transport, and the domestic rail carrier’s&para;<br>obligation in that case arose in New Orleans where the&para;<br>rail carrier received the goods, it did not matter that the&para;<br>shipment began overseas in Buenos Aires. Similarly, in&para;<br>the instant cases, because Union Pacific’s obligations to&para;<br>transport by rail originated in California, it does not mat­&para;<br>ter that the shipment began overseas in China.5&para;<br>Second, the majority errs in suggesting that the issu­&para;<br>ance of an international through bill of lading precludes&para;<br>the applicability of Carmack. Cf. ante, at 10–11, 13. The&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority suggests that respondents “conceded” at oral argument&para;<br>that Union Pacific was not a receiving carrier but only a delivering&para;<br>carrier.

S. 611, 624–625 (1948).&para;<br>5 Contrary to Union Pacific’s suggestion, Brief for Petitioner in 08–&para;<br>1554, p. 33, its obligations did not originate in China. “K” Line’s bills of&para;<br>lading, issued in China, “entitled [“K” Line] to sub-contract on any&para;<br>terms . . . all duties whatsoever undertaken,” App. 145, and therefore&para;<br>did not create any obligation on the part of Union Pacific in China. In&para;<br>turn, the agreement between “K” Line and Union Pacific—which “K”&para;<br>Line made “by and through its duly authorized agent and representa­&para;<br>tive in the United States, ‘K’ Line AMERICA, Inc. . . ., a Michigan&para;<br>corporation,” id., at 120—was a multiyear contract committing “K” Line&para;<br>to “tender to [Union Pacific] not less than 95% of its Container traffic,”&para;<br>ibid., but did not actually commit “K” Line to deliver any particular&para;<br>piece of cargo to Union Pacific. As “K” Line explains, then, “the Agree­&para;<br>ment [with Union Pacific] was a ‘requirements’ contract, which did not&para;<br>become effective as to any particular container until ‘K’ Line delivered&para;<br>it” to Union Pacific in California.

In Reider, the Court found Carmack applica­&para;<br>ble when the first domestic rail carrier issued a bill of&para;<br>lading from New Orleans to Boston. Although we ob­&para;<br>served in that opinion that there was no through bill of&para;<br>lading from Buenos Aires to Boston, 339 U. S., at 117, we&para;<br>did not say, and it is not a necessary corollary, that the&para;<br>presence of such a bill of lading would have commanded a&para;<br>different result. The observation is better read as indicat­&para;<br>ing that no law other than Carmack could possibly have&para;<br>applied in that case: Because “the shipment . . . could not&para;<br>have moved an inch beyond New Orleans under the ocean&para;<br>bill,” id., at 118, a new domestic bill of lading for domestic&para;<br>transportation was required, and as to that transporta­&para;<br>tion, we held, Carmack unquestionably applied.&para;<br>For its part, Mexican Light held only that, where the&para;<br>first rail carrier in the chain of transportation issued a bill&para;<br>of lading, a subsequent bill of lading issued by a later rail&para;<br>carrier was void because Carmack contemplates one&para;<br>through bill of lading governing the entire journey by rail.&para;<br>331 U. S., at 734. A subsequent bill of lading by a connect­&para;<br>ing rail carrier, however, can be void under Carmack&para;<br>without requiring the conclusion that an international&para;<br>through bill of lading involving initial transportation by&para;<br>ocean carrier would void a subsequent bill of lading issued&para;<br>in the United States by the first rail carrier in the domes­&para;<br>tic chain of transportation. Because the text of Carmack&para;<br>expressly requires a bill of lading to be issued for property&para;<br>“receive[d] for transportation under this part,” and Union&para;<br>Pacific first received the property for rail transportation in&para;<br>the United States, it should have issued a bill of lading.&para;<br>Of course, its failure to do so did not affect its liability&para;<br>under Carmack (or that of a subsequent connecting or&para;<br>delivering carrier), as §11706(a) explicitly states.&para;<br>Third, the majority errs in giving weight to the differ­&para;<br>ence in scope between Carmack liability and the jurisdic­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion of the Board. Ante, at 14. I agree with the majority&para;<br>that Carmack’s reach is narrower than the Board’s juris­&para;<br>diction. The Board’s jurisdiction extends over transporta­&para;<br>tion by rail carrier “in the United States between a place&para;<br>in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign country,”&para;<br>§10501(a)(2)(F), which indicates that it does not matter&para;<br>whether the movement of the transportation is from the&para;<br>United States to the foreign country or from the foreign&para;<br>country to the United States.6 In contrast, Carmack ap­&para;<br>plies only when a rail carrier first receives property in the&para;<br>United States, §11706(a), and therefore would not apply to&para;<br>a rail carrier originating in Canada and delivering in the&para;<br>United States without transferring the property to a&para;<br>domestic rail carrier.7 As long as there is a receiving rail&para;<br>carrier in the United States, however, Carmack attaches.&para;<br>Because the property at issue in these cases was received&para;<br>in the United States for domestic transportation by Union&para;<br>Pacific, Carmack governs the rail carrier’s liability.&para;<br>Finally, the majority misunderstands the role I believe&para;<br>Carmack liability plays in international shipments to the&para;<br>United States. My reading of the statute would not “out­&para;<br>law through shipments under a single bill of lading.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The ICA’s jurisdictional provision uses the term “foreign country” to&para;<br>describe the Board’s jurisdiction, §10501(a)(2)(F), while Carmack uses&para;<br>the term “adjacent foreign country” to describe the liability of connect­&para;<br>ing carriers, §11706(a)(3). I find the difference between these terms to&para;<br>be of no moment. Section 10501 describes the Board’s jurisdiction over&para;<br>rail carriers, and it is impossible to have connecting rail lines between&para;<br>the United States and a foreign country that is not adjacent. This&para;<br>reading is confirmed by §10501(a)(2)(E), which refers to the Board’s&para;<br>jurisdiction over transportation by railroad “in the United States&para;<br>between a place in . . . the United States and another place in the&para;<br>United States and a foreign country.” No rail transportation between&para;<br>two places in the United States that is interrupted by rail transporta­&para;<br>tion through a foreign country could be through a foreign country that&para;<br>is anything but adjacent.&para;<br>7 This situation is consistent with historical agreements between the&para;<br>ICC and its Canadian counterpart. See infra, at 14–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Ante, at 13. To the contrary, an overseas ocean carrier&para;<br>like “K” Line can still issue a through bill of lading govern­&para;<br>ing the entire international trip to an American destina­&para;<br>tion. That bill of lading reflects the ocean carrier’s agree­&para;<br>ment with and obligations to the original shipper of the&para;<br>cargo. As the ocean carrier has no independent Carmack&para;<br>obligations of its own, the ocean carrier and the shipper&para;<br>are free to select whatever liability terms they wish to&para;<br>govern their relationship during the entire shipment. See&para;<br>infra, at 20–21. Carmack simply requires an American&para;<br>“receiving rail carrier” like Union Pacific to issue a bill of&para;<br>lading to the party from whom it received the goods for&para;<br>shipment—here, “K” Line. See Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.&para;<br>James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 33 (2004) (“When&para;<br>an intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport&para;<br>goods, the cargo owner’s recovery against the carrier is&para;<br>limited by the liability limitation to which the intermedi­&para;<br>ary and carrier agreed”); Great Northern R.

As to that bill of lading, Car­&para;<br>mack provides the legal regime and defines the relation­&para;<br>ship between the contracting parties (unless they have&para;<br>agreed to contract out of Carmack, see infra, at 23–26).&para;<br>The issuance of this second bill of lading, however, in no&para;<br>way undermines the efficiency of the through bill of lading&para;<br>between the ocean carrier and the original shipper, nor&para;<br>does it require that those parties bind themselves to apply&para;<br>Carmack to the inland leg.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The majority seems to find it troubling that my view “would require&para;<br>two bills of lading.” Ante, at 13.

REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>In addition to misreading the text, the Court’s opinion&para;<br>misapplies Carmack’s statutory history. The Court states&para;<br>that no version of Carmack has ever applied to imports&para;<br>originating overseas on a through bill of lading. Ante, at&para;<br>15. The Court further asserts that, because Congress&para;<br>stated that the 1978 recodification of the ICA effected no&para;<br>“substantive change,” Carmack should be read consis­&para;<br>tently with this historical practice. Ante, at 16. There are&para;<br>three problems with this analysis.&para;<br>First, if “Congress intended no substantive change” to&para;<br>Carmack in the 1978 recodification, “that would mean only&para;<br>that the present text is the best evidence of what the law&para;<br>has always meant, and that the language of the prior&para;<br>version cannot be relied upon to support a different read­&para;<br>ing.” Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 221&para;<br>(1993) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Because the present text&para;<br>of Carmack indicates that it applies to the domestic inland&para;<br>rail transportation of a multimodal international ship­&para;<br>ment, there is no reason to rely on Congress’ statement in&para;<br>the recodification.&para;<br>Second, there is no necessary conflict between the pre­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>warder delivered the shipper’s goods). The majority also suggests that&para;<br>an original shipper might not be able to sue Union Pacific under the&para;<br>terms of Union Pacific’s bill with “K” Line. Ante, at 13. In Kirby,&para;<br>however, we took as a given that the shipper could sue the inland rail&para;<br>carrier, even though the shipper was not a party to the rail carrier’s bill&para;<br>of lading with an intermediary. Indeed, we held that in an action&para;<br>against the rail carrier, the shipper was bound to the terms of the bill of&para;<br>lading governing the rail carrier’s transportation, even though those&para;<br>terms were less generous than the terms in the shipper’s through bill of&para;<br>lading with the freight forwarder with which it originally contracted.&para;<br>543 U. S., at 33–34. We observed that the shipper could sue the freight&para;<br>forwarder to recover the difference. Id., at 35. In light of this analysis,&para;<br>I see no reason to doubt a shipper’s ability to sue an American rail&para;<br>carrier under Carmack, even though its bill of lading with an overseas&para;<br>ocean carrier is not governed by Carmack.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The pre-1978 text referred to a carrier “receiving&para;<br>property for transportation from a point in one State or&para;<br>Territory or the District of Columbia to a point in another&para;<br>State, Territory, [or the] District of Columbia, or from any&para;<br>point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign&para;<br>country.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976).9 A rail carrier like&para;<br>Union Pacific who receives property in California for&para;<br>transportation to locations in the American midwest “re­&para;<br>ceiv[es] property from a point in one State . . . to a point in&para;<br>another State,” regardless of whether the property origi­&para;<br>nated in California or China. The geographical restriction&para;<br>“from any point in the United States to a point in an adja­&para;<br>cent foreign country” simply reflected agreements between&para;<br>the ICC and its Canadian counterpart to respect each&para;<br>other’s regulation of rail carriage originating in that coun­&para;<br>try. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae (herein­&para;<br>after Brief for United States) 17–18.

The general statement that Congress&para;<br>intended no change to the ICA should not require us to&para;<br>ignore what the current text of the specific Carmack pro­&para;<br>vision says, as both Union Pacific and “K” Line explicitly&para;<br>ask us to do.

I would not, however, read “from . . . to” in the&para;<br>current version of §11706(a)(3) to encompass “to . . . from,” as Congress&para;<br>specifically amended the similar language in the jurisdictional provi­&para;<br>sion at §10501(a)(2) to “between” while leaving intact the “to . . . from”&para;<br>in Carmack, against the background of Woodbury.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The United States observes that&para;<br>§11706(a)(3) describes the liability of “another rail carrier over whose&para;<br>line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a&para;<br>place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country&para;<br>when transported under a through bill of lading.” (Emphasis added.)&para;<br>According to the United States, “[t]hat textual limitation, when read in&para;<br>light of Carmack’s purpose, reflects Congress’s continued intent to&para;<br>restrict Carmack to the carriage of goods between places in the United&para;<br>States and for export to an adjacent foreign country.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 21. As I have already explained, however, once a domestic rail&para;<br>carrier first receives property for transportation within the United&para;<br>States, regardless of where the property itself originated, Carmack&para;<br>applies. Supra, at 3–6. Section 11706(a)(3) simply ensures that when a&para;<br>connecting carrier that neither received the property in the United&para;<br>States nor delivered it in the United States transports the property&para;<br>from the United States to either Canada or Mexico, that connecting&para;<br>carrier remains subject to Carmack liability during the part of the&para;<br>transportation that is in the United States. Further, as I explain&para;<br>below, see infra, at 18–20, Carmack’s purpose would be better effectu­&para;<br>ated by applying its provisions inland as the default rule. In any event,&para;<br>the “adjacent foreign country” provision in §11706(a)(3) has no bearing&para;<br>on the rail transportation provided in these cases by Union Pacific as&para;<br>“receiving rail carrier,” §11706(a), from California to four locations in&para;<br>the American midwest. To this transportation, Carmack plainly&para;<br>applies.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>consistency between Carmack and [the Carriage of Goods&para;<br>by Sea Act (COGSA)],” ante, at 17, reflects its fundamental&para;<br>misunderstanding of these statutes and the broader legal&para;<br>context in which the international shipping industry&para;<br>functions. As the mandatory default regime governing the&para;<br>relationship between an American receiving rail carrier&para;<br>and its direct contracting partner (here an overseas ocean&para;<br>carrier), Carmack permits the shippers who contract for a&para;<br>through bill of lading with the ocean carrier to receive the&para;<br>benefit of Carmack through that once-removed relation­&para;<br>ship. Such a legal regime is entirely consistent with&para;<br>COGSA and industry practice.&para;<br>As noted, the Court’s position as to Carmack rests on its&para;<br>erroneous belief that the “receiving carrier” must receive&para;<br>the goods at the point of the shipment’s origin. Ante, at&para;<br>12–15. Because Carmack provides that suit against the&para;<br>receiving rail carrier “may only be brought . . . in the&para;<br>judicial district in which the point of origin is located,” 49&para;<br>U. S. C. §11706(d)(2)(A)(i), and defines “judicial district” as&para;<br>only a federal or state court, §11706(d)(2)(B), the Court&para;<br>mistakenly concludes that were Carmack to apply to&para;<br>inland transportation of international shipments, “there&para;<br>would often be no venue in which to sue the receiving&para;<br>carrier” because that carrier would have received the&para;<br>goods in a foreign country where no federal or state court&para;<br>exists. Ante, at 14–15, 17. Contrary to the Court’s sugges­&para;<br>tion, however, the proper venue in which to sue a receiving&para;<br>carrier under Carmack is the location in which the first&para;<br>domestic rail carrier received the goods for domestic&para;<br>transportation. Supra, at 4–5, 9.&para;<br>Nor is it true that Carmack’s focus is on providing a&para;<br>single through bill of lading for an entire shipment. Ante,&para;<br>at 17. Carmack’s purpose in §11706 is to ensure that a&para;<br>single bill of lading, with a single protective liability re­&para;<br>gime, governs an entire shipment by rail carrier within&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

It does not place obligations on the relationship&para;<br>between any overseas carrier and any overseas shipper&para;<br>who operate under their own bill of lading. That Congress&para;<br>expected different liability regimes to govern ocean and&para;<br>rail carriers can be inferred from the different regulatory&para;<br>oversight provided for each type of carrier—the FMC for&para;<br>the former, the STB for the latter, see supra, at 8.&para;<br>Moreover, that Carmack provides certain greater pro­&para;<br>tections than does COGSA demonstrates that one of Car­&para;<br>mack’s purposes—beyond simply the fact of a single bill of&para;<br>lading governing all rail transportation—was to specify a&para;<br>protective liability regime for that part of the shipment&para;<br>only. As compared to COGSA, Carmack provides height­&para;<br>ened liability rules for rail transportation, compare&para;<br>COGSA §4, 49 Stat. 1207, note following 46 U. S. C.&para;<br>§30701, p. 1179, with 49 U. S. C. §§11706(a)–(c); stricter&para;<br>venue requirements, compare Vimar Seguros y Reasegu&para;<br>ros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U.

The&para;<br>Court is correct, ante, at 8, that Congress has permitted&para;<br>parties contractually to extend COGSA, which, by its own&para;<br>terms, applies only to the period “from the time when the&para;<br>goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged&para;<br>from the ship.” §§1(e), 7, at 1178, 1180. But the Court&para;<br>ignores that COGSA specifically contemplates that there&para;<br>may be “other law” that mandatorily governs the inland&para;<br>leg, and makes clear that contractual extension of COGSA&para;<br>does not trump this law. §12, at 1180 (“Nothing in&para;<br>[COGSA] shall be construed as superseding . . . any . . .&para;<br>other law which would be applicable in the absence of&para;<br>[COGSA], insofar as they relate to the duties, responsibili­&para;<br>ties, and liabilities of the ship or carrier prior to the time&para;<br>when the goods are loaded on or after the time they are&para;<br>discharged from the ship”); see also Sturley, Freedom of&para;<br>Contract and the Ironic Story of Section 7 of the Carriage&para;<br>of Goods by Sea Act, 4 Benedict’s Mar.

Notably, when it wants to do so, Congress knows&para;<br>how to specify that a contractual extension of COGSA&para;<br>supersedes other law: COGSA elsewhere defines a limited&para;<br>circumstance—the carriage of goods by sea between ports&para;<br>of the United States—in which a contractual extension of&para;<br>COGSA has the force of law. §13, at 1180 (providing that&para;<br>such bills of lading “shall be subjected hereto as fully as if&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Even under the&para;<br>Court’s interpretation, two sets of rules may govern, be­&para;<br>cause the parties need not extend COGSA to the inland&para;<br>leg—they may agree on any terms they choose to cover&para;<br>that transportation. §7, at 1180 (permitting the parties to&para;<br>“ente[r] into any agreement . . . as to the responsibility and&para;<br>liability of the carrier or the ship” for the period before the&para;<br>goods are loaded on and after they are discharged from the&para;<br>ship (emphasis added)); see also Train Wrecks 23&para;<br>(“[C]arriers regularly include clauses in their bills of lad­&para;<br>ing to limit their liability [for inland travel] in ways that&para;<br>COGSA prohibits”); 1 T.

It would even permit different&para;<br>liability rules to apply to different lawsuits arising out of&para;<br>the same inland accident depending on where each piece&para;<br>of cargo originated. Contrary to the Court’s view, then,&para;<br>the value of uniformity articulated in Kirby is best pro­&para;<br>moted by application of Carmack to the obligations of the&para;<br>rail carrier during the inland leg in these cases.

I&para;<br>would hold that where, as here, the STB has exempted rail&para;<br>carriers from Part A of the ICA pursuant to its authority&para;<br>as set forth in 49 U. S. C. §10502, such rail carriers may&para;<br>not use §10709 to opt out of Carmack entirely. Instead,&para;<br>such rail carriers must first offer their contractual coun­&para;<br>terparties Carmack-compliant terms for liability and&para;<br>claims, as §10502(e) requires. Having reached that con­&para;<br>clusion, I would remand for consideration of whether the&para;<br>requirements of §10502(e) were met in these cases. I set&para;<br>forth these views only briefly, as the Court’s determina­&para;<br>tion that Carmack does not apply at all makes resolution&para;<br>of these questions moot.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.

Consistent with these goals, 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§10502 and 10709 provide two options for contracting&para;<br>around the requirements of the ICA.&para;<br>Section 10502(a) provides that when certain conditions&para;<br>are met, the Board “shall exempt,” “to the maximum&para;<br>extent consistent with this part,” “a person, class of per­&para;<br>sons, or a transaction or service” from either a particular&para;<br>provision of Part A of the ICA or the entirety of that Part.&para;<br>Section 10502(f) specifies that “[t]he Board may exercise&para;<br>its authority under this section to exempt transportation&para;<br>that is provided by a rail carrier as part of a continuous&para;<br>intermodal movement.” Acting pursuant to this authority,&para;<br>the Board has broadly exempted such transportation&para;<br>“from the requirements of [the ICA].” 49 CFR §1090.2&para;<br>(2009). The authority to issue broad exemptions, however,&para;<br>is not unlimited. Under 49 U. S. C. §10502(e), “[n]o ex­&para;<br>emption order issued pursuant to this section shall oper­&para;<br>ate to relieve any rail carrier from an obligation to provide&para;<br>contractual terms for liability and claims which are consis­&para;<br>tent with the provisions of [Carmack],” although, at the&para;<br>same time, “[n]othing . . . shall prevent rail carriers from&para;<br>offering alternative terms.” Section 10502(g) further&para;<br>limits the Board from exempting rail carriers from their&para;<br>obligations to comply with certain employee protections&para;<br>under Part A of the ICA.&para;<br>In turn, under §10709(a), “[o]ne or more rail carriers&para;<br>providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the&para;<br>Board . . . may enter into a contract with one or more&para;<br>purchasers of rail services to provide specified services&para;<br>under specified rates and conditions.” Having signed such&para;<br>a contract, a rail carrier “shall have no duty in connection&para;<br>with services provided under such contract other than&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>those duties specified by the terms of the contract.”&para;<br>§10709(b). Once such a contract is made, that contract,&para;<br>“and transportation under such contract, shall not be&para;<br>subject to this part, and may not be subsequently chal­&para;<br>lenged before the Board or in any court on the grounds&para;<br>that such contract violates a provision of [Part A of the&para;<br>ICA].” §10709(c)(1).&para;<br>According to Union Pacific, §10502(e) limits only the&para;<br>Board’s exemption ability; it does not place any affirma­&para;<br>tive obligation on rail carriers to offer Carmack-compliant&para;<br>terms. Rail carriers, Union Pacific contends, may opt out&para;<br>of Carmack entirely simply by entering into a contract&para;<br>under §10709, thus escaping any duty imposed by Part A&para;<br>of the ICA. I disagree. I am persuaded by the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s view that because the Board’s order in 49 CFR&para;<br>§1090.2 exempted intermodal rail transportation from all&para;<br>of Part A of the ICA, which includes 49 U. S. C. §10709,&para;<br>“Union Pacific could not properly enter into a contract&para;<br>under Section 10709 to relieve it of its obligations under&para;<br>Section 10502(e).” Brief for United States 31. Those&para;<br>obligations require “a rail carrier providing exempt trans­&para;<br>portation [to] offer the shipper the option of contractual&para;<br>terms for liability and claims consistent with Carmack,&para;<br>presumably at a higher rate,” and they permit such a rail&para;<br>carrier to “enter into a contract with different terms only if&para;<br>the shipper does not select that option.” Id., at 30.&para;<br>Observing that the Board’s exemption order relieves&para;<br>intermodal rail transportation from the “requirements” of&para;<br>Part A, Union Pacific contends that §10709 is not a re­&para;<br>quirement but a privilege and therefore is not included&para;<br>within the exemption. In clarifying its order, however, the&para;<br>Board has described the exemption as one from “regula­&para;<br>tion” under the ICA or “application” of that Act. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Improvement of TOFC/COFC Regulations, 3 I. C. C. 2d, at&para;<br>869–870. Especially in light of this clarification, there&para;<br>seems little reason to ascribe significance to the Board’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>use of the word “requirements,” instead of the statutory&para;<br>term “provision,” in the exemption order.&para;<br>The Government aptly describes the policy concerns&para;<br>that justify this reading of the interplay between §§10502&para;<br>and 10709. Brief for United States 31–32. Because a rail&para;<br>carrier’s counterparty to a §10709 contract can ordinarily&para;<br>require a rail carrier to comply with common carriage&para;<br>rates and terms under Part A (including Carmack), such&para;<br>counterparties possess considerable bargaining power.&para;<br>But rail carriers the Board has exempted from Part A&para;<br>under §10502 lack any obligation to comply with that&para;<br>Part. If exempt carriers could escape Carmack’s obliga­&para;<br>tions under §10709, their counterparties would be at a&para;<br>significant disadvantage as compared to counterparties to&para;<br>contracts with nonexempt carriers. Such a disadvantage&para;<br>cannot be squared with Congress’ evident intent, as ex­&para;<br>pressed in §10502(e), to ensure that no carrier may be&para;<br>automatically exempted from Carmack.&para;<br>This interpretation of §§10502 and 10709 imposes no&para;<br>unfairness on exempt rail carriers. As the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals explained, “carriers providing exempt transportation&para;<br>gain the benefits of deregulation, but lose the opportunity&para;<br>to contract for preferable terms under §10709 without first&para;<br>offering Carmack terms.” 557 F. 3d 985, 1002 (CA9 2009).&para;<br>Given rail carriers’ ability to charge higher rates for full&para;<br>Carmack coverage, see New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. v.&para;<br>Nothnagle, 346 U. S. 128, 135 (1953), and the likelihood&para;<br>that some counterparties will agree to reject Carmack­&para;<br>compliant terms in favor of a lower price, such a trade-off&para;<br>makes eminent sense.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Whether Union Pacific properly contracted out of Car­&para;<br>mack under §10502(e) requires a factual determination&para;<br>better suited for resolution by the District Court in the&para;<br>first instance. Accordingly, I would remand for considera­&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion of that issue. Cf. 557 F. 3d, at 1003. Union Pacific&para;<br>also raises a related legal argument not decided by the&para;<br>courts below: that the forum selection clause at issue in&para;<br>these cases is valid because venue is not encompassed&para;<br>within the phrase “contractual terms for liability and&para;<br>claims” in §10502(e). To the extent this argument is not&para;<br>waived, it would also be properly considered on remand.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In endorsing a strained reading of the text, history, and&para;<br>purpose of Carmack, the Court is evidently concerned with&para;<br>a perceived need to enforce the COGSA-based contracts&para;<br>that the “sophisticated cargo owners” here made with “K”&para;<br>Line. Ante, at 18. But these cases do not require the&para;<br>Court to interpret or examine the contract between the&para;<br>cargo owners and “K” Line. The Court need consider only&para;<br>the legal relationship between Union Pacific and “K” Line&para;<br>as its direct contracting party. As to that relationship, it&para;<br>bears emphasizing that industry actors on all sides are&para;<br>sophisticated and can easily adapt to a regime in which&para;<br>Carmack provides the default rule governing the rail&para;<br>carrier’s liability during the inland leg of a multimodal&para;<br>shipment traveling on an international through bill of&para;<br>lading. See, e.g., Train Wrecks 40 (describing how ocean&para;<br>and rail carriers have drafted their contracts to account&para;<br>for—and permissibly escape—Carmack’s applicability); cf.&para;<br>Kirby, 543 U. S., at 36 (recognizing that “our decision does&para;<br>no more than provide a legal backdrop against which&para;<br>future bills of lading will be negotiated”). In disregarding&para;<br>Congress’ commands in both Carmack and COGSA and in&para;<br>discounting the practical realities reflected in the Rotter­&para;<br>dam Rules and other international conventions governing&para;<br>the carriage of goods, the Court ignores what we acknowl­&para;<br>edged in Kirby: “It is not . . . this Court’s task to structure&para;<br>the international shipping industry.” Ibid.
