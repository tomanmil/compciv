S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>BRIAN COLEMAN, SUPERINTENDENT, STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT FAYETTE, ET AL.&para;<br>v. LORENZO JOHNSON&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 11–1053. Decided May 29, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an accomplice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in&para;<br>the early morning hours of December 15, 1995, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After his conviction was affirmed&para;<br>in state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and&para;<br>sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court&para;<br>pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254. The District&para;<br>Court denied habeas relief but the U. S. Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence&para;<br>at trial was insufficient to support Johnson’s conviction&para;<br>under the standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443&para;<br>U. S. 307 (1979).&para;<br>We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar&para;<br>in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to&para;<br>two layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, “it&para;<br>is the responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide&para;<br>what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted&para;<br>at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury’s verdict&para;<br>on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational&para;<br>trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.” Cavazos v.&para;<br>Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).&para;<br>And second, on habeas review, “a federal court may not&para;<br>overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of&para;<br>the evidence challenge simply because the federal court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. JOHNSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead&para;<br>may do so only if the state court decision was ‘objectively&para;<br>unreasonable.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)).&para;<br>Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect&para;<br>to the role of the jury and the state courts of Pennsylvania,&para;<br>we now grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed&para;<br>by Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of firstdegree murder. Johnson was with Walker on the night of&para;<br>the crime, and the two were tried jointly. Johnson was&para;<br>charged as an accomplice and co-conspirator. See 18 Pa.&para;<br>Cons. Stat. §2502 (2008) (defining first-degree murder&para;<br>as “willful, deliberate and premeditated” killing); §306(c)&para;<br>(imposing accomplice liability for anyone who, “with the&para;<br>intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the&para;<br>offense . . . aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other&para;<br>person in planning or committing it”); Commonwealth v.&para;<br>Montalvo, 598 Pa. 263, 274, 956 A. 2d 926, 932 (2008)&para;<br>(criminal conspiracy liability for anyone who takes an&para;<br>overt act in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or&para;<br>commit).&para;<br>At trial, the Commonwealth called Victoria Doubs, who&para;<br>testified that she, Johnson, and Walker were “close&para;<br>friends” who “ran the streets together.” Tr. 213. On the&para;<br>morning of December 14, the three of them awoke at the&para;<br>same residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a&para;<br>Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encountered Williams. Walker announced that he was going to&para;<br>“holler at” Williams about a debt Williams owed. Id., at&para;<br>217. According to Doubs, Walker and Williams “were&para;<br>talking about the money that [Williams] had owed us,”&para;<br>with Walker “asking [Williams], confronting him, about&para;<br>his money and what’s up with the money and why is it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>taking you so long to give us the money.” Id., at 217–218.&para;<br>Williams was “cussing [Walker] out, telling him he’d&para;<br>give it to him when he felt like it and he ain’t scared of&para;<br>[Walker].” Id., at 218. A fight ensued, which ended&para;<br>when Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front&para;<br>of the crowd of people that had gathered.&para;<br>After the fight, Doubs testified, Walker “was mad, because he got beat by a crackhead. . . . He was saying, yo,&para;<br>that crackhead beat me. I’m going to kill that crackhead.&para;<br>I’m going to kill that kid. . . . He was hot. He was heated.”&para;<br>Id., at 220–221. Johnson was present when Walker made&para;<br>these statements. Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted&para;<br>the beating to others, who laughed at Walker. Walker&para;<br>“repeated it for a while that I’m going to kill that kid.&para;<br>That kid must think I’m some type of joke. I’m going to&para;<br>kill that kid. Who he think he is[?]” Id., at 222. Once&para;<br>again, Johnson was present for these statements.&para;<br>Another witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim,&para;<br>who testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar&para;<br>on the night of December 14–15, where she saw Walker,&para;<br>Johnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument.&para;<br>Although she could not hear what they were saying, she&para;<br>could tell they were arguing because they were making “a&para;<br>lot of arm movements.” Id., at 104. The bouncer soon told&para;<br>them to leave, and Brown followed them into the street&para;<br>because she “wanted to know what was going on.” Ibid.&para;<br>Brown observed the three men walking in a single-file&para;<br>line, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and&para;<br>Johnson in the back. Walker was wearing a long leather&para;<br>coat, walking as if he had something concealed underneath it. Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at&para;<br>which point Williams recognized Brown and told her to “go&para;<br>ahead” and pass. Id., at 107. Walker then entered the&para;<br>alleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained&para;<br>standing at the entrance. As Brown walked past the alley,&para;<br>she heard a loud “boom,” causing her to run away. Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. JOHNSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>143. On cross-examination, Brown stated: “They walked&para;<br>[Williams] in that alley. He stood inside the alley. He&para;<br>walked him in the alley. I heard a boom.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testified that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at&para;<br>12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15. He heard a&para;<br>loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from&para;<br>his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes&para;<br>fleeing.&para;<br>After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey,&para;<br>who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at&para;<br>the time of the murder. He testified that he saw Williams&para;<br>walking toward an alleyway with two males and a female,&para;<br>and he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered&para;<br>the alley. When pressed on cross-examination, he stated:&para;<br>“I would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.” Id.,&para;<br>at 189.&para;<br>The jury also heard testimony from police who searched&para;<br>the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun&para;<br>with the barrel missing. A medical examiner who examined Williams’ body testified that the cause of death was a&para;<br>shotgun wound to the chest.&para;<br>After the jury convicted Johnson, he filed a post-trial&para;<br>motion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court denied his motion, and&para;<br>the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction&para;<br>on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 726&para;<br>A. 2d 1079 (1998). After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&para;<br>denied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully&para;<br>sought state postconviction relief. He then filed a habeas&para;<br>petition in Federal District Court, which denied his&para;<br>claims. See Johnson v. Mechling, 541 F. Supp. 2d 651&para;<br>(MD Pa. 2008). Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third&para;<br>Circuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his&para;<br>conviction overturned.&para;<br>Under Jackson, evidence is sufficient to support a con-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>viction if, “after viewing the evidence in the light most&para;<br>favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact&para;<br>could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” 443 U. S., at 319.&para;<br>In light of the testimony at Johnson’s trial, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals acknowledged that “[a] trier of fact could reasonably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common&para;<br>intent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.” Johnson&para;<br>v. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011). As for&para;<br>the notion that “Johnson shared Walker’s intent to kill&para;<br>Williams,” however, the court concluded that was “mere&para;<br>speculation” that no rational factfinder could accept as&para;<br>true. Ibid. The court stated that “a reasonable inference&para;<br>is one where the fact inferred is ‘more likely than not to&para;<br>flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 539–540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland,&para;<br>452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A. 2d 592, 594 (1973)). In order for a&para;<br>jury’s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned,&para;<br>they must “ ‘flow from facts and circumstances proven in&para;<br>the record’ ” that are “ ‘of such volume and quality as to&para;<br>overcome the presumption of innocence.’ ” 446 Fed. Appx.,&para;<br>at 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A. 2d 543,&para;<br>560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).&para;<br>At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of&para;<br>Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what&para;<br>distinguishes a reasoned inference from “mere speculation.” Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state&para;<br>law for “the substantive elements of the criminal offense,”&para;<br>443 U. S., at 324, n. 16, but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the&para;<br>offense is purely a matter of federal law.&para;<br>Under the deferential federal standard, the approach&para;<br>taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it unduly impinged on the jury’s role as factfinder. Jackson&para;<br>leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences&para;<br>to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. JOHNSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>only that jurors “draw reasonable inferences from basic&para;<br>facts to ultimate facts.” Id., at 319. This deferential&para;<br>standard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual&para;<br>parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For example, in addressing Brown and Ramsey’s testimony that&para;<br>Williams was “walked” and “forced” into the alleyway, the&para;<br>court objected that the witnesses did not describe any&para;<br>“physical action” supporting the conclusion that force was&para;<br>used. 446 Fed. Appx., at 541. Absent some specific testimony that “Johnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or&para;<br>otherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented&para;<br>him from leaving it,” ibid., the court could see no reasonable basis for the jury’s conclusion that Johnson had a&para;<br>specific intent to help kill Williams.&para;<br>That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coercive nature of Johnson and Walker’s behavior could be&para;<br>inferred from other circumstances not involving the direct&para;<br>use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon,&para;<br>and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams&para;<br>after a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson&para;<br>and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file&para;<br>line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the&para;<br>entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that&para;<br>Johnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams&para;<br>from fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded&para;<br>that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the&para;<br>murder.&para;<br>Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the&para;<br>trial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker “ran&para;<br>the streets together,” and had attempted to collect a debt&para;<br>from Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams&para;<br>resisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in&para;<br>the process by giving him a public thrashing with a&para;<br>broomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he&para;<br>repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>presence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while&para;<br>Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his&para;<br>trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley,&para;<br>where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled&para;<br>out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.&para;<br>On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer&para;<br>that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped&para;<br>usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The&para;<br>jury in this case was convinced, and the only question&para;<br>under Jackson is whether that finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The&para;<br>state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable deference&para;<br>under AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d).&para;<br>Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the&para;<br>state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson’s&para;<br>trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufficient&para;<br>to convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator&para;<br>in the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth’s&para;<br>petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma&para;<br>pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
