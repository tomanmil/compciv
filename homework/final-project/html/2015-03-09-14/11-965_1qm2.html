BAUMAN ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–965.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 15, 2013—Decided January 14, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>Plaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who&para;<br>filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant&para;<br>DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public&para;<br>stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.&para;<br>Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state security forces during Argentina’s 1976–1983 “Dirty War” to kidnap,&para;<br>detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them,&para;<br>plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and&para;<br>the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California&para;<br>and Argentina law. Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),&para;<br>another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its&para;<br>principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the&para;<br>United States, including California. Daimler moved to dismiss the&para;<br>action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing that motion, plaintiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the&para;<br>California contacts of MBUSA. The District Court granted Daimler’s&para;<br>motion to dismiss. Reversing the District Court’s judgment, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the&para;<br>California courts’ all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler’s “agent” for&para;<br>jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be answerable to suit in that State.&para;<br>Held: Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries allegedly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside&para;<br>the United States. Pp. 6–24.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) California’s long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the U. S. Constitution.&para;<br>Thus, the inquiry here is whether the Ninth Circuit’s holding comports with the limits imposed by federal due process. See Fed. Rule&para;<br>Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A). P. 6.&para;<br>(b) For a time, this Court held that a tribunal’s jurisdiction over&para;<br>persons was necessarily limited by the geographic bounds of the forum. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. That rigidly territorial focus&para;<br>eventually yielded to a less wooden understanding, exemplified by&para;<br>the Court’s pathmarking decision in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310. International Shoe presaged the recognition of&para;<br>two personal jurisdiction categories: One category, today called “specific jurisdiction,” see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v.&para;<br>Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___, encompasses cases in which the suit&para;<br>“arise[s] out of or relate[s] to the defendant’s contacts with the forum,” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.&para;<br>408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distinguished exercises of specific,&para;<br>case-based jurisdiction from a category today known as “general jurisdiction,” exercisable when a foreign corporation’s “continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from&para;<br>dealings entirely distinct from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318.&para;<br>Since International Shoe, “specific jurisdiction has become the centerpiece of modern jurisdiction theory.” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.&para;<br>This Court’s general jurisdiction opinions, in contrast, have been few.&para;<br>See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416, and Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___. As is evident&para;<br>from these post-International Shoe decisions, while specific jurisdiction has been cut loose from Pennoyer’s sway, general jurisdiction has&para;<br>not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized. Pp. 6–14.&para;<br>(c) Even assuming, for purposes of this decision, that MBUSA qualifies as at home in California, Daimler’s affiliations with California&para;<br>are not sufficient to subject it to the general jurisdiction of that&para;<br>State’s courts. Pp. 14–23.&para;<br>(1) Whatever role agency theory might play in the context of&para;<br>general jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals’ analysis in this case cannot be sustained. The Ninth Circuit’s agency determination rested&para;<br>primarily on its observation that MBUSA’s services were “important”&para;<br>to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler’s hypothetical readiness to perform&para;<br>those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. But if “importan[ce]” in&para;<br>this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign&para;<br>corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever&para;<br>they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would&para;<br>sweep beyond even the “sprawling view of general jurisdiction” re-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>jected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___. Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>(2) Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and&para;<br>that MBUSA’s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be&para;<br>no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California. The&para;<br>paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corporation’s place of incorporation and principal place of business. Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___. Plaintiffs’ reasoning, however, would reach&para;<br>well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general&para;<br>jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation “engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 16–17, and nn. 7–8. The words “continuous and systematic,” plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in&para;<br>International Shoe to describe situations in which the exercise of specific jurisdiction would be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317. With&para;<br>respect to all-purpose jurisdiction, International Shoe spoke instead&para;<br>of “instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a&para;<br>state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit . . . on&para;<br>causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.” Id., at 318. Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has&para;<br>explained, is whether a foreign corporation’s “affiliations with the&para;<br>State are so ‘continuous and systematic’ as to render [it] essentially&para;<br>at home in the forum State.” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.&para;<br>Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor&para;<br>does either entity have its principal place of business there. If Daimler’s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presumably be available in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are&para;<br>sizable. No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general jurisdiction so grasping. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to&para;<br>conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA’s contacts attributed to it,&para;<br>was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims&para;<br>by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred&para;<br>or had its principal impact in California. Pp. 18–21.&para;<br>(3) Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears attention. This Court’s recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs’&para;<br>Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims. See Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___, ___, and Mohamad&para;<br>v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___. The Ninth Circuit, moreover, paid little heed to the risks to international comity posed by its&para;<br>expansive view of general jurisdiction.

The litigation commenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents1&para;<br>filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the&para;<br>Northern District of California against DaimlerChrysler&para;<br>Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler),2 a German public stock&para;<br>company, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures&para;<br>Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany.&para;<br>The complaint&para;<br>alleged that during Argentina’s 1976–1983 “Dirty War,”&para;<br>Daimler’s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security&para;<br>forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 One plaintiff is a resident of Argentina and a citizen of Chile; all&para;<br>other plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Argentina.&para;<br>2 Daimler was restructured in 2007 and is now known as Daimler AG.&para;<br>No party contends that any postsuit corporate reorganization bears on&para;<br>our disposition of this case.

BAUMAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons&para;<br>closely related to plaintiffs. Damages for the alleged&para;<br>human-rights violations were sought from Daimler under&para;<br>the laws of the United States, California, and Argentina.&para;<br>Jurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),&para;<br>a subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with&para;<br>its principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA&para;<br>distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the United States, including&para;<br>California.&para;<br>The question presented is whether the Due Process&para;<br>Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the District Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in&para;<br>this case, given the absence of any California connection&para;<br>to the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the&para;<br>complaint. Plaintiffs invoked the court’s general or allpurpose jurisdiction. California, they urge, is a place&para;<br>where Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against&para;<br>it, wherever in the world the claims may arise. For example, as plaintiffs’ counsel affirmed, under the proffered&para;<br>jurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle&para;<br>overturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passenger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit&para;<br>in California. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29. Exercises of&para;<br>personal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by&para;<br>due process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory&para;<br>authority.&para;<br>In Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,&para;<br>564 U. S. ___ (2011), we addressed the distinction between&para;<br>general or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conductlinked jurisdiction. As to the former, we held that a court&para;<br>may assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation “to hear&para;<br>any and all claims against [it]” only when the corporation’s&para;<br>affiliations with the State in which suit is brought are&para;<br>so constant and pervasive “as to render [it] essentially at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>home in the forum State.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). Instructed by Goodyear, we conclude Daimler is not “at&para;<br>home” in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries&para;<br>plaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina’s conduct in Argentina.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Northern District of&para;<br>California, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with&para;<br>Argentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the&para;<br>military dictatorship in place there from 1976 through&para;<br>1983, a period known as Argentina’s “Dirty War.” Based&para;<br>on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the&para;<br>Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, and the Torture&para;<br>Victim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1350, as well as claims for wrongful death and&para;<br>intentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws&para;<br>of California and Argentina. The incidents recounted in&para;<br>the complaint center on MB Argentina’s plant in Gonzalez&para;<br>Catan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina’s alleged collaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in California or anywhere else in the United States.&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ operative complaint names only one corporate&para;<br>defendant: Daimler, the petitioner here. Plaintiffs seek to&para;<br>hold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina’s alleged&para;<br>malfeasance. Daimler is a German Aktiengesellschaft&para;<br>(public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz&para;<br>vehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in&para;<br>Stuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina&para;<br>was a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler’s predecessor&para;<br>in interest.&para;<br>Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal&para;<br>jurisdiction. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted&para;<br>declarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the&para;<br>presence of Daimler itself in California. Alternatively,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>plaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could&para;<br>be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a distinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should&para;<br>be treated as Daimler’s agent for jurisdictional purposes.&para;<br>MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Delaware limited liability corporation.3 MBUSA serves as&para;<br>Daimler’s exclusive importer and distributor in the United&para;<br>States, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from&para;<br>Daimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and&para;<br>ultimately distributing them to independent dealerships&para;<br>located throughout the Nation. Although MBUSA’s principal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has&para;<br>multiple California-based facilities, including a regional&para;<br>office in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in&para;<br>Carson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the&para;<br>record developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of&para;<br>luxury vehicles to the California market. In particular,&para;<br>over 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States&para;<br>take place in California, and MBUSA’s California sales&para;<br>account for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales.&para;<br>The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delineated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets&para;<br>forth requirements for MBUSA’s distribution of MercedesBenz vehicles in the United States. That agreement&para;<br>established MBUSA as an “independent contracto[r]”&para;<br>that “buy[s] and sell[s] [vehicles] . . . as an independent&para;<br>business for [its] own account.” App. 179a. The agreement “does not make [MBUSA] . . . a general or special&para;<br>agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of&para;<br>DAIMLERCHRYSLER or any DaimlerChrysler Group&para;<br>Company”; MBUSA “ha[s] no authority to make binding&para;<br>obligations for or act on behalf of DAIMLERCHRYSLER&para;<br>or any DaimlerChrysler Group Company.” Ibid.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 At times relevant to this suit, MBUSA was wholly owned by DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corporation, a Daimler subsidiary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>After allowing jurisdictional discovery on plaintiffs’&para;<br>agency allegations, the District Court granted Daimler’s&para;<br>motion to dismiss. Daimler’s own affiliations with California, the court first determined, were insufficient to&para;<br>support the exercise of all-purpose jurisdiction over the&para;<br>corporation. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler AG, No. C–04–&para;<br>00194 RMW (ND Cal., Nov. 22, 2005), App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 111a–112a, 2005 WL 3157472, *9–*10. Next, the&para;<br>court declined to attribute MBUSA’s California contacts to&para;<br>Daimler on an agency theory, concluding that plaintiffs&para;<br>failed to demonstrate that MBUSA acted as Daimler’s&para;<br>agent. Id., at 117a, 133a, 2005 WL 3157472, *12, *19;&para;<br>Bauman v.

Addressing solely the question of agency, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs had not shown the&para;<br>existence of an agency relationship of the kind that might&para;<br>warrant attribution of MBUSA’s contacts to Daimler.&para;<br>Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 579 F. 3d 1088, 1096–&para;<br>1097 (2009). Judge Reinhardt dissented. In his view, the&para;<br>agency test was satisfied and considerations of “reasonableness” did not bar the exercise of jurisdiction. Id., at&para;<br>1098–1106. Granting plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing, the&para;<br>panel withdrew its initial opinion and replaced it with one&para;<br>authored by Judge Reinhardt, which elaborated on reasoning he initially expressed in dissent. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909 (CA9 2011).&para;<br>Daimler petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc,&para;<br>urging that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over&para;<br>Daimler could not be reconciled with this Court’s decision&para;<br>in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2011). Over the dissent of eight judges, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit denied Daimler’s petition. See Bauman v.&para;<br>DaimlerChrysler Corp., 676 F. 3d 774 (2011) (O’Scannlain,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with&para;<br>the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,&para;<br>Daimler is amenable to suit in California courts for claims&para;<br>involving only foreign plaintiffs and conduct occurring&para;<br>entirely abroad. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons. See Fed.&para;<br>Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A) (service of process is effective to&para;<br>establish personal jurisdiction over a defendant “who is&para;<br>subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction&para;<br>in the state where the district court is located”). Under&para;<br>California’s long-arm statute, California state courts may&para;<br>exercise personal jurisdiction “on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United&para;<br>States.” Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §410.10 (West 2004).&para;<br>California’s long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the&para;<br>U. S. Constitution. We therefore inquire whether the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit’s holding comports with the limits imposed&para;<br>by federal due process. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v.&para;<br>Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 464 (1985).&para;<br>III&para;<br>In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 (1878), decided shortly&para;<br>after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the&para;<br>Court held that a tribunal’s jurisdiction over persons&para;<br>reaches no farther than the geographic bounds of the&para;<br>forum. See id., at 720 (“The authority of every tribunal is&para;<br>necessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State&para;<br>in which it is established.”). See also Shaffer v. Heitner,&para;<br>433 U. S. 186, 197 (1977) (Under Pennoyer, “any attempt&para;<br>‘directly’ to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons&para;<br>or property would offend sister States and exceed the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>inherent limits of the State’s power.”). In time, however,&para;<br>that strict territorial approach yielded to a less rigid understanding, spurred by “changes in the technology of&para;<br>transportation and communication, and the tremendous&para;<br>growth of interstate business activity.” Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 617&para;<br>(1990) (opinion of SCALIA, J.).&para;<br>“The canonical opinion in this area remains International Shoe [Co. v. Washington], 326 U. S. 310 [(1945)], in&para;<br>which we held that a State may authorize its courts to&para;<br>exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant if the defendant has ‘certain minimum contacts with&para;<br>[the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not&para;<br>offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial&para;<br>justice.” ’ ” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316).

The first category is represented by International Shoe itself, a case in which the instate activities of the corporate defendant “ha[d] not only&para;<br>been continuous and systematic, but also g[a]ve rise to the&para;<br>liabilities sued on.” 326 U.

In the proceedings&para;<br>below, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain&para;<br>points we now take as given. Plaintiffs have never attempted to fit this case into the specific jurisdiction category. Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District&para;<br>Court’s holding that Daimler’s own contacts with California were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction. While plaintiffs ultimately&para;<br>persuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA’s California contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point&para;<br>have they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of&para;<br>Daimler.&para;<br>Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to&para;<br>plaintiffs’ assertion that the California courts could exercise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.12 But see Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 23, n. 4 (suggestion that in light of Goodyear, MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction&para;<br>in California); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>16, n. 5 (hereinafter U.

We will assume&para;<br>then, for purposes of this decision only, that MBUSA&para;<br>qualifies as at home in California.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In sustaining the exercise of general jurisdiction over&para;<br>Daimler, the Ninth Circuit relied on an agency theory,&para;<br>determining that MBUSA acted as Daimler’s agent for&para;<br>jurisdictional purposes and then attributing MBUSA’s&para;<br>California contacts to Daimler. The Ninth Circuit’s agency&para;<br>analysis derived from Circuit precedent considering&para;<br>principally whether the subsidiary “performs services that&para;<br>are sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if&para;<br>it did not have a representative to perform them, the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 MBUSA&para;<br>&para;<br>is not a defendant in this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v.

Unocal Corp., 248 F. 3d 915, 928 (CA9 2001); emphasis deleted).&para;<br>This Court has not yet addressed whether a foreign&para;<br>corporation may be subjected to a court’s general jurisdiction based on the contacts of its in-state subsidiary. Daimler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a&para;<br>subsidiary’s jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its&para;<br>parent only when the former is so dominated by the latter&para;<br>as to be its alter ego. The Ninth Circuit adopted a less&para;<br>rigorous test based on what it described as an “agency”&para;<br>relationship. Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and&para;<br>shapes: “One may be an agent for some business purposes&para;<br>and not others so that the fact that one may be an agent&para;<br>for one purpose does not make him or her an agent for&para;<br>every purpose.” 2A C.

Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), observed, “is a&para;<br>fiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a&para;<br>fact.” Id., at 316. See generally 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of&para;<br>Corporations §30, p. 30 (Supp. 2012–2013) (“A corporation is a distinct&para;<br>legal entity that can act only through its agents.”). As such, a corporation can purposefully avail itself of a forum by directing its agents or&para;<br>distributors to take action there. See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U. S., at 112&para;<br>(opinion of O’Connor, J.) (defendant’s act of “marketing [a] product&para;<br>through a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in the&para;<br>forum State” may amount to purposeful availment); International Shoe,&para;<br>326 U. S., at 318 (“the commission of some single or occasional acts of&para;<br>the corporate agent in a state” may sometimes “be deemed sufficient to&para;<br>render the corporation liable to suit” on related claims). See also Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 24 (acknowledging that “an agency relationship may be&para;<br>sufficient in some circumstances to give rise to specific jurisdiction”). It&para;<br>does not inevitably follow, however, that similar reasoning applies to&para;<br>general jurisdiction. Cf. Goodyear, 564 U.

The Court of Appeals did not advert to&para;<br>that prospect. But we need not pass judgment on invocation of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdiction, for in no event can the appeals court’s analysis be&para;<br>sustained.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit’s agency finding rested primarily on&para;<br>its observation that MBUSA’s services were “important” to&para;<br>Daimler, as gauged by Daimler’s hypothetical readiness to&para;<br>perform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.&para;<br>Formulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks&para;<br>the deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer:&para;<br>“Anything a corporation does through an independent&para;<br>contractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably something that the corporation would do ‘by other means’ if the&para;<br>independent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not&para;<br>exist.” 676 F. 3d, at 777 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from&para;<br>denial of rehearing en banc).14 The Ninth Circuit’s agency&para;<br>theory thus appears to subject foreign corporations to&para;<br>general jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond&para;<br>even the “sprawling view of general jurisdiction” we rejected in Goodyear. 564 U.

See Brief for Respondents 39, n. 18 (“We do not believe that&para;<br>this gloss is particularly helpful.”).&para;<br>15 The Ninth Circuit’s agency analysis also looked to whether the&para;<br>parent enjoys “the right to substantially control” the subsidiary’s&para;<br>activities. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909, 924&para;<br>(2011). The Court of Appeals found the requisite “control” demonstrated by the General Distributor Agreement between Daimler and&para;<br>MBUSA, which gives Daimler the right to oversee certain of MBUSA’s&para;<br>operations, even though that agreement expressly disavowed the&para;<br>creation of any agency relationship. Thus grounded, the separate&para;<br>inquiry into control hardly curtails the overbreadth of the Ninth Circuit’s agency holding.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v.

See also International Shoe,&para;<br>326 U. S., at 318 (citing Tauza). Barrow and Tauza indeed upheld the&para;<br>exercise of general jurisdiction based on the presence of a local office,&para;<br>which signaled that the corporation was “doing business” in the forum.&para;<br>Perkins’ unadorned citations to these cases, both decided in the era&para;<br>dominated by Pennoyer’s territorial thinking, see supra, at 6–7, should&para;<br>not attract heavy reliance today.

But this case presents no&para;<br>occasion to explore that question, because Daimler’s activities in&para;<br>California plainly do not approach that level. It is one thing to hold a&para;<br>corporation answerable for operations in the forum State, see infra, at&para;<br>23, quite another to expose it to suit on claims having no connection&para;<br>whatever to the forum State.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdiction would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants “to&para;<br>structure their primary conduct with some minimum&para;<br>assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.” Burger King Corp., 471 U.

General&para;<br>jurisdiction instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation’s activities in&para;<br>their entirety, nationwide and worldwide. A corporation that operates&para;<br>in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them. Otherwise, “at home” would be synonymous with “doing business” tests&para;<br>framed before specific jurisdiction evolved in the United States. See&para;<br>von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1142–1144. Nothing in International Shoe&para;<br>and its progeny suggests that “a particular quantum of local activity”&para;<br>should give a State authority over a “far larger quantum of . . . activity”&para;<br>having no connection to any in-state activity. Feder, supra, at 694.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reach the same result, but for a different&para;<br>reason. Rather than concluding that Daimler is not at home in California, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would hold that the exercise of general&para;<br>jurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable “in the unique circumstances of this case.” Post, at 1. In other words, she favors a resolution&para;<br>fit for this day and case only. True, a multipronged reasonableness&para;<br>check was articulated in Asahi, 480 U.

The reasonableness factors&para;<br>identified in Asahi include “the burden on the defendant,” “the interests&para;<br>of the forum State,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining relief,” “the&para;<br>interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient&para;<br>resolution of controversies,” “the shared interest of the several States in&para;<br>furthering fundamental substantive social policies,” and, in the international context, “the procedural and substantive policies of other&para;<br>nations whose interests are affected by the assertion of jurisdiction.”&para;<br>480 U.

In the European Union, for example,&para;<br>a corporation may generally be sued in the nation in which&para;<br>it is “domiciled,” a term defined to refer only to the location of the corporation’s “statutory seat,” “central administration,” or “principal place of business.” European&para;<br>Parliament and Council Reg. 1215/2012, Arts. 4(1), and&para;<br>63(1), 2012 O.

It has multiple facilities&para;<br>in the State, including a regional headquarters. Each&para;<br>year, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars,&para;<br>the sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year&para;<br>this suit was brought. And it provides service and sales&para;<br>support to customers throughout the State. Daimler has&para;<br>conceded that California courts may exercise general&para;<br>jurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts,&para;<br>and the Court assumes that MBUSA’s contacts may be&para;<br>attributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether&para;<br>Daimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.&para;<br>Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of&para;<br>general jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that&para;<br>they are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process&para;<br>jurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that&para;<br>Daimler’s contacts with California are too few, but that its&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v.

Daimler is just not one of those busi­&para;<br>nesses, the Court concludes, because its California con­&para;<br>tacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive “na­&para;<br>tionwide and worldwide” operations. Ante, at 21, n. 20. In&para;<br>recent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the&para;<br>concept of multinational corporations that are supposedly&para;<br>“too big to fail”; today the Court deems Daimler “too big for&para;<br>general jurisdiction.”&para;<br>The Court’s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both&para;<br>process and substance. As to process, the Court decides&para;<br>this case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed&para;<br>on below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a&para;<br>footnote to its brief.

As&para;<br>to substance, the Court’s focus on Daimler’s operations out­&para;<br>side of California ignores the lodestar of our personal&para;<br>jurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defend­&para;<br>ant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently&para;<br>taken advantage of the State’s laws and protections&para;<br>through its contacts in the State; whether the defendant&para;<br>has contacts elsewhere is immaterial.&para;<br>Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can&para;<br>and should decide this case on the far simpler ground that,&para;<br>no matter how extensive Daimler’s contacts with Califor­&para;<br>nia, that State’s exercise of jurisdiction would be unrea­&para;<br>sonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs&para;<br>suing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and&para;<br>given that a more appropriate forum is available.

Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475–478 (1985). As the majority&para;<br>points out, all of the cases in which we have applied the&para;<br>reasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to&para;<br>general jurisdiction.

See ante, at 20–21 (noting that it would be “exor­&para;<br>bitant” for California courts to exercise general jurisdiction&para;<br>over Daimler, a German defendant, in this “Argentina­&para;<br>rooted case” brought by “foreign plaintiffs”). But instead&para;<br>of resolving the case on this uncontroversial basis, the&para;<br>majority reaches out to decide it on a ground neither argued&para;<br>nor decided below.3&para;<br>We generally do not pass on arguments that lower&para;<br>courts have not addressed. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson,&para;<br>544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). After all, “we are a court of&para;<br>review, not of first view.” Ibid. This principle carries even&para;<br>greater force where the argument at issue was never&para;<br>pressed below. See Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198,&para;<br>205 (2001). Yet the majority disregards this principle,&para;<br>basing its decision on an argument raised for the first time&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The majority appears to suggest that Daimler may have presented&para;<br>the argument in its petition for rehearing en banc before the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit. See ante, at 5 (stating that Daimler “urg[ed] that the exercise&para;<br>of personal jurisdiction . . . could not be reconciled with this Court’s&para;<br>decision in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2011)”). But Daimler’s petition for rehearing did not argue&para;<br>what the Court holds today. The Court holds that Daimler’s California contacts would be insufficient for general jurisdiction even assum­&para;<br>ing that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to Daimler. Daimler’s&para;<br>rehearing petition made a distinct argument—that attribution of&para;<br>MBUSA’s contacts should not be permitted under an “ ‘agency’ theory”&para;<br>because doing so would “rais[e] significant constitutional concerns”&para;<br>under Goodyear.

MBUSA’s California&para;<br>sales account for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales, which&para;<br>were $192 billion in 2004.4 And 2.4% of $192 billion is&para;<br>$4.6 billion, a considerable sum by any measure. MBUSA&para;<br>also has multiple offices and facilities in California, in­&para;<br>cluding a regional headquarters.&para;<br>But the record does not answer a number of other&para;<br>important questions. Are any of Daimler’s key files main­&para;<br>tained in MBUSA’s California offices? How many employ­&para;<br>ees work in those offices? Do those employees make&para;<br>important strategic decisions or oversee in any manner&para;<br>Daimler’s activities? These questions could well affect&para;<br>whether Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction. After&para;<br>all, this Court upheld the exercise of general jurisdiction&para;<br>in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437,&para;<br>447–448 (1952)—which the majority refers to as a “text­&para;<br>book case” of general jurisdiction, ante, at 10—on the basis&para;<br>that the foreign defendant maintained an office in Ohio,&para;<br>kept corporate files there, and oversaw the company’s&para;<br>activities from the State.

But the majority recognizes that International Shoe&para;<br>separately described the type of contacts needed for general jurisdiction&para;<br>as “continuous corporate operations” that are “so substantial” as to&para;<br>justify suit on unrelated causes of action. Id., at 318. It is unclear why&para;<br>our precedents departed from International Shoe’s “continuous and&para;<br>substantial” formulation in favor of the “continuous and systematic”&para;<br>formulation, but the majority does not contend—nor do I perceive—that&para;<br>there is a material difference between the two.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Just as in Perkins and Helicopteros, our&para;<br>opinion in Goodyear did not identify the defendants’ con­&para;<br>tacts outside of the forum State, but focused instead on the&para;<br>defendants’ lack of offices, employees, direct sales, and&para;<br>business operations within the State.&para;<br>This approach follows from the touchstone principle of&para;<br>due process in this field, the concept of reciprocal fairness.&para;<br>When a corporation chooses to invoke the benefits and&para;<br>protections of a State in which it operates, the State ac­&para;<br>quires the authority to subject the company to suit in its&para;<br>courts.

We used the phrase “at home” to signify that in&para;<br>order for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general&para;<br>jurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a&para;<br>forum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise&para;<br>that actually is “at home” in the State. See Brilmayer,&para;<br>supra, at 742.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The majority views the phrase “at home” as serving a different&para;<br>purpose—that of requiring a comparison between a defendant’s in-state&para;<br>and out-of-state contacts.

By the time the suit was commenced, the company had&para;<br>resumed its considerable mining operations in the Philippines, “ ‘re­&para;<br>building its properties’ ” there and purchasing “ ‘machinery, supplies&para;<br>and equipment.’ ” 88 Ohio App., at 123–124, 95 N.

But there&para;<br>is nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multi­&para;<br>national corporations that if they engage in continuous&para;<br>and substantial contacts with more than one State, they&para;<br>will be subject to general jurisdiction in each one.

BAUMAN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>test unpredictable.&para;<br>Nor is the majority’s proportionality inquiry any more&para;<br>predictable than the approach it rejects. If anything, the&para;<br>majority’s approach injects an additional layer of uncer­&para;<br>tainty because a corporate defendant must now try to&para;<br>foretell a court’s analysis as to both the sufficiency of its&para;<br>contacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative&para;<br>sufficiency of those contacts in light of the company’s&para;<br>operations elsewhere. Moreover, the majority does not&para;<br>even try to explain just how extensive the company’s&para;<br>in-state contacts must be in the context of its global operations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.&para;<br>The majority’s approach will also lead to greater unpre­&para;<br>dictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdic­&para;<br>tional discovery. Rather than ascertaining the extent of a&para;<br>corporate defendant’s forum-state contacts alone, courts&para;<br>will now have to identify the extent of a company’s con­&para;<br>tacts in every other forum where it does business in order&para;<br>to compare them against the company’s in-state contacts.&para;<br>That considerable burden runs headlong into the majority’s recitation of the familiar principle that “ ‘[s]imple&para;<br>jurisdictional rules . . . promote greater predictability.’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 18–19 (quoting Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S.&para;<br>77, 94 (2010)).&para;<br>Absent the predictability rationale, the majority’s sole&para;<br>remaining justification for its proportionality approach is&para;<br>its unadorned concern for the consequences. “If Daimler’s&para;<br>California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this&para;<br>Argentina-rooted case in California,” the majority la­&para;<br>ments, “the same global reach would presumably be avail­&para;<br>able in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are&para;<br>sizable.” Ante, at 20.&para;<br>The majority characterizes this result as “exorbitant,”&para;<br>ibid., but in reality it is an inevitable consequence of the&para;<br>rule of due process we set forth nearly 70 years ago, that&para;<br>there are “instances in which [a company’s] continuous&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

In the&para;<br>era of International Shoe, it was rare for a corporation to&para;<br>have such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be&para;<br>subject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.&para;<br>Today, that circumstance is less rare. But that is as it&para;<br>should be. What has changed since International Shoe is&para;<br>not the due process principle of fundamental fairness but&para;<br>rather the nature of the global economy. Just as it was&para;<br>fair to say in the 1940’s that an out-of-state company could&para;<br>enjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it&para;<br>“essentially at home” in the State, it is fair to say today that&para;<br>a multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive&para;<br>benefits in multiple forum States that it is “essentially&para;<br>at home” in each one.&para;<br>In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned&para;<br>with the modern-day consequences of International Shoe’s&para;<br>conception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other&para;<br>judicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting un­&para;<br>fairness to large corporate defendants. Here, for instance,&para;<br>the reasonableness prong may afford petitioner relief. See&para;<br>supra, at 3–4. In other cases, a defendant can assert the&para;<br>doctrine of forum non conveniens if a given State is a&para;<br>highly inconvenient place to litigate a dispute. See Gulf&para;<br>Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 508–509 (1947). In still&para;<br>other cases, the federal change of venue statute can pro­&para;<br>vide protection. See 28 U. S. C. §1404(a) (permitting&para;<br>transfers to other districts “[f]or the convenience of parties&para;<br>and witnesses” and “in the interests of justice”). And to&para;<br>the degree that the majority worries these doctrines are&para;<br>not enough to protect the economic interests of multina­&para;<br>tional businesses (or that our longstanding approach to&para;<br>general jurisdiction poses “risks to international comity,”&para;<br>ante, at 22), the task of weighing those policy concerns&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>belongs ultimately to legislators, who may amend state&para;<br>and federal long-arm statutes in accordance with the&para;<br>democratic process. Unfortunately, the majority short&para;<br>circuits that process by enshrining today’s narrow rule of&para;<br>general jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority’s concern for the consequences of its deci­&para;<br>sion should have led it the other way, because the rule&para;<br>that it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four&para;<br>respects.&para;<br>First, the majority’s approach unduly curtails the&para;<br>States’ sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against&para;<br>corporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and&para;<br>substantial business operations within their boundaries.10&para;<br>The majority does not dispute that a State can exercise&para;<br>general jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its&para;<br>corporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of&para;<br>business within the State. Cf. Hertz Corp., 559 U. S., at&para;<br>93. Yet it never explains why the State should lose that&para;<br>power when, as is increasingly common, a corporation&para;<br>“divide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among&para;<br>officers who work at several different locations.” Id., at&para;<br>95–96. Suppose a company divides its management func­&para;<br>tions equally among three offices in different States, with&para;<br>one office nominally deemed the company’s corporate&para;<br>headquarters. If the State where the headquarters is&para;<br>located can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 States&para;<br>&para;<br>will of course continue to exercise specific jurisdiction in&para;<br>many cases, but we have never held that to be the outer limit of the&para;<br>States’ authority under the Due Process Clause. That is because the&para;<br>two forms of jurisdiction address different concerns. Whereas specific&para;<br>jurisdiction focuses on the relationship between a defendant’s chal­&para;<br>lenged conduct and the forum State, general jurisdiction focuses on the&para;<br>defendant’s substantial presence in the State irrespective of the loca­&para;<br>tion of the challenged conduct.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Indeed, under the majority’s approach, the result&para;<br>would be unchanged even if the company has substantial&para;<br>operations within the latter two States (and even if the&para;<br>company has no sales or other business operations in the&para;<br>first State). Put simply, the majority’s rule defines the&para;<br>Due Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to&para;<br>contravene the States’ sovereign prerogative to subject to&para;<br>judgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified&para;<br>“intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit&para;<br>to the[ir] laws,” J. McIntyre, 564 U. S., at ___ (plurality&para;<br>opinion) (slip op., at 5).&para;<br>Second, the proportionality approach will treat small&para;<br>businesses unfairly in comparison to national and multi­&para;<br>national conglomerates. Whereas a larger company will&para;<br>often be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on&para;<br>account of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small&para;<br>business will not be. For instance, the majority holds&para;<br>today that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in&para;<br>California despite its multiple offices, continuous opera­&para;<br>tions, and billions of dollars’ worth of sales there. But&para;<br>imagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehi­&para;<br>cles principally targeting the California market and that&para;<br>has substantially all of its sales and operations in the&para;<br>State—even though those sales and operations may&para;<br>amount to one-thousandth of Daimler’s. Under the major­&para;<br>ity’s rule, that small business will be subject to suit in&para;<br>California on any cause of action involving any of its activ­&para;<br>ities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive&para;<br>competitor, Daimler, will not be. That will be so even if&para;<br>the small business incorporates and sets up its headquar­&para;<br>ters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business’&para;<br>California sales and operations would still predominate&para;<br>when “apprais[ed]” in proportion to its minimal “nation­&para;<br>wide and worldwide” operations, ante, at 21, n. 20.&para;<br>Third, the majority’s approach creates the incongruous&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>DAIMLER AG v.

S. 604 (1990), but a large corporation that owns&para;<br>property, employs workers, and does billions of dollars’&para;<br>worth of business in the State will not be, simply because&para;<br>the corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the&para;<br>visiting individual surely does as well).&para;<br>Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of&para;<br>the majority’s approach will be to shift the risk of loss&para;<br>from multinational corporations to the individuals harmed&para;<br>by their actions. Under the majority’s rule, for example, a&para;<br>parent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a&para;<br>foreign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will&para;<br>be unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U. S.&para;<br>court, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in&para;<br>multiple States. See, e.g., Meier v. Sun Int’l Hotels, Ltd.,&para;<br>288 F. 3d 1264 (CA11 2002).11 Similarly, a U. S. business&para;<br>that enters into a contract in a foreign country to sell its&para;<br>products to a multinational company there may be unable&para;<br>to seek relief in any U. S. court if the multinational com­&para;<br>pany breaches the contract, even if that company has&para;<br>considerable operations in numerous U. S. forums. See,&para;<br>e.g., Walpex Trading Co. v. Yacimientos Petroliferos&para;<br>Fiscales Bolivianos, 712 F. Supp. 383 (SDNY 1989).12&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 See&para;<br>&para;<br>also, e.g., Woods v. Nova Companies Belize Ltd., 739 So. 2d&para;<br>617, 620–621 (Fla. App. 1999) (estate of decedent killed in an overseas&para;<br>plane crash permitted to sue responsible Belizean corporate defendant&para;<br>in Florida courts, rather than Belizean courts, based on defendant’s&para;<br>continuous and systematic business contacts in Florida).&para;<br>12 The present case and the examples posited involve foreign corpo­&para;<br>rate defendants, but the principle announced by the majority would&para;<br>apply equally to preclude general jurisdiction over a U. S. company that&para;<br>is incorporated and has its principal place of business in another U. S.&para;<br>State. Under the majority’s rule, for example, a General Motors auto­&para;<br>worker who retires to Florida would be unable to sue GM in that State&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

I cannot agree with the majority’s conclusion that the Due Process Clause requires these&para;<br>results.&para;<br>* * *&para;<br>The Court rules against respondents today on a ground&para;<br>that no court has considered in the history of this case,&para;<br>that this Court did not grant certiorari to decide, and that&para;<br>Daimler raised only in a footnote of its brief.

Because I would&para;<br>reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision on the narrower&para;<br>ground that the exercise of jurisdiction over Daimler&para;<br>would be unreasonable in any event, I respectfully concur&para;<br>in the judgment only.&para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>for disabilities that develop from the retiree’s labor at a Michigan parts &para;<br>&para;<br>plant, even though GM undertakes considerable business operations in&para;<br>&para;<br>Florida.
