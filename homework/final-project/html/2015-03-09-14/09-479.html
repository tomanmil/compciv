Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–479.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 4, 2010—Decided November 15, 2010*&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,&para;<br>were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a&para;<br>deadly weapon in connection with “any crime of violence or drug traf&para;<br>ficking crime,” §924(c)(1). The minimum prison term for a §924(c) of&para;<br>fense is five years, §924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to “any other term of&para;<br>imprisonment imposed on the [offender],” §924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Abbott&para;<br>was convicted on the §924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking&para;<br>counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received a&para;<br>15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession con&para;<br>viction and an additional five years for his §924(c) violation. Gould’s&para;<br>predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory mini&para;<br>mum sentence; he received an additional five years for his §924(c)&para;<br>violation. On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their §924(c) sen&para;<br>tences, resting their objections on the “except” clause prefacing&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A). That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five&para;<br>year term as a consecutive sentence “[e]xcept to the extent that a&para;<br>greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [§924(c) itself] or&para;<br>by any other provision of law.” Abbott urged that the “except” clause&para;<br>was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said&para;<br>the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking&para;<br>crime. The Third Circuit affirmed Abbott’s sentence, concluding that&para;<br>the “except” clause “refers only to other minimum sentences that may&para;<br>be imposed” for §924(c) violations. Gould fared no better before the&para;<br>Fifth Circuit.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 09–7073, Gould v. United States, on certiorari to&para;<br>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum speci&para;<br>fied for his conduct in §924(c), unless another provision of law di&para;<br>rected to conduct proscribed by §924(c) imposes an even greater&para;<br>mandatory minimum. Pp. 5–18.&para;<br>(a) Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of&para;<br>1968, but the “except” clause was not added until 1998. Under the&para;<br>pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not&para;<br>preempt §924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been&para;<br>correctly sentenced under §924(c). The question here is whether&para;<br>Congress’ 1998 reformulation of §924(c) rendered their sentences ex&para;<br>cessive. The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United&para;<br>States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that §924(c)(1)’s ban on “use” of a&para;<br>firearm did not reach “mere possession” of a weapon, id., at 144. In&para;<br>addition to bringing possession within the statute’s compass, Con&para;<br>gress increased the severity of §924(c) sentences by changing “once&para;<br>mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,” United&para;<br>States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences&para;<br>for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.&para;<br>Congress also restructured the provision, “divid[ing] what was once a&para;<br>lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,” id., at ___,&para;<br>and it added the “except” clause at issue. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) The leading portion of the “except” clause now prefacing&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A) refers to a “greater minimum sentence . . . otherwise&para;<br>provided by [§924(c) itself]”; the second segment of the clause refers&para;<br>to a greater minimum provided outside §924(c) “by any other provi&para;<br>sion of law.” To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is&para;<br>“otherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law,” the key ques&para;<br>tion is: otherwise provided for what? Most courts have answered: for&para;<br>the conduct §924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection&para;<br>with a predicate crime.&para;<br>Abbott and Gould disagree. Gould would apply the “except” clause&para;<br>whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater&para;<br>minimum sentence. Abbott argues that the minimum sentence “oth&para;<br>erwise provided” must be one imposed for the criminal transaction&para;<br>that triggered §924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense in&para;<br>volving the same firearm that triggered §924(c). These three inter&para;<br>pretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress&para;<br>in 1998 adopted a less aggressive mode of applying §924(c), one that&para;<br>significantly reduced the severity of the provision’s impact on defen&para;<br>dants. The pre-1998 version of §924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence&para;<br>to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime&para;<br>or any separate firearm conviction. It is unlikely that Congress&para;<br>meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed “An Act [t]o throttle&para;<br>criminal use of guns,” to effect a departure so great from §924(c)’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>original insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punish&para;<br>ment for §924(c) violations. Abbott’s and Gould’s readings would un&para;<br>dercut that same bill’s primary objective: to expand §924(c)’s coverage&para;<br>to reach firearm possession. Their readings would also result in sen&para;<br>tencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend. Section 924(c), as&para;<br>they construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct&para;<br>that provision makes independently criminal. Stranger still, the&para;<br>worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave&para;<br>offenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction&para;<br>would be most likely to preempt §924(c) sentences. Abbott and Gould&para;<br>respond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies&para;<br>and order appropriate adjustments. While a judge exercising discre&para;<br>tion under 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) would not be required to sentence a&para;<br>more culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Con&para;<br>gress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before United&para;<br>States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discre&para;<br>tion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on §3553(a).&para;<br>Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have an&para;<br>ticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve dispari&para;<br>ties by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.&para;<br>But Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when&para;<br>it amended §924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate&para;<br>crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement. Between 1984 and&para;<br>1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of&para;<br>§924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm en&para;<br>hancement might suffice to accomplish §924(c)’s objective. Nor is&para;<br>there any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guide&para;<br>lines’ relationship to §924(c) when it added the “except” clause.&para;<br>Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(c) The Government’s reading—that the “except” clause is triggered&para;<br>only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct vio&para;<br>lating §924(c)—makes far more sense. It gives effect to statutory&para;<br>language commanding that all §924(c) offenders shall receive addi&para;<br>tional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command re&para;<br>iterated three times: First, the statute states that the §924(c)(1) pun&para;<br>ishment “shall” be imposed “in addition to” the penalty for the&para;<br>predicate offense, §924(c)(1)(A); second, §924(c) demands a discrete&para;<br>punishment even if the predicate crime itself “provides for an en&para;<br>hanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous&para;<br>weapon or device,” ibid.; third, §924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibil&para;<br>ity that a §924(c) sentence might “run concurrently with any other&para;<br>term of imprisonment.” Interpreting the “except” clause to train on&para;<br>conduct offending §924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.&para;<br>The clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§924(c) proscribes. See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–&para;<br>535. There is strong contextual support for the view that the “except”&para;<br>clause was intended simply to clarify §924(c). At the same time Con&para;<br>gress added the clause, it made the rest of §924(c) more complex, di&para;<br>viding its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and&para;<br>adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.&para;<br>Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges:&para;<br>It added the “except” clause’s initial part, which covers greater mini&para;<br>mums provided “by this subsection,” to instruct judges not to stack&para;<br>ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the&para;<br>same weapon. In referencing greater minimums provided by “any&para;<br>other provision of law,” the second portion of the clause simply fur&para;<br>nishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which §924(c)&para;<br>and a different statute both punish conduct offending §924(c). Con&para;<br>gress likely anticipated such cases when framing the “except” clause,&para;<br>for the bill that reformulated §924(c)’s text also amended 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons con&para;<br>victed of “firearms possession (as described in §924(c)).” This inter&para;<br>pretation does not render the “except” clause’s second part effectively&para;<br>meaningless. Though §3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of&para;<br>§924(c) itself, that the Government places within the “except” clause,&para;<br>the “any other provision of law” portion installs a safety valve for ad&para;<br>ditional sentences that Congress may codify outside §924(c) in the fu&para;<br>ture. Neither United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, nor Republic of&para;<br>Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, warrants a different conclusion.

S. C. §924(c)(1). The minimum prison term&para;<br>for the offense described in §924(c) is five years,&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to “any other term of impris&para;<br>onment imposed on the [offender],” §924(c)(1)(D)(ii). The&para;<br>two consolidated cases before us call for interpretation of&para;<br>§924(c) as that provision was reformulated in 1998.&para;<br>Kevin Abbott and Carlos Rashad Gould, petitioners&para;<br>here, defendants below, were charged with multiple drug&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and firearm offenses; charges on which they were con&para;<br>victed included violation of §924(c). Each objected to the&para;<br>imposition of any additional prison time for his §924(c)&para;<br>conviction. Their objections rested on the “except” clause&para;<br>now prefacing §924(c)(1)(A). Under that clause, a mini&para;<br>mum term of five years shall be imposed as a consecutive&para;<br>sentence “[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum&para;<br>sentence is otherwise provided by [§924(c) itself] or by any&para;<br>other provision of law.”&para;<br>Abbott and Gould read §924(c)’s “except” clause to se&para;<br>cure them against prison time for their §924(c) convic&para;<br>tions. They claim exemption from punishment under&para;<br>§924(c) because they were sentenced to greater mandatory&para;<br>minimum prison terms for convictions on other counts&para;<br>charging different offenses. The “except” clause, they&para;<br>urge, ensures that §924(c) offenders will serve at least five&para;<br>years in prison. If conviction on a different count yields a&para;<br>mandatory sentence exceeding five years, they maintain,&para;<br>the statutory requirement is satisfied and the penalty&para;<br>specified for the §924(c) violation becomes inoperative.&para;<br>The courts below, agreeing with the Government’s&para;<br>construction of the statute, read §924(c)(1) as independ&para;<br>ently requiring a sentence of at least five years, tacked&para;<br>onto any other sentence the defendant receives. The&para;<br>“except” clause refers to “a greater minimum sentence . . .&para;<br>otherwise provided.” “[O]therwise provided” for what, the&para;<br>courts below asked; their answer, for conduct offending&para;<br>§924(c), i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a&para;<br>crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.&para;<br>A defendant is not spared from a separate, consecutive&para;<br>sentence for a §924(c) conviction, the lower courts deter&para;<br>mined, whenever he faces a higher mandatory minimum&para;<br>for a different count of conviction. Instead, according to&para;<br>the courts below and the Government here, the “except”&para;<br>clause applies only when another provision—whether&para;<br>contained within or placed outside §924(c)—commands a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>longer term for conduct violating §924(c). For example,&para;<br>the mandatory minimum sentence for a §924(c) offense is&para;<br>five years, but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum&para;<br>rises to seven years, and if the firearm is discharged, to&para;<br>ten years. §924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii). A defendant who&para;<br>possessed, brandished, and discharged a firearm in viola&para;<br>tion of §924(c) would thus face a mandatory minimum&para;<br>term of ten years.&para;<br>We hold, in accord with the courts below, and in line&para;<br>with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, that a defen&para;<br>dant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a&para;<br>§924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by&para;<br>virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a&para;<br>different count of conviction. Under the “except” clause as&para;<br>we comprehend it, a §924(c) offender is not subject to&para;<br>stacked sentences for violating §924(c). If he possessed,&para;<br>brandished, and discharged a gun, the mandatory penalty&para;<br>would be 10 years, not 22. He is, however, subject to the&para;<br>highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in&para;<br>§924(c), unless another provision of law directed to con&para;<br>duct proscribed by §924(c) imposes an even greater man&para;<br>datory minimum.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,&para;<br>were each charged with violating §924(c)(1)(A)(i) by pos&para;<br>sessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking&para;<br>crime. Abbott’s case was tried to a jury in the Eastern&para;<br>District of Pennsylvania, which convicted him on the&para;<br>§924(c) count and three others: two predicate trafficking&para;<br>counts, 21 U. S. C. §§841, 846, and being a felon in posses&para;<br>sion of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g). Given Abbott’s&para;<br>extensive criminal history, his felon-in-possession convic&para;<br>tion triggered a 15-year mandatory minimum under the&para;<br>Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e).&para;<br>The District Court sentenced Abbott to the 15 years man&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dated by ACCA, and to an additional five years for the&para;<br>§924(c) violation, yielding a total prison term of 20 years.1&para;<br>Gould’s indictment listed seven separate drug and fire&para;<br>arm charges. In return for Gould’s agreement to plead&para;<br>guilty, the Government dropped all but two: one §924(c)&para;<br>offense and one predicate drug-trafficking crime. The&para;<br>latter, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute&para;<br>cocaine base, carried a ten-year mandatory minimum&para;<br>under §841(b)(1)(A). Firearm involvement was not an&para;<br>element of that offense. The United States District Court&para;<br>for the Northern District of Texas imposed a sentence of&para;<br>11 years and 5 months for the trafficking offense and an&para;<br>additional five years for the §924(c) violation, for a total of&para;<br>16 years and 5 months.&para;<br>On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged the five-year&para;<br>consecutive sentence each received under §924(c). Abbott&para;<br>urged that ACCA’s 15-year mandatory minimum triggered&para;<br>§924(c)’s “except” clause, because ACCA qualified as&para;<br>“[an]other provision of law” that “provided” a “greater&para;<br>minimum sentence.” Gould said the same of the ten years&para;<br>commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Cir&para;<br>cuit affirmed Abbott’s sentence, concluding that the “ex&para;<br>cept” clause “refers only to other minimum sentences that&para;<br>may be imposed for violations of §924(c).” United States v.&para;<br>Abbott, 574 F. 3d 203, 208 (2009). Gould fared no better&para;<br>before the Fifth Circuit. United States v. Gould, 329 Fed.&para;<br>Appx. 569, 570 (2009) (per curiam).

And it added the prefatory “except”&para;<br>clause at issue in the cases now before us. As amended,&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A) prescribes:&para;<br>“Except to the extent that a greater minimum sen&para;<br>tence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by&para;<br>any other provision of law, any person who, during&para;<br>and in relation to any crime of violence or drug traf&para;<br>ficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug&para;<br>trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced pun&para;<br>ishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dan&para;<br>gerous weapon or device) for which the person may be&para;<br>prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or&para;<br>carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such&para;<br>crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the&para;<br>punishment provided for such crime of violence or&para;<br>drug trafficking crime—&para;<br>“(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not&para;<br>less than 5 years;&para;<br>“(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a&para;<br>term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and&para;<br>“(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to&para;<br>a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”&para;<br>The 1998 reformulation, furthermore, removed to sepa&para;<br>rate paragraphs the provisions commanding higher penal&para;<br>ties for especially destructive weapons and “second or&para;<br>subsequent” offenses.

In adding the “except” clause in 1998, all&para;<br>three posit, Congress adopted a less aggressive mode of&para;<br>applying §924(c), one that significantly reduced the sever&para;<br>ity of the provision’s impact on defendants. Like the&para;<br>courts below, we regard this premise as implausible. As&para;<br>earlier observed, see supra, at 5–6, the pre-1998 version of&para;<br>§924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence—punishment to be&para;<br>imposed regardless of the sentence received for the predi&para;<br>cate crime or any separate firearm conviction. Abbott and&para;<br>Gould think the “except” clause installed, instead, a mod&para;<br>est scheme designed simply to ensure that all §924(c)&para;<br>offenders “serve at least 5 years in prison.” Gould Brief 5;&para;<br>see Abbott Brief 10. We doubt that Congress meant a&para;<br>prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed “An Act [t]o throt&para;<br>tle criminal use of guns,” to effect a departure so great&para;<br>from §924(c)’s longstanding thrust, i.e., its insistence that&para;<br>sentencing judges impose additional punishment for&para;<br>§924(c) violations.&para;<br>Were we to accept any of the readings proposed by&para;<br>Abbott or Gould, it bears emphasis, we would undercut&para;<br>that same bill’s primary objective: to expand §924(c)’s&para;<br>coverage to reach firearm possession. In 1999, more than&para;<br>half of those who violated §924(c) in connection with a&para;<br>drug-trafficking offense received a mandatory minimum of&para;<br>ten years or more for that trafficking offense.

Congress, however, imposed&para;<br>only a five-year minimum for firearm possession “in fur&para;<br>therance of” a drug offense. As construed by Abbott and&para;<br>Gould, the amendment to include firearm possession as a&para;<br>§924(c) offense would spare the most serious drug offend&para;<br>ers from any discrete punishment for the very firearm&para;<br>activity the amendment targeted. “We are disinclined to&para;<br>say that what Congress imposed with one hand . . . it&para;<br>withdrew with the other . . . .” Logan v. United States, 552&para;<br>U. S. 23, 35 (2007).&para;<br>Abbott’s and Gould’s proposed readings, moreover,&para;<br>would result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did&para;<br>not intend. We note first that §924(c), as they construe it,&para;<br>would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that&para;<br>provision makes independently criminal. Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>52. For example, an individual who sold enough drugs to&para;<br>receive a ten-year minimum sentence under §841(b)(1)(A)&para;<br>could, so far as §924(c) is concerned, possess or even bran&para;<br>dish a gun without incurring any additional punishment.&para;<br>Stranger still, under the Abbott and Gould readings, the&para;<br>worst offenders would often secure the shortest sentences.&para;<br>Consider two defendants convicted of trafficking in co&para;<br>caine. The first possesses 500 grams and is subject to a&para;<br>mandatory minimum of five years, §841(b)(1)(B); the&para;<br>second possesses five kilograms and is subject to a manda&para;<br>tory minimum of ten years, §841(b)(1)(A). Both brandish&para;<br>firearms, calling for a sentence of seven years under&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A)(ii). The first defendant, under all readings,&para;<br>will spend at least 12 years in prison. The second defen&para;<br>dant’s ten-year drug minimum, according to Abbott and&para;<br>Gould, triggers the “except” clause and wipes out that&para;<br>defendant’s §924(c) penalty; though the more culpable of&para;<br>the two, the second defendant’s minimum term would be&para;<br>just ten years. Brief for United States 40.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Abbott’s alternative construction, which homes in on&para;<br>other firearm offenses, gives rise to similar oddities. On&para;<br>this reading, Abbott’s 15-year ACCA sentence for being a&para;<br>felon-in-possession would preempt his five-year §924(c)&para;<br>sentence, and his minimum term would be 15 years,&para;<br>rather than 20.5 But if ACCA were not at issue, Abbott’s&para;<br>minimum term would be the same 15 years: his fiveyear §924(c) sentence on top of his ten-year drug sen&para;<br>tence. Qualification as a career criminal would carry no&para;<br>consequence.&para;<br>Nor does Abbott’s second construction necessarily pro&para;<br>mote more equitable outcomes. Suppose, for example, that&para;<br>a career criminal sold drugs together with a first-time&para;<br>offender, and both brandished firearms in the process.&para;<br>The first-time offender, lacking a felon-in-possession&para;<br>conviction, would serve a seven-year §924(c) sentence on&para;<br>top of a ten-year drug sentence, for a total of 17 years. But&para;<br>the career criminal’s ACCA sentence would preempt the&para;<br>§924(c) sentence; he would serve only 15 years.&para;<br>Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may&para;<br>take account of such anomalies and order appropriate&para;<br>adjustments. We observe first that no correction or avoid&para;<br>ance appears possible for the anomaly that, while §924(c)&para;<br>“defines a standalone crime,” a §924(c) sentence would be&para;<br>wiped out by a wholly separate and independent convic&para;<br>tion. United States v. Easter, 553 F. 3d 519, 526 (CA7&para;<br>2009) (per curiam) (“A determination of guilt that yields&para;<br>no sentence is not a judgment of conviction at all.”). We&para;<br>do, however, agree that a judge exercising discretion un&para;<br>der 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) “would [not] be required to sen&para;<br>tence” a more culpable defendant to a lesser term; the&para;<br>judge could increase that defendant’s sentence for a predi&para;<br>cate crime to make up for §924(c)’s failure to effect any&para;<br>enlargement of the time served.

But we doubt Congress&para;<br>had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before we&para;<br>held, in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), that&para;<br>district courts have discretion to depart from the Sentenc&para;<br>ing Guidelines on the basis of §3553(a).&para;<br>Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress&para;<br>could have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guide&para;<br>lines would resolve disparities. See Abbott Brief 32–35;&para;<br>Gould Brief 30–32. On this view, the “except” clause&para;<br>ensures that a §924(c) offender incurs a minimum sen&para;<br>tence of considerable length; the Guidelines would then&para;<br>control, elevating that sentence based on firearm posses&para;<br>sion or use. See United States Sentencing Commission,&para;<br>Guidelines Manual §§2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1998)&para;<br>(increasing offense level for defendants who use or possess&para;<br>firearms in course of violent crime or drug trafficking);&para;<br>§§2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov. 2009) (same).&para;<br>We do not gainsay that Abbott and Gould project a&para;<br>rational, less harsh, mode of sentencing. But we do not&para;<br>think it was the mode Congress ordered. Congress ex&para;<br>pressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it&para;<br>amended §924(c) in the same law that created the Sen&para;<br>tencing Commission and the Guidelines. Pub. L. 98–473,&para;<br>98 Stat. 1987, 2138. Four years earlier, in Busic v. United&para;<br>States, 446 U. S. 398, 404 (1980), we had read §924(c) to&para;<br>impose no penalty when the predicate crime itself pre&para;<br>scribed a firearm enhancement; similarly, Abbott and&para;<br>Gould now read §924(c) to impose no penalty when the&para;<br>Guidelines prescribe a firearm enhancement to the predi&para;<br>cate sentence. The 1984 legislation “repudiated” Busic,&para;<br>clarifying that §924(c) applied even when the predicate&para;<br>crime already “provides for an enhanced punishment if&para;<br>committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or&para;<br>device.” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 10 (1997)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v.

If Congress wanted to ensure that §924(c) offend&para;<br>ers “receive at least five years in prison,” and to rely on&para;<br>the Guidelines for the rest, Abbott Brief 10, there was an&para;<br>obvious solution: Congress could have excised all prescrip&para;<br>tions ordering that §924(c) sentences shall run consecu&para;<br>tively to other sentences. Without such a requirement, all&para;<br>defendants would benefit from a minimum-plusGuidelines regime—not just the most culpable offenders.&para;<br>Congress did not adopt that obvious solution, we think,&para;<br>because it did not want the Guidelines to supplant §924(c).&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Government’s reading of the “except” clause, we are&para;<br>convinced, makes far more sense than the interpretations&para;<br>urged by Abbott and Gould.

Third, §924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that&para;<br>a §924(c) sentence might “run concurrently with any other&para;<br>term of imprisonment.” We doubt that Congress, having&para;<br>retained this thrice-repeated instruction, would simulta&para;<br>neously provide an exception severely limiting application&para;<br>of the instruction.&para;<br>Cf.

United States v.&para;<br>Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–535 (1925). As a proviso&para;<br>attached to §924(c), the “except” clause is most naturally&para;<br>read to refer to the conduct §924(c) proscribes. Accord&para;<br>United States v. Villa, 589 F. 3d 1334, 1343 (CA10 2009).&para;<br>There is strong contextual support for our view that&para;<br>Congress intended the “except” clause to serve simply as a&para;<br>clarification of §924(c), not as a major restraint on the&para;<br>statute’s operation. At the same time Congress added the&para;<br>“except” clause, it made the rest of §924(c) more complex.&para;<br>The 1998 revision divided the statute’s existing sentencing&para;<br>prescriptions into four paragraphs in lieu of one, and&para;<br>added new penalties for brandishing and discharging a&para;<br>firearm. §924(c)(1)(A)–(D). We know that Congress&para;<br>thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing&para;<br>judges: Warding off confusion, all agree, was the Legisla&para;<br>ture’s sole objective in adding the initial part of the “ex&para;<br>cept” clause, which covers greater minimums provided “by&para;<br>this subsection.” That portion of the clause instructs&para;<br>judges to pick the single highest sentence stipulated for a&para;<br>§924(c) violation within §924(c) itself, and not to stack ten&para;<br>years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing&para;<br>the same weapon, whenever a defendant does both.&para;<br>In referencing greater minimums provided by “any other&para;<br>provision of law,” we think, the second portion of the&para;<br>“except” clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking&para;<br>instruction for cases in which §924(c) and a different&para;<br>statute both punish conduct offending §924(c). Congress&para;<br>likely anticipated such cases when the “except” clause was&para;<br>framed in 1998, for the bill that reformulated the text of&para;<br>§924(c) did just one thing more: It amended 18 U.

S. ___ (2009), do not warrant a different conclusion.&para;<br>We observed in Gonzales that “the word ‘any’ [ordinarily]&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 We&para;<br>&para;<br>agree with the Government that a qualifying statute need not&para;<br>“explicit[ly] reference” §924(c), Tr. of Oral Arg. 27; a statute will fit the&para;<br>bill if it provides a greater mandatory minimum for an offense that&para;<br>embodies all the elements of a §924(c) offense.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>has an expansive meaning.” 520 U. S., at 5 (holding that&para;<br>“any other term of imprisonment” includes terms imposed&para;<br>by state courts). See also Beaty, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 7) (the word “any” in “any other provision of law” was&para;<br>“no warrant to limit the class of provisions of law”). But&para;<br>our decision on the petitions of Abbott and Gould does not&para;<br>turn on artificial confinement of the phrase “any other&para;<br>provision of law.” We rely, instead, on the different direc&para;<br>tion Congress prescribed for the “except” clause: It applies&para;<br>only when “a greater minimum sentence is otherwise&para;<br>provided.” “In the contest between reading” that phrase&para;<br>“to refer to penalties for the [§924(c)] offense in question or&para;<br>to penalties for any [other] offense [a defendant commits],&para;<br>we believe the former is the most natural.” Easter, 553&para;<br>F. 3d, at 526.9&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons stated, the judgments of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Fifth Circuit are&para;<br>Affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or&para;<br>decision of these cases.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Abbott&para;<br>&para;<br>and Gould invoke the rule of lenity as a final reason to con&para;<br>strue the “except” clause to bar their punishments under §924(c); if&para;<br>their proposed limitations are textually possible, they maintain, we&para;<br>may not choose the Government’s. “[T]he touchstone of the rule of&para;<br>lenity is statutory ambiguity.” Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381,&para;<br>387 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[A]fter consulting&para;<br>traditional canons of statutory construction,” United States v. Shabani,&para;<br>513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994), we are persuaded that none remains here: The&para;<br>“except” clause covers only conduct offending §924(c). Although the&para;<br>clause might have been more meticulously drafted, the “grammatical&para;<br>possibility” of a defendant’s interpretation does not command a resort&para;<br>to the rule of lenity if the interpretation proffered by the defendant&para;<br>reflects “an implausible reading of the congressional purpose.” Caron v.&para;<br>United States, 524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
