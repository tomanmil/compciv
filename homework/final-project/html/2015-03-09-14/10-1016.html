COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND &para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1016. Argued January 11, 2012—Decided March 20, 2012&para;<br>The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) entitles an employee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave per year for (A) the&para;<br>care of a newborn son or daughter; (B) the adoption or foster-care&para;<br>placement of a child; (C) the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious medical condition; and (D) the employee’s own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee’s ability to perform at work. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The FMLA&para;<br>also creates a private right of action for equitable relief and damages&para;<br>“against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or&para;<br>State court.” §2617(a)(2). For present purposes, subparagraphs (A),&para;<br>(B), and (C) are referred to as the family-care provisions, and subparagraph (D) as the self-care provision. In Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 730−732, this Court held that Congress could subject States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C)&para;<br>based on evidence of family-leave policies that discriminated on the&para;<br>basis of sex.&para;<br>Petitioner filed suit, alleging that his employer, the Maryland&para;<br>Court of Appeals, an instrumentality of the State, violated the FMLA&para;<br>by denying him self-care leave. The Federal District Court dismissed&para;<br>the suit on sovereign immunity grounds. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that unlike the family-care provision in Hibbs, the&para;<br>self-care provision was not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to&para;<br>any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>626 F. 3d 187, affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS,&para;<br>and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded that suits against States under the&para;<br>self-care provision are barred by sovereign immunity. Pp. 3−12.&para;<br>(a) Under the federal system, States, as sovereigns, are immune&para;<br>from damages suits, unless they waive that defense. See, e.g., Kimel&para;<br>v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72−73. Congress may also abrogate the States’ immunity pursuant to its powers under §5 of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment, but it must make that intention “unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,” Hibbs, supra, at 726. It did&para;<br>so in the FMLA. Congress also “must tailor” legislation enacted under §5 “to remedy or prevent” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639.&para;<br>“There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury&para;<br>to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.”&para;<br>City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520. Pp. 3−5.&para;<br>(b) The sex-based discrimination that supported allowing subparagraph (C) suits against States is absent with respect to the self-care&para;<br>provision. Petitioner’s three arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(1) Petitioner maintains that the self-care provision addresses&para;<br>sex discrimination and sex stereotyping. But the provision, standing&para;<br>alone, is not a valid abrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. At&para;<br>the time the FMLA was enacted, there was no evidence of such discrimination or stereotyping in sick-leave policies. Congress was concerned about the economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss&para;<br>on employees and their families and about discrimination based on&para;<br>illness, not sex. Although the self-care provision offers some women&para;<br>a benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not congruent and proportional&para;<br>to any identified constitutional violations. When the FMLA was enacted, Congress had no evidence that States were excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from their leave policies. Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>(2) Petitioner also argues that the self-care provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs. But his&para;<br>claim—that the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal availability of total FMLA leave time to women and men despite their different leave-usage patterns―is unconvincing and does not comply&para;<br>with the requirements of City of Boerne. Also, there are no congressional findings of, or evidence on, how the self-care provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces employer discrimination against women. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(3) Finally, petitioner contends that the self-care provision helps&para;<br>single parents keep their jobs when they get ill. The fact that most&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the&para;<br>self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect on women.&para;<br>However,&para;<br>“[a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of . . . discrimination . . . such evidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional&para;<br>violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.” Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,&para;<br>531 U. S. 356, 373. Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral&para;<br>leave policies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional,&para;<br>the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed&para;<br>remedial or preventive objectives. Pp. 11−12.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA adhered to his view that the Court should abandon&para;<br>the “congruence and proportionality” approach in favor of one that is&para;<br>properly tied to the text of §5, which grants Congress the power “to&para;<br>enforce, by appropriate legislation,” the other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Outside the context of racial discrimination,&para;<br>Congress’s §5 power should be limited to the regulation of conduct&para;<br>that itself violates the Fourteenth Amendment and thus would not&para;<br>reach a State’s failure to grant self-care leave to its employees.&para;<br>Pp. 1−2.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an&para;<br>opinion, in which ROBERTS, C.

The statute in&para;<br>question is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107&para;<br>Stat. 6, 29 U. S. C. §2601 et seq. The provision at issue&para;<br>requires employers, including state employers, to grant&para;<br>unpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition,&para;<br>provided other statutory requisites are met, particularly&para;<br>requirements that the total amount of annual leave taken&para;<br>under all the Act’s provisions does not exceed a stated&para;<br>maximum. §2612(a)(1)(d). In agreement with every Court&para;<br>of Appeals to have addressed this question, this Court now&para;<br>holds that suits against States under this provision are&para;<br>barred by the States’ immunity as sovereigns in our federal system. See 626 F. 3d 187 (CA4 2010) (case below);&para;<br>Nelson v. University of Tex., 535 F. 3d 318 (CA5 2008);&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v.

New&para;<br>Hampshire, 259 F. 3d 1 (CA1 2001).&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or&para;<br>Act) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work&para;<br>weeks of unpaid leave per year. An employee may take&para;<br>leave under the FMLA for: (A) “the birth of a son or&para;<br>daughter . . . in order to care for such son or daughter,” (B)&para;<br>the adoption or foster-care placement of a child with the&para;<br>employee, (C) the care of a “spouse . . . son, daughter, or&para;<br>parent” with “a serious health condition,” and (D) the&para;<br>employee’s own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee’s ability to perform at&para;<br>work. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The Act creates a private&para;<br>right of action to seek both equitable relief and money&para;<br>damages “against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.” §2617(a)(2). As noted, subparagraph (D) is at issue&para;<br>here.&para;<br>This Court considered subparagraph (C) in Nevada&para;<br>Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003).&para;<br>Subparagraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave for reasons related to family care, and those three provisions are&para;<br>referred to here as the family-care provisions. Hibbs held&para;<br>that Congress could subject the States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C), §2612(a)(1)(C). That holding&para;<br>rested on evidence that States had family-leave policies&para;<br>that differentiated on the basis of sex and that States&para;<br>administered even neutral family-leave policies in ways&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that discriminated on the basis of sex. See id., at 730–732.&para;<br>Subparagraph (D), the self-care provision, was not at issue&para;<br>in Hibbs.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner Daniel Coleman was employed by the Court&para;<br>of Appeals of the State of Maryland. When Coleman&para;<br>requested sick leave, he was informed he would be terminated if he did not resign. Coleman then sued the state&para;<br>court in the United States District Court for the District of&para;<br>Maryland, alleging, inter alia, that his employer violated&para;<br>the FMLA by failing to provide him with self-care leave.&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the suit on the basis that&para;<br>the Maryland Court of Appeals, as an entity of a sovereign&para;<br>State, was immune from the suit for damages. The parties&para;<br>do not dispute the District Court’s ruling that the Maryland Court of Appeals is an entity or instrumentality of&para;<br>the State for purposes of sovereign immunity. The District Court concluded the FMLA’s self-care provision did&para;<br>not validly abrogate the State’s immunity from suit. App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 15–20. The Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that, unlike the familycare provision at issue in Hibbs, the self-care provision&para;<br>was not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based&para;<br>discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to&para;<br>any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of&para;<br>States. 626 F. 3d 187. Certiorari was granted. 564 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>A foundational premise of the federal system is that&para;<br>States, as sovereigns, are immune from suits for damages,&para;<br>save as they elect to waive that defense. See Kimel v.&para;<br>Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72–73 (2000); Alden&para;<br>v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706 (1999). As an exception to this&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>principle, Congress may abrogate the States’ immunity&para;<br>from suit pursuant to its powers under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427&para;<br>U. S. 445 (1976).&para;<br>Congress must “mak[e] its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” Hibbs, 538&para;<br>U. S., at 726. On this point the Act does express the clear&para;<br>purpose to abrogate the States’ immunity. Ibid. (“The&para;<br>clarity of Congress’ intent” to abrogate the States’ immunity from suits for damages under the FMLA “is not fairly&para;<br>debatable”). Congress subjected any “public agency” to&para;<br>suit under the FMLA, 29 U. S. C. §2617(a)(2), and a “public agency” is defined to include both “the government of&para;<br>a State or political subdivision thereof ” and “any agency of&para;<br>. . . a State, or a political subdivision of a State,” §§203(x),&para;<br>2611(4)(A)(iii).&para;<br>The question then becomes whether the self-care provision and its attempt to abrogate the States’ immunity are&para;<br>a valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 grants Congress the&para;<br>power “to enforce” the substantive guarantees of §1 of&para;<br>the Amendment by “appropriate legislation.” The power&para;<br>to enforce “ ‘includes the authority both to remedy and to&para;<br>deter violation[s] of rights guaranteed’ ” by §1. See Board&para;<br>of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365&para;<br>(2001) (quoting Kimel, supra, at 81). To ensure Congress’&para;<br>enforcement powers under §5 remain enforcement powers,&para;<br>as envisioned by the ratifiers of the Amendment, rather&para;<br>than powers to redefine the substantive scope of §1, Congress “must tailor” legislation enacted under §5 “ ‘to remedy or prevent’ ” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid&para;<br>Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,&para;<br>527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999).&para;<br>Whether a congressional Act passed under §5 can impose monetary liability upon States requires an assess-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ment of both the “ ‘evil’ or ‘wrong’ that Congress intended&para;<br>to remedy,” ibid., and the means Congress adopted to&para;<br>address that evil, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.&para;<br>507, 520 (1997). Legislation enacted under §5 must be&para;<br>targeted at “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid,&para;<br>supra, at 639; see Kimel, supra, at 88; City of Boerne,&para;<br>521 U. S., at 525. And “[t]here must be a congruence&para;<br>and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or&para;<br>remedied and the means adopted to that end.” Id., at 520.&para;<br>Under this analysis Hibbs permitted employees to recover damages from States for violations of subparagraph&para;<br>(C). In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon evidence&para;<br>of a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination&para;<br>in family-leave policies. States had facially discriminatory&para;<br>leave policies that granted longer periods of leave to women than to men. 538 U. S., at 730–731. States also administered facially neutral family-leave policies in genderbiased ways. Id., at 732. These practices reflected what&para;<br>Congress found to be a “pervasive sex-role stereotype that&para;<br>caring for family members is women’s work,” id., at 731,&para;<br>a stereotype to which even this Court had succumbed in&para;<br>earlier times, id., at 729. Faced with “the States’ record of&para;<br>unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, genderbased discrimination in the administration of leave benefits,” Hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to&para;<br>give all employees the opportunity to take family-care&para;<br>leave was “narrowly targeted at the faultline between&para;<br>work and family—precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.” Id., at 735, 738.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The same cannot be said for requiring the States to give&para;<br>all employees the opportunity to take self-care leave.&para;<br>Petitioner advances three arguments for allowing employees to recover damages from States that violate the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>FMLA’s self-care provision: The self-care provision standing alone addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping; the provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care&para;<br>provision sustained in Hibbs; and the provision eases the&para;<br>burden on single parents. But what the family-care provisions have to support them, the self-care provision lacks,&para;<br>namely evidence of a pattern of state constitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to&para;<br>address or prevent those violations.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Standing alone, the self-care provision is not a valid&para;<br>abrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. When the&para;<br>FMLA was enacted, “ninety-five percent of full-time stateand local-government employees were covered by paid sick&para;<br>leave plans and ninety-six percent of such employees&para;<br>likewise enjoyed short-term disability protection.” Brief&para;<br>for States of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (hereinafter Texas Brief) (citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S.&para;<br>Dept. of Labor, Employee Benefits in State and Local&para;<br>Governments 17–26 (1994) (hereinafter BLS Rept.)). The&para;<br>evidence did not suggest States had facially discriminatory&para;<br>self-care leave policies or that they administered neutral&para;<br>self-care leave policies in a discriminatory way. And there&para;<br>is scant evidence in the legislative history of a purported&para;<br>stereotype harbored by employers that women take selfcare leave more often than men. Congress considered&para;<br>evidence that “men and women are out on medical leave&para;<br>approximately equally.” H. R. Rep. No. 101–28, pt. 1, p.&para;<br>15 (1989) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Nothing in the record&para;<br>shows employers formulated self-care leave policies based&para;<br>on a contrary view.&para;<br>Without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or&para;<br>sex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is&para;<br>apparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the&para;<br>self-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The legislative history of the self-care provision reveals a&para;<br>concern for the economic burdens on the employee and the&para;<br>employee’s family resulting from illness-related job loss&para;<br>and a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness, not&para;<br>sex. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, pp. 11–12 (1993); H. R.&para;<br>Rep., at 23. In the findings pertinent to the self-care&para;<br>provision, the statute makes no reference to any distinction on the basis of sex. See 29 U. S. C. §2601(a)(4)&para;<br>(“[T]here is inadequate job security for employees who&para;<br>have serious health conditions that prevent them from&para;<br>working for temporary periods”). By contrast, with regard&para;<br>to family care Congress invoked concerns related to gender. See §2601(a)(5) (“[D]ue to the nature of the roles of&para;<br>men and women in our society, the primary responsibility&para;<br>for family caretaking often falls on women, and such&para;<br>responsibility affects the working lives of women more&para;<br>than it affects the working lives of men”).&para;<br>It is true the self-care provision offers some women a&para;<br>benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancyrelated illnesses; but as a remedy, the provision is not&para;<br>congruent and proportional to any identified constitutional&para;<br>violations. At the time of the FMLA’s enactment, “ninetyfive percent” of state employees had paid sick-leave plans&para;<br>at work, and “ninety-six percent” had short-term disability&para;<br>protection. Texas Brief 13–14 (citing BLS Rept. 17–26).&para;<br>State employees presumably could take leave for pregnancyrelated illnesses under these policies, and Congress did&para;<br>not document any pattern of States excluding pregnancyrelated illnesses from sick-leave or disability-leave policies. “Congress . . . said nothing about the existence or&para;<br>adequacy of state remedies.” Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S.,&para;<br>at 644. It follows that abrogating the States’ immunity&para;<br>from suits for damages for failure to give self-care leave is&para;<br>not a congruent and proportional remedy if the existing&para;<br>state leave policies would have sufficed.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>As an alternative justification for the self-care provision,&para;<br>it has been suggested that the provision is a necessary&para;<br>adjunct to the family-care provisions. Petitioner argues&para;<br>that employers may assume women are more likely to&para;<br>take family-care leave than men and that the FMLA&para;<br>therefore offers up to 12 weeks of leave for family care and&para;<br>self care combined. According to petitioner, when the selfcare provision is coupled with the family-care provisions,&para;<br>the self-care provision could reduce the difference in the&para;<br>expected number of weeks of FMLA leave that different&para;<br>employees take for different reasons.&para;<br>The fact that self-care leave could have this effect does&para;<br>not mean that it would. If, for example, women are expected to take 20 days of family-care leave per year and&para;<br>men to take 10, and women and men are each expected to&para;<br>take 5 days of self-care leave per year, the difference in the&para;<br>expected number of days of leave and cost to the employer&para;<br>remains the same regardless of the availability of self-care&para;<br>leave. Congress made no findings, and received no specific&para;<br>testimony, to suggest the availability of self-care leave&para;<br>equalizes the expected amount of FMLA leave men and&para;<br>women will take. Even if women take family-care leave&para;<br>more often than men, men do not take self-care leave more&para;<br>often than women; and there is little evidence that employers assume they do. See H. R. Rep., at 15. Petitioner&para;<br>suggests that some women will be expected to take all 12&para;<br>weeks of leave under the FMLA for family-care purposes,&para;<br>and therefore that any amount of self-care leave taken by&para;<br>men will diminish the difference in the amount of FMLA&para;<br>leave taken by men and women. But there is little evidence to support petitioner’s assumption about the magnitude of women’s expected FMLA leave for family-care&para;<br>purposes. And men are only expected to take five days of&para;<br>sick leave per year, see ibid., so the self-care provision&para;<br>diminishes the difference in expected leave time by a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>maximum of five days. And that is only to the extent&para;<br>women use all their available FMLA leave for family-care&para;<br>reasons. Petitioner’s overly complicated argument about&para;<br>how the self-care provision works in tandem with the&para;<br>family-care provisions is unconvincing and in the end does&para;<br>not comply with the clear requirements of City of Boerne.&para;<br>In addition petitioner’s first defense of the self-care&para;<br>provision contradicts his second defense of the provision.&para;<br>In the first defense, the Court is told employers assume&para;<br>women take more self-care leave than men. See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 10–12. In the second defense, the Court is told&para;<br>the self-care provision provides an incentive to hire women&para;<br>that will counteract the incentives created by the familycare provisions because employers assume women take&para;<br>more family-care leave than men. But if the first defense&para;<br>is correct, the second defense is wrong. In other words, if&para;<br>employers assume women take self-care leave more often&para;<br>than men (the first defense), a self-care provision will not&para;<br>provide an incentive to hire women. To the contrary, the&para;<br>self-care provision would provide an incentive to discriminate against women.&para;<br>There is “little support in the record for the concerns&para;<br>that supposedly animated” the self-care provision. Florida&para;<br>Prepaid, supra, at 639. Only supposition and conjecture&para;<br>support the contention that the self-care provision is&para;<br>necessary to make the family-care provisions effective.&para;<br>The evidence documented in support of the self-care provision is, to a large degree, unrelated to sex discrimination,&para;<br>or to the administration of the family-care provisions. See&para;<br>supra, at 7. Congress made no findings and did not cite&para;<br>specific or detailed evidence to show how the self-care&para;<br>provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how&para;<br>it reduces an employer’s incentives to discriminate against&para;<br>women.

These&para;<br>“isolated sentences clipped from floor debates” and testimony, Kimel, supra, at 89, are stated as conclusions,&para;<br>unsupported by evidence or findings about how the selfcare provision interrelates to the family-care provisions to&para;<br>counteract employers’ incentives to discriminate against&para;<br>women. Congress must rely on more than abstract generalities to subject the States to suits for damages. Otherwise, Congress could choose to combat the purported&para;<br>effects of the family-care provisions by allowing employees&para;<br>to sue States that do not permit employees to take vacation time under the FMLA. There is nothing in particular&para;<br>about self-care leave, as opposed to leave for any personal&para;<br>reason, that connects it to gender discrimination. And&para;<br>when the issue, as here, is whether subparagraph (D) can&para;<br>abrogate a State’s immunity from damages, there is no&para;<br>sufficient nexus, or indeed any demonstrated nexus, between self-care leave and gender discrimination by state&para;<br>employers.

An explicit&para;<br>purpose of the Congress in adopting the FMLA was to&para;<br>improve workplace conditions for women. See 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§2601(b)(4), (5). But States may not be subject to suits&para;<br>for damages based on violations of a comprehensive statute unless Congress has identified a specific pattern of&para;<br>constitutional violations by state employers. See City of&para;<br>Boerne, 521 U. S., at 532.&para;<br>3&para;<br>The petitioner’s last defense of the self-care provision is&para;<br>that the provision helps single parents retain their jobs&para;<br>when they become ill. This, however, does not explain&para;<br>how the provision remedies or prevents constitutional&para;<br>violations. The fact that most single parents happen to be&para;<br>women, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 7, demonstrates, at&para;<br>most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying employers’ neutral leave restrictions which have a&para;<br>disparate effect on women. “Although disparate impact&para;<br>may be relevant evidence of . . . discrimination . . . such&para;<br>evidence alone is insufficient [to prove a constitutional&para;<br>violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects&para;<br>state action to strict scrutiny.” Garrett, supra, at 372–373;&para;<br>see Tuan Anh Nguyen v.

To the extent, then, that the self-care&para;<br>provision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate&para;<br>impact on women, it is not directed at a pattern of constitutional violations. Because, moreover, it is “unlikely that&para;<br>many of the [neutral leave policies] . . . affected by” the&para;<br>self-care provision are unconstitutional, “the scope of the&para;<br>[self-care provision is] out of proportion to its supposed&para;<br>remedial or preventive objectives.” Kimel, supra, at 82;&para;<br>see City of Boerne, supra, at 519.&para;<br>Of course, a State need not assert its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suits for damages.

S., at 728.&para;<br>I begin with the text of the statute, which repeatedly&para;<br>emphasizes gender discrimination. One of the FMLA’s&para;<br>stated purposes is to “entitle employees to take reasonable&para;<br>leave,” 29 U. S. C. §2601(b)(2), “in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment, minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally&para;<br>that leave is available for eligible medical reasons (including maternity-related disability) and for compelling family&para;<br>reasons, on a gender-neutral basis.” §2601(b)(4). Another&para;<br>identified aim is “to promote the goal of equal employment&para;<br>opportunity for women and men, pursuant to [the Equal&para;<br>Protection Clause].” §2601(b)(5). “[E]mployment standards that apply to one gender only,” Congress expressly&para;<br>found, “have serious potential for encouraging employers&para;<br>to discriminate against employees and applicants for&para;<br>employment who are of that gender.” §2601(a)(6).&para;<br>The FMLA’s purpose and legislative history reinforce&para;<br>the conclusion that the FMLA, in its entirety, is directed&para;<br>at sex discrimination. Indeed, the FMLA was originally&para;<br>envisioned as a way to guarantee—without singling out&para;<br>women or pregnancy—that pregnant women would not&para;<br>lose their jobs when they gave birth. The self-care provision achieves that aim.&para;<br>A brief history is in order.

Footnote 20 reads:&para;<br>“The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is&para;<br>. . . a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71&para;<br>(1971), and Frontiero v.

The&para;<br>program divides potential recipients into two groups—&para;<br>pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the&para;<br>first group is exclusively female, the second includes&para;<br>members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both&para;<br>sexes.” 417 U.

Rather,&para;<br>discriminating on the basis of pregnancy “[b]y definition&para;<br>. . . discriminates on account of sex; for it is the capacity&para;<br>to become pregnant which primarily differentiates the female from the male.” General Elec.

As Justice Brennan&para;<br>insightfully concluded in dissent, “a limitation is imposed&para;<br>upon the disabilities for which women workers may recover, while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered . . . . Such dissimilar treatment of men and&para;<br>women, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably&para;<br>linked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimination.” Id., at 501.&para;<br>Second, pregnancy provided a central justification for&para;<br>the historic discrimination against women this Court&para;<br>chronicled in Hibbs. See 538 U. S., at 729 (“[A] proper&para;<br>discharge of [a woman’s] maternal functions—having in&para;<br>view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the&para;<br>race—justif[ies] legislation to protect her from the greed&para;<br>as well as the passion of man.” (quoting Muller v.

Relatedly, discrimination against pregnant employees was often “based&para;<br>not on the pregnancy itself but on predictions concerning&para;<br>the future behavior of the pregnant woman when her child&para;<br>was born or on views about what her behavior should be.”&para;<br>Williams 355. See also S. Rep.

It is also inextricably intertwined with&para;<br>employers’ “stereotypical views about women’s commitment to work and their value as employees.” Hibbs, 538&para;<br>U. S., at 736. Because pregnancy discrimination is inevitably sex discrimination, and because discrimination&para;<br>against women is tightly interwoven with society’s beliefs&para;<br>about pregnancy and motherhood, I would hold that Aiello&para;<br>was egregiously wrong to declare that discrimination on&para;<br>the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of&para;<br>sex.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Boerne’s third step requires “ ‘a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied&para;<br>and the means adopted to that end.’ ” Ante, at 5 (quoting&para;<br>521 U. S., at 520). Section 2612(a)(1)(D), I would conclude,&para;<br>is an appropriate response to pervasive discriminatory&para;<br>treatment of pregnant women. In separating self-care&para;<br>leave for the physical disability following childbirth,&para;<br>§2612(a)(1)(D), which affects only women, from familycare leave for parenting a newborn baby, §2612(a)(1)(A),&para;<br>for which men and women are equally suited, Congress&para;<br>could attack gender discrimination and challenge stereotypes of women as lone childrearers. Cf. Hibbs, 538 U. S.,&para;<br>at 731 (States’ extended “maternity” leaves, far exceeding&para;<br>a woman’s physical disability following childbirth, were&para;<br>attributable “to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that&para;<br>caring for family members is women’s work.”).&para;<br>It would make scant sense to provide job-protected leave&para;<br>for a woman to care for a newborn, but not for her recovery from delivery, a miscarriage, or the birth of a stillborn&para;<br>baby. And allowing States to provide no pregnancydisability leave at all, given that only women can become&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>pregnant, would obviously “exclude far more women than&para;<br>men from the workplace.” Id., at 738.&para;<br>The plurality’s statement that Congress lacked “widespread evidence of sex discrimination . . . in the administration of sick leave,” ante, at 6, misses the point. So too&para;<br>does the plurality’s observation that state employees likely&para;<br>“could take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses”—&para;<br>presumably severe morning sickness, toxemia, etc.—under&para;<br>paid sick-leave plans, ante, at 7. Congress heard evidence&para;<br>that existing sick-leave plans were inadequate to ensure&para;<br>that women were not fired when they needed to take time&para;<br>out to recover their strength and stamina after childbirth.&para;<br>The self-care provision responds to that evidence by requiring employers to allow leave for “ongoing pregnancy,&para;<br>miscarriages, . . . the need for prenatal care, childbirth,&para;<br>and recovery from childbirth.” S. Rep. No. 103–3, p. 29&para;<br>(1993).&para;<br>That §2612(a)(1)(D) entitles all employees to up to 12&para;<br>weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for a serious health&para;<br>condition, rather than singling out pregnancy or childbirth, does not mean that the provision lacks the requisite&para;<br>congruence and proportionality to the identified constitutional violations. As earlier noted, supra, at 6–7, Congress&para;<br>made plain its rationale for the prescription’s broader&para;<br>compass: Congress sought to ward off the unconstitutional&para;<br>discrimination it believed would attend a pregnancy-only&para;<br>leave requirement. Under the caption “Equal protection&para;<br>and non-discrimination,” Congress explained:&para;<br>“The FMLA addresses the basic leave needs of all&para;<br>employees. . . . This is an important principle reflected&para;<br>in the bill.&para;<br>“A law providing special protection to women . . . ,&para;<br>in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of causing discriminatory treatment. Employers might be&para;<br>less inclined to hire women . . . . For example, legisla-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion addressing the needs of pregnant women only&para;<br>might encourage discriminatory hiring practices&para;<br>against women of child bearing age. Legislation addressing the needs of all workers equally does not&para;<br>have this effect. By addressing the serious leave&para;<br>needs of all employees, the FMLA avoids providing&para;<br>employers the temptation to discriminate [against&para;<br>women].&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“The legislation is [thus] based not only on the Commerce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal protection . . . embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.”&para;<br>H. R. Rep. No. 102–135, pt. 1, pp. 27–28 (1991) (hereinafter 1991 House Report).&para;<br>Congress’ concern was solidly grounded in workplace&para;<br>realities. After this Court upheld California’s pregnancyonly leave policy in California Fed., Don Butler, President&para;<br>of the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, one of&para;<br>the plaintiffs in that case, told National Public Radio&para;<br>reporter Nina Totenberg that, as a result of the decision,&para;<br>“many employers will be prone to discriminate against&para;<br>women in hiring and hire males instead.” 1987 House&para;<br>Hearing 36. Totenberg replied, “But that is illegal, too”—&para;<br>to which Butler responded, “Well, that is illegal, but try to&para;<br>prove it.” Ibid.&para;<br>Finally, as in Hibbs, it is important to note the moderate&para;<br>cast of the FMLA, in particular, the considerable limitations Congress placed on §§2612(a)(1)(A)–(D)’s leave&para;<br>requirement. See 538 U. S., at 738–739. FMLA leave is&para;<br>unpaid. It is limited to employees who have worked&para;<br>at least one year for the employer and at least 1,250&para;<br>hours during the past year. §§2611(2)(A), 2612(c)(1).&para;<br>High-ranking employees, including state elected officials&para;<br>and their staffs, are not within the Act’s compass.&para;<br>§§203(e)(2)(C), 2611(3). Employees must provide advance&para;<br>notice of foreseeable leaves. §2612(e). Employers may&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>require a doctor’s certification of a serious health condition. §2613(a). And, if an employer violates the FMLA,&para;<br>the employees’ recoverable damages are “strictly defined&para;<br>and measured by actual monetary losses.” Hibbs, 538&para;<br>U. S., at 740 (citing §§2617(a)(1)(A)(i)–(iii)). The self-care&para;<br>provision, I would therefore hold, is congruent and proportional to the injury to be prevented.&para;<br>III&para;<br>But even if Aiello senselessly holds sway, and impedes&para;<br>the conclusion that §2612(a)(1)(D) is an appropriate response to the States’ unconstitutional discrimination&para;<br>against pregnant women,6 I would nevertheless conclude&para;<br>that the FMLA is valid §5 legislation.

According to one study, male workers missed an average of 4.9 days of work per year due to illness or injury;&para;<br>female workers missed 5.1 days. See 1991 House Report,&para;<br>pt. 1, p. 28. “[T]he incidence of serious medical conditions&para;<br>that would be covered by medical leave under the bill,”&para;<br>Congress determined, “is virtually the same for men and&para;<br>women.

As Judge Lipez&para;<br>explained:&para;<br>“If Congress had drawn a line at leave for caring for&para;<br>other family members, there is greater likelihood that&para;<br>the FMLA would have been perceived as further reason to avoid granting employment opportunities to&para;<br>women.

Responding to assertions that the FMLA would lead employers to discriminate against women, Senator Boxer stated:&para;<br>“[T]o say that women will not be hired by business is a&para;<br>specious argument . . . . Men also get sick. They get&para;<br>cancer. They get heart disease. They have ailments. And&para;<br>this bill applies to men and women.” 139 Cong. Rec. 1697&para;<br>(1993). See also 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 2, p. 536 (“I&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>just think it’s wrong that there will be a perception that&para;<br>this is something that only women will take and they are,&para;<br>therefore, more expensive. Both men and women have&para;<br>medical conditions . . . .” (statement of Prof. Susan Deller&para;<br>Ross, Georgetown University Law Center)).&para;<br>The plurality therefore gets it wrong in concluding that&para;<br>“[o]nly supposition and conjecture support the contention&para;<br>that the self-care provision is necessary to make the familycare provisions effective.” Ante, at 9. Self-care leave, I&para;<br>would hold, is a key part of Congress’ endeavor to make it&para;<br>feasible for women to work and have families. See 1991&para;<br>Senate Report 25–26 (“This legislation is essential if the&para;<br>nation is to address the dramatic changes that have occurred in the American workforce in recent years. . . . The&para;<br>once-typical American family, where the father worked for&para;<br>pay and the mother stayed at home with the children, is&para;<br>vanishing. . . . Today, more than one-half of all mothers&para;<br>with infants under one year of age work outside the home.&para;<br>That figure has doubled since 1970 . . . . By the year 2000,&para;<br>about three out of every four American children will have&para;<br>mothers in the workforce.”). By reducing an employer’s&para;<br>perceived incentive to avoid hiring women, §2612(a)(1)(D)&para;<br>lessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise&para;<br>to the very sex discrimination it was enacted to thwart.&para;<br>The plurality offers no legitimate ground to dilute the&para;<br>force of the Act.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Two additional points. First, this Court reached a different conclusion than the one I reach here in Board of&para;<br>Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356 (2001),&para;<br>and Kimel, 528 U. S. 62. In those cases, as we observed in&para;<br>Hibbs, we reviewed statutes targeting disability and age&para;<br>discrimination, respectively. Neither disability nor age is&para;<br>a suspect classification under this Court’s Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence; States may discriminate on the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>basis of disability or age as long as the classification is&para;<br>rationally related to a legitimate state interest. See Garrett, 531 U. S., at 366–367; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 83–84.&para;<br>Therefore, for the statutes to be responsive to or designed&para;<br>to prevent unconstitutional discrimination, Congress&para;<br>needed to rely on a pattern of irrational state discrimination on the basis of disability or age. See Garrett, 531&para;<br>U. S., at 368; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 89. Here, however,&para;<br>Congress homed in on gender discrimination, which triggers heightened review. See United States v. Virginia, 518&para;<br>U. S. 515, 531 (1996) (“Parties who seek to defend genderbased government action must demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification for that action.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). “[I]t was [therefore] easier for&para;<br>Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.”&para;<br>Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 736.&para;<br>Finally, the plurality’s opinion does not authorize state&para;<br>employers to violate the FMLA, although it does block&para;<br>injured employees from suing for monetary relief. The&para;<br>self-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legislation, Maryland concedes, and consequently binds the&para;<br>states, as well as the private sector. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25;&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 32–33. An employee wrongly denied&para;<br>self-care leave, Maryland also acknowledges, may, pursuant to Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), seek injunctive relief against the responsible state official. See Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 33. Moreover, the U. S. Department of&para;<br>Labor may bring an action against a state for violating the&para;<br>self-care provision and may recover monetary relief on an&para;<br>employee’s behalf. 29 U. S. C. §§2617(b)(2)–(3), (d).&para;<br>V&para;<br>The plurality pays scant attention to the overarching&para;<br>aim of the FMLA: to make it feasible for women to work&para;<br>while sustaining family life. Over the course of eight&para;<br>years, Congress considered the problem of workplace&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>discrimination against women, and devised the FMLA to&para;<br>reduce sex-based inequalities in leave programs. Essential to its design, Congress assiduously avoided a legislative package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared&para;<br>to women only. Congress thereby reduced employers’&para;<br>incentives to prefer men over women, advanced women’s&para;<br>economic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more&para;<br>egalitarian relationship at home and at work. The selfcare provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my&para;<br>view, a valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore reverse the&para;<br>judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth&para;<br>Circuit.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
