UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–94. Argued March 19, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012&para;<br>Petitioner Southern Union Company was convicted by a jury in federal&para;<br>court on one count of violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) for having knowingly stored liquid mercury&para;<br>without a permit at a subsidiary’s facility “on or about September 19,&para;<br>2002 to October 19, 2004.” Violations of the RCRA are punishable by,&para;<br>inter alia, a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office calculated a&para;<br>maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern Union violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from September 19, 2002,&para;<br>through October 19, 2004. Southern Union argued that imposing any&para;<br>fine greater than the 1-day penalty of $50,000 would be unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, which holds that&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee requires that any fact&para;<br>(other than the fact of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime be proved to a jury&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt. Southern Union contended that, based&para;<br>on the jury verdict and the District Court’s instructions, the only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day. The District Court&para;<br>held that Apprendi applies to criminal fines, but concluded from the&para;<br>“content and context of the verdict all together” that the jury found a&para;<br>762-day violation. The court therefore set a maximum potential fine&para;<br>of $38.1 million, from which it imposed a fine of $6 million and a&para;<br>“community service obligation” of $12 million. On appeal, the First&para;<br>Circuit disagreed with the District Court that the jury necessarily&para;<br>found a violation of 762 days. But the First Circuit affirmed the sentence because it held that Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.&para;<br>Held: The rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.&para;<br>Pp. 3−16.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law practice,” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281, and preserves&para;<br>the “historic jury function” of “determining whether the prosecution&para;<br>has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt,”&para;<br>Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 163. This Court has repeatedly affirmed&para;<br>Apprendi’s rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes that&para;<br>allow judges to find facts that increase a defendant’s maximum authorized sentence. See Cunningham, 549 U. S., at 274−275; United&para;<br>States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–227; Blakely v. Washington, 542&para;<br>U. S. 296, 299–300; Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469. While the punishments at stake in these&para;<br>cases were imprisonment or a death sentence, there is no principled&para;<br>basis under Apprendi to treat criminal fines differently. Apprendi’s&para;<br>“core concern”—to reserve to the jury “the determination of facts that&para;<br>warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense,” Ice, 555 U. S.,&para;<br>at 170—applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or imprisonment or death. Criminal fines, like these other forms of punishment,&para;<br>are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.&para;<br>Fines were by far the most common form of noncapital punishment in&para;<br>colonial America and they continue to be frequently imposed today.&para;<br>And, the amount of a fine, like the maximum term of imprisonment&para;<br>or eligibility for the death penalty, is often determined by reference to&para;<br>particular facts. The Government argues that fines are less onerous&para;<br>than incarceration and the death sentence and therefore should be&para;<br>exempt from Apprendi. But where a fine is substantial enough to&para;<br>trigger the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee, Apprendi applies&para;<br>in full. Pp. 3−8.&para;<br>(b) The “historical role of the jury at common law,” which informs&para;<br>the “scope of the constitutional jury right,” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170, supports applying Apprendi to criminal fines. To be sure, judges in the&para;<br>colonies and during the founding era had much discretion in determining whether to impose a fine and in what amount. But the exercise of such discretion is fully consistent with Apprendi, which permits courts to impose “judgment within the range prescribed by&para;<br>statute.” 530 U. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). The more salient&para;<br>question is what role the jury played in prosecutions for offenses that&para;<br>pegged the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts. A&para;<br>review of both state and federal decisions discloses that the predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and&para;<br>proved to the jury. The rule that juries must determine facts that set&para;<br>a fine’s maximum amount is an application of the “two longstanding&para;<br>tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence” on which Apprendi is&para;<br>based: first, “the ‘truth of every accusation’ against a defendant&para;<br>‘should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of his equals and neighbours.’ ” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301. And second, “ ‘an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law&para;<br>makes essential to the punishment is . . . no accusation within the&para;<br>requirements of the common law, and is no accusation in reason.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. Contrary to the Government’s contentions, neither United&para;<br>States v. Murphy, 16 Pet. 203, nor United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch&para;<br>285, overcomes the ample historical evidence that juries routinely&para;<br>found facts that set maximum criminal fines. Pp. 8−14.&para;<br>(c) The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the dissent,&para;<br>are unpersuasive. The Government claims that facts relevant to a fine’s&para;<br>amount typically quantify the harm caused by the defendant’s offense, and do not define a separate set of acts for punishment. The&para;<br>Government contends that only the latter determination implicates&para;<br>Apprendi’s concerns. But this argument rests on the rejected assumption that, in determining the maximum punishment for an offense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact&para;<br>that is an “element” of the offense and one that is a “sentencing factor.” Further, the facts the District Court found in imposing a fine on&para;<br>Southern Union are not fairly characterized as merely quantifying&para;<br>the harm the company caused.&para;<br>The Government also argues that applying Apprendi to criminal&para;<br>fines will prevent States and the Federal Government from enacting statutes that calibrate the amount of a fine to a defendant’s culpability. But legislatures are free to enact such statutes, so long&para;<br>as the statutes are administered in conformance with the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment.&para;<br>Finally, the Government contends that requiring juries to determine facts related to fines will cause confusion, prejudice defendants,&para;<br>or be impractical. These policy arguments rehearse those made by&para;<br>the dissents in our prior Apprendi cases. They must be rejected because the rule the Government espouses is unconstitutional. In addition, because Apprendi is now more than a decade old, the reliance&para;<br>interests underlying the Government’s arguments are by this point&para;<br>attenuated.

We have&para;<br>applied this principle in numerous cases where the sentence was imprisonment or death. The question here is&para;<br>whether the same rule applies to sentences of criminal&para;<br>fines. We hold that it does.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Southern Union Company is a natural gas&para;<br>distributor. Its subsidiary stored liquid mercury, a hazardous substance, at a facility in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In September 2004, youths from a nearby apartment complex broke into the facility, played with the mercury, and spread it around the facility and complex. The&para;<br>complex’s residents were temporarily displaced during&para;<br>the cleanup and most underwent testing for mercury&para;<br>poisoning.&para;<br>In 2007, a grand jury indicted Southern Union on mul-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tiple counts of violating federal environmental statutes.&para;<br>As relevant here, the first count alleged that the company&para;<br>knowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at the&para;<br>Pawtucket facility “[f ]rom on or about September 19, 2002&para;<br>until on or about October 19, 2004,” App. 104, in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of&para;<br>1976 (RCRA). See 90 Stat. 2812, as amended, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§6928(d)(2)(A). A jury convicted Southern Union on this&para;<br>count following a trial in the District Court for the District&para;<br>of Rhode Island. The verdict form stated that Southern&para;<br>Union was guilty of unlawfully storing liquid mercury&para;<br>“on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004.”&para;<br>App. 140.&para;<br>Violations of the RCRA are punishable by, inter alia,&para;<br>“a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.”&para;<br>§6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern&para;<br>Union violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from&para;<br>September 19, 2002, through October 19, 2004. Southern&para;<br>Union objected that this calculation violated Apprendi&para;<br>because the jury was not asked to determine the precise&para;<br>duration of the violation. The company noted that the verdict form listed only the violation’s approximate start&para;<br>date (i.e., “on or about”), and argued that the court’s instructions permitted conviction if the jury found even a&para;<br>1-day violation. Therefore, Southern Union maintained, the&para;<br>only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day,&para;<br>and imposing any fine greater than the single-day penalty&para;<br>of $50,000 would require factfinding by the court, in contravention of Apprendi.&para;<br>The Government acknowledged the jury was not asked&para;<br>to specify the duration of the violation, but argued that&para;<br>Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines. The District&para;<br>Court disagreed and held that Apprendi applies. But the&para;<br>court concluded from the “content and context of the verdict all together” that the jury found a 762-day violation.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. The court therefore set a&para;<br>maximum potential fine of $38.1 million, from which&para;<br>it imposed a fine of $6 million and a “community service&para;<br>obligatio[n]” of $12 million. App. 154.&para;<br>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>First Circuit rejected the District Court’s conclusion that&para;<br>the jury necessarily found a violation of 762 days. 630&para;<br>F. 3d 17, 36 (2010). But the Court of Appeals affirmed&para;<br>the sentence because it also held, again in contrast to the&para;<br>District Court, that Apprendi does not apply to criminal&para;<br>fines. 630 F. 3d, at 33–36. Other Circuits have reached&para;<br>the opposite conclusion. See United States v. Pfaff, 619&para;<br>F. 3d 172 (CA2 2010) (per curiam); United States v.&para;<br>LaGrou Distribution Sys., Inc., 466 F. 3d 585 (CA7 2006).&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 565 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2011), and now reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>This case requires us to consider the scope of the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right of jury trial, as construed in Apprendi.&para;<br>Under Apprendi, “[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond&para;<br>the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a&para;<br>jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at&para;<br>490. The “ ‘statutory maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is&para;<br>the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the&para;<br>basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted&para;<br>by the defendant.” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted). Thus, while judges may exercise discretion in&para;<br>sentencing, they may not “inflic[t] punishment that the&para;<br>jury’s verdict alone does not allow.” Id., at 304.&para;<br>Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law&para;<br>practice.” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281&para;<br>(2007). It preserves the “historic jury function” of “determining whether the prosecution has proved each element&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” Oregon v. Ice,&para;<br>555 U. S. 160, 163 (2009). We have repeatedly affirmed&para;<br>this rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes&para;<br>that allowed judges to find facts that increased a defendant’s maximum authorized sentence. See Cunningham,&para;<br>549 U. S., at 274–275 (elevated “upper term” of imprisonment); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–&para;<br>227, 233–234 (2005) (increased imprisonment range for&para;<br>defendant under then-mandatory Federal Sentencing&para;<br>Guidelines); Blakely, 542 U. S., at 299–300 (increased imprisonment above statutorily prescribed “standard range”);&para;<br>Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589 (2002) (death&para;<br>penalty authorized upon finding existence of aggravating&para;<br>factors); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469 (extended term&para;<br>of imprisonment based on violation of a “hate crime”&para;<br>statute).&para;<br>While the punishments at stake in those cases were&para;<br>imprisonment or a death sentence, we see no principled&para;<br>basis under Apprendi for treating criminal fines differently. Apprendi’s “core concern” is to reserve to the jury&para;<br>“the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a&para;<br>specific statutory offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. That&para;<br>concern applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or&para;<br>imprisonment or death. Criminal fines, like these other&para;<br>forms of punishment, are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses. Fines were by far the&para;<br>most common form of noncapital punishment in colonial&para;<br>America.1 They are frequently imposed today, especially&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 See&para;<br>&para;<br>Preyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview,&para;<br>26 Am.

S.&para;<br>257, 290 (1989) (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in&para;<br>part) (fines were “the preferred penal sanction” in England by the 17th&para;<br>century). “Imprisonment,” in contrast, “although provided for as a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>upon organizational defendants who cannot be imprisoned.2 And the amount of a fine, like the maximum term&para;<br>of imprisonment or eligibility for the death penalty, is often calculated by reference to particular facts. Sometimes,&para;<br>as here, the fact is the duration of a statutory violation;3&para;<br>under other statutes it is the amount of the defendant’s&para;<br>gain or the victim’s loss, or some other factor.4 In all&para;<br>such cases, requiring juries to find beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt facts that determine the fine’s maximum amount is&para;<br>necessary to implement Apprendi’s “animating principle”:&para;<br>the “preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bulwark&para;<br>between the State and the accused at the trial for an&para;<br>alleged offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 168. In stating Apprendi’s rule, we have never distinguished one form of punishment from another. Instead, our decisions broadly&para;<br>prohibit judicial factfinding that increases maximum&para;<br>criminal “sentence[s],” “penalties,” or “punishment[s]”—&para;<br>terms that each undeniably embrace fines. E.g., Blakely,&para;<br>542 U. S., at 304; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490; Ring, 536&para;<br>U. S., at 589.&para;<br>The Government objects, however, that fines are less&para;<br>——————&para;<br>punishment in some colonies, was not a central feature of criminal&para;<br>punishment until a later time.” Preyer 329; see also Lillquist 641–643.&para;<br>2 In 2011, a fine was imposed on 9.0% of individual defendants and on&para;<br>70.6% of organizational defendants in the federal system.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>onerous than incarceration and the death sentence. The&para;<br>Government notes that Apprendi itself referred to the&para;<br>physical deprivation of liberty that imprisonment occasions, see 530 U. S., at 484, and that we have placed more&para;<br>weight on imprisonment than on fines when construing&para;<br>the scope of the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and&para;<br>jury trial. See Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538,&para;<br>542–543 (1989) (jury trial); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367,&para;<br>373–374 (1979) (counsel). Therefore, the Government&para;<br>concludes, fines categorically “do not implicate” the “primary concerns motivating Apprendi.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 23–25.&para;<br>This argument fails because its conclusion does not follow from its premise. Where a fine is so insubstantial that&para;<br>the underlying offense is considered “petty,” the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right of jury trial is not triggered, and no&para;<br>Apprendi issue arises. See, e.g., Muniz v. Hoffman, 422&para;<br>U. S. 454, 477 (1975) ($10,000 fine imposed on labor union&para;<br>does not entitle union to jury trial); see also Blanton,&para;<br>489 U. S., at 541 (no jury trial right for “petty” offenses,&para;<br>as measured by the “severity of the maximum authorized&para;<br>penalty” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The same,&para;<br>of course, is true of offenses punishable by relatively brief&para;<br>terms of imprisonment—these, too, do not entitle a defendant to a jury trial. See id., at 543 (establishing a&para;<br>rebuttable presumption that offenses punishable by six&para;<br>months’ imprisonment or less are petty); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159–162 (1968).&para;<br>But not all fines are insubstantial, and not all offenses&para;<br>punishable by fines are petty. See, e.g., Mine Workers v.&para;<br>Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 838, n. 5 (1994) (criminal contempt&para;<br>fine of $52 million imposed on union “unquestionably is&para;<br>a serious contempt sanction” that triggers right of jury&para;<br>trial). The federal twice-the-gain-or-loss statute, in particular, see 18 U. S. C. §3571(d), has been used to obtain&para;<br>substantial judgments against organizational defendants.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>See, e.g., Amended Judgment in United States v. LG Display Co., Ltd., No. 08–CR–803–SI (ND Cal.), pp. 1–2 ($400&para;<br>million fine for conviction of single count of violating&para;<br>Sherman Antitrust Act); Judgment in United States v.&para;<br>Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, No. 08–CR–367–RJL (D DC),&para;<br>pp. 1–2, 5 ($448.5 million fine for two violations of Foreign&para;<br>Corrupt Practices Act); United States Sentencing Commission, 2010 Annual Report, ch. 5, p. 38 (noting fine of&para;<br>$1.195 billion imposed on pharmaceutical corporation for&para;<br>violations of food and drug laws). And, where the defendant is an individual, a large fine may “engender ‘a significant infringement of personal freedom.’ ” Blanton, 489&para;<br>U. S., at 542 (quoting Frank v. United States, 395 U. S.&para;<br>147, 151 (1969)); see also 18 U. S. C. §3572(a)(2) (requiring&para;<br>court to consider “the burden that the fine will impose&para;<br>upon the defendant” in determining whether to impose a&para;<br>fine and in what amount).&para;<br>The Government thus asks the wrong question by comparing the severity of criminal fines to that of other punishments. So far as Apprendi is concerned, the relevant&para;<br>question is the significance of the fine from the perspective&para;<br>of the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee. Where a&para;<br>fine is substantial enough to trigger that right, Apprendi&para;<br>applies in full. As we said in Cunningham, “Asking&para;<br>whether a defendant’s basic jury-trial right is preserved,&para;<br>though some facts essential to punishment are reserved&para;<br>for determination by the judge, . . . is the very inquiry&para;<br>Apprendi’s ‘bright-line rule’ was designed to exclude.” 549&para;<br>U. S., at 291.&para;<br>This case is exemplary. The RCRA subjects Southern&para;<br>Union to a maximum fine of $50,000 for each day of&para;<br>violation. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d). The Government does not&para;<br>deny that, in light of the seriousness of that punishment,&para;<br>the company was properly accorded a jury trial. And the&para;<br>Government now concedes the District Court made factual&para;<br>findings that increased both the “potential and actual” fine&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the court imposed. Brief for United States 28. This is&para;<br>exactly what Apprendi guards against: judicial factfinding&para;<br>that enlarges the maximum punishment a defendant faces&para;<br>beyond what the jury’s verdict or the defendant’s admissions allow.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In concluding that the rule of Apprendi does not apply to&para;<br>criminal fines, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision&para;<br>in Ice. Ice addressed the question whether, when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses, Apprendi forbids&para;<br>judges to determine facts that authorize the imposition of&para;<br>consecutive sentences. 555 U.

We think the statement is at most ambiguous,&para;<br>and more likely refers to the routine practice of judges’ imposing fines&para;<br>from within a range authorized by jury-found facts. Such a practice&para;<br>poses no problem under Apprendi because the penalty does not exceed&para;<br>what the jury’s verdict permits. See 530 U. S., at 481.

To be sure, judges in the colonies and during the founding era “possessed a great deal&para;<br>of discretion” in determining whether to impose a fine&para;<br>and in what amount. Lillquist 640–641; see also Preyer&para;<br>350. Often, a fine’s range “was apparently without limit&para;<br>except insofar as it was within the expectation on the part&para;<br>of the court that it would be paid.” Ibid. For some other&para;<br>offenses, the maximum fine was capped by statute. See,&para;<br>e.g., id., at 333 (robbery, larceny, burglary, and other&para;<br>offenses punishable in Massachusetts Bay Colony “by&para;<br>fines of up to £5”); Act of Feb. 28, 1803, ch. 9, §7, 2 Stat.&para;<br>205 (any consul who gives a false certificate shall “forfeit&para;<br>and pay a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, at the&para;<br>discretion of the court”); K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of&para;<br>Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9&para;<br>(1998) (describing federal practice).&para;<br>The exercise of such sentencing discretion is fully consistent with Apprendi, which permits courts to impose&para;<br>“judgment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530&para;<br>U. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). Nor, a fortiori, could&para;<br>there be an Apprendi violation where no maximum is&para;<br>prescribed. Indeed, in surveying the historical record that&para;<br>formed the basis of our holding in Apprendi, we specifically considered the English practice with respect to fines,&para;<br>which, as was true of many colonial offenses, made sentencing largely “dependent upon judicial discretion.” See&para;<br>id., at 480, n. 7; see also Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.&para;<br>227, 244–245 (1999); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on&para;<br>the Laws of England 372–373 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone). And even then, as the dissent acknowledges, post,&para;<br>at 11–12 (opinion of BREYER, J.), there is authority suggesting that English juries were required to find facts that&para;<br>determined the authorized pecuniary punishment. See&para;<br>1 T.

See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 502, n. 2 (THOMAS, J., concurring).&para;<br>Our review of state and federal decisions discloses that the&para;<br>predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in&para;<br>the indictment and proved to the jury. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245, 247 (1804) (declining to&para;<br>award judgment of treble damages for all stolen items in&para;<br>larceny prosecution when indictment alleged value of only&para;<br>some of the items); Clark v.

See post, at 18–20. But this fact was not the basis of&para;<br>the decisions; rather, the courts required value to be alleged and proved&para;<br>to the jury because “the extent of the punishment . . . depend[s] upon&para;<br>the value of the property consumed or injured.” Ritchey, 7 Blackf.,&para;<br>at 169; see also, e.g., Clark, 2 Ill., at 120–121 (same). And as Bishop&para;<br>explained, this requirement of proof originated not from a unique feature of jury sentencing, but from longstanding common-law principles—a point to which the dissent notably does not respond. 1 J.&para;<br>Bishop, Criminal Procedure §§81, 540 (2d ed. 1872). See infra, at 12.&para;<br>Nor, for that matter, do larceny cases “presen[t] a special circumstance.” Post, at 20. Such decisions invoked the same reasoning as the&para;<br>other cases just mentioned. See, e.g., Hope, 50 Mass., at 137 (value&para;<br>must be proved because, among other things, “[o]ur statutes . . . prescribe the punishment for larceny . . . with reference to the value of the&para;<br>property stolen”); Goodrich, 46 N. H., at 188 (same). Bishop made this&para;<br>point explicit: “[Value] must be alleged wherever it is an element to&para;<br>be considered by the court in determining the punishment, and it is&para;<br>immaterial whether the particular crime is larceny or any other crime.”&para;<br>Criminal Procedure §541, at 331 (footnote omitted and emphasis&para;<br>added). At the end of the day, the only evidence the dissent musters&para;<br>that judges found fine-enhancing facts are United States v. Tyler, 7&para;<br>Cranch 285 (1812), and one lower-court decision restating Tyler’s&para;<br>holding. See post, at 15–17. We address Tyler below. See infra, at&para;<br>13–14.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fine’s maximum amount is an application of the “two&para;<br>longstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence” on which Apprendi is based: First, “the ‘truth of&para;<br>every accusation’ against a defendant ‘should afterwards&para;<br>be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his&para;<br>equals and neighbours.’ ” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301 (quoting 4 Blackstone 343). And second, “ ‘an accusation which&para;<br>lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to&para;<br>the punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and it is no accusation in reason.’ ” 542 U. S., at 301–302 (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure §87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872)). Indeed, Bishop’s&para;<br>leading treatise on criminal procedure specifically identified cases involving fines as evidence of the proposition&para;<br>that “the indictment must, in order to inform the court&para;<br>what punishment to inflict, contain an averment of every&para;<br>particular thing which enters into the punishment.” Id.,&para;<br>§540, at 330 (discussing Clark and Garner). This principle, Bishop explained, “pervades the entire system of the&para;<br>adjudged law of criminal procedure. It is not made apparent to our understandings by a single case only, but by&para;<br>all the cases.” Criminal Procedure §81, at 51. See also Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 510–511 (THOMAS, J., concurring)&para;<br>(explaining that Bishop grounded this principle in “wellestablished common-law practice . . . and in the provisions&para;<br>of Federal and State Constitutions guaranteeing notice of&para;<br>an accusation in all criminal cases, indictment by a grand&para;<br>jury for serious crimes, and trial by jury”).&para;<br>As counterevidence that juries historically did not determine facts relevant to criminal fines, the Government&para;<br>points to two decisions from this Court. One is United&para;<br>States v. Murphy, 16 Pet. 203 (1842), which considered&para;<br>whether an interested witness was competent to testify in&para;<br>a larceny prosecution brought under a provision of the&para;<br>Crimes Act of 1790. Murphy’s only relevance to this case&para;<br>is that the Crimes Act authorized a fine of up to four times&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the value of the stolen property, and the Court remarked&para;<br>that “the fine is, as to its amount, purely in the discretion&para;<br>of the Court.” Id., at 209. But this statement is best&para;<br>read as permitting the court to select a fine from within&para;<br>the maximum authorized by jury-found facts—a practice,&para;<br>as noted, that accords with Apprendi. Such a reading is&para;<br>consistent with the fact that the indictment in Murphy&para;<br>alleged the value of the stolen items, see 16 Pet., at 207–&para;<br>208, and with the practice of contemporary courts addressing the same statute, see United States v. Holland, 26&para;<br>F. Cas. 343, 345 (No. 15,378) (CC SDNY 1843) (trial court&para;<br>instructs jury “to assess the value of the property taken”&para;<br>in order to determine maximum fine); Pye v. United&para;<br>States, 20 F. Cas. 99 (No. 11,488) (CC DC 1842) (value of&para;<br>stolen items alleged in indictment).&para;<br>The Government and dissent place greater reliance on&para;<br>United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812). But like&para;<br>Murphy, this decision involved no constitutional question.&para;<br>Rather, it construed a federal embargo statute that imposed a fine of four times the value of the property intended&para;<br>to be exported. The indictment identified the property at&para;<br>issue as “pearl-ashes,” but the jury’s guilty verdict referred instead to “ ‘pot-ashes [that] were worth two hundred and eighty dollars.’ ” Tyler, 7 Cranch, at 285.7 The&para;<br>question was whether the discrepancy rendered the verdict “not sufficiently certain as to the value of the property&para;<br>charged in the indictment,” i.e., pearl-ashes. Ibid. The&para;<br>Court held that the discrepancy was immaterial, on the&para;<br>ground that “under this law, no valuation by the jury was&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We will not keep the reader in suspense: pot-ash and pearl-ash are&para;<br>alkaline salts of differing causticity that “for a long time . . .

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>necessary to enable the Circuit Court to impose the proper&para;<br>fine.” Ibid. The Court’s reasoning is somewhat opaque,&para;<br>but appears to rest on the text of the embargo statute,&para;<br>which directed that the defendant “shall, upon conviction,&para;<br>be . . . fined a sum by the Court.” Ibid. In any event,&para;<br>nothing in the decision purports to construe the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment. And, insofar as Tyler reflects prevailing&para;<br>practice, it bears noting that both the indictment and verdict identified the value of the property at issue. See&para;<br>Tr. 2 in Tyler, 7 Cranch 285, reprinted in Appellate Case&para;<br>Files of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1792–&para;<br>1831, National Archives Microfilm Publications No. 214&para;<br>(1962), roll 18 (indictment: “nineteen barrels of pearlashes,&para;<br>which were then and there of the value of six hundred&para;<br>dollars”). Whatever the precise meaning of this decision,&para;<br>it does not outweigh the ample historical evidence showing&para;<br>that juries routinely found facts that set the maximum&para;<br>amounts of fines.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the&para;<br>dissent (see post, at 23–28), are unpersuasive. The Government first submits that, when it comes to fines, “the&para;<br>judicially found facts typically involve only quantifying&para;<br>the harm caused by the defendant’s offense”—for example,&para;<br>how long did the violation last, or how much money did the&para;<br>defendant gain (or the victim lose)?—“as opposed to defining a separate set of acts for punishment.” Brief for&para;<br>United States 25. Only the latter determination, the&para;<br>Government contends, implicates Apprendi’s concerns.&para;<br>This argument has two defects. First, it rests on an&para;<br>assumption that Apprendi and its progeny have uniformly&para;<br>rejected: that in determining the maximum punishment&para;<br>for an offense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact that is an “element” of the offense and&para;<br>one that is a “sentencing factor.” See, e.g., 530 U. S., at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>478; Ring, 536 U. S., at 605. Second, we doubt the coherence of this distinction. This case proves the point. Under&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §6928(d), the fact that will ultimately determine the maximum fine Southern Union faces is the number of days the company violated the statute. Such a&para;<br>finding is not fairly characterized as merely “quantifying&para;<br>the harm” Southern Union caused. Rather, it is a determination that for each given day, the Government has&para;<br>proved that Southern Union committed all of the acts&para;<br>constituting the offense.&para;<br>The Government next contends that applying Apprendi&para;<br>to fines will prevent States and the Federal Government&para;<br>from enacting statutes that, like §6928(d), calibrate fines&para;<br>to a defendant’s culpability, thus providing just punishment and reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity.&para;<br>But the Government presents a false choice. As was true&para;<br>in our prior Apprendi cases, and remains so here, legislatures are free to enact statutes that constrain judges’&para;<br>discretion in sentencing—Apprendi requires only that&para;<br>such provisions be administered in conformance with the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>Last, the Government argues that requiring juries to&para;<br>determine facts related to fines will cause confusion (because expert testimony might be needed to guide the&para;<br>inquiry); or prejudice the defendant (who might have to&para;<br>deny violating a statute while simultaneously arguing&para;<br>that any violation was minimal); or be impractical (at&para;<br>least when the relevant facts are unknown or unknowable&para;<br>until the trial is completed).8 These arguments rehearse&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 In this vein, the dissent speculates that today’s decision may&para;<br>“nudg[e] our [criminal justice] system” further in favor of plea bargains&para;<br>at the expense of jury trials. Post, at 28. But groups representing the&para;<br>interests of defendants—whom the dissent’s rule purportedly favors—&para;<br>tell us the opposite is true.

The statute that cre­&para;<br>ates the crime in question typically sets forth those con­&para;<br>stituent parts. And a jury must find the existence of&para;<br>each such element “beyond a reasonable doubt.” See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re&para;<br>Winship, 397 U.

In that case, the jury can convict&para;<br>only if it finds the existence of each of these four factual&para;<br>“elements” beyond a reasonable doubt.

S. 224, 239–247 (1998) (constitu­&para;<br>tional inquiry).&para;<br>The dispute in Apprendi and its line of cases arose after&para;<br>Congress and many States codified these sentencing facts&para;<br>during the sentencing reform movement of the 1970’s and&para;<br>1980’s. Congress, for example, concluded that too many&para;<br>different judges were imposing too many different sen­&para;<br>tences upon too many similar offenders who had committed similar crimes in similar ways. It subsequently&para;<br>enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, creating a&para;<br>federal Sentencing Commission which would produce greater&para;<br>uniformity in sentencing through the promulgation of&para;<br>mandatory uniform Guidelines structuring how judges, in&para;<br>ordinary cases, should typically use sentencing facts to&para;<br>determine sentences. 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994 (2006 ed. and&para;<br>Supp. IV); see also 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e). The&para;<br>Apprendi-line majority agreed that, where a statute set a&para;<br>higher maximum sentence, a Commission might structure&para;<br>how a judge found sentencing facts relevant to the sen­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tence imposed below that otherwise applicable maximum,&para;<br>at least if the resulting guidelines were not mandatory.&para;<br>See Booker, 543 U. S., at 245. But the majority held that&para;<br>where a sentencing fact increased the otherwise applicable&para;<br>maximum penalty, that fact had to be found by a jury.&para;<br>Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490.&para;<br>As I have said, the dissenters thought that the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment did not require a jury to find any of these&para;<br>sentencing facts. Why, asked the dissenters, should Con­&para;<br>gress’ or a State’s desire for greater sentencing uniformity&para;<br>achieved through statutes seeking more uniform treat­&para;<br>ment (of similar offenders committing similar offenses in&para;<br>similar ways) suddenly produce new Sixth Amendment&para;<br>jury trial requirements?&para;<br>Those requirements would work against greater sen­&para;<br>tencing fairness. To treat all sentencing facts (where so&para;<br>specified in a statute or rule) as if they were elements of&para;<br>the offense could lead Congress simply to set high maxi­&para;<br>mum ranges for each crime, thereby avoiding Apprendi’s jury trial requirement. Alternatively, Congress might&para;<br>enact statutes that more specifically tied particular pun­&para;<br>ishments to each crime (limiting or removing judicial&para;<br>discretion), for example, mandatory minimum statutes.&para;<br>But this system would threaten disproportionality by insisting that similar punishments be applied to very dif­&para;<br>ferent kinds of offense behavior or offenders. Apprendi’s&para;<br>jury trial requirements might also prove unworkable. Consider the difficulty of juries’ having to find the different facts in the bank robbery example I have set forth&para;<br>above. Moreover, how is a defendant, arguing that he did&para;<br>not have a gun, alternatively to argue that, in any event,&para;<br>he did not fire the gun?&para;<br>Finally, the dissenters took a different view of Sixth&para;<br>Amendment history. They believed that under the com­&para;<br>mon law and at the time the Constitution was ratified,&para;<br>judges, not juries, often found sentencing facts, i.e., facts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant only to the determination of the offender’s pun­&para;<br>ishment. See, e.g., Booker, supra, at 329 (BREYER, J.,&para;<br>dissenting in part); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 527–529&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., dissenting).&para;<br>The dissenters lost the argument. The Court in Apprendi held that (other than the fact of a prior conviction)&para;<br>“any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the&para;<br>prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a&para;<br>jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 490.&para;<br>But the dissenters’ views help to explain why I continue to&para;<br>believe this Court should not extend Apprendi’s rule be­&para;<br>yond “ ‘the central sphere of [its] concern.’ ” Ice, 555 U. S.,&para;<br>at 172 (quoting Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270,&para;<br>295 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)). That is the Court’s&para;<br>view, too, as set forth in Ice. And I base my dissent here&para;<br>primarily upon Ice.&para;<br>II&para;<br>This case involves sentencing facts, not elements of a&para;<br>crime. The criminal statute at issue constitutes one part&para;<br>of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976&para;<br>(RCRA), which, among others things, authorizes the Envi­&para;<br>ronmental Protection Agency to create a list of hazardous&para;<br>wastes. 42 U. S. C. §6921. The criminal statute says:&para;<br>“Any person who . . . knowingly treats, stores, or dis­&para;<br>poses of any hazardous waste identified or listed un­&para;<br>der [RCRA] . . . without [an RCRA-authorized] permit&para;<br>. . . shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not&para;<br>more than $50,000 for each day of violation, or im­&para;<br>prisonment not to exceed . . . five years . . . , or both.”&para;<br>§6928(d)(2)(A).&para;<br>No one here denies that this statute creates a crime with&para;<br>four elements: (1) knowing treatment, storage, or disposal&para;<br>of a waste (2) that is hazardous, (3) without a permit, and&para;<br>(4) knowing that the waste has a substantial potential of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>causing harm to others or to the environment. App. 129–&para;<br>130; see Brief for Petitioner 30.&para;<br>The number of “day[s] of each violation,” however, is not&para;<br>an additional element of the crime. The statute says that&para;<br>the number of days becomes relevant only “upon convic­&para;<br>tion” of the crime as previously defined. Moreover, the&para;<br>number of days is relevant to application of only one of&para;<br>two kinds of punishment that the statute mentions (fine&para;<br>and imprisonment); one cannot easily read this statute as&para;<br>creating two separate crimes identical but for the punish­&para;<br>ment. Finally, Congress did not include here, as it some­&para;<br>times has done, statutory words such as “each day of&para;<br>violation shall constitute a separate offense.” E.g., 47&para;<br>U. S. C. §223(b); see also 42 U. S. C. §4910(b). Rather, as&para;<br>in many other similar statutes, the statute here sets forth&para;<br>the crime and kinds of punishments (fine and imprison­&para;<br>ment), while separately specifying facts that determine&para;<br>the maximum punishment of one kind (fines).&para;<br>In this particular case, the indictment set forth a viola­&para;<br>tion period of 762 days (from “on or about September 19,&para;<br>2002 until on or about October 19, 2004”). App. 104. The&para;<br>jury’s guilty verdict did not specify the number of days on&para;<br>which the defendant committed the offense. Id., at 141.&para;<br>But after the conviction and sentencing hearing, the judge&para;<br>found that, among other things, the “clear and essentially&para;<br>irrefutable evidence” at trial supported the conclusion set&para;<br>forth in the presentence report, namely, that the maxi­&para;<br>mum fine available amounted to $50,000 per day for 762&para;<br>days—or $38.1 million. App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a–48a.&para;<br>The judge imposed a fine of $6 million along with a $12&para;<br>million community service obligation. App. 162–163.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Apprendi says that “any fact that increases the penalty&para;<br>for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum&para;<br>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reason­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>able doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490. The number of days (be­&para;<br>yond one) on which the defendant violated this criminal&para;<br>statute is such a fact. Nonetheless, like the majority, I&para;<br>believe that Apprendi’s rule does not automatically control&para;<br>the outcome in this case.&para;<br>That is because this case concerns a fine, not, as in&para;<br>Apprendi, a term of imprisonment. And we made clear in&para;<br>Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, that Apprendi does not en­&para;<br>compass every kind of fact-related sentencing decision&para;<br>that increases the statutory maximum. In Ice, we consid­&para;<br>ered Apprendi’s application to a sentencing decision about&para;<br>whether two prison sentences for conviction of two sepa­&para;<br>rate crimes (e.g., illegal drug possession and illegal gun&para;<br>possession) would run concurrently or consecutively. 555&para;<br>U. S., at 163. An Oregon statute required a concurrent&para;<br>sentence unless the sentencing judge found certain facts.&para;<br>Id., at 165. Those facts could make a large difference in a&para;<br>term of imprisonment. Their presence could mean that a&para;<br>5-year sentence for illegal drug possession and a 5-year&para;<br>sentence for illegal gun possession would amount to 10&para;<br>years of imprisonment rather than 5 (indeed, in Ice itself,&para;<br>the judge’s factfinding increased the sentence by 20 years,&para;<br>see id., at 166, and n. 5). Thus, the presence of those&para;<br>“fact[s]” could “increas[e] the penalty” beyond what would&para;<br>otherwise be “the prescribed statutory maximum.” Id., at&para;<br>167 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, we&para;<br>held that the Sixth Amendment permitted a judge—it did&para;<br>not require a jury—to make that factual determination.&para;<br>Id., at 164.&para;<br>We consequently concluded that Apprendi does not&para;<br>encompass every kind of fact-related sentencing decision&para;<br>that increases the statutory maximum. In doing so, we&para;<br>wrote that the “animating principle” of Apprendi’s rule&para;<br>“is the preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for&para;<br>an alleged offense.” 555 U. S., at 168. And we refused&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to extend Apprendi’s rule to a new category of sentence­&para;<br>related facts for two basic reasons.&para;<br>First, we considered a historical question, namely,&para;<br>whether “the finding of a particular fact was understood&para;<br>as within ‘the domain of the jury . . . by those who framed&para;<br>the Bill of Rights.’ ” 555 U. S., at 168 (quoting Harris, 536&para;<br>U. S., at 557). And we read the “historical record” as&para;<br>showing that “in England before the founding of our Na­&para;<br>tion, and in the early American States,” the jury “played&para;<br>no role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively&para;<br>or concurrently.” 555 U. S., at 168–169 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>Rather, that decision “rested exclusively with the judge.”&para;<br>Id., at 168.&para;<br>Second, recognizing that “administration of a discrete&para;<br>criminal justice system is among the [States’] basic sover­&para;<br>eign prerogatives,” we considered the need to “respect . . .&para;<br>state sovereignty.” Ibid. We expressed concern lest appli­&para;<br>cation of Apprendi to this kind of decision inhibit state&para;<br>legislative efforts to establish a fairer sentencing system&para;<br>by helping to bring about more uniform sentencing. Ice,&para;<br>555 U. S., at 171. We concluded that “[n]either Apprendi&para;<br>nor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacket­&para;<br>ing the States” in this respect. Ibid.&para;<br>This case presents another new category of fact-related&para;<br>sentencing decisions, namely, decisions about the amount&para;<br>of a fine. Thus, as the majority recognizes, we must begin with a historical question. Ante, at 8. Who—judge or&para;<br>jury—found the facts that determine the amount of a&para;<br>criminal fine “in England before the founding of our&para;<br>Nation, and in the early American States?” Ice, supra, at&para;<br>169 (footnote omitted). Unlike the majority, I believe&para;<br>the answer to this question is that, in most instances, the&para;<br>judge made that determination.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Apprendi relied heavily upon the fact that in “England&para;<br>before the founding of our Nation” the prescribed punish­&para;<br>ment for more serious crimes, i.e., felonies, was typically&para;<br>fixed—indeed, fixed at death. 530 U. S., at 478–480; see J.&para;<br>Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 512 (4th&para;<br>ed. 2007); J. Beattie, Crime and the Courts in England,&para;<br>1660–1800, pp. 409, 450–451 (1986) (hereinafter Beattie);&para;<br>Langbein, The English Criminal Trial on the Eve of the&para;<br>French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France,&para;<br>Germany 1700–1900, pp. 13, 16, 36–37 (A. Schioppa ed.&para;<br>1987). The facts related to the application of that pun­&para;<br>ishment were typically elements of the crime. And the&para;<br>jury, not the judge, determined the existence of those&para;<br>facts. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws&para;<br>of England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also&para;<br>Baker, supra, at 512–518 (in practice, the jury or judge&para;<br>could ameliorate capital punishment through application&para;<br>of doctrines such as “pious perjury,” “benefit of clergy,”&para;<br>and reprieves, or the King could grant a royal pardon);&para;<br>Beattie 419–435 (same).&para;<br>Punishment for lesser crimes, however, included fines.&para;<br>And under the common law, the judge, not the jury, de­&para;<br>termined the amount of the fine and the sentencing facts&para;<br>relevant to the setting of that amount. See Baker, supra,&para;<br>at 512; Beattie 459. Pertinent sentencing facts typically&para;<br>concerned the manner in which the offender committed&para;<br>the crime and the characteristics of that offender. See id.,&para;<br>at 456–460. Thus, in 1769, Blackstone wrote:&para;<br>“Our statute law has not therefore often ascertained&para;<br>the quantity of fines, nor the common law ever; it di­&para;<br>recting such an offense to be punished by fine, in gen­&para;<br>eral, without specifying the certain sum.” Blackstone&para;<br>372 (emphasis added).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>That is because&para;<br>“the quantum, in particular, of pecuniary fines neither&para;<br>can, nor ought to be, ascertained by any invariable&para;<br>law. The value of money itself changes from a thou­&para;<br>sand causes; and, at all events, what is ruin to one&para;<br>man’s fortune, may be a matter of indifference to an­&para;<br>other.” Id., at 371.&para;<br>Moreover, the “quantum” of pecuniary fines&para;<br>“must frequently vary, from aggravations or otherwise&para;<br>of the offense [i.e., the manner in which the crime was&para;<br>committed], the quality and conditions of the parties&para;<br>[e.g., the offender’s characteristics], and from innu­&para;<br>merable other circumstances.” Ibid.&para;<br>Similarly, the 18th-century statesman and treatise­&para;<br>writer Baron Auckland pointed out that in 10th-century&para;<br>England pre-Norman law had attached a fixed financial&para;<br>penalty to each specific crime. Principles of Penal Law 69&para;<br>(2d ed. 1771). That law, for example, imposed a penalty of&para;<br>3 cows for perjury and 12 cows for the rape of a maid.&para;<br>Ibid. This system, Baron Auckland added, ignored varia­&para;<br>tions in, for example, the differing value of a fixed fine, say&para;<br>a cow, over time and among individuals; it also ignored&para;<br>the manner in which the offense was committed and the&para;<br>characteristics of the offender. Id., at 69–72. For those&para;<br>reasons, 18th-century English law ordinarily left “the&para;<br>quantum of the fine” to “the discretion of the Judges.” Id.,&para;<br>at 68 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>“[Because t]he enormity and tendency of the crime,&para;<br>the malice and wilfulness of the intention, the incon­&para;<br>siderateness and suddenness of the act, the age, facul­&para;<br>ties, and fortune of the offender, form a chain of&para;<br>complex questions; which can be resolved only by&para;<br>the evidence of each separate charge, and for which no&para;<br>human foresight can provide . . . then arises a neces­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sary appeal to the breast of the judge.” Id., at 72 (em­&para;<br>phasis added).&para;<br>The only generally applicable limitations on the judge,&para;<br>when imposing the fine, were those contained in the Eng­&para;<br>lish Bill of Rights and the Magna Carta. 1 W. &amp; M., ch. 2,&para;<br>§11, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 440 (forbidding “excessive&para;<br>Fines”); Magna Carta §20, 9 Hen. III, §14, in 1 Eng. Stat.&para;<br>at Large 5 (1225) (fine cannot deprive offender of means of&para;<br>livelihood); see Auckland, supra, at 73 (so interpreting&para;<br>Magna Carta); Blackstone 372–373 (same).&para;<br>To be sure, the jury, not the judge, would determine the&para;<br>facts that made up the elements of the crime, even though&para;<br>those elements might be relevant to whether a fine could&para;<br>apply and, if so, the amount of the fine imposed as well.&para;<br>The common law, for example, defined larceny as the theft&para;<br>of goods that had some intrinsic value and divided the&para;<br>offense into grand larceny, which was theft of goods val­&para;<br>ued at more than a shilling, and petit larceny, which was&para;<br>theft of goods worth less than a shilling. Blackstone 229–&para;<br>234; Langbein, supra, at 16–17; see also Beattie 424&para;<br>(whether “benefit of clergy” was available depended on&para;<br>value stolen). Consequently, the jury would determine the&para;<br>value of the goods in question. In doing so, the jury might&para;<br>“manipulate the sentence by valuing the goods at under a&para;<br>shilling and thereby spare the defendant the capital sanc­&para;<br>tion.” Lillquist, The Puzzling Return of Jury Sentencing:&para;<br>Misgivings About Apprendi, 82 N. C. L. Rev. 621, 636&para;<br>(2004). But otherwise “the jury could not influence what&para;<br>other penalties” like fines the defendant might face be­&para;<br>cause in “non-capital criminal cases” the amount of pun­&para;<br>ishment “was left solely in the hands of the justices.” Ibid.&para;<br>I cannot determine with any certainty the extent to&para;<br>which 18th-century law placed other relevant limitations&para;<br>upon the judges’ authority to determine fine-related sen­&para;<br>tencing facts. I have found an 1814 English treatise on&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>criminal pleading that says, unlike in cases “where to&para;<br>constitute the offence the value must [only] be of a certain&para;<br>amount,” in cases “where the offence, or its defined meas­&para;<br>ure of punishment, depends upon the quantity of that&para;<br>excess . . . a variance from the amount averred . . . will be&para;<br>fatal.” 1 T. Starkie, A Treatise on Criminal Pleading 187–&para;<br>188 (emphasis deleted). It then adds that “in the case of&para;<br>usury, where the judgment depends upon the quantum&para;<br>taken, the usurious contract must be averred according to&para;<br>the fact; and a variance from it, in evidence, would be&para;<br>fatal, because the penalty is apportioned to the value.”&para;<br>Id., at 188. And an 18th-century treatise says that it&para;<br>is questionable whether it is necessary “to set forth the&para;<br>Value of the Goods in an Indictment of Trespass for any&para;<br>other Purpose than to aggravate the Fine.” 2 W. Hawkins,&para;<br>A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25, §75, pp. 234–&para;<br>235 (3d ed. 1739) (emphasis added). One might read these&para;<br>statements as supporting the majority, for they might indicate that, where a statute sets forth facts that deter­&para;<br>mine a pecuniary penalty, then a jury, not judge, would&para;<br>determine those facts.&para;<br>But whether that is the correct reading is unclear. For&para;<br>one thing, prosecutions for economic crimes were usually&para;<br>brought by injured parties and the “fine” in such cases&para;<br>went in whole or in part to compensate that party for&para;<br>damages. See Beattie 35–36, 192. For example, immedi­&para;<br>ately following the sentence I have just quoted, Hawkins&para;<br>wrote that it is questionable whether it is necessary “to set&para;<br>forth the Value of the Goods . . . in an Indictment of Lar­&para;<br>ceny for any other Purpose than to sh[o]w that the Crime&para;<br>amounts to grand Larceny, and to ascertain the Goods,&para;<br>thereby the better to [e]ntitle the Prosecutor to a Restitution.” Hawkins, supra, at 234–235 (emphasis added;&para;<br>footnote omitted). Likewise, Blackstone dated English&para;<br>usury law back to a 1545 statute that provided as the&para;<br>penalty that the offending lender shall both “make f[i]ne&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>. . . at the King’s will and pleasure” and forfeit “treble&para;<br>value” of the money borrowed—with half to the King and&para;<br>the other half “to him or them that will sue for the same.”&para;<br>37 Hen. VIII, ch. 9, in 3 Stat. of Realm 997 (emphasis&para;<br>added); see Blackstone 156; see also M. Ord, An Essay&para;<br>on the Law of Usury 122–123 (3d ed. 1809) (treble-value&para;<br>forfeitures recovered through information qui tam but discretionary fines recovered through criminal indictment).&para;<br>Thus, the statutes at issue were what American courts&para;<br>would later call quasi-civil statutes—part civil, part crimi­&para;<br>nal; see also Beattie 457.&para;<br>Parliament consequently would have had a special rea­&para;<br>son for requiring jury determinations of the amount of&para;<br>the pecuniary penalty. And Parliament had the authority&para;<br>to depart from the common law and to insist that juries&para;<br>determine sentencing facts without establishing a generally&para;<br>applicable principle. The relevant question here is how&para;<br>often and for what purposes Parliament did so. Black­&para;<br>stone himself wrote that such statutes fixing fines in&para;<br>amounts were both in derogation of the common law and&para;<br>uncommon. Blackstone 372. Finally, no one here argues&para;<br>that we adopt the rule actually suggested by the treatises.&para;<br>That rule is not that sentencing is to be done according to&para;<br>value found by the jury but instead that a discrepancy&para;<br>between the value alleged and value found by the jury&para;<br>might render the entire case fatal. See Starkie, supra,&para;<br>at 188.&para;<br>Thus, I cannot place great weight upon these statutes.&para;<br>The parties did not refer to them in their briefs. And in&para;<br>any event, the historical sources taken together make&para;<br>clear that the predominant practice in 18th-century Eng­&para;<br>land was for a judge, not a jury, to find sentencing facts&para;<br>related to the imposition of a fine.&para;<br>Indeed, the Court in Apprendi conceded the point. It&para;<br>distinguished 18th-century punishments for greater&para;<br>crimes (fixed punishments) from punishments for lesser&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>crimes (included fines). 530 U. S., at 480, n. 7. And it&para;<br>wrote that “judges most commonly imposed discretionary&para;<br>‘sentences’ of fines . . . upon misdemeanants.” Ibid. (em­&para;<br>phasis added). Insofar as 18th-century English practice&para;<br>helps determine what the Framers would have thought&para;<br>about the scope of the Constitution’s terms—here, the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment’s right to trial by an impartial jury—&para;<br>that practice suggests they would not have expected that&para;<br>right to include determination of sentencing facts relevant&para;<br>only to the imposition of a fine.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Practice in the “early American States” is even less ambiguous. In the colonial era, judges would normally&para;<br>determine the amount of a fine (within an unlimited or&para;<br>otherwise broad range) while also determining related&para;<br>sentencing facts (say, about the manner in which the&para;<br>offender committed the crime and the offender’s character­&para;<br>istics). Legal historians tell us that in the American&para;<br>colonies a criminal fine was “overwhelmingly the most&para;<br>common of the non-capital punishments,” that in most&para;<br>instances the range of the fine was “apparently without&para;<br>limit except insofar as it was within the expectation of the&para;<br>court that it would be paid,” that the judge established the&para;<br>precise amount of the fine, and that the amount was “tai­&para;<br>lored individually to the particular case.” Preyer, Penal&para;<br>Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am.&para;<br>J. Legal Hist. 326, 350 (1982). “[C]olonial judges, like&para;<br>their English brethren, possessed a great deal of discre­&para;<br>tion” and could set the amount of fine “depending upon&para;<br>the nature of the defendant and the crime.” Lillquist, 82&para;<br>N. C. L. Rev., at 640–641.&para;<br>Enactment of the Constitution and Bill of Rights did not&para;<br>change this practice. Some early American statutes speci­&para;<br>fied that the judge has discretion to set the amount of the&para;<br>fine while saying nothing about amount. E.g., Crimes Act&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of 1790, ch. 9, §21, 1 Stat. 117 (any person who bribes a&para;<br>judge “on conviction thereof shall be fined and imprisoned&para;<br>at the discretion of the court”); §28, 1 Stat. 118 (any per­&para;<br>son who does violence to an ambassador or public minister, “on conviction, shall be imprisoned not exceeding&para;<br>three years, and fined at the discretion of the court”).&para;<br>Others set only a maximum limitation. E.g., Act of Mar. 3,&para;<br>1791, ch. 15, §39, 1 Stat. 208 (officer of inspection convicted of oppression or extortion “shall be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding six&para;<br>months, or both, at the discretion of the court”). In respect&para;<br>to these statutes, Justice Iredell wrote in 1795 that the&para;<br>“common law practice . . . must be adhered to; that is to&para;<br>say, the jury are to find whether the prisoner be guilty,&para;<br>and . . . the court must assess the fine.” United States v.&para;<br>Mundell, 27 F. Cas. 23, 24 (No. 15,834) (CC Va.).&para;<br>Still other statutes, as in England, specifically keyed the&para;<br>amount of the fine to a specific factual finding. A section&para;<br>of the Crimes Act of 1790, for example, said that any&para;<br>person who upon United States property or the high seas&para;<br>“shall take and carry away, with an intent to steal or&para;<br>purloin the personal goods of another . . . shall, on convic­&para;<br>tion, be fined not exceeding the fourfold value of the prop­&para;<br>erty so stolen.” §16, 1 Stat. 116. This crime has several&para;<br>elements: (1) taking and (2) carrying away (3) with intent&para;<br>to steal (4) personal goods (5) belonging to another (6) on&para;<br>United States property or the high seas. The jury must&para;<br>find the existence of these facts beyond a reasonable doubt&para;<br>to establish a conviction. But the statute also says that&para;<br>the fine cannot exceed “the fourfold value of the property&para;<br>so stolen.” And it thereby requires the finding of a sen­&para;<br>tencing fact, namely the value of the stolen property. Who&para;<br>would make this determination—judge or jury?&para;<br>Unlike in 18th-century England, in the United States&para;<br>there is case law directly answering the question. In&para;<br>United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812), this Court&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>considered a federal embargo statute making it a crime to&para;<br>“put” certain “goods” on board a ship with intent to “ex­&para;<br>port” them outside of the United States. See Act of Jan. 9,&para;<br>1809, ch. 5, §1, 2 Stat. 506. The statute also provided&para;<br>that an offender’s “goods” and ship “shall be forfeited,” and&para;<br>the offender, “shall, upon conviction,” be “fined a sum, by&para;<br>the court before which the conviction is had, equal to four&para;<br>times the value of such specie, goods, wares and merchan­&para;<br>dise.” Ibid. The statute thereby required determination of&para;<br>a sentencing fact, namely “the value of such . . . goods.”&para;<br>Was the finding of this sentencing fact for the judge or for&para;<br>the jury?&para;<br>In Tyler, the defendant had been indicted for attempting&para;<br>to export 19 barrels of pearl-ashes, valued at $600. Ante,&para;<br>at 13–14. The jury convicted the defendant, but when&para;<br>doing so, it said that it found the defendant guilty of hav­&para;<br>ing tried to export “ ‘pot-ashes . . . worth two hundred and&para;<br>eighty dollars.’ ” 7 Cranch, at 285 (emphasis deleted). The&para;<br>defendant appealed, claiming a difference between the&para;<br>jury’s basis for conviction and the crime as charged in the&para;<br>indictment. The difference between the words “pearl­&para;<br>ashes” and “pot-ashes” is unlikely to have mattered, for&para;<br>pearl-ash is simply a refined grade of pot-ash (potassium&para;<br>carbonate). See T. Barker, R. Dickinson, &amp; D. Hardie,&para;<br>Origins of the Synthetic Alkali Industry in Britain, 23&para;<br>Economica 158, 163 (1956). Thus, the defendant did not&para;<br>focus upon that difference. Rather, he claimed that the&para;<br>jury’s verdict “was not sufficiently certain as to the value&para;<br>of the property charged in the indictment.” Tyler, 7&para;<br>Cranch, at 285 (emphasis added). Because $280 differs&para;<br>from $600, the jury had not found him guilty of the crime&para;<br>charged.&para;<br>The Supreme Court, however, found that the jury’s&para;<br>finding as to valuation was not relevant. It upheld the&para;<br>conviction because it was “of the opinion that, under this&para;<br>law, no valuation by the jury was necessary to enable the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Circuit Court to impose the proper fine.” Ibid. (emphasis&para;<br>added). The Court did not say explicitly that the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment permitted the judge to find the relevant sen­&para;<br>tencing fact. See ante, at 14. But it seems unlikely&para;<br>that a Court that included Chief Justice John Marshall,&para;<br>Justice Joseph Story, and others familiar with both the&para;<br>common law and the Constitution would have interpreted&para;<br>a federal statute as they did if either contemporary legal&para;<br>practice or the Constitution suggested or required a differ­&para;<br>ent interpretation.&para;<br>Nor can we say that the Court did not fully consider the&para;<br>matter. Justice Story later authoritatively interpreted&para;<br>Tyler. Sitting as a Circuit Justice in United States v.&para;<br>Mann, 26 F. Cas. 1153 (No. 15,717) (CCNH 1812), he&para;<br>considered the same judge/jury question in respect to the&para;<br>same embargo statute. His court wrote that in “Tyler, 7&para;<br>Cranch 285, in a prosecution on this same clause, the court&para;<br>held that the fine and quadruple value must be assessed&para;<br>and adjudged by the court, and not by the jury.” Id., at&para;<br>1153 (emphasis added); see also 26 F. Cas. 1153, 1155&para;<br>(No. 15,718) (CCNH 1812) (Story, J.) (noting that the Supreme Court would not have reached its result unless&para;<br>satisfied “that the fine was to be imposed by the court, and&para;<br>not found by the jury”).&para;<br>Thus, nothing in early American practice suggests that&para;<br>the Framers thought that the Sixth Amendment jury trial&para;<br>right encompassed a right to have a jury determine fine­&para;<br>related sentencing facts. But, to the contrary, there is a&para;<br>Supreme Court opinion, namely Tyler, that holds, or at&para;<br>least strongly indicates, the opposite.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority reaches a different conclusion. But the&para;<br>majority does not pose what I believe to be the relevant&para;<br>historical question, namely whether traditionally “in&para;<br>England before the founding of our Nation, and in the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>early American States,” see Ice, 555 U. S., at 169 (footnote&para;<br>omitted), judges, not juries, normally determined fine­&para;<br>related sentencing facts. Instead, it asks whether a jury,&para;<br>rather than the judge, found those facts in that subclass of&para;<br>cases where a statute “peg[ged] the amount of a fine to the&para;<br>determination of specified facts.” Ante, at 10. It concludes&para;<br>that “the predominant practice was for such facts to be&para;<br>alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.” Ibid.&para;<br>Putting the question this way invites a circular re­&para;<br>sponse. As is true of the English usury cases, nothing&para;<br>prohibits a legislature from requiring a jury to find a&para;<br>sentencing fact in a particular subset of cases. And obvi­&para;<br>ously when a State does so, the jury will indeed have to&para;<br>find those facts. Thus, if, say, 10 States decide to make&para;<br>juries find facts that will set the fine for, say, simple lar­&para;<br>ceny, then jury practice in those States (during, say, the&para;<br>19th century) will include the jury’s finding of those sen­&para;<br>tencing facts. But that circumstance tells us only that in&para;<br>those 10 States for those specific statutes the legislatures&para;<br>so required. It tells us little, if anything, about practices&para;<br>in most States, and it tells us nothing at all about tradi­&para;<br>tional practice in England or 18th-century America. Nor&para;<br>does a discovery that, say, 10 state legislatures once re­&para;<br>quired juries, rather than judges, generally to set fines tell&para;<br>us about the scope of the Sixth Amendment’s constitutional right to trial by jury. The matter is important because the majority rests its conclusion almost exclusively&para;<br>upon reports of mid-19th-century jury trials in a handful of&para;<br>States, namely Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,&para;<br>and New Hampshire, and a treatise that bases its state­&para;<br>ments upon those cases. Ante, at 10–12.&para;<br>Scholars tell us that in fact there were about 10&para;<br>States—including Alabama, Illinois, and Indiana—that&para;<br>(after ratification of the Sixth Amendment) enacted stat­&para;<br>utes that required juries, not judges, to determine a de­&para;<br>fendant’s punishment, including not only the length of a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>prison term but also the amount of a fine. See Iontcheva,&para;<br>Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice, 89 Va. L. Rev.&para;<br>311, 317 (2003); King, Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing&para;<br>in the United States 78 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 937, 963 (2003).&para;<br>The courts that considered this practice, however, did&para;<br>not believe that the constitutional right to jury trial com­&para;<br>pelled it.&para;<br>Alabama’s Supreme Court, for example, explained that&para;<br>its State’s jury-sentencing system, which allowed the jury&para;<br>“to determine both the fine and imprisonment,” was in&para;<br>derogation of, and created “an innovation upon[,] the rules&para;<br>of the common law, so far as it transfers [those] powers&para;<br>from the court to the jury.” Hawkins v. State, 3 Stew. &amp; P.&para;<br>63 (1832). Thus, in State v. Garner, 8 Port. 447 (1839), see&para;<br>ante, at 10, the malicious mischief statute at issue said&para;<br>that the offender would “ ‘be fined in such sum as the jury&para;<br>trying the same may assess, not exceeding four fold the&para;<br>value of the property injured or destroyed.’ ” 8 Port., at&para;<br>448 (emphasis added). The statute, in other words, trans­&para;<br>ferred all sentencing facts to the jury and was not illus­&para;<br>trative of 18th-century practice. Further, the statute said&para;<br>that the “ ‘fine shall be paid to the party injured.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>The court held that it was consequently proper to allege&para;<br>the amount of the property’s value in the indictment, not&para;<br>because the State’s constitution required any such thing,&para;<br>but because “the fine thus assesse[d] is for the benefit of&para;<br>the injured party”; the case “is, therefore, a quasi civil&para;<br>proceeding”; and for that reason “it would be more consonant to the rules of pleading, and to the principles&para;<br>which govern analogous cases, that the indictment should&para;<br>contain an averment of the value of the property.” Ibid.;&para;<br>Ord, Law of Usury, at 122–123 (usury as quasi-civil&para;<br>proceeding).&para;<br>Illinois law was similar.&para;<br>Illinois became a jury­&para;<br>sentencing State in 1831. See Iontcheva, supra, at 317,&para;<br>n. 28 (citing Act of Feb. 15, 1831, §42, 1830 Ill. Laws 103,&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>113). The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently wrote&para;<br>that, even though “at common law . . . juries . . . never&para;<br>were invested with the power of determining the character&para;<br>or extent of the punishment . . . , we are to be governed&para;<br>entirely the provisions and enactments of our code of&para;<br>criminal jurisprudence.” Blevings v. People, 1 Scam. 172&para;<br>(1835). And in Clark v. People, 1 Scam. 117 (1833), see&para;<br>ante, at 10, the court made clear that the arson statute at&para;<br>issue&para;<br>“ha[d] changed the common law, . . . [that the] fine&para;<br>equal in value to the property burne[d] is imposed as&para;<br>part of the punishment[; hence,] [t]he indictment . . .&para;<br>should have charged the value of the property de­&para;<br>stroyed, [for] otherwise it could not properly have&para;<br>been inquired into by the jury.” 1 Scam., at 117.&para;<br>Indiana was another jury-sentencing State. Iontcheva,&para;<br>supra, at 317, n. 28; King, supra, at 937. Indiana case law&para;<br>decided before Indiana changed its system indicates that&para;<br>the judge could decide certain facts required to set the&para;<br>applicable maximum fine. E.g., Morris v. State, 1 Blackf.&para;<br>37 (1819). But after Indiana became a jury-sentencing&para;<br>State, its courts held, not surprisingly, that under Indiana&para;<br>law the jury must determine sentencing facts. See Ritchey&para;<br>v. State, 7 Blackf. 168, 169 (1844); ante, at 10.&para;<br>Massachusetts presents a special circumstance. The&para;<br>two Massachusetts cases that the majority cites, ante, at&para;<br>10–11, are larceny cases. Value traditionally was an&para;<br>element of the crime of larceny—both because larceny was&para;<br>theft of goods that had some intrinsic value and because&para;<br>value distinguished grand larceny from petit larceny—and&para;<br>thus juries traditionally had to determine at least some&para;<br>facts about the value of the property stolen. See Black­&para;<br>stone 229, 234. Massachusetts had abolished the distinc­&para;<br>tion between grand and petit larceny before its courts&para;<br>decided the two cases the majority cites. See Common-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>wealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245, 246 (1804). But those deci­&para;<br>sions nonetheless rest in significant part upon the jury’s&para;<br>traditional larceny factfinding role. In Hope v. Commonwealth, 9 Metcalf 134 (1845), for example, the Massachu­&para;<br>setts Supreme Judicial Court wrote:&para;<br>“The well settled practice, familiar to us all, has been&para;<br>that of stating in the indictment the value of the arti­&para;<br>cle alleged to have been stolen. . . . The reason for re­&para;<br>quiring this allegation and finding of value may have&para;<br>been, originally, that a distinction might appear be­&para;<br>tween the offences of grand and petit larceny . . . . Our&para;<br>statutes . . . prescribe the punishment for larceny,&para;<br>with reference to the value of the property stolen; and&para;<br>for this reason, as well as because it is in conformity&para;<br>with long established practice, the court are of opinion&para;<br>that the value of the property alleged to be stolen&para;<br>must be set forth in the indictment.” Id., at 136–137.&para;<br>The “long established practice” to which the court refers is&para;<br>larceny case practice, not practice in all criminal cases.&para;<br>The New Hampshire case to which the majority refers,&para;<br>State v. Goodrich, 46 N. H. 186 (1865), ante, at 11, is also&para;<br>a larceny case that relied on the “established” larceny case&para;<br>practice. The court explained:&para;<br>“The indictment ought to state the value of the arti­&para;<br>cles stolen that it may appear whether the offence be&para;<br>grand or petit larceny, and such we believe is the set­&para;<br>tled practice. . . . It has been held in some jurisdic­&para;<br>tions, that, in case no value is alleged, the offence&para;<br>charged may be regarded as simple larceny, and a&para;<br>conviction be had accordingly . . . but we think it best&para;<br>to adhere to the well established doctrine in such&para;<br>cases . . . . It may also be suggested, that, in the case&para;<br>of simple larceny, the respondent may be sentenced&para;<br>to pay the owner of the goods stolen, treble the value&para;<br>thereof, which is an additional reason for requiring&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the character of the offence to be stated.” 46 N. H., at&para;<br>187–188.&para;<br>The court wrote nothing to suggest that its holding rested&para;<br>on generally applicable constitutional grounds. And it was&para;<br>in the New Hampshire federal circuit court a half-century&para;<br>earlier when Justice Story had indicated that the Federal&para;<br>Constitution did not impose any such requirement. See&para;<br>Mann, 26 F. Cas., at 1155 (No. 15,718).&para;<br>That leaves the majority’s puzzling 1895 Federal Dis­&para;<br>trict Court case from Kansas. United States v. Woodruff,&para;<br>68 F. 536 (D. Kan. 1895); ante, at 11. The circumstances&para;<br>of this case are highly unusual, and the District Court’s&para;<br>reasoning as to why no fine could be set seems to have&para;<br>rested on a combination of statutory construction and&para;<br>constitutional principle. See Woodruff v. United States, 58&para;<br>F. 766, 767–768 (CC Kan. 1893); Woodruff, 68 F., at 538–&para;<br>539. Still, I concede this case to the majority—as the lone&para;<br>swallow that cannot make the majority’s summer.&para;<br>Taken together, the 19th-century cases upon which the&para;<br>majority rests its holding do not show anything about&para;<br>practice in the vast majority of States. They concede that&para;<br>common-law practice was to the contrary. And they tell us&para;<br>little about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Even&para;<br>were that not so, I do not understand why these mid-19th­&para;<br>century cases should tell us more about the Constitution’s&para;<br>meaning than, say, the common 20th-century practice&para;<br>of leaving sentencing fact determinations to the judge.&para;<br>This Court apparently once approved the latter practice as&para;<br>constitutional. E.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.&para;<br>79 (1986); Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S. 224. And these&para;<br>cases seem more closely related to the present topic.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The upshot is that both 18th-century English common&para;<br>law and 18th-century American law typically provided&para;<br>judges with broad discretion to assess fines. The judge,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not the jury, would normally determine fine-related sen­&para;<br>tencing facts. In this respect, ordinary 18th-century sen­&para;<br>tencing practice related to fines was unlike sentencing&para;<br>practice in respect to felonies. In the latter case, in Apprendi’s view, punishment was normally “fixed” and the&para;<br>judge’s sentencing role was consequently minimal. 530&para;<br>U. S., at 478–480. In the former case, namely fines, the&para;<br>judge’s role was not normally minimal, but the opposite.&para;<br>For these reasons, I believe that allowing a judge to de­&para;<br>termine sentencing facts related to imposition of a fine&para;<br>does not invade the historic province of the jury. The&para;<br>historical test that we set forth in Ice is satisfied.&para;<br>V&para;<br>In Ice, we also took account of the practical extent&para;<br>to which extending Apprendi’s rule beyond the “ ‘central&para;<br>sphere of [its] concern’ ” would “diminish” the States’ “role”&para;<br>in “devising solutions to difficult legal problems . . . absent&para;<br>impelling reason to do so.” 555 U. S., at 171–172. In&para;<br>particular, we feared that insisting that juries determine&para;<br>the relevant sentencing facts (concerning concurrent, as&para;<br>opposed to consecutive, punishment) would unjustifiably&para;<br>interfere with a State’s legislative efforts “to rein in the&para;<br>discretion judges possessed at common law to impose&para;<br>consecutive sentences at will.” Id., at 171. It would inhibit (indeed “straightjacke[t]”) States seeking to make&para;<br>“concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences&para;<br>the exception.” Ibid. We said that we were “unclear how&para;<br>many other state initiatives would fall” if Apprendi were&para;<br>extended, and that expansion would be “difficult for&para;<br>States to administer.” Id., at 171–172. We believed that&para;<br>these considerations argued strongly against any such&para;<br>“expansion.”&para;<br>Here, the same kinds of considerations similarly argue&para;<br>against “expansion” of Apprendi’s rule. Today’s decision&para;<br>applies to the States. In the 1950’s and thereafter, States&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>as well as the Federal Government recognized a serious&para;<br>problem in respect to the sentencing of corporations.&para;<br>Fines, imposed as a punishment upon corporate offenders,&para;<br>were both nonuniform (treating identical offenders differ­&para;<br>ently) and too often they were set too low. Judges would&para;<br>frequently fine corporations in amounts that failed to&para;<br>approximate the harm a corporation had caused or the&para;<br>gain that it had obtained through its illegal activity, both&para;<br>because often the statutory maximums were low and because often the fines imposed tended to be substantially&para;<br>lower than those maximums. See Gruner, Towards an&para;<br>Organizational Jurisprudence: Transforming Corporate&para;<br>Criminal Law Through Federal Sentencing Reform, 36&para;<br>Ariz. L.

Q. 205, 215 (1993).&para;<br>Consequently, the authors of the Model Penal Code&para;<br>adopted a model provision stating that, in respect to of­&para;<br>fenses involving financial gain, a court could impose an&para;<br>alternative “higher” fine “equal to double the pecuniary&para;<br>gain derived from the offense by the offender.” Model&para;<br>Penal Code §6.03(5), 10A U. L. A. 259 (2001). New York&para;<br>soon thereafter adopted such a provision. N. Y. Penal Law&para;<br>Ann. §80.10(2)(b) (West 2009). And other States followed&para;<br>New York’s example with similar provisions permitting&para;<br>judges to set fines equal to twice the gain to the offender&para;<br>or twice the loss to the victim, thereby helping to diminish&para;<br>disparity while helping potential victims by increasing&para;<br>deterrence. E.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §53a–44 (West&para;<br>2007); Fla. Stat. §775.083(1)(f) (2010). Many of these&para;<br>statutes say in particular that the “court” shall make the&para;<br>finding of gain or loss, in a separate hearing if necessary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Ann. §2C:43–3(e) (West 2005).&para;<br>The Federal Government followed suit. In some in­&para;<br>stances, such as RCRA, where environmental harm likely&para;<br>varies with the length of the violation period, Congress&para;<br>advanced its uniformity and deterrence goals by tying a&para;<br>dollar-limited fine to the length of time during which that&para;<br>violation took place. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d)(2)(A). In other&para;<br>instances, it did so through a new general gain-or-loss&para;<br>provision, applying to all offenses, including such crimes&para;<br>as corporate fraud, antitrust violations, and environmen­&para;<br>tal pollution. That provision says:&para;<br>“ALTERNATIVE FINE BASED ON GAIN OR LOSS.—If any&para;<br>person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if&para;<br>the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other&para;<br>than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not&para;<br>more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice&para;<br>the gross loss, unless imposition of a fine under this&para;<br>subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the&para;<br>sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C. §3571(d).&para;<br>To apply Apprendi’s rule to the fines set forth in such&para;<br>statutes, no less than in Ice, would weaken or destroy the&para;<br>States’ and Federal Government’s efforts “to rein in the&para;<br>discretion judges possessed at common law,” Ice, 555 U. S.,&para;<br>at 171, over fines. Congress, in enacting such statutes,&para;<br>expected judges, not juries, to determine fine-related sen­&para;<br>tencing facts because doing so will often involve highly&para;<br>complex determinations. Where, say, major fraud is at&para;<br>issue, the full extent of the loss (or gain) may be unknown&para;<br>at the time of indictment or at any other time prior to the&para;<br>conclusion of the trial. And in an antitrust or an environ­&para;<br>mental pollution case, the jury may have particular diffi­&para;<br>culty assessing different estimates of resulting losses.&para;<br>The consequence of the majority’s holding, insisting that&para;<br>juries make such determinations, is likely to diminish the&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>fairness of the criminal trial process. A defendant will not&para;<br>find it easy to show the jury at trial that (1) he committed&para;<br>no environmental crime, but (2) in any event, he commit­&para;<br>ted the crime only on 20 days, not 30. Moreover, the&para;<br>majority’s holding will sometimes permit prosecutors to&para;<br>introduce newly relevant evidence that would otherwise&para;<br>have been kept from the jury on the ground that it was&para;<br>cumulative or unduly prejudicial. If victims’ losses are&para;<br>relevant, the prosecutor may be able to produce witness&para;<br>after witness testifying only about the amount of life&para;<br>savings lost to the fraud. The defendant in this case, for&para;<br>example, thought the introduction of evidence about the&para;<br>discovery of mercury and remediation and evacuation of a&para;<br>nearby apartment complex was unduly prejudicial. Brief&para;<br>for United States 51 (citing App. 15 (defendant’s motion in&para;<br>limine to exclude such evidence)). But even if that were&para;<br>so, that evidence might now be admitted as showing the&para;<br>amount of harm caused or the number of days upon which&para;<br>the defendant’s unlawful activity took place.&para;<br>Administrative problems here may prove more serious&para;<br>than where, as in Apprendi, prison terms were at stake.&para;<br>In part, that is because corporate criminal cases often&para;<br>focus upon complex frauds, criminal price fixing, extended&para;<br>environmental pollution, food-and-drug safety violations,&para;<br>and the like. Both Congress and the Sentencing Commis­&para;<br>sion have recognized as much. The federal criminal fine&para;<br>statute to which I earlier referred specifically creates an&para;<br>exception where assessing total loss or gain “would unduly&para;<br>complicate or prolong the sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3571(d). Similarly, Sentencing Guidelines applicable to&para;<br>corporations exclude fine provisions for environmental&para;<br>crimes (along with most crimes involving export viola­&para;<br>tions, food-and-drug safety, agricultural-and-consumer&para;<br>products, and RICO violations) because of the “potential&para;<br>difficulty . . . of defining and computing loss.” Nagel &amp;&para;<br>Swenson, supra, at 256; see USSG §8C2.1, and comment.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§8C2.10. Where the defendant is a human being, the&para;<br>Government can avoid problems of proof simply by aban­&para;<br>doning any effort to obtain a fine; instead, perhaps to the&para;<br>individual defendant’s dismay, the prosecution can seek&para;<br>a longer prison term. Where the criminal defendant is a&para;<br>corporation, however, no such possibility exists.&para;<br>If, as seems likely, it becomes too difficult to prove fine­&para;<br>related sentencing facts to a jury, legislatures will have&para;<br>to change their statutes. Some may choose to return to&para;<br>highly discretionary sentencing, with its related risks of&para;<br>nonuniformity. Others may link conviction with fines&para;<br>specified in amount, rather like the 10th-century preNorman system of three cows for perjury or more modern&para;<br>mandatory minimum penalties. As Blackstone pointed&para;<br>out, those systems produce sentences that are not propor­&para;<br>tionate; they tend to treat alike offenders who committed&para;<br>the same crime in very different ways. See 4 Blackstone&para;<br>371–372.&para;<br>The majority believes that 10 years of experience with&para;<br>Apprendi “attenuate[s]” any legal claim of reliance on&para;<br>different rule of constitutional law here. Ante, at 16.&para;<br>Perhaps so. Perhaps that experience shows that Apprendi’s jury trial requirement is workable. But there is an­&para;<br>other less optimistic possibility.&para;<br>Perhaps that experience, like the canary in a mine­&para;<br>shaft, tells us only that our criminal justice system is no&para;<br>longer the jury-trial-based adversarial system that it once&para;<br>was. We have noted that “[n]inety-seven percent of fed­&para;<br>eral convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions&para;<br>are the result of guilty pleas.” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). We have added that today&para;<br>“ ‘plea bargaining” is “not some adjunct to the criminal&para;<br>justice system; it is the criminal justice system.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting Scott &amp; Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract, 101&para;<br>Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992)). And in such a system, com­&para;<br>plex jury trial requirements may affect the strength of a&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>party’s bargaining position rather than the conduct of&para;<br>many actual trials.&para;<br>At the same time, the prosecutor in such a system,&para;<br>perhaps armed with statutes providing for mandatory&para;<br>minimum sentences, can become the ultimate adjudicator.&para;<br>The prosecutor/adjudicator plays an important role in&para;<br>many “European inquisitorial” systems. But those prose­&para;<br>cutors, unlike ours, typically are trained formally to be&para;<br>more like neutral adjudicators than advocates. Cf. Lang­&para;<br>bein &amp; Weinreb, Continental Criminal Procedure: “Myth”&para;<br>and Reality, 87 Yale L. J. 1549, 1559 (1978); see, e.g.,&para;<br>Ècole Nationale de la Magistrature. Today’s holding, by&para;<br>unnecessarily complicating the trial process, may prove&para;<br>workable only because it nudges our system slightly fur­&para;<br>ther in this direction. I see no virtue in doing so.&para;<br>For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
