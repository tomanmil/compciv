CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–974.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued February 22, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1995, respondent the City of Chicago gave a written examination to&para;<br>applicants seeking firefighter positions. In January 1996, the City&para;<br>announced it would draw candidates randomly from a list of appli&para;<br>cants who scored at least 89 out of 100 points on the examination,&para;<br>whom it designated as “well qualified.” It informed those who scored&para;<br>below 65 that they had failed and would not be considered further. It&para;<br>informed applicants who scored between 65 and 88, whom it desig&para;<br>nated as “qualified,” that it was unlikely they would be called for fur&para;<br>ther processing but that the City would keep them on the eligibility&para;<br>list for as long as that list was used. That May, the City selected its&para;<br>first class of applicants to advance, and it repeated this process mul&para;<br>tiple times over the next six years. Beginning in March 1997, several&para;<br>African-American applicants who scored in the “qualified” range but&para;<br>had not been hired filed discrimination charges with the Equal Em&para;<br>ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and received right-to-sue&para;<br>letters. They then filed suit, alleging (as relevant here) that the&para;<br>City’s practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above&para;<br>had a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII&para;<br>of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i).&para;<br>The District Court certified a class—petitioners here—of AfricanAmericans who scored in the “qualified” range but were not hired.&para;<br>The court denied the City’s summary judgment motion, rejecting its&para;<br>claim that petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300&para;<br>days “after the unlawful employment practice occurred,” §2000e–&para;<br>5(e)(1), and finding instead that the City’s “ongoing reliance” on the&para;<br>1995 test results constituted a continuing Title VII violation. The&para;<br>litigation then proceeded, and petitioners prevailed on the merits.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment in their favor, holding&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEWIS v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that the suit was untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was&para;<br>filed more than 300 days after the only discriminatory act—sorting&para;<br>the scores into the “well qualified,” “qualified,” and “not qualified”&para;<br>categories. The later hiring decisions, the Seventh Circuit held, were&para;<br>an automatic consequence of the test scores, not new discriminatory&para;<br>acts.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: A plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adop&para;<br>tion of a practice may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely&para;<br>charge challenging the employer’s later application of that practice as&para;<br>long as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate-impact claim.&para;<br>Pp. 4–11.&para;<br>(a) Determining whether petitioners’ charges were timely requires&para;<br>“identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment practice’ of which”&para;<br>they complain. Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257.&para;<br>With the exception of the first selection round, all agree that the chal&para;<br>lenged practice here—the City’s selection of firefighter hires on the&para;<br>basis announced in 1996—occurred within the charging period.&para;<br>Thus, the question is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct&para;<br>is timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a&para;<br>disparate-impact claim at all. It can. A Title VII plaintiff establishes&para;<br>a prima facie claim by showing that the employer “uses a particular&para;<br>employment practice that causes a disparate impact” on one of the&para;<br>prohibited bases. §2000e–2(k). The term “employment practice”&para;<br>clearly encompasses the conduct at issue: exclusion of passing appli&para;<br>cants who scored below 89 when selecting those who would advance.&para;<br>The City “use[d]” that practice each time it filled a new class of fire&para;<br>fighters, and petitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate im&para;<br>pact. It is irrelevant that subsection (k) does not address “accrual” of&para;<br>disparate-impact claims, since the issue here is not when the claims&para;<br>accrued but whether the claims stated a violation. They did.&para;<br>Whether petitioners proved a violation is not before the Court.&para;<br>Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) The City argues that the only actionable discrimination oc&para;<br>curred in 1996 when it used the test results to create the hiring list,&para;<br>which it concedes was unlawful. It may be true that the City’s adop&para;<br>tion in 1996 of the cutoff score gave rise to a freestanding disparate&para;<br>impact claim. If so, because no timely charge was filed, the City is&para;<br>now “entitled to treat that past act as lawful,” United Air Lines, Inc.&para;<br>v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558. But it does not follow that no new viola&para;<br>tion occurred—and no new claims could arise—when the City later&para;<br>implemented the 1996 decision. Evans and later cases the City cites&para;<br>establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola&para;<br>tion” within the limitations period. For disparate-treatment claims—&para;<br>which require discriminatory intent—the plaintiff must demonstrate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>deliberate discrimination within the limitations period. But no such&para;<br>demonstration is needed for claims, such as this one, that do not re&para;<br>quire discriminatory intent. Cf., e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp;&para;<br>Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 640. Contrary to the Seventh Circuit’s&para;<br>reasoning, even if both types of claims take aim at prohibited dis&para;<br>crimination, it does not follow that their reach is coextensive. Pp. 7–&para;<br>10.&para;<br>(c) The City and its amici warn that this reading will result in a&para;<br>host of practical problems for employers and employees alike. The&para;<br>Court, however, must give effect to the law Congress enacted, not as&para;<br>sess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that pro&para;<br>duces the least mischief. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(d) It is left to the Seventh Circuit to determine whether the judg&para;<br>ment must be modified to the extent that the District Court awarded&para;<br>relief based on the first round of hiring, which occurred outside the&para;<br>charging period even for the earliest EEOC charge. P. 11.&para;<br>528 F. 3d 488, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

LEWIS, JR., ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY&para;<br>OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>[May 24, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits em&para;<br>ployers from using employment practices that cause a&para;<br>disparate impact on the basis of race (among other bases).&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). It also requires plaintiffs,&para;<br>before beginning a federal lawsuit, to file a timely charge&para;<br>of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu&para;<br>nity Commission (EEOC). §2000e–5(e)(1). We consider&para;<br>whether a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge chal&para;<br>lenging the adoption of a practice—here, an employer’s&para;<br>decision to exclude employment applicants who did not&para;<br>achieve a certain score on an examination—may assert a&para;<br>disparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the&para;<br>employer’s later application of that practice.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In July 1995, the City of Chicago administered a written&para;<br>examination to over 26,000 applicants seeking to serve in&para;<br>the Chicago Fire Department. After scoring the examina&para;<br>tions, the City reported the results. It announced in a&para;<br>January 26, 1996, press release that it would begin draw&para;<br>ing randomly from the top tier of scorers, i.e., those who&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEWIS v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>scored 89 or above (out of 100), whom the City called “well&para;<br>qualified.” Those drawn from this group would proceed to&para;<br>the next phase—a physical-abilities test, background&para;<br>check, medical examination, and drug test—and if they&para;<br>cleared those hurdles would be hired as candidate fire&para;<br>fighters. Those who scored below 65, on the other hand,&para;<br>learned by letters sent the same day that they had failed&para;<br>the test. Each was told he had not achieved a passing&para;<br>score, would no longer be considered for a firefighter&para;<br>position, and would not be contacted again about the&para;<br>examination.&para;<br>The applicants in-between—those who scored between&para;<br>65 and 88, whom the City called “qualified”1—were noti&para;<br>fied that they had passed the examination but that, based&para;<br>on the City’s projected hiring needs and the number of&para;<br>“well-qualified” applicants, it was not likely they would be&para;<br>called for further processing. The individual notices&para;<br>added, however, that because it was not possible to predict&para;<br>how many applicants would be hired in the next few years,&para;<br>each “qualified” applicant’s name would be kept on the&para;<br>eligibility list maintained by the Department of Personnel&para;<br>for as long as that list was used. Eleven days later, the&para;<br>City officially adopted an “Eligible List” reflecting the&para;<br>breakdown described above.&para;<br>On May 16, 1996, the City selected its first class of&para;<br>applicants to advance to the next stage. It selected a&para;<br>second on October 1, 1996, and repeated the process nine&para;<br>more times over the next six years. As it had announced,&para;<br>in each round the City drew randomly from among those&para;<br>who scored in the “well-qualified” range on the 1995 test.&para;<br>In the last round it exhausted that pool, so it filled the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Certain&para;<br>&para;<br>paramedics who scored between 65 and 88 were deemed&para;<br>“well qualified” pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, and&para;<br>certain veterans in the “qualified” range had 5 points added to their&para;<br>scores and therefore became “well qualified.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>remaining slots with “qualified” candidates instead.&para;<br>On March 31, 1997, Crawford M. Smith, an AfricanAmerican applicant who scored in the “qualified” range&para;<br>and had not been hired as a candidate firefighter, filed a&para;<br>charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Five others&para;<br>followed suit, and on July 28, 1998, the EEOC issued all&para;<br>six of them right-to-sue letters. Two months later, they&para;<br>filed this civil action against the City, alleging (as relevant&para;<br>here) that its practice of selecting for advancement only&para;<br>applicants who scored 89 or above caused a disparate&para;<br>impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII. The&para;<br>District Court certified a class—petitioners here—&para;<br>consisting of the more than 6,000 African-Americans who&para;<br>scored in the “qualified” range on the 1995 examination&para;<br>but had not been hired.2&para;<br>The City sought summary judgment on the ground that&para;<br>petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300&para;<br>days after their claims accrued. See §2000e–5(e)(1). The&para;<br>District Court denied the motion, concluding that the&para;<br>City’s “ongoing reliance” on the 1995 test results consti&para;<br>tuted a “continuing violation” of Title VII. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 45a. The City stipulated that the 89-point cutoff had&para;<br>a “severe disparate impact against African Americans,”&para;<br>Final Pretrial Order, Record, Doc. 223, Schedule A, p. 2,&para;<br>but argued that its cutoff score was justified by business&para;<br>necessity. After an 8-day bench trial, the District Court&para;<br>ruled for petitioners, rejecting the City’s business&para;<br>necessity defense. It ordered the City to hire 132 ran&para;<br>domly selected members of the class (reflecting the num&para;<br>ber of African-Americans the Court found would have been&para;<br>hired but for the City’s practices) and awarded backpay to&para;<br>be divided among the remaining class members.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit reversed. 528 F. 3d 488 (2008). It&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In addition to the class members, the African American Fire Fight&para;<br>ers League of Chicago, Inc., also joined the suit as a plaintiff.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LEWIS v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>held that petitioners’ suit was untimely because the earli&para;<br>est EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the&para;<br>only discriminatory act: sorting the scores into the “well&para;<br>qualified,” “qualified,” and “not-qualified” categories. The&para;<br>hiring decisions down the line were immaterial, it rea&para;<br>soned, because “[t]he hiring only of applicants classified&para;<br>‘well qualified’ was the automatic consequence of the test&para;<br>scores rather than the product of a fresh act of discrimina&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 491. We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __&para;<br>(2009).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Before beginning a Title VII suit, a plaintiff must first&para;<br>file a timely EEOC charge. In this case, petitioners’&para;<br>charges were due within 300 days “after the alleged&para;<br>unlawful employment practice occurred.” §2000e–5(e)(1).3&para;<br>Determining whether a plaintiff’s charge is timely thus&para;<br>requires “identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment&para;<br>practice’ of which he complains.” Delaware State College&para;<br>v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257 (1980). Petitioners here chal&para;<br>lenge the City’s practice of picking only those who had&para;<br>scored 89 or above on the 1995 examination when it later&para;<br>chose applicants to advance. Setting aside the first round&para;<br>of selection in May 1996, which all agree is beyond the cut&para;<br>off, no one disputes that the conduct petitioners challenge&para;<br>occurred within the charging period.4 The real question,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 All agree that a 300-day deadline applies to petitioners’ charges&para;<br>pursuant to 29 CFR §§1601.13(a)(4), (b)(1), 1601.80 (2009). Cf. EEOC&para;<br>v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 112, 114–122 (1988).&para;<br>4 Because the District Court certified petitioners as a class, and be&para;<br>cause a court may award class-wide relief even to unnamed class&para;<br>members who have not filed EEOC charges, see Franks v. Bowman&para;<br>Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 771 (1976), petitioners assert and the City&para;<br>does not dispute that the date of the earliest EEOC charge filed by a&para;<br>named plaintiff—that filed by Smith on March 31, 1997—controls the&para;<br>timeliness of the class’s claims. We assume without deciding that this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>then, is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is&para;<br>timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the&para;<br>basis for a disparate-impact claim at all.&para;<br>We conclude that it can. As originally enacted, Title VII&para;<br>did not expressly prohibit employment practices that&para;<br>cause a disparate impact. That enactment made it an&para;<br>“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to fail or&para;<br>refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise&para;<br>to discriminate against any individual with respect to his&para;<br>compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ&para;<br>ment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,&para;<br>or national origin,” §2000e–2(a)(1), or “to limit, segregate,&para;<br>or classify his employees or applicants for employment in&para;<br>any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi&para;<br>vidual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely&para;<br>affect his status as an employee, because of” any of the&para;<br>same reasons, §2000e–2(a)(2). In Griggs v. Duke Power&para;<br>Co., 401 U. S. 424, 431 (1971), we interpreted the latter&para;<br>provision to “proscrib[e] not only overt discrimination but&para;<br>also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in&para;<br>operation.”&para;<br>Two decades later, Congress codified the requirements&para;<br>of the “disparate impact” claims Griggs had recognized.&para;<br>Pub. L. 102–166, §105, 105 Stat. 1074, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–&para;<br>2(k). That provision states:&para;<br>“(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on dis&para;<br>parate impact is established under this subchapter&para;<br>only if—&para;<br>“(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a re&para;<br>spondent uses a particular employment practice&para;<br>that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,&para;<br>color, religion, sex, or national origin and the re&para;<br>spondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged&para;<br>practice is job related for the position in question&para;<br>——————&para;<br>is correct.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LEWIS v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and consistent with business necessity . . . .”&para;<br>Thus, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie disparate&para;<br>impact claim by showing that the employer “uses a par&para;<br>ticular employment practice that causes a disparate im&para;<br>pact” on one of the prohibited bases. Ibid. (emphasis&para;<br>added). See Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 18).&para;<br>Petitioners’ claim satisfies that requirement. Title VII&para;<br>does not define “employment practice,” but we think it&para;<br>clear that the term encompasses the conduct of which&para;<br>petitioners complain: the exclusion of passing applicants&para;<br>who scored below 89 (until the supply of scores 89 or above&para;<br>was exhausted) when selecting those who would advance.&para;<br>The City “use[d]” that practice in each round of selection.&para;<br>Although the City had adopted the eligibility list (embody&para;<br>ing the score cutoffs) earlier and announced its intention&para;<br>to draw from that list, it made use of the practice of ex&para;<br>cluding those who scored 88 or below each time it filled a&para;<br>new class of firefighters. Petitioners alleged that this&para;<br>exclusion caused a disparate impact. Whether they ade&para;<br>quately proved that is not before us. What matters is that&para;<br>their allegations, based on the City’s actual implementa&para;<br>tion of its policy, stated a cognizable claim.&para;<br>The City argues that subsection (k) is inapposite be&para;<br>cause it does not address “accrual” of disparate-impact&para;<br>claims. Section 2000e–5(e)(1), it says, specifies when the&para;<br>time to file a charge starts running. That is true but&para;<br>irrelevant. Aside from the first round of selection in May&para;<br>1996 (which all agree is beyond the 300-day charging&para;<br>period), the acts petitioners challenge—the City’s use of its&para;<br>cutoff score in selecting candidates—occurred within the&para;<br>charging period. Accordingly, no one disputes that if&para;<br>petitioners could bring new claims based on those acts,&para;<br>their claims were timely. The issue, in other words, is not&para;<br>when petitioners’ claims accrued, but whether they could&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>accrue at all.&para;<br>The City responds that subsection (k) does not answer&para;<br>that question either; that it speaks, as its title indicates,&para;<br>only to the plaintiff’s “[b]urden of proof in disparate im&para;<br>pact cases,” not to the elements of disparate-impact&para;<br>claims, which the City says are be found in §2000e–2(a)(2).&para;<br>That is incorrect. Subsection (k) does indeed address the&para;<br>burden of proof—not just who bears it, however, but also&para;<br>what it consists of. It does set forth the essential ingredi&para;<br>ents of a disparate-impact claim: It says that a claim “is&para;<br>established” if an employer “uses” an “employment prac&para;<br>tice” that “causes a disparate impact” on one of the enu&para;<br>merated bases. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). That it also sets&para;<br>forth a business-necessity defense employers may raise,&para;<br>§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), and explains how plaintiffs may&para;<br>prevail despite that defense, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii), is ir&para;<br>relevant. Unless and until the defendant pleads and&para;<br>proves a business-necessity defense, the plaintiff wins&para;<br>simply by showing the stated elements.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Notwithstanding the text of §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) and&para;<br>petitioners’ description of the practice they claim was&para;<br>unlawful, the City argues that the unlawful employment&para;<br>practice here was something else entirely. The only ac&para;<br>tionable discrimination, it argues, occurred in 1996 when&para;<br>it “used the examination results to create the hiring eligi&para;<br>bility list, limited hiring to the ‘well qualified’ classifica&para;<br>tion, and notified petitioners.” Brief for Respondent 23.&para;<br>That initial decision, it concedes, was unlawful. But be&para;<br>cause no timely charge challenged the decision, that can&para;<br>not now be the basis for liability. And because, the City&para;<br>claims, the exclusion of petitioners when selecting classes&para;<br>of firefighters followed inevitably from the earlier decision&para;<br>to adopt the cutoff score, no new violations could have&para;<br>occurred. The Seventh Circuit adopted the same analysis.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LEWIS v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>See 528 F. 3d, at 490–491.&para;<br>The City’s premise is sound, but its conclusion does not&para;<br>follow. It may be true that the City’s January 1996 deci&para;<br>sion to adopt the cutoff score (and to create a list of the&para;<br>applicants above it) gave rise to a freestanding disparate&para;<br>impact claim. Cf. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 445–&para;<br>451 (1982). If that is so, the City is correct that since no&para;<br>timely charge was filed attacking it, the City is now “enti&para;<br>tled to treat that past act as lawful.” United Air Lines,&para;<br>Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558 (1977). But it does not&para;<br>follow that no new violation occurred—and no new claims&para;<br>could arise—when the City implemented that decision&para;<br>down the road. If petitioners could prove that the City&para;<br>“use[d]” the “practice” that “causes a disparate impact,”&para;<br>they could prevail.&para;<br>The City, like the Seventh Circuit, see 528 F. 3d, at&para;<br>490–491, insists that Evans and a line of cases following it&para;<br>require a different result. See also Ledbetter v. Goodyear&para;<br>Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618 (2007); Lorance v. AT&amp;T&para;<br>Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Ricks, 449 U. S.&para;<br>250. Those cases, we are told, stand for the proposition&para;<br>that present effects of prior actions cannot lead to Title VII&para;<br>liability.&para;<br>We disagree. As relevant here, those cases establish&para;<br>only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola&para;<br>tion” within the limitations period. Evans, supra, at 558&para;<br>(emphasis deleted). What that requires depends on the&para;<br>claim asserted.&para;<br>For disparate-treatment claims—and&para;<br>others for which discriminatory intent is required—that&para;<br>means the plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimi&para;<br>nation within the limitations period. See Ledbetter, supra,&para;<br>at 624–629; Lorance, supra, at 904–905; Ricks, supra, at&para;<br>256–258; Evans, supra, at 557–560; see also Chardon v.&para;<br>Fernandez, 454 U. S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam). But for&para;<br>claims that do not require discriminatory intent, no such&para;<br>demonstration is needed. Cf. Ledbetter, supra, at 640;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Lorance, supra, at 904, 908–909. Our opinions, it is true,&para;<br>described the harms of which the unsuccessful plaintiffs in&para;<br>those cases complained as “present effect[s]” of past dis&para;<br>crimination. Ledbetter, supra, at 628; see also Lorance,&para;<br>supra, at 907; Chardon, supra, at 8; Ricks, supra, at 258;&para;<br>Evans, supra, at 558. But the reason they could not be the&para;<br>present effects of present discrimination was that the&para;<br>charged discrimination required proof of discriminatory&para;<br>intent, which had not even been alleged. That reasoning&para;<br>has no application when, as here, the charge is disparate&para;<br>impact, which does not require discriminatory intent.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit resisted this conclusion, reasoning&para;<br>that the difference between disparate-treatment and&para;<br>disparate-impact claims is only superficial. Both take aim&para;<br>at the same evil—discrimination on a prohibited basis—&para;<br>but simply seek to establish it by different means. 528&para;<br>F. 3d, at 491–492. Disparate-impact liability, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals explained, “ ‘is primarily intended to lighten the&para;<br>plaintiff’s heavy burden of proving intentional discrimina&para;<br>tion after employers learned to cover their tracks.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>492 (quoting Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 967&para;<br>F. 2d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992)). But even if the two theories&para;<br>were directed at the same evil, it would not follow that&para;<br>their reach is therefore coextensive. If the effect of apply&para;<br>ing Title VII’s text is that some claims that would be&para;<br>doomed under one theory will survive under the other,&para;<br>that is the product of the law Congress has written. It is&para;<br>not for us to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what&para;<br>we think is necessary to achieve what we think Congress&para;<br>really intended. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser&para;<br>vices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).&para;<br>The City also argues that, even if petitioners could have&para;<br>proved a present disparate-impact violation, they never&para;<br>did so under the proper test. The parties litigated the&para;<br>merits—and the City stipulated that the cutoff score&para;<br>caused disparate impact—after the District Court adopted&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LEWIS v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>petitioners’ “continuing violation” theory. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 45a. That theory, which petitioners have since&para;<br>abandoned, treated the adoption and application of the&para;<br>cutoff score as a single, ongoing wrong. As a result, the&para;<br>City says, “petitioners never proved, or even attempted to&para;<br>prove, that use of the [eligibility] list had disparate im&para;<br>pact,” Brief for Respondent 32 (emphasis added), since the&para;<br>theory they advanced did not require them to do so. If the&para;<br>Court of Appeals determines that the argument has been&para;<br>preserved it may be available on remand. But it has no&para;<br>bearing here. The only question presented to us is&para;<br>whether the claim petitioners brought is cognizable.&para;<br>Because we conclude that it is, our inquiry is at an end.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The City and its amici warn that our reading will result&para;<br>in a host of practical problems for employers and employ&para;<br>ees alike. Employers may face new disparate-impact suits&para;<br>for practices they have used regularly for years. Evidence&para;<br>essential to their business-necessity defenses might be&para;<br>unavailable (or in the case of witnesses’ memories, unreli&para;<br>able) by the time the later suits are brought. And affected&para;<br>employees and prospective employees may not even know&para;<br>they have claims if they are unaware the employer is still&para;<br>applying the disputed practice.&para;<br>Truth to tell, however, both readings of the statute&para;<br>produce puzzling results. Under the City’s reading, if an&para;<br>employer adopts an unlawful practice and no timely&para;<br>charge is brought, it can continue using the practice in&para;<br>definitely, with impunity, despite ongoing disparate im&para;<br>pact. Equitable tolling or estoppel may allow some af&para;<br>fected employees or applicants to sue, but many others&para;<br>will be left out in the cold. Moreover, the City’s reading&para;<br>may induce plaintiffs aware of the danger of delay to file&para;<br>charges upon the announcement of a hiring practice,&para;<br>before they have any basis for believing it will produce a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>disparate impact.&para;<br>In all events, it is not our task to assess the conse&para;<br>quences of each approach and adopt the one that produces&para;<br>the least mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law&para;<br>Congress enacted. By enacting §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), Con&para;<br>gress allowed claims to be brought against an employer&para;<br>who uses a practice that causes disparate impact, what&para;<br>ever the employer’s motives and whether or not he has&para;<br>employed the same practice in the past. If that effect was&para;<br>unintended, it is a problem for Congress, not one that&para;<br>federal courts can fix.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The City asserts that one aspect of the District Court’s&para;<br>judgment still must be changed. The first round of hiring&para;<br>firefighters occurred outside the charging period even for&para;<br>the earliest EEOC charge. Yet the District Court, apply&para;<br>ing the continuing-violation theory, awarded relief based&para;<br>on those acts. Petitioners do not disagree, and they do not&para;<br>oppose the City’s request for a remand to resolve this&para;<br>issue. We therefore leave it to the Seventh Circuit to&para;<br>determine, to the extent that point was properly pre&para;<br>served, whether the judgment must be modified in light of&para;<br>our decision.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
