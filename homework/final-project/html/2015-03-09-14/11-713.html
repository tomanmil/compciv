That&para;<br>growth required the State to redraw its electoral districts&para;<br>for the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the&para;<br>State House of Representatives, in order to comply with&para;<br>the Constitution’s one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia&para;<br>v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n. 2 (2003). The State also&para;<br>had to create new districts for the four additional congres-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v.

C.&para;<br>§1973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011). Section 5 suspends&para;<br>all changes to a covered jurisdiction’s election procedures,&para;<br>including district lines, until those changes are submitted&para;<br>to and approved by a three-judge United States District&para;<br>Court for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney General. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.&para;<br>One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 198 (2009). This process,&para;<br>known as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction&para;<br>to demonstrate that its proposed change “neither has the&para;<br>purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging&para;<br>the right to vote on account of race or color.” §1973c(a).&para;<br>This Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map&para;<br>cannot be used to conduct an election until it has been&para;<br>precleared. See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652&para;<br>(1991).&para;<br>The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas&para;<br>submitted them to the United States District Court for the&para;<br>District of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance&para;<br>process remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its&para;<br>bid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the&para;<br>coming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs—appellees&para;<br>here—brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State’s&para;<br>newly enacted plans violate the United States Constitution and §2 of the Voting Rights Act.1 Appellees alleged,&para;<br>inter alia, that Texas’ enacted plans discriminate against&para;<br>Latinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting&para;<br>strength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and&para;<br>African-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas’&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Section&para;<br>&para;<br>2 prohibits “any State or political subdivision” from imposing any electoral practice “which results in a denial or abridgement of&para;<br>the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or&para;<br>color.” 42 U.

A three-judge panel of the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Western District of&para;<br>Texas was convened. See 28 U. S. C. §2284. That court&para;<br>heard argument and held a trial with respect to the plaintiffs’ claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution&para;<br>of the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch&para;<br>v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 283–285 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>As Texas’ 2012 primaries approached, it became increasingly likely that the State’s newly enacted plans would not&para;<br>receive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections. And&para;<br>the State’s old district lines could not be used, because&para;<br>population growth had rendered them inconsistent with&para;<br>the Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement. It&para;<br>thus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim&para;<br>plans for the State’s 2012 primaries and elections. See&para;<br>Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 414–415 (1977). After&para;<br>receiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive&para;<br>hearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court&para;<br>unanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but&para;<br>Judge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional&para;<br>and State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the&para;<br>interim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were&para;<br>unnecessarily inconsistent with the State’s enacted plans.&para;<br>This Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdiction. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>Redistricting is “primarily the duty and responsibility&para;<br>of the State.” Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975).&para;<br>The failure of a State’s newly enacted plan to gain preclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by&para;<br>itself, require a court to take up the state legislature’s task.&para;<br>That is because, in most circumstances, the State’s last&para;<br>enacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan&para;<br>receives preclearance. But if an intervening event—most&para;<br>commonly, as here, a census—renders the current plan&para;<br>unusable, a court must undertake the “unwelcome obliga-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. PEREZ&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>tion” of creating an interim plan. Connor, supra, at 415.&para;<br>Even then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient&para;<br>structure to the court’s endeavor. Where shifts in a&para;<br>State’s population have been relatively small, a court may&para;<br>need to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the&para;<br>State’s existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.&para;<br>But here the scale of Texas’ population growth appears&para;<br>to require sweeping changes to the State’s current districts. In areas where population shifts are so large that&para;<br>no semblance of the existing plan’s district lines can be&para;<br>used, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an&para;<br>interim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in&para;<br>adding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no&para;<br>suggestion as to where those new districts should be&para;<br>placed. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of&para;<br>defining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistricting ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have&para;<br>been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the&para;<br>exercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller v.&para;<br>Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915–916 (1995); White v. Weiser,&para;<br>412 U. S. 783, 795–796 (1973). Thus, if the old state districts were the only source to which a district court could&para;<br>look, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judgments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.&para;<br>To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise standardless decisions, a district court should take guidance&para;<br>from the State’s recently enacted plan in drafting an&para;<br>interim plan. That plan reflects the State’s policy judgments on where to place new districts and how to shift&para;<br>existing ones in response to massive population growth.&para;<br>This Court has observed before that “faced with the necessity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a&para;<br>general rule, should be guided by the legislative policies&para;<br>underlying” a state plan—even one that was itself unenforceable—“to the extent those policies do not lead to&para;<br>violations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 79 (1997) (holding that&para;<br>the District Court properly declined to defer to a precleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For&para;<br>example, in White, supra, an equal population challenge,&para;<br>this Court reversed a District Court’s choice of interim&para;<br>plan, and required the District Court to choose a plan&para;<br>more closely resembling an enacted state plan, even&para;<br>though the state plan itself had been held to violate the&para;<br>one-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham v.&para;<br>Seamon, although the state plan as a whole had been&para;<br>denied §5 preclearance, this Court directed a District&para;<br>Court to “defer to the legislative judgments the [state]&para;<br>plans reflect,” insofar as they involved districts found to&para;<br>meet the preclearance standard. 456 U. S. 37, 40–41&para;<br>(1982) (per curiam). See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403&para;<br>U. S. 124, 160–161 (1971) (equal protection challenge).&para;<br>Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented&para;<br>if it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that&para;<br>the plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it&para;<br>reflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an&para;<br>interim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a&para;<br>starting point for the district court. It provides important&para;<br>guidance that helps ensure that the district court appropriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that&para;<br>comply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act,&para;<br>without displacing legitimate state policy judgments with&para;<br>the court’s own preferences.&para;<br>A district court making such use of a State’s plan must,&para;<br>of course, take care not to incorporate into the interim&para;<br>plan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams,&para;<br>supra, at 85–86; White, supra, at 797. Where a State’s&para;<br>plan faces challenges under the Constitution or §2 of the&para;<br>Voting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by&para;<br>that plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are&para;<br>shown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. PEREZ&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>normally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on&para;<br>the merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter v.&para;<br>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20&para;<br>(2008). There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat&para;<br>the policies behind a State’s redistricting legislation&para;<br>should not also have to meet that standard. And because&para;<br>the local district court—here, the District Court for the&para;<br>Western District of Texas—will ultimately decide the&para;<br>merits of claims under §2 and the Constitution, it is well&para;<br>equipped to apply that familiar standard.&para;<br>The calculus with respect to §5 challenges is somewhat&para;<br>different. Where a State has sought preclearance in the&para;<br>District Court for the District of Columbia, §5 allows only&para;<br>that court to determine whether the state plan complies&para;<br>with §5. Consistent with that design, we have made clear&para;<br>that other district courts may not address the merits of §5&para;<br>challenges. See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379,&para;<br>385 (1971). The local district court drafting an interim&para;<br>plan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits&para;<br>of the preclearance proceedings. The court should presume neither that a State’s effort to preclear its plan will&para;<br>succeed nor that it will fail.&para;<br>The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance&para;<br>is satisfied by taking guidance from a State’s policy judgments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that&para;<br>stand a reasonable probability of failing to gain §5 preclearance. And by “reasonable probability” this Court&para;<br>means in this context that the §5 challenge is not insubstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not&para;<br>deprived of important guidance provided by a state plan&para;<br>due to §5 challenges that have no reasonable probability of&para;<br>success but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative&para;<br>of those responsible for the preclearance determination.&para;<br>And the reasonable probability standard adequately balances the unique preclearance scheme with the State’s&para;<br>sovereignty and a district court’s need for policy guidance&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>in constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted&para;<br>the “serious constitutional questions” raised by §5’s intrusion on state sovereignty. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at&para;<br>204. Those concerns would only be exacerbated if §5&para;<br>required a district court to wholly ignore the State’s policies in drawing maps that will govern a State’s elections,&para;<br>without any reason to believe those state policies are&para;<br>unlawful.&para;<br>Appellees, however, contend that §5 demands exactly&para;<br>that. In their view, this Court’s precedents require district&para;<br>courts to ignore any state plan that has not received §5&para;<br>preclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely&para;<br>hold only that a district court may not adopt an unprecleared plan as its own. See Lopez v. Monterey County,&para;<br>519 U. S. 9 (1996); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130&para;<br>(1981). They say nothing about whether a district court&para;<br>may take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in&para;<br>such a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in&para;<br>Upham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the&para;<br>unobjectionable aspects of a State’s plan even though that&para;<br>plan had already been denied preclearance.&para;<br>In this case, the District Court stated that it had&para;<br>“giv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the&para;<br>Legislature’s enacted map as possible.” 1 App. 182. At&para;<br>the same time, however, the court said that it was required to draw an “independent map” following “neutral&para;<br>principles that advance the interest of the collective public&para;<br>good.” Id., at 169–170. In the court’s view, it “was not&para;<br>required to give any deference to the Legislature’s enacted&para;<br>plan,” and it instead applied principles that it determined&para;<br>“place the interests of the citizens of Texas first.” Id., at&para;<br>171. To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission&para;<br>to draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution&para;<br>or the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept&para;<br>of “the collective public good” for the Texas Legislature’s&para;<br>determination of which policies serve “the interests of the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. PEREZ&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>citizens of Texas,” the court erred.&para;<br>In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map “without regard to political considerations,” the District Court&para;<br>relied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001&para;<br>U. S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001)&para;<br>(per curiam), summarily aff’d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002). 1&para;<br>App. 182. But in Balderas there was no recently enacted&para;<br>state plan to which the District Court could turn. Without&para;<br>the benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly&para;<br>legislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was perhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own&para;<br>notion of the public good. Because the District Court here&para;<br>had the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the&para;<br>court had neither the need nor the license to cast aside&para;<br>that vital aid.&para;<br>Some specific aspects of the District Court’s plans seem&para;<br>to pay adequate attention to the State’s policies, others do&para;<br>not, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For example, in drawing State House districts in North and East&para;<br>Texas, the District Court closely followed the State’s policies. See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 25–26. Although Texas’&para;<br>entire State House plan is challenged in the §5 proceedings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the&para;<br>district lines in North and East Texas have a discriminatory intent or effect. 1 id., at 187, n. 4. The District Court&para;<br>was thus correct to take guidance from the State’s plan in&para;<br>drawing the interim map for those regions. But the court&para;<br>then altered those districts to achieve de minimis population variations—even though there was no claim that the&para;<br>population variations in those districts were unlawful.&para;<br>Id., at 171, and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in&para;<br>this respect in the State’s plan, the District Court had no&para;<br>basis to modify that plan.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher&para;<br>standard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting&para;<br>precincts (called “voter tabulation districts” in Texas) in&para;<br>drawing the interim plans. Id., at 90, 102–103. That&para;<br>choice alone prevented the District Court from following&para;<br>the lead of Texas’ enacted plan—which freely splits precincts—in many areas where there were no legal challenges to the plan’s details. See id., at 102–103, 116, n. 24.&para;<br>The District Court was apparently motivated by a wellintentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of&para;<br>reconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court’s&para;<br>interim plan could be implemented in time for the upcoming election. Id., at 90, 102–103, 109. But the State’s plan&para;<br>accepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accomplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting&para;<br>precincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.&para;<br>§42.032 (West 2010). If a State has chosen to accept the&para;<br>burden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so&para;<br>is otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court&para;<br>to ignore the State’s decision. Of course, in this case it&para;<br>may well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light&para;<br>of the exigencies caused by the impending election.&para;<br>The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily&para;<br>ignored the State’s plans in drawing certain individual&para;<br>districts. For example, the District Court drew an interim&para;<br>District 77 that resembles neither the State’s newly enacted plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010&para;<br>census. The court said that it did so in response to alleged&para;<br>constitutional violations. 1 App. 174–175. But the court&para;<br>did not say that those allegations were plausible, much&para;<br>less likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a&para;<br>finding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>maps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 98 (1997). But this&para;<br>Court has also explained that those “stricter standard[s]” are not&para;<br>triggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a&para;<br>State’s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42–&para;<br>43 (1982) (per curiam).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v.

Without such a determination, the District Court had no basis for drawing a district that does&para;<br>not resemble any legislatively enacted plan.&para;<br>The court’s approach in drawing other districts was&para;<br>unclear. The interim plan’s Congressional District 33, for&para;<br>example, disregards aspects of the State’s plan that appear to be subject to strong challenges in the §5 proceeding. See 3 id., at 600–601; 5 id., at 12–14. That much&para;<br>seems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with&para;<br>the path the District Court followed from there. The&para;<br>court’s order suggests that it may have intentionally&para;<br>drawn District 33 as a “minority coalition opportunity&para;<br>district” in which the court expected two different minority&para;<br>groups to band together to form an electoral majority.&para;<br>1 id., at 147. The order is somewhat ambiguous on this&para;<br>point—some portions suggest that the court deliberately&para;<br>designed such a district, other parts suggest that it drew&para;<br>the district solely as a response to population growth in&para;<br>the area. Compare id., at 146–147 (“Because much of the&para;<br>growth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex&para;<br>was attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was&para;<br>drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district”), with&para;<br>id., at 144 (“The Court has nowhere expressly sought to&para;<br>increase the performance of any opportunity district above&para;<br>benchmark”). If the District Court did set out to create a&para;<br>minority coalition district, rather than drawing a district&para;<br>that simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for&para;<br>doing so. Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13–15&para;<br>(2009) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the&para;<br>Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards in drawing interim maps for the 2012 Texas elections, the orders implementing those maps are vacated,&para;<br>and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.
