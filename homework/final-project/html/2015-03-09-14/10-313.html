First, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(3) requires&para;<br>an incumbent LEC to lease “on an unbundled basis”—i.e., a la carte—&para;<br>network elements specified by the Federal Communications Commis&para;<br>sion (FCC) to allow a competitor to create its own network without&para;<br>having to build every element from scratch. In identifying those ele&para;<br>ments, the FCC must consider whether access is “necessary” and&para;<br>whether failing to provide it would “impair” the competitor’s provi&para;<br>sion of service. §251(d)(2). Second, §251(c)(2) mandates that incum&para;<br>bent LECs “provide . . . interconnection” between their networks and&para;<br>competitive LECs’ to ensure that a competitor’s customers can call&para;<br>the incumbent’s customers, and vice versa. The interconnection duty&para;<br>is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment&para;<br>analysis.&para;<br>In 2003, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Order deciding, con&para;<br>trary to previous orders, that §251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent&para;<br>LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access&para;<br>to existing “entrance facilities”—i.e., transmission facilities (typically&para;<br>wires or cables) that connect the two LECs’ networks—because such&para;<br>facilities are not network elements at all. The FCC noted, however,&para;<br>that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and back&para;<br>hauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 10–329, Isiogu et al. v. Michigan Bell Telephone&para;<br>Co. dba AT&amp;T Michigan, also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL &para;<br>&para;<br>TELEPHONE CO.&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>LECs’ §251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection. Thus, the&para;<br>practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not&para;<br>obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.&para;<br>In 2005, following D. C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its Trien&para;<br>nial Review Remand Order. The FCC retreated from the view that&para;<br>entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its pre&para;<br>vious position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities&para;<br>need not be provided under §251(c)(3). Treating entrance facilities as&para;<br>network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not&para;<br>impaired without access to such facilities. The FCC again empha&para;<br>sized that competitive LECs’ §251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnec&para;<br>tion had not been altered.&para;<br>In the Remand Order’s wake, respondent AT&amp;T notified competi&para;<br>tive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost&para;<br>based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would in&para;<br>stead charge higher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the&para;<br>Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&amp;T was unlawfully ab&para;<br>rogating their §251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection. The&para;<br>Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&amp;T to&para;<br>continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost&para;<br>based rates. AT&amp;T challenged the ruling. Relying on the Remand&para;<br>Order, the Federal District Court ruled in AT&amp;T’s favor. The Sixth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCC’s argument that the&para;<br>order did not change incumbent LECs’ interconnection obligations,&para;<br>including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnec&para;<br>tion.&para;<br>Held: The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regula&para;<br>tions—i.e., that to satisfy its duty under §251(c)(2), an incumbent&para;<br>LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competi&para;<br>tors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnec&para;<br>tion—and this Court defers to the FCC’s views. Pp. 6–16.&para;<br>(a) No statute or regulation squarely addresses the question. Pp.&para;<br>6–7.&para;<br>(b) Absent an unambiguous statute or regulation, the Court turns&para;<br>to the FCC’s interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief. See,&para;<br>e.g., Chase Bank USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___. The FCC&para;<br>proffers a three-step argument why its regulations require AT&amp;T to&para;<br>provide access at cost-based rates to existing entrance facilities for&para;<br>interconnection purposes. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(1) Interpreting 47 CFR §51.321(a), the FCC first contends that&para;<br>an incumbent LEC must lease “technically feasible” facilities for in&para;<br>terconnection. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>(2) The FCC contends, second, that existing entrance facilities&para;<br>are part of an incumbent LEC’s network, 47 CFR §51.319(e), and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>therefore are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease&para;<br>for interconnection, if technically feasible. P. 9.&para;<br>(3) Third, says the FCC, it is technically feasible to provide ac&para;<br>cess to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases—a&para;<br>point AT&amp;T does not dispute. P. 10.&para;<br>(c) Contrary to AT&amp;T’s arguments, the FCC’s interpretation is not&para;<br>“plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]. ” Auer v.&para;<br>Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. First, it is perfectly sensible to read the&para;<br>FCC’s regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent&para;<br>LECs’ networks. Second, the FCC’s views do not conflict with 47&para;<br>CFR §51.5’s definition of interconnection as “the linking of two net&para;<br>works for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and&para;<br>termination of traffic.” Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>(d) Nor is there any other “reason to suspect that the [FCC’s] in&para;<br>terpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judg&para;<br>ment on the matter in question.” Auer, supra, at 462. AT&amp;T incor&para;<br>rectly suggests that the FCC is attempting to require under&para;<br>§251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under&para;<br>§251(c)(3) and what the FCC itself said was not required in the Re&para;<br>mand Order.

We defer to&para;<br>the Commission’s views and reverse the judgment below.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110&para;<br>Stat. 56, imposed a number of duties on incumbent pro­&para;<br>viders of local telephone service in order to facilitate mar­&para;<br>ket entry by competitors. AT&amp;T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities&para;<br>Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 371 (1999). The incumbent local ex­&para;<br>change carriers (LECs) owned the local exchange net­&para;<br>works: the physical equipment necessary to receive, prop­&para;<br>erly route, and deliver phone calls among customers.&para;<br>Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 490&para;<br>(2002). Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could&para;<br>not compete with an incumbent carrier without basically&para;<br>replicating the incumbent’s entire existing network. Ibid.&para;<br>The 1996 Act addressed that barrier to market entry by&para;<br>requiring incumbent LECs to share their networks with&para;<br>competitive LECs in several ways, two of which are rele­&para;<br>vant here. First, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(3) requires incumbent&para;<br>LECs to lease “on an unbundled basis”—i.e., a la carte—&para;<br>network elements specified by the Commission. This&para;<br>makes it easier for a competitor to create its own network&para;<br>without having to build every element from scratch. In&para;<br>identifying which network elements must be available&para;<br>for unbundled lease under §251(c)(3), the Commission&para;<br>is required to consider whether access is “necessary”&para;<br>and whether failing to provide access would “impair” a&para;<br>competitor’s provision of service. §251(d)(2). Second,&para;<br>§251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs “provide . . .&para;<br>interconnection” between their networks and competitive&para;<br>LECs’ facilities. This ensures that customers on a com­&para;<br>petitor’s network can call customers on the incumbent’s&para;<br>network, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to&para;<br>impairment analysis. It is undisputed that both un­&para;<br>bundled network elements and interconnection must be&para;<br>provided at cost-based rates. See §252(d)(1); Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner in No. 10–313, p. 28; Brief for Petitioners in No.&para;<br>10–329, p. 7; Brief for Respondent 4.&para;<br>These cases concern incumbent LECs’ obligation to&para;<br>share existing “entrance facilities” with competitive LECs.&para;<br>Entrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically&para;<br>wires or cables) that connect competitive LECs’ networks&para;<br>with incumbent LECs’ networks.&para;<br>The FCC recently&para;<br>adopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are&para;<br>not among the network elements that §251(c)(3) requires&para;<br>incumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis&para;<br>at cost-based rates. See 47 CFR §51.319(e)(2)(i) (2005).&para;<br>The Commission noted, however, that it “d[id] not alter&para;<br>the right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection&para;<br>facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).” In re Unbundled&para;<br>Access to Network Elements, 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2611, ¶140&para;<br>(2005) (Triennial Review Remand Order).&para;<br>The specific issue here is whether respondent, Michigan&para;<br>Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&amp;T Michigan (AT&amp;T),&para;<br>must lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs&para;<br>at cost-based rates. The FCC interprets its regulations to&para;<br>require AT&amp;T to do so for the purpose of interconnection.&para;<br>We begin by reviewing the Commission’s recent actions&para;<br>regarding entrance facilities and then explain the particu­&para;<br>lar dispute that is before us today.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In 2003, the FCC decided, contrary to its previous or­&para;<br>ders, that incumbent LECs were not obligated to provide&para;<br>cost-based unbundled access to entrance facilities under&para;<br>§251(c)(3). In re Review of Section 251 Unbundling Obli&para;<br>gations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, 18 FCC&para;<br>Rcd. 16978, 17202–17205, ¶¶365–367 (2003) (Triennial&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL &para;<br>&para;<br>TELEPHONE CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Review Order). Explaining that its previous approach had&para;<br>been “misguided” and “overly broad,” id., ¶¶366, 365, the&para;<br>Commission concluded that entrance facilities were not&para;<br>subject to the unbundling requirement because they are&para;<br>not network elements at all. See id., ¶366 (entrance facili­&para;<br>ties “exist outside the incumbent LEC’s local network”).&para;<br>The Commission therefore did not conduct an impairment&para;<br>analysis.&para;<br>The FCC emphasized, however, the limits of this ruling.&para;<br>Entrance facilities are used for two purposes: interconnec­&para;<br>tion and backhauling.2 It expressly “d[id] not alter” an&para;<br>incumbent LEC’s obligation under §251(c)(2) to provide&para;<br>“facilities in order to ‘interconnect with the incumbent&para;<br>LEC’s network.’ ” Id., ¶366 (brackets omitted). Thus, al­&para;<br>though the Commission specified that §251(c)(3) did not&para;<br>require any unbundled leasing of entrance facilities, it&para;<br>determined in practical effect only that “incumbent LECs&para;<br>[were not obligated] to unbundle [entrance facilities] for&para;<br>the purpose of backhauling traffic.” Id., ¶365.&para;<br>On direct review, the D. C. Circuit questioned the Com­&para;<br>mission’s determination that entrance facilities are not&para;<br>network elements under §251(c)(3), but found the agency&para;<br>rulemaking record insufficient and remanded to the&para;<br>Commission for further consideration. See United States&para;<br>Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 359 F. 3d 554, 586, cert. denied, 543&para;<br>U. S. 925 (2004). The court noted that if entrance facilities&para;<br>were in fact “ ‘network elements,’ ” then “an analysis of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Although the parties and their amici disagree over the precise defi­&para;<br>nition of backhauling, they all appear to agree that backhauling is&para;<br>important to competitive LECs and occurs when a competitive LEC&para;<br>uses an entrance facility to transport traffic from a leased portion of an&para;<br>incumbent network to the competitor’s own facilities. Backhauling does&para;<br>not involve the exchange of traffic between incumbent and competitive&para;<br>networks. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners in No. 10–329, p. 25; Brief for&para;<br>United States Telecom Association et al. as Amici Curiae 32.

Id., ¶¶137–138. Treating entrance&para;<br>facilities as network elements, the Commission concluded&para;<br>that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to&para;<br>them. Ibid.

Competitive LECs complained to the Michi­&para;<br>gan Public Service Commission (PSC) that AT&amp;T was&para;<br>unlawfully abrogating their right to cost-based intercon­&para;<br>nection under §251(c)(2). The Michigan PSC agreed with&para;<br>the competitive LECs and ordered AT&amp;T to continue&para;<br>providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost­&para;<br>based rates.&para;<br>AT&amp;T challenged the Michigan PSC’s ruling in the&para;<br>District Court, which, relying on the Triennial Review&para;<br>Remand Order, ruled in AT&amp;T’s favor.

Sec­&para;<br>tion 251(c)(2) mandates that an incumbent LEC provide&para;<br>interconnection, at cost-based rates, “at any technically&para;<br>feasible point within the carrier’s network.” The FCC&para;<br>has long construed §251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs&para;<br>to provide, at cost-based rates, “any technically feasible&para;<br>method of obtaining interconnection . . . at a particular&para;<br>point.” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).&para;<br>The requirement in §51.321(a) to provide a “method of&para;<br>obtaining interconnection,” the Commission argues, en­&para;<br>compasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a compet­&para;<br>ing LEC. When the Commission originally promulgated&para;<br>§51.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be&para;<br>required to “adapt their facilities to interconnection” and&para;<br>to “accept the novel use of, and modification to, [their]&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Since then, as AT&amp;T and its amici concede, in­&para;<br>cumbent LECs have commonly leased certain facilities at&para;<br>cost-based prices to accommodate interconnection. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 28–29; Brief for United States Tele­&para;<br>com Association et al. as Amici Curiae 33–35.&para;<br>As additional support for its assertion that incumbent&para;<br>LECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC highlights&para;<br>the examples in §51.321(b) of “[t]echnically feasible meth­&para;<br>ods of obtaining interconnection,” which include “[m]eet&para;<br>point interconnection arrangements.” In a meet-point&para;<br>arrangement, an incumbent LEC “accommodat[es]” inter­&para;<br>connection by building a transmission facility from its&para;<br>network to a designated point, where it connects with the&para;<br>competitor’s corresponding transmission facility. Local&para;<br>Competition Order ¶553. Compared to that requirement,&para;<br>the Commission argues, the obligation to lease existing&para;<br>facilities for interconnection is quite modest.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Next, the Commission contends that existing entrance&para;<br>facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC&para;<br>must lease for interconnection. According to the FCC, the&para;<br>Triennial Review Remand Order adopted a regulatory def­&para;<br>inition that reestablished that entrance facilities are&para;<br>part of an incumbent LEC’s network. See ¶137; see also&para;<br>47 CFR §51.319(e) (2005). The end of every entrance&para;<br>facility is therefore a “point within [an incumbent] car­&para;<br>rier’s network” at which a competing LEC could request&para;<br>interconnection, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(2), and each entrance&para;<br>facility potentially provides a “technically feasible method&para;<br>of obtaining interconnection,” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

The Com­&para;<br>mission suggests here, as it has before, that additional considerations of&para;<br>cost or reasonableness might be appropriate if a competitive LEC were&para;<br>to request that an incumbent LEC build new entrance facilities for&para;<br>interconnection.

Given that revised definition, it&para;<br>is perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are&para;<br>a part of incumbent LECs’ networks.&para;<br>Second, we are not persuaded by AT&amp;T’s argument that&para;<br>the Commission’s views conflict with the definition of&para;<br>interconnection in §51.5. That regulation provides: “Inter­&para;<br>connection is the linking of two networks for the mutual&para;<br>exchange of traffic. This term does not include the trans­&para;<br>port and termination of traffic.” AT&amp;T focuses on the&para;<br>definition’s exclusion of “transport and termination of&para;<br>traffic.” An entrance facility is a transport facility, AT&amp;T&para;<br>argues, and it makes no sense to require an incumbent&para;<br>LEC to furnish a transport facility for interconnection&para;<br>when the definition of interconnection expressly excludes&para;<br>transport.&para;<br>We think AT&amp;T reads too much into the exclusion of&para;<br>“transport.” The regulation cannot possibly mean that no&para;<br>transport can occur across an interconnection facility, as&para;<br>that would directly conflict with the statutory language.&para;<br>See §251(c)(2) (requiring “interconnection . . . for the&para;<br>transmission and routing of [local] telephone exchange&para;<br>service”). The very reason for interconnection is the “mu­&para;<br>tual exchange of traffic.” 47 CFR §51.5; see also Competi&para;<br>tive Telecommunications Assn. v. FCC, 117 F. 3d 1068,&para;<br>1071–1072 (CA8 1997) (“[T]he transmission and routing of&para;<br>telephone exchange service” is “what the interconnection,&para;<br>the physical link, would be used for” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)).&para;<br>The better reading of the regulation is that it merely&para;<br>reflects that the “transport and termination of traffic” is&para;<br>subject to different regulatory treatment than intercon­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

The Commission ex­&para;<br>plains that the issue in these cases did not arise until&para;<br>recently—when it initially eliminated unbundled access to&para;<br>entrance facilities in the Triennial Review Order.

In the&para;<br>Triennial Review Order, the Commission once again rein­&para;<br>terpreted the “impair” standard and revised the list of&para;<br>network elements that incumbents must provide unbun­&para;<br>dled to competitors.&para;<br>The Commission’s initial decision to eliminate the obli­&para;<br>gation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not&para;<br>a result of the narrower view of impairment mandated&para;<br>by this Court and the D.

Instead, the Commis­&para;<br>sion determined that entrance facilities need not be pro­&para;<br>vided on an unbundled basis under §251(c)(3) on the novel&para;<br>ground that they are not network elements at all—&para;<br>something no court had ever suggested.&para;<br>Moreover, since its initial decision to eliminate the&para;<br>unbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the Commis­&para;<br>sion has been committed to that position. When the D.

The&para;<br>Triennial Review orders eliminated incumbent LECs’ obli­&para;<br>gation under §251(c)(3) to provide unbundled access to&para;<br>entrance facilities.

Triennial Review Order ¶366; Triennial&para;<br>Review Remand Order ¶140.

Tri&para;<br>ennial Review Order ¶365. That distinction is neither&para;<br>unusual nor ambiguous.6 In these cases, the Commission&para;<br>is simply explaining the interconnection obligation that it&para;<br>left undisturbed in the Triennial Review orders.

Most cogently, ¶140 of the Trien&para;<br>nial Review Remand Order serves no purpose unless one&para;<br>accepts (as AT&amp;T does not) the distinction between back­&para;<br>hauling and interconnection that is referred to in footnotes&para;<br>to ¶¶138 and 141 of the order. 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2610–&para;<br>2612 (2005).

For while I have in the past&para;<br>uncritically accepted that rule, I have become increasingly&para;<br>doubtful of its validity. On the surface, it seems to be a&para;<br>natural corollary—indeed, an a fortiori application—of the&para;<br>rule that we will defer to an agency’s interpretation of the&para;<br>statute it is charged with implementing, see Chevron&para;<br>U. S. A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467&para;<br>U. S. 837 (1984). But it is not. When Congress enacts an&para;<br>imprecise statute that it commits to the implementation of&para;<br>an executive agency, it has no control over that implemen­&para;<br>tation (except, of course, through further, more precise,&para;<br>legislation). The legislative and executive functions are&para;<br>not combined. But when an agency promulgates an im­&para;<br>precise rule, it leaves to itself the implementation of that&para;<br>rule, and thus the initial determination of the rule’s mean­&para;<br>ing. And though the adoption of a rule is an exercise of&para;<br>the executive rather than the legislative power, a properly&para;<br>adopted rule has fully the effect of law. It seems contrary&para;<br>to fundamental principles of separation of powers to per­&para;<br>mit the person who promulgates a law to interpret it as&para;<br>well. “When the legislative and executive powers are&para;<br>united in the same person, or in the same body of magis­&para;<br>trates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may&para;<br>arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact ty­&para;<br>rannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.”&para;<br>Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152&para;<br>(O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949).&para;<br>Deferring to an agency’s interpretation of a statute does&para;<br>not encourage Congress, out of a desire to expand its&para;<br>power, to enact vague statutes; the vagueness effectively&para;<br>cedes power to the Executive. By contrast, deferring to an&para;<br>agency’s interpretation of its own rule encourages the&para;<br>agency to enact vague rules which give it the power, in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The seeming inappro­&para;<br>priateness of Auer deference is especially evident in cases&para;<br>such as these, involving an agency that has repeatedly&para;<br>been rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond&para;<br>its text, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same&para;<br>ends.&para;<br>There are undoubted advantages to Auer deference.
