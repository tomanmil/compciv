Those programs train doctors primarily&para;<br>through hands-on experience. Although residents are required to&para;<br>take part in formal educational activities, these doctors generally&para;<br>spend the bulk of their time—typically 50 to 80 hours a week—caring&para;<br>for patients. Mayo pays its residents annual “stipends” of over&para;<br>$40,000 and also provides them with health insurance, malpractice&para;<br>insurance, and paid vacation time.&para;<br>The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) requires employ&para;<br>ees and employers to pay taxes on all “wages” employees receive, 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §§3101(a), 3111(a), and defines “wages” to include “all remu&para;<br>neration for employment,” §3121(a). FICA defines “employment” as&para;<br>“any service . . . performed . . . by an employee for the person employ&para;<br>ing him,” §3121(b), but excludes from taxation any “service performed&para;<br>in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university . . . if such service&para;<br>is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending&para;<br>classes at [the school],” §3121(b)(10). Since 1951, the Treasury De&para;<br>partment has construed the student exception to exempt from taxa&para;<br>tion students who work for their schools “as an incident to and for the&para;<br>purpose of pursuing a course of study.” 16 Fed. Reg. 12474. In 2004,&para;<br>the Department issued regulations providing that “[t]he services of a&para;<br>full-time employee”—which includes an employee normally scheduled&para;<br>to work 40 hours or more per week—“are not incident to and for the&para;<br>purpose of pursuing a course of study.” 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–&para;<br>2(d)(3)(iii). The Department explained that this analysis “is not af&para;<br>fected by the fact that the services . . . may have an educational, in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>structional, or training aspect.” Ibid. The rule offers as an example a&para;<br>medical resident whose normal schedule requires him to perform ser&para;<br>vices 40 or more hours per week, and concludes that the resident is&para;<br>not a student.&para;<br>Mayo filed suit asserting that this rule was invalid, and the Dis&para;<br>trict Court agreed. It found the full-time employee rule inconsistent&para;<br>with §3121’s unambiguous text and concluded that the factors gov&para;<br>erning this Court’s analysis in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v.&para;<br>United States, 440 U. S. 472, also indicated that the rule was invalid.&para;<br>The Eighth Circuit reversed. Applying Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu&para;<br>ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals concluded that the Department’s regulation was a permissible&para;<br>interpretation of an ambiguous statute.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Treasury Department’s full-time employee rule is a reason&para;<br>able construction of §3121(b)(10). Pp. 6–15.&para;<br>(a) Under Chevron’s two-part framework, the Court first asks&para;<br>whether Congress has “directly addressed the precise question at is&para;<br>sue.” 467 U. S., at 842-843. Congress has not done so here; the stat&para;<br>ute does not define “student” or otherwise attend to the question&para;<br>whether medical residents are subject to FICA. Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>(b) The parties debate whether the Court should next apply Chev&para;<br>ron step two or the multi-factor analysis used to review a tax regula&para;<br>tion in National Muffler. Absent a justification to do so, this Court is&para;<br>not inclined to apply a less deferential framework to evaluate Treas&para;<br>ury Department regulations than it uses to review rules adopted by&para;<br>any other agency. The Court has “[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of&para;<br>maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative&para;<br>action.” Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154. And the principles&para;<br>underlying Chevron apply with full force in the tax context. Chevron&para;<br>recognized that an agency’s power “ ‘to administer a congressionally&para;<br>created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy&para;<br>and the making of rules to fill any gap left . . . by Congress.’ ” 467&para;<br>U. S., at 843. Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly re&para;<br>quires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for&para;<br>statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones made by&para;<br>other agencies in administering their statutes.&para;<br>It is true that the full-time employee rule, like the rule at issue in&para;<br>National Muffler, was promulgated under the Department’s general&para;<br>authority to “prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the en&para;<br>forcement” of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U. S. C. §7805(a). It is&para;<br>also true that this Court, in opinions predating Chevron, stated that&para;<br>it owed less deference to a rule adopted under that general grant of&para;<br>authority than it would afford rules issued pursuant to more specific&para;<br>grants. See Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247, 253; United&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., 455 U. S. 16, 24. Since then, however,&para;<br>the Court has found Chevron deference appropriate “when it appears&para;<br>that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make&para;<br>rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation&para;<br>claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that author&para;<br>ity.” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–227. Chevron&para;<br>and Mead provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the full&para;<br>time employee rule. The Department issued the rule pursuant to an&para;<br>explicit authorization to prescribe needful rules and regulations, and&para;<br>only after notice-and-comment procedures. The Court has recognized&para;<br>these to be good indicators of a rule meriting Chevron deference,&para;<br>Mead, 533 U. S., at 229–231. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(c) The rule easily satisfies Chevron’s second step. Mayo accepts&para;<br>the Treasury Department’s determination that an individual may not&para;<br>qualify for the student exception unless the educational aspect of his&para;<br>relationship with his employer predominates over the service aspect&para;<br>of that relationship, but objects to the Department’s conclusion that&para;<br>residents working more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot&para;<br>satisfy that requirement. Mayo argues that the Treasury Depart&para;<br>ment should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into&para;<br>what each employee does and why he does it, and that the Depart&para;<br>ment has arbitrarily distinguished between hands-on training and&para;<br>classroom instruction. But regulation, like legislation, often requires&para;<br>drawing lines. The Department reasonably sought to distinguish be&para;<br>tween workers who study and students who work. Focusing on the&para;<br>hours spent working and those spent in studies is a sensible way to&para;<br>accomplish that goal. The Department thus has drawn a distinction&para;<br>between education and service, not between classroom instruction&para;<br>and hands-on training. The Treasury Department also reasonably&para;<br>concluded that its full-time employee rule would “improve adminis&para;<br>trability,” 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, and thereby “has avoided the wasteful&para;<br>litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accom&para;<br>pany [a] case-by-case approach” like the one Mayo advocates, United&para;<br>States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 302. Moreover, the rule reasonably&para;<br>takes into account the Social Security Administration’s concern that&para;<br>exempting residents from FICA would deprive them and their fami&para;<br>lies of vital social security disability and survivorship benefits.&para;<br>Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>568 F. 3d 675, affirmed.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

The question presented in this case is&para;<br>whether doctors who serve as medical residents are prop&para;<br>erly viewed as “student[s]” whose service Congress has&para;<br>exempted from FICA taxes under 26 U. S. C. §3121(b)(10).&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Most doctors who graduate from medical school in the&para;<br>United States pursue additional education in a specialty to&para;<br>become board certified to practice in that field. Petitioners&para;<br>Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research,&para;<br>Mayo Clinic, and the Regents of the University of Minne&para;<br>sota (collectively Mayo) offer medical residency programs&para;<br>that provide such instruction. Mayo’s residency programs,&para;<br>which usually last three to five years, train doctors pri&para;<br>marily through hands-on experience. Residents often&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>spend between 50 and 80 hours a week caring for patients,&para;<br>typically examining and diagnosing them, prescribing&para;<br>medication, recommending plans of care, and performing&para;<br>certain procedures. Residents are generally supervised in&para;<br>this work by more senior residents and by faculty mem&para;<br>bers known as attending physicians. In 2005, Mayo paid&para;<br>its residents annual “stipends” ranging between $41,000&para;<br>and $56,000 and provided them with health insurance,&para;<br>malpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.&para;<br>Mayo residents also take part in “a formal and struc&para;<br>tured educational program.” Brief for Petitioners 5 (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). Residents are assigned&para;<br>textbooks and journal articles to read and are expected to&para;<br>attend weekly lectures and other conferences. Residents&para;<br>also take written exams and are evaluated by the attend&para;<br>ing faculty physicians. But the parties do not dispute that&para;<br>the bulk of residents’ time is spent caring for patients.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Through the Social Security Act and related legislation,&para;<br>Congress has created a comprehensive national insurance&para;<br>system that provides benefits for retired workers, disabled&para;<br>workers, unemployed workers, and their families. See&para;<br>United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 254, 258, and nn. 1, 7&para;<br>(1982). Congress funds Social Security by taxing both&para;<br>employers and employees under FICA on the wages em&para;<br>ployees earn. See 26 U. S. C. §3101(a) (tax on employees);&para;<br>§3111(a) (tax on employers).&para;<br>Congress has defined&para;<br>“wages” broadly, to encompass “all remuneration for em&para;<br>ployment.” §3121(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The term&para;<br>“employment” has a similarly broad reach, extending to&para;<br>“any service, of whatever nature, performed . . . by an&para;<br>employee for the person employing him.” §3121(b).&para;<br>Congress has, however, exempted certain categories of&para;<br>service and individuals from FICA’s demands. As relevant&para;<br>here, Congress has excluded from taxation “service per&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>formed in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university&para;<br>. . . if such service is performed by a student who is en&para;<br>rolled and regularly attending classes at such school,&para;<br>college, or university.” §3121(b)(10) (2006 ed.). The Social&para;<br>Security Act, which governs workers’ eligibility for bene&para;<br>fits, contains a corresponding student exception materially&para;<br>identical to §3121(b)(10). 42 U. S. C. §410(a)(10).&para;<br>Since 1951, the Treasury Department has applied the&para;<br>student exception to exempt from taxation students who&para;<br>work for their schools “as an incident to and for the pur&para;<br>pose of pursuing a course of study” there. 16 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>12474 (adopting Treas. Regs. 127, §408.219(c)); see Treas.&para;<br>Reg. §31.3121(b)(10)–2(d), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)&para;<br>(2010). Until 2005, the Department determined whether&para;<br>an individual’s work was “incident to” his studies by per&para;<br>forming a case-by-case analysis. The primary considera&para;<br>tions in that analysis were the number of hours worked&para;<br>and the course load taken. See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 78–17,&para;<br>1978–1 Cum. Bull. 307 (services of individual “employed&para;<br>on a full-time basis” with a part-time course load are “not&para;<br>incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of&para;<br>study”).&para;<br>For its part, the Social Security Administration (SSA)&para;<br>also articulated in its regulations a case-by-case approach&para;<br>to the corresponding student exception in the Social Secu&para;<br>rity Act. See 20 CFR §404.1028(c) (1998). The SSA has,&para;<br>however, “always held that resident physicians are not&para;<br>students.” SSR 78–3, 1978 Cum. Bull. 55–56. In 1998,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the&para;<br>SSA could not categorically exclude residents from student&para;<br>status, given that its regulations provided for a case-by&para;<br>case approach. See Minnesota v. Apfel, 151 F. 3d 742,&para;<br>747–748. Following that decision, the Internal Revenue&para;<br>Service received more than 7,000 claims seeking FICA tax&para;<br>refunds on the ground that medical residents qualified as&para;<br>students under §3121(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>568 F. 3d 675, 677 (CA8 2009).&para;<br>Facing that flood of claims, the Treasury Department&para;<br>“determined that it [wa]s necessary to provide additional&para;<br>clarification of the ter[m]” “student” as used in&para;<br>§3121(b)(10), particularly with respect to individuals who&para;<br>perform “services that are in the nature of on the job&para;<br>training.” 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (2004). The Department&para;<br>proposed an amended rule for comment and held a public&para;<br>hearing on it. See id., at 76405.&para;<br>On December 21, 2004, the Department adopted an&para;<br>amended rule prescribing that an employee’s service is&para;<br>“incident” to his studies only when “[t]he educational&para;<br>aspect of the relationship between the employer and the&para;<br>employee, as compared to the service aspect of the rela&para;<br>tionship, [is] predominant.” Id., at 76408; Treas. Reg.&para;<br>§31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–&para;<br>2(d)(3)(i) (2005). The rule categorically provides that&para;<br>“[t]he services of a full-time employee”—as defined by the&para;<br>employer’s policies, but in any event including any em&para;<br>ployee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per&para;<br>week—“are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing&para;<br>a course of study.” 69 Fed. Reg. 76408; Treas. Reg.&para;<br>§31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)(3)(iii), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–&para;<br>2(d)(3)(iii) (the full-time employee rule). The amended&para;<br>provision clarifies that the Department’s analysis “is not&para;<br>affected by the fact that the services performed . . . may&para;<br>have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.”&para;<br>Ibid. The rule also includes as an example the case of&para;<br>“Employee E,” who is employed by “University V” as a&para;<br>medical resident.&para;<br>69 Fed. Reg. 76409; Treas. Reg.&para;<br>§31.3121(b)(10)–2(e), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–2(e) (Exam&para;<br>ple 4). Because Employee E’s “normal work schedule calls&para;<br>for [him] to perform services 40 or more hours per week,”&para;<br>the rule provides that his service is “not incident to and for&para;<br>the purpose of pursuing a course of study,” and he accord&para;<br>ingly is not an exempt “student” under §3121(b)(10). 69&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Supp. 2d 1164, 1166–&para;<br>1167 (Minn. 2007); Regents of Univ. of Minn. v. United&para;<br>States, No. 06–5084 (D Minn., Apr. 1, 2008), App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. C–47a. Mayo asserted that its residents were&para;<br>exempt under §3121(b)(10) and that the Treasury De&para;<br>partment’s full-time employee rule was invalid.&para;<br>The District Court granted Mayo’s motion for summary&para;<br>judgment. The court held that the full-time employee rule&para;<br>is inconsistent with the unambiguous text of §3121, which&para;<br>the court understood to dictate that “an employee is a&para;<br>‘student’ so long as the educational aspect of his service&para;<br>predominates over the service aspect of the relationship&para;<br>with his employer.” 503 F. Supp. 2d, at 1175. The court&para;<br>also determined that the factors governing this Court’s&para;<br>analysis of regulations set forth in National Muffler Deal&para;<br>ers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 440 U. S. 472 (1979), “indi&para;<br>cate that the full-time employee exception is invalid.” 503&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1176; see App. to Pet. for Cert.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&para;<br>467 U.

AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(2010).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We begin our analysis with the first step of the two-part&para;<br>framework announced in Chevron, supra, at 842–843, and&para;<br>ask whether Congress has “directly addressed the precise&para;<br>question at issue.” We agree with the Court of Appeals&para;<br>that Congress has not done so. The statute does not de&para;<br>fine the term “student,” and does not otherwise attend to&para;<br>the precise question whether medical residents are subject&para;<br>to FICA. See 26 U. S. C. §3121(b)(10).&para;<br>Mayo nonetheless contends that the Treasury Depart&para;<br>ment’s full-time employee rule must be rejected under&para;<br>Chevron step one. Mayo argues that the dictionary defini&para;<br>tion of “student”—one “who engages in ‘study’ by applying&para;<br>the mind ‘to the acquisition of learning, whether by means&para;<br>of books, observation, or experiment’ ”—plainly encom&para;<br>passes residents. Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting Oxford&para;<br>Universal Dictionary 2049–2050 (3d ed. 1955)). And,&para;<br>Mayo adds, residents are not excluded from that category&para;<br>by the only limitation on students Congress has imposed&para;<br>under the statute—that they “be ‘enrolled and regularly&para;<br>attending classes at [a] school.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 22&para;<br>(quoting 26 U. S. C. §3121(b)(10)).&para;<br>Mayo’s reading does not eliminate the statute’s ambigu&para;<br>ity as applied to working professionals. In its reply brief,&para;<br>Mayo acknowledges that a full-time professor taking&para;<br>evening classes—a person who presumably would satisfy&para;<br>the statute’s class-enrollment requirement and apply his&para;<br>mind to learning—could be excluded from the exemption&para;<br>and taxed because he is not “ ‘predominant[ly]’ ” a student.&para;<br>Reply Brief for Petitioners 7. Medical residents might&para;<br>likewise be excluded on the same basis; the statute itself&para;<br>does not resolve the ambiguity.&para;<br>The District Court interpreted §3121(b)(10) as unambig&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>uously foreclosing the Department’s rule by mandating&para;<br>that an employee be deemed “a ‘student’ so long as the&para;<br>educational aspect of his service predominates over the&para;<br>service aspect of the relationship with his employer.” 503&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1175. We do not think it possible to glean&para;<br>so much from the little that §3121 provides. In any event,&para;<br>the statutory text still would offer no insight into how&para;<br>Congress intended predominance to be determined or&para;<br>whether Congress thought that medical residents would&para;<br>satisfy the requirement.&para;<br>To the extent Congress has specifically addressed medi&para;<br>cal residents in §3121, moreover, it has expressly excluded&para;<br>these doctors from exemptions they might otherwise in&para;<br>voke. See 26 U. S. C. §§3121(b)(6)(B), (7)(C)(ii) (excluding&para;<br>medical residents from exemptions available to employees&para;<br>of the District of Columbia and the United States). That&para;<br>choice casts doubt on any claim that Congress specifically&para;<br>intended to insulate medical residents from FICA’s reach&para;<br>in the first place.&para;<br>In sum, neither the plain text of the statute nor the&para;<br>District Court’s interpretation of the exemption “speak[s]&para;<br>with the precision necessary to say definitively whether&para;<br>[the statute] applies to” medical residents.

If the regulation dates from a later&para;<br>period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry.&para;<br>Other relevant considerations are the length of time&para;<br>the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed&para;<br>on it, the consistency of the Commissioner’s interpre&para;<br>tation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has&para;<br>devoted to the regulation during subsequent re&para;<br>enactments of the statute.” Id., at 477.&para;<br>The Government, on the other hand, contends that the&para;<br>National Muffler standard has been superseded by Chev&para;<br>ron. The sole question for the Court at step two under the&para;<br>Chevron analysis is “whether the agency’s answer is based&para;<br>on a permissible construction of the statute.” 467 U. S., at&para;<br>843.&para;<br>Since deciding Chevron, we have cited both National&para;<br>Muffler and Chevron in our review of Treasury Depart&para;<br>ment regulations. See, e.g., United States v. Cleveland&para;<br>Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 219 (2001) (citing&para;<br>National Muffler); Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner,&para;<br>499 U. S. 554, 560–561 (1991) (same); United States v.&para;<br>Boyle, 469 U. S. 241, 246, n. 4 (1985) (citing Chevron); see&para;<br>also Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523 U. S. 382,&para;<br>387, 389 (1998) (citing Chevron and Cottage Savings).&para;<br>Although we have not thus far distinguished between&para;<br>National Muffler and Chevron, they call for different&para;<br>analyses of an ambiguous statute. Under National Muf&para;<br>fler, for example, a court might view an agency’s interpre&para;<br>tation of a statute with heightened skepticism when it has&para;<br>not been consistent over time, when it was promulgated&para;<br>years after the relevant statute was enacted, or because of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

The District Court in this case cited each of these&para;<br>factors in rejecting the Treasury Department’s rule, noting&para;<br>in particular that the regulation had been promulgated&para;<br>after an adverse judicial decision. See 503 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>1176; see also Brief for Petitioners 41–44 (relying on the&para;<br>same considerations).&para;<br>Under Chevron, in contrast, deference to an agency’s&para;<br>interpretation of an ambiguous statute does not turn on&para;<br>such considerations.&para;<br>We have repeatedly held that&para;<br>“[a]gency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to&para;<br>analyze the agency’s interpretation under the Chevron&para;<br>framework.” National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.&para;<br>v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981 (2005);&para;<br>accord, Eurodif S. A., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). We&para;<br>have instructed that “neither antiquity nor contempora&para;<br>neity with [a] statute is a condition of [a regulation’s]&para;<br>validity.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517&para;<br>U. S. 735, 740 (1996). And we have found it immaterial to&para;<br>our analysis that a “regulation was prompted by litiga&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 741. Indeed, in United Dominion Industries,&para;<br>Inc. v. United States, 532 U. S. 822, 838 (2001), we ex&para;<br>pressly invited the Treasury Department to “amend its&para;<br>regulations” if troubled by the consequences of our resolu&para;<br>tion of the case.&para;<br>Aside from our past citation of National Muffler, Mayo&para;<br>has not advanced any justification for applying a less&para;<br>deferential standard of review to Treasury Department&para;<br>regulations than we apply to the rules of any other agency.&para;<br>In the absence of such justification, we are not inclined&para;<br>to carve out an approach to administrative review good&para;<br>for tax law only. To the contrary, we have expressly&para;<br>“[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform&para;<br>approach to judicial review of administrative action.”&para;<br>Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154 (1999). See, e.g.,&para;<br>Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. S. 212, 222–&para;<br>&para;<br>10 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>223 (1989) (declining to apply “a different and stricter&para;<br>nondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates&para;<br>discretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing&para;<br>power”).&para;<br>The principles underlying our decision in Chevron apply&para;<br>with full force in the tax context. Chevron recognized that&para;<br>“[t]he power of an administrative agency to administer a&para;<br>congressionally created . . . program necessarily requires&para;<br>the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill&para;<br>any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.” 467&para;<br>U. S., at 843 (internal quotation marks omitted). It ac&para;<br>knowledged that the formulation of that policy might&para;<br>require “more than ordinary knowledge respecting the&para;<br>matters subjected to agency regulations.” Id., at 844&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Filling gaps in the&para;<br>Internal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury&para;<br>Department to make interpretive choices for statutory&para;<br>implementation at least as complex as the ones other&para;<br>agencies must make in administering their statutes. Cf.&para;<br>Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 596&para;<br>(1983) (“[I]n an area as complex as the tax system, the&para;<br>agency Congress vests with administrative responsibility&para;<br>must be able to exercise its authority to meet changing&para;<br>conditions and new problems”). We see no reason why our&para;<br>review of tax regulations should not be guided by agency&para;<br>expertise pursuant to Chevron to the same extent as our&para;<br>review of other regulations.&para;<br>As one of Mayo’s amici points out, however, both the&para;<br>full-time employee rule and the rule at issue in National&para;<br>Muffler were promulgated pursuant to the Treasury De&para;<br>partment’s general authority under 26 U. S. C. §7805(a) to&para;<br>“prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the en&para;<br>forcement” of the Internal Revenue Code. See Brief for&para;<br>Carlton M. Smith 4–7. In two decisions predating Chev&para;<br>ron, this Court stated that “we owe the [Treasury Depart&para;<br>ment’s] interpretation less deference” when it is contained&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in a rule adopted under that “general authority” than&para;<br>when it is “issued under a specific grant of authority to&para;<br>define a statutory term or prescribe a method of executing&para;<br>a statutory provision.” Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452&para;<br>U. S. 247, 253 (1981); United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.,&para;<br>455 U. S. 16, 24 (1982) (quoting Rowan).&para;<br>Since Rowan and Vogel were decided, however, the&para;<br>administrative landscape has changed significantly. We&para;<br>have held that Chevron deference is appropriate “when it&para;<br>appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency&para;<br>generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that&para;<br>the agency interpretation claiming deference was promul&para;<br>gated in the exercise of that authority.” Mead, 533 U. S.,&para;<br>at 226–227. Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on&para;<br>whether Congress’s delegation of authority was general or&para;<br>specific. For example, in National Cable &amp; Telecommuni&para;<br>cations Assn., supra, we held that the Federal Communi&para;<br>cations Commission was delegated “the authority to prom&para;<br>ulgate binding legal rules” entitled to Chevron deference&para;<br>under statutes that gave the Commission “the authority to&para;<br>‘execute and enforce,’ ” and “to ‘prescribe such rules and&para;<br>regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to&para;<br>carry out the provisions’ of,” the Communications Act of&para;<br>1934. 545 U. S., at 980–981 (quoting 47 U. S. C. §§151,&para;<br>201(b)). See also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 87,&para;<br>88–89 (1990) (applying Chevron deference to rule promul&para;<br>gated pursuant to delegation of “general authority to&para;<br>‘make rules and regulations and to establish procedures,&para;<br>not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter,&para;<br>which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such&para;<br>provisions’ ” (quoting 42 U. S. C. §405(a) (1982 ed.))).&para;<br>We believe Chevron and Mead, rather than National&para;<br>Muffler and Rowan, provide the appropriate framework&para;<br>for evaluating the full-time employee rule. The Depart&para;<br>ment issued the full-time employee rule pursuant to the&para;<br>explicit authorization to “prescribe all needful rules and&para;<br>&para;<br>12 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>regulations for the enforcement” of the Internal Revenue&para;<br>Code. 26 U. S. C. §7805(a). We have found such “express&para;<br>congressional authorizations to engage in the process of&para;<br>rulemaking” to be “a very good indicator of delegation&para;<br>meriting Chevron treatment.” Mead, supra, at 229. The&para;<br>Department issued the full-time employee rule only after&para;<br>notice-and-comment procedures, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, again&para;<br>a consideration identified in our precedents as a “signifi&para;<br>cant” sign that a rule merits Chevron deference. Mead,&para;<br>supra, at 230–231; see, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,&para;<br>Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 173–174 (2007).&para;<br>We have explained that “the ultimate question is&para;<br>whether Congress would have intended, and expected,&para;<br>courts to treat [the regulation] as within, or outside, its&para;<br>delegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’ authority.” Id., at&para;<br>173 (emphasis deleted). In the Long Island Care case, we&para;<br>found that Chevron provided the appropriate standard of&para;<br>review “[w]here an agency rule sets forth important indi&para;<br>vidual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully&para;<br>and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full&para;<br>notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule,&para;<br>[and] where the resulting rule falls within the statutory&para;<br>grant of authority.” 551 U. S., at 173. These same consid&para;<br>erations point to the same result here. This case falls&para;<br>squarely within the bounds of, and is properly analyzed&para;<br>under, Chevron and Mead.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The full-time employee rule easily satisfies the second&para;<br>step of Chevron, which asks whether the Department’s&para;<br>rule is a “reasonable interpretation” of the enacted text.&para;<br>467 U. S., at 844. To begin, Mayo accepts that “the ‘educa&para;<br>tional aspect of the relationship between the employer and&para;<br>the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the&para;<br>relationship, [must] be predominant’ ” in order for an&para;<br>individual to qualify for the exemption. Reply Brief for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners 6–7 (quoting Treas. Reg. §31.3121(b)(10)–&para;<br>2(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)(3)(i)). Mayo ob&para;<br>jects, however, to the Department’s conclusion that resi&para;<br>dents who work more than 40 hours per week categorically&para;<br>cannot satisfy that requirement. Because residents’ em&para;<br>ployment is itself educational, Mayo argues, the hours a&para;<br>resident spends working make him “more of a student, not&para;<br>less of one.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, n. 3 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted). Mayo contends that the Treasury Department&para;<br>should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into&para;<br>“what [each] employee does [in his service] and why” he&para;<br>does it. Id., at 7. Mayo also objects that the Department&para;<br>has drawn an arbitrary distinction between “hands-on&para;<br>training” and “classroom instruction.” Brief for Petition&para;<br>ers 35.&para;<br>We disagree. Regulation, like legislation, often requires&para;<br>drawing lines. Mayo does not dispute that the Treasury&para;<br>Department reasonably sought a way to distinguish be&para;<br>tween workers who study and students who work, see IRS&para;<br>Letter Ruling 9332005 (May 3, 1993). Focusing on the&para;<br>hours an individual works and the hours he spends in&para;<br>studies is a perfectly sensible way of accomplishing that&para;<br>goal. The Department explained that an individual’s&para;<br>service and his “course of study are separate and distinct&para;<br>activities” in “the vast majority of cases,” and reasoned&para;<br>that “[e]mployees who are working enough hours to be&para;<br>considered full-time employees . . . have filled the conven&para;<br>tional measure of available time with work, and not&para;<br>study.” 69 Fed. Reg. 8607. The Department thus did not&para;<br>distinguish classroom education from clinical training but&para;<br>rather education from service. The Department reasona&para;<br>bly concluded that its full-time employee rule would “im&para;<br>prove administrability,” id., at 76405, and it thereby “has&para;<br>avoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty&para;<br>that would inevitably accompany any purely case-by-case&para;<br>approach” like the one Mayo advocates, United States v.&para;<br>&para;<br>14 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 302 (1967).&para;<br>As the Treasury Department has explained, moreover,&para;<br>the full-time employee rule has more to recommend it&para;<br>than administrative convenience. The Department rea&para;<br>sonably determined that taxing residents under FICA&para;<br>would further the purpose of the Social Security Act and&para;<br>comport with this Court’s precedent. As the Treasury&para;<br>Department appreciated, this Court has understood the&para;<br>terms of the Social Security Act to “ ‘import a breadth of&para;<br>coverage,’ ” 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (quoting Social Security Bd.&para;<br>v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 365 (1946)), and we have in&para;<br>structed that “exemptions from taxation are to be con&para;<br>strued narrowly,” Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U. S. 741, 752&para;<br>(1969). Although Mayo contends that medical residents&para;<br>have not yet begun their “working lives” because they are&para;<br>not “fully trained,” Reply Brief for Petitioners 13 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted), the Department certainly did&para;<br>not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors—“who&para;<br>work long hours, serve as highly skilled professionals, and&para;<br>typically share some or all of the terms of employment of&para;<br>career employees”—are the kind of workers that Congress&para;<br>intended to both contribute to and benefit from the Social&para;<br>Security system. 69 Fed. Reg. 8608.&para;<br>The Department’s rule takes into account the SSA’s&para;<br>concern that exempting residents from FICA would de&para;<br>prive residents and their families of vital disability and&para;<br>survivorship benefits that Social Security provides. Id., at&para;<br>8605. Mayo wonders whether the full-time employee rule&para;<br>will result in residents being taxed under FICA but denied&para;<br>coverage by the SSA. The Government informs us, how&para;<br>ever, that the SSA continues to adhere to its longstanding&para;<br>position that medical residents are not students and thus&para;<br>remain eligible for coverage.
