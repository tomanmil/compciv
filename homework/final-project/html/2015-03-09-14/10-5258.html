UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–5258. Argued April 25, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011&para;<br>Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a felon unlawfully in&para;<br>possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1), is subject to a 15-year&para;<br>minimum prison sentence if he has three prior convictions for a “vio&para;<br>lent felony” or “serious drug offense.” As relevant here, a “serious&para;<br>drug offense” is defined as “an offense under State law . . . , for which&para;<br>a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed&para;<br>by law,” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In sentencing petitioner McNeill for violat&para;<br>ing §922(g), the District Court determined that he qualified for&para;<br>ACCA’s sentencing enhancement based in part on six prior North&para;<br>Carolina drug trafficking convictions. When McNeill committed&para;<br>those crimes, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, which&para;<br>McNeill in fact received. However, because the State later reduced&para;<br>the maximum sentence for those offenses to fewer than 10 years,&para;<br>McNeill argued that none of his six prior convictions were for “serious&para;<br>drug offenses” within the meaning of §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The District&para;<br>Court rejected McNeill’s request that it look to current state law and&para;<br>instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied at the&para;<br>time he committed his state offenses. The Fourth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. A federal sentencing court must determine whether “an offense&para;<br>under State law” is a “serious drug offense” by consulting the “maxi&para;<br>mum term of imprisonment” applicable to a defendant’s prior state&para;<br>drug offense at the time of the defendant’s conviction for that offense.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Pp. 3–7.&para;<br>(a) ACCA’s plain text requires this result by mandating that the&para;<br>court determine whether a “previous conviction” was for a serious&para;<br>drug offense. The only way to answer this backward-looking question&para;<br>is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ACCA’s use of the present tense in defining a “serious drug offense”&para;<br>as, inter alia, “an offense . . . for which a maximum [10-year] term . . .&para;<br>is prescribed by law” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill’s argument&para;<br>that this language looks to the state law in effect at the time of the&para;<br>federal sentencing ignores ACCA’s focus on convictions that have al&para;<br>ready occurred. Pp. 3–4.&para;<br>(b) The statute’s broader context, specifically the adjacent defini&para;<br>tion of “violent felony,” confirms this interpretation. Although Con&para;<br>gress used the present tense in defining “violent felony,” see&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B), this Court has repeatedly turned to the version of state&para;<br>law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating in deter&para;<br>mining whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, e.g., Taylor v.&para;<br>United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602. The Court sees no reason to inter&para;<br>pret “serious drug offenses” any differently. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder,&para;<br>557 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(c) This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results&para;<br>that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previ&para;<br>ous offense. Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>2. The District Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en&para;<br>hancement to McNeill because all six of his prior drug convictions&para;<br>were for “serious drug offenses.” Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>&para;<br>598 F. 3d 161, affirmed.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S. C.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The question in this case concerns how a&para;<br>federal court should determine the maximum sentence for&para;<br>a prior state drug offense for ACCA purposes. We hold&para;<br>that the “maximum term of imprisonment” for a defen&para;<br>dant’s prior state drug offense is the maximum sentence&para;<br>applicable to his offense when he was convicted of it.&para;<br>I&para;<br>After an extended chase, police officers in Fayetteville,&para;<br>North Carolina apprehended petitioner Clifton Terelle&para;<br>McNeill. McNeill was caught with 3.1 grams of crack&para;<br>cocaine packaged for distribution and a .38-caliber re&para;<br>volver. In August 2008, he pleaded guilty to unlawful&para;<br>possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1),&para;<br>and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21&para;<br>U. S. C. §841(a)(1).&para;<br>At sentencing, the District Court determined that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>McNeill qualified for ACCA’s sentencing enhancement.&para;<br>Under ACCA, a person who violates 18 U. S. C. §922(g)&para;<br>and “has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony&para;<br>or a serious drug offense” is subject to a 15-year minimum&para;<br>prison sentence. §924(e)(1). McNeill conceded that two of&para;<br>his prior convictions—assault with a deadly weapon and&para;<br>robbery—were for “violent felonies.”&para;<br>McNeill argued, however, that none of his six state drug&para;<br>trafficking convictions were for “serious drug offenses” be&para;<br>cause those crimes no longer carried a “maximum term&para;<br>of imprisonment of ten years or more.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).&para;<br>When McNeill committed those crimes between 1991 and&para;<br>1994, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, and&para;<br>McNeill in fact received 10-year sentences. See N. C. Gen.&para;<br>Stat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993)&para;<br>(sale of cocaine and possession with intent to sell cocaine).&para;<br>But as of October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the&para;<br>maximum sentence for selling cocaine to 38 months and&para;<br>the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent&para;<br>to sell to 30 months. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§15A–&para;<br>1340.17(c) and (d), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Lexis 2009).&para;<br>The District Court rejected McNeill’s request that it&para;<br>look to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year&para;<br>maximum sentence that applied to McNeill’s drug offenses&para;<br>at the time he committed them. No. 5:08–CR–2–D–1&para;<br>(EDNC, Jan. 26, 2009), App. 118. Finding that McNeill&para;<br>therefore had three prior convictions for violent felonies or&para;<br>serious drug offenses, the court applied ACCA’s sentencing&para;<br>enhancement. The court then departed upward from the&para;<br>advisory Sentencing Guidelines range and sentenced&para;<br>McNeill to 300 months in prison in light of his “long and&para;<br>unrelenting history of serious criminal conduct” and “near&para;<br>certain likelihood of recidivism.” Id., at 119, 121.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Although the court consulted the maximum sentence&para;<br>under current state law, it reached the same conclusion as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the District Court because North Carolina’s revised sen&para;<br>tencing scheme does not apply to crimes committed before&para;<br>October 1, 1994. 598 F. 3d 161, 165 (2010) (agreeing with&para;<br>United States v. Hinojosa, 349 F. 3d 200 (CA5 2003), and&para;<br>disagreeing with United States v. Darden, 539 F. 3d 116&para;<br>(CA2 2008)). Thus, even if McNeill were convicted today&para;<br>for his 1991, 1992, and September 1994 drug offenses, he&para;<br>would still be subject to the old 10-year statutory maxi&para;<br>mum. 598 F. 3d, at 165 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. §15A–&para;<br>1340.10 and State v. Branch, 134 N. C. App. 637, 639–640,&para;<br>518 S. E. 2d 213, 215 (1999)). We granted certiorari, 562&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2011), and now affirm, albeit for a different&para;<br>reason.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with&para;<br>“the language itself [and] the specific context in which that&para;<br>language is used.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S.&para;<br>337, 341 (1997). ACCA’s sentencing enhancement applies&para;<br>to individuals who have “three previous convictions . . . for&para;<br>a violent felony or a serious drug offense.” §924(e)(1). As&para;<br>relevant here, the statute defines a “serious drug offense”&para;<br>as “an offense under State law, involving manufacturing,&para;<br>distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or&para;<br>distribute, a controlled substance . . . , for which a maxi&para;<br>mum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is pre&para;<br>scribed by law.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).&para;<br>The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing&para;<br>court to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a&para;<br>defendant’s previous drug offense at the time of his convic&para;<br>tion for that offense. The statute requires the court to&para;<br>determine whether a “previous conviction” was for a seri&para;<br>ous drug offense. The only way to answer this backward&para;<br>looking question is to consult the law that applied at the&para;<br>time of that conviction. We did precisely that in United&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), where we ad&para;<br>dressed whether the “maximum term of imprisonment” in&para;<br>cludes recidivism enhancements. In assessing the “max&para;<br>imum term of imprisonment” for Rodriguez’s state drug&para;<br>offenses, we consulted the version of state law “that&para;<br>[he] was convicted of violating,” that is, the 1994 statutes&para;<br>and penalties that applied to his offenses at the time of his&para;<br>state convictions. Id., at 380–381.&para;<br>Use of the present tense in the definition of “serious&para;<br>drug offense” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill argues&para;<br>that the present-tense verb in the phrase “is prescribed by&para;<br>law” requires federal courts to determine the maximum&para;<br>sentence for a potential predicate offense by looking to the&para;<br>state law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing, as&para;<br>if the state offense were committed on the day of federal&para;<br>sentencing. That argument overlooks the fact that ACCA&para;<br>is concerned with convictions that have already occurred.&para;<br>Whether the prior conviction was for an offense “involving&para;<br>manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to&para;<br>manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance” can&para;<br>only be answered by reference to the law under which the&para;<br>defendant was convicted. Likewise, the maximum sen&para;<br>tence that “is prescribed by law” for that offense must also&para;<br>be determined according to the law applicable at that&para;<br>time.&para;<br>McNeill’s interpretation contorts the plain meaning of&para;<br>the statute. Although North Carolina courts actually&para;<br>sentenced him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses,&para;<br>McNeill now contends that the “maximum term of impris&para;<br>onment” for those offenses is 30 or 38 months. We find it&para;<br>“hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may&para;<br>lawfully [have] be[en] sentenced to a term of imprison&para;<br>ment that exceeds the ‘maximum term of imprisonment&para;<br>. . . prescribed by law.’ ” Id., at 383.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>The “broader context of the statute as a whole,” specifi&para;<br>cally the adjacent definition of “violent felony,” confirms&para;<br>this interpretation. Robinson, supra, at 341. ACCA de&para;<br>fines “violent felony” in part as a crime that “has as an&para;<br>element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of&para;<br>physical force against the person of another” or “is bur&para;<br>glary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or&para;<br>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten&para;<br>tial risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B) (em&para;<br>phasis added).&para;<br>Despite Congress’ use of present tense in that definition,&para;<br>when determining whether a defendant was convicted of a&para;<br>“violent felony,” we have turned to the version of state law&para;<br>that the defendant was actually convicted of violating. In&para;<br>Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), the Court&para;<br>held that whether Taylor’s 1963 and 1971 convictions were&para;<br>for a crime that “is burglary” depended on the “former&para;<br>Missouri statutes defining second-degree burglary” that&para;<br>“were the bases for Taylor’s prior convictions.” Id., at 602;&para;<br>see id., at 578, n. 1 (noting a subsequent change in state&para;<br>law, but relying on the burglary statutes in force “[i]n&para;<br>those years” in which Taylor was convicted). Similarly, in&para;<br>James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007), this Court&para;<br>looked to the versions of Florida’s burglary and criminal&para;<br>attempt statutes that were in effect “at the time of James’&para;<br>[1993 state] conviction.” Id., at 197; see ibid. (quoting the&para;<br>1993 versions of the Florida statutes). The present-tense&para;<br>verbs in the definition of “violent felony” did not persuade&para;<br>us to look anywhere other than the law under which the&para;<br>defendants were actually convicted to determine the ele&para;<br>ments of their offenses.&para;<br>Having repeatedly looked to the historical statute of&para;<br>conviction in the context of violent felonies, we see no&para;<br>reason to interpret “serious drug offenses” in the adjacent&para;<br>section of the same statute any differently. In both defini&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions, Congress used the present tense to refer to past&para;<br>convictions. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 8) (“Where, as here, Congress uses&para;<br>similar statutory language . . . in two adjoining provisions,&para;<br>it normally intends similar interpretations”).&para;<br>C&para;<br>This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd&para;<br>results that would follow from consulting current state law&para;<br>to define a previous offense. See United States v. Wilson,&para;<br>503 U. S. 329, 334 (1992) (“[A]bsurd results are to be&para;<br>avoided”).&para;<br>For example, McNeill concedes that under his approach,&para;<br>a prior conviction could “disappear” entirely for ACCA&para;<br>purposes if a State reformulated the offense between the&para;<br>defendant’s state conviction and federal sentencing. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 12–13. The Sixth Circuit confronted a similar&para;<br>scenario in Mallett v. United States, 334 F. 3d 491 (2003),&para;<br>where Ohio had substantially changed how drug quanti&para;<br>ties were measured since Mallett’s state drug conviction.&para;<br>Id., at 502 (addressing this issue in the context of the&para;<br>career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines).&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit could not “determine how Mallett would&para;<br>now be sentenced under Ohio’s revised drug laws” because&para;<br>the offense for which he had been convicted “no longer&para;<br>exist[ed] and no conversion between the former and&para;<br>amended statutes [wa]s facially apparent.” Ibid. The&para;<br>court therefore was compelled to look to state law “as of&para;<br>the time of the state-court conviction” to determine the&para;<br>maximum possible sentence for Mallet’s prior offense. Id.,&para;<br>at 503.&para;<br>It cannot be correct that subsequent changes in state&para;<br>law can erase an earlier conviction for ACCA purposes. A&para;<br>defendant’s history of criminal activity—and the culpabil&para;<br>ity and dangerousness that such history demonstrates—&para;<br>does not cease to exist when a State reformulates its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>criminal statutes in a way that prevents precise transla&para;<br>tion of the old conviction into the new statutes. Congress&para;<br>based ACCA’s sentencing enhancement on prior convic&para;<br>tions and could not have expected courts to treat those&para;<br>convictions as if they had simply disappeared. To the&para;<br>contrary, Congress has expressly directed that a prior&para;<br>violent felony conviction remains a “conviction” unless it&para;<br>has been “expunged, or set aside or [the] person has been&para;<br>pardoned or has had civil rights restored.” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§921(a)(20); see also Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485,&para;<br>491 (1994) (explaining that §921(a)(20) “creates a clear&para;<br>negative implication that courts may count a conviction&para;<br>that has not been set aside”).&para;<br>In addition, McNeill’s interpretation would make&para;<br>ACCA’s applicability depend on the timing of the federal&para;<br>sentencing proceeding. McNeill cannot explain why two&para;<br>defendants who violated §922(g) on the same day and who&para;<br>had identical criminal histories—down to the dates on&para;<br>which they committed and were sentenced for their prior&para;<br>offenses—should receive dramatically different federal&para;<br>sentences solely because one’s §922(g) sentencing hap&para;<br>pened to occur after the state legislature amended the&para;<br>punishment for one of the shared prior offenses. In con&para;<br>trast, the interpretation we adopt permits a defendant to&para;<br>know even before he violates §922(g) whether ACCA&para;<br>would apply.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Applying our holding to this case, we conclude that the&para;<br>District Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en&para;<br>hancement to McNeill. In light of his two admitted violent&para;<br>felony convictions, McNeill needed only one conviction for&para;<br>a “serious drug offense” to trigger ACCA, but we note that&para;<br>all six of his prior drug convictions qualify.&para;<br>In November 1992, McNeill pleaded guilty and was&para;<br>sentenced in a North Carolina court for five offenses:&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>selling cocaine on four separate occasions in October 1991&para;<br>and possessing cocaine with intent to sell on one occasion&para;<br>in February 1992. At the time of McNeill’s November&para;<br>1992 conviction and sentencing, North Carolina law dic&para;<br>tated that the maximum sentence for selling cocaine in&para;<br>1991 and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine&para;<br>with intent to sell in 1992 was 10 years in prison. See&para;<br>N. C. Gen. Stat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1)&para;<br>(Michie 1991). McNeill’s 1992 convictions were therefore&para;<br>for “serious drug offenses” within the meaning of ACCA.&para;<br>McNeill’s sixth drug offense was possessing cocaine with&para;<br>intent to sell in September 1994. He pleaded guilty and&para;<br>was sentenced in a North Carolina court in April 1995. By&para;<br>April 1995, North Carolina had changed the sentence&para;<br>applicable to that type of drug offense but still provided&para;<br>that the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with&para;<br>intent to sell in September 1994 was 10 years in prison.&para;<br>See 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §2 (repealing N. C.&para;<br>Gen Stat. §14–1.1); 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §56 (as&para;<br>modified by Extra Session 1994 N. C. Sess.
