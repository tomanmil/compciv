In No. 10−9647, petitioner Jackson accompanied two&para;<br>other boys to a video store to commit a robbery; on the way to the&para;<br>store, he learned that one of the boys was carrying a shotgun. Jackson stayed outside the store for most of the robbery, but after he entered, one of his co-conspirators shot and killed the store clerk. Arkansas charged Jackson as an adult with capital felony murder and&para;<br>aggravated robbery, and a jury convicted him of both crimes. The&para;<br>trial court imposed a statutorily mandated sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Jackson filed a state habeas&para;<br>petition, arguing that a mandatory life-without-parole term for a 14year-old violates the Eighth Amendment.

ALABAMA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide&para;<br>offenders. Pp. 6−27.&para;<br>(a) The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment “guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.” Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560. That right&para;<br>“flows from the basic ‘precept of justice that punishment for crime&para;<br>should be graduated and proportioned’ ” to both the offender and the&para;<br>offense. Ibid.&para;<br>Two strands of precedent reflecting the concern with proportionate&para;<br>punishment come together here. The first has adopted categorical&para;<br>bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407. Several cases in this group&para;<br>have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser&para;<br>culpability. Thus, Roper v. Simmons held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham v. Florida,&para;<br>560 U. S. ___, concluded that the Amendment prohibits a sentence of&para;<br>life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense. Graham further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty, thereby evoking a second line of cases.&para;<br>In those decisions, this Court has required sentencing authorities to&para;<br>consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death. See, e.g., Woodson v. North&para;<br>Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (plurality opinion). Here, the confluence of&para;<br>these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory&para;<br>life without parole for juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment.&para;<br>As to the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purposes. Their “ ‘lack of maturity’ ” and “ ‘underdeveloped sense of responsibility’ ” lead to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.&para;<br>Roper, 543 U. S., at 569. They “are more vulnerable . . . to negative&para;<br>influences and outside pressures,” including from their family and&para;<br>peers; they have limited “contro[l] over their own environment” and&para;<br>lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing&para;<br>settings. Ibid. And because a child’s character is not as “well&para;<br>formed” as an adult’s, his traits are “less fixed” and his actions are&para;<br>less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].” Id., at 570.&para;<br>Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of&para;<br>youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible&para;<br>crimes.&para;<br>While Graham’s flat ban on life without parole was for nonhomi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cide crimes, nothing that Graham said about children is crimespecific. Thus, its reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sentence for a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses. Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth&para;<br>matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole. The mandatory penalty&para;<br>schemes at issue here, however, prevent the sentencer from considering youth and from assessing whether the law’s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. This contravenes Graham’s (and also Roper’s) foundational principle: that&para;<br>imposition of a State’s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders&para;<br>cannot proceed as though they were not children.&para;<br>Graham also likened life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to&para;<br>the death penalty. That decision recognized that life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences “share some characteristics with death sentences that are&para;<br>shared by no other sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___. And it treated life&para;<br>without parole for juveniles like this Court’s cases treat the death&para;<br>penalty, imposing a categorical bar on its imposition for nonhomicide&para;<br>offenses. By likening life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to&para;<br>the death penalty, Graham makes relevant this Court’s cases demanding individualized sentencing in capital cases. In particular,&para;<br>those cases have emphasized that sentencers must be able to consider the mitigating qualities of youth. In light of Graham’s reasoning,&para;<br>these decisions also show the flaws of imposing mandatory lifewithout-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. Pp. 6−17.&para;<br>(b) The counterarguments of Alabama and Arkansas are unpersuasive. Pp. 18–27.&para;<br>(1) The States first contend that Harmelin v. Michigan, 501&para;<br>U. S. 957, forecloses a holding that mandatory life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment. Harmelin declined to extend the individualized sentencing requirement to noncapital cases “because of the qualitative difference between death and&para;<br>all other penalties.” Id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and&para;<br>concurring in judgment). But Harmelin had nothing to do with children, and did not purport to apply to juvenile offenders. Indeed,&para;<br>since Harmelin, this Court has held on multiple occasions that sentencing practices that are permissible for adults may not be so for&para;<br>children. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Graham, 560 U. S ___.&para;<br>The States next contend that mandatory life-without-parole terms&para;<br>for juveniles cannot be unconstitutional because 29 jurisdictions impose them on at least some children convicted of murder. In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole,&para;<br>this Court asks as part of the analysis whether legislative enactments and actual sentencing practices show a national consensus&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>against a sentence for a particular class of offenders. But where, as&para;<br>here, this Court does not categorically bar a penalty, but instead requires only that a sentencer follow a certain process, this Court has&para;<br>not scrutinized or relied on legislative enactments in the same way.&para;<br>See, e.g., Sumner v. Schuman, 483 U. S. 66.&para;<br>In any event, the “objective indicia of society’s standards,” Graham,&para;<br>560 U. S., at ___, that the States offer do not distinguish these cases&para;<br>from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment. Fewer States impose mandatory life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences on juvenile homicide offenders than authorized the penalty&para;<br>(life-without-parole for nonhomicide offenders) that this Court invalidated in Graham. And as Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487&para;<br>U. S. 815, explain, simply counting legislative enactments can present a distorted view. In those cases, as here, the relevant penalty&para;<br>applied to juveniles based on two separate provisions: One allowed&para;<br>the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another&para;<br>set out penalties for any and all individuals tried there. In those circumstances, this Court reasoned, it was impossible to say whether a&para;<br>legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so&para;<br>if presented with the choice). The same is true here. Pp. 18–25.&para;<br>(2) The States next argue that courts and prosecutors sufficiently consider a juvenile defendant’s age, as well as his background&para;<br>and the circumstances of his crime, when deciding whether to try him&para;<br>as an adult. But this argument ignores that many States use mandatory transfer systems. In addition, some lodge the decision in the&para;<br>hands of the prosecutors, rather than courts. And even where judges&para;<br>have transfer-stage discretion, it has limited utility, because the decisionmaker typically will have only partial information about the child&para;<br>or the circumstances of his offense. Finally, because of the limited&para;<br>sentencing options in some juvenile courts, the transfer decision may&para;<br>present a choice between a light sentence as a juvenile and standard&para;<br>sentencing as an adult. It cannot substitute for discretion at posttrial sentencing. Pp. 25−27.&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10−9646, 63 So. 3d 676, and No. 10−9647, 2011 Ark. 49, ___ S.

In neither case did the sentencing authority have any discretion to impose a different&para;<br>punishment. State law mandated that each juvenile die&para;<br>in prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that&para;<br>his youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the&para;<br>nature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example,&para;<br>life with the possibility of parole) more appropriate.

We therefore hold that&para;<br>mandatory life without parole for those under the age of&para;<br>18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishments.”&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>In November 1999, petitioner Kuntrell Jackson, then 14&para;<br>years old, and two other boys decided to rob a video store.&para;<br>En route to the store, Jackson learned that one of the&para;<br>boys, Derrick Shields, was carrying a sawed-off shotgun in&para;<br>his coat sleeve. Jackson decided to stay outside when the&para;<br>two other boys entered the store. Inside, Shields pointed&para;<br>the gun at the store clerk, Laurie Troup, and demanded&para;<br>that she “give up the money.” Jackson v. State, 359 Ark.&para;<br>87, 89, 194 S. W. 3d 757, 759 (2004) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Troup refused. A few moments later,&para;<br>Jackson went into the store to find Shields continuing to&para;<br>demand money. At trial, the parties disputed whether&para;<br>Jackson warned Troup that “[w]e ain’t playin’,” or instead&para;<br>told his friends, “I thought you all was playin’.” Id., at 91,&para;<br>194 S. W. 3d, at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>When Troup threatened to call the police, Shields shot and&para;<br>killed her. The three boys fled empty-handed. See id., at&para;<br>89–92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 758–760.&para;<br>Arkansas law gives prosecutors discretion to charge 14year-olds as adults when they are alleged to have committed certain serious offenses. See Ark. Code Ann. §9–27–&para;<br>318(c)(2) (1998). The prosecutor here exercised that authority by charging Jackson with capital felony murder&para;<br>and aggravated robbery. Jackson moved to transfer the&para;<br>case to juvenile court, but after considering the alleged&para;<br>facts of the crime, a psychiatrist’s examination, and Jackson’s juvenile arrest history (shoplifting and several inci-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dents of car theft), the trial court denied the motion, and&para;<br>an appellate court affirmed. See Jackson v. State, No.&para;<br>02–535, 2003 WL 193412, *1 (Ark. App., Jan. 29, 2003);&para;<br>§§9–27–318(d), (e). A jury later convicted Jackson of both&para;<br>crimes. Noting that “in view of [the] verdict, there’s only&para;<br>one possible punishment,” the judge sentenced Jackson to&para;<br>life without parole. App. in No. 10–9647, p. 55 (hereinafter Jackson App.); see Ark. Code Ann. §5–4–104(b) (1997)&para;<br>(“A defendant convicted of capital murder or treason shall&para;<br>be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole”).1 Jackson did not challenge the sentence on appeal,&para;<br>and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the convictions. See 359 Ark. 87, 194 S. W. 3d 757.&para;<br>Following Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), in&para;<br>which this Court invalidated the death penalty for all&para;<br>juvenile offenders under the age of 18, Jackson filed a&para;<br>state petition for habeas corpus. He argued, based on&para;<br>Roper’s reasoning, that a mandatory sentence of life without parole for a 14-year-old also violates the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment. The circuit court rejected that argument and&para;<br>granted the State’s motion to dismiss. See Jackson App.&para;<br>72–76. While that ruling was on appeal, this Court held&para;<br>in Graham v. Florida that life without parole violates the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment when imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders. After the parties filed briefs addressing&para;<br>that decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the&para;<br>dismissal of Jackson’s petition. See Jackson v. Norris,&para;<br>2011 Ark. 49, ___ S. W. 3d ___. The majority found that&para;<br>Roper and Graham were “narrowly tailored” to their contexts: “death-penalty cases involving a juvenile and lifeimprisonment-without-parole cases for nonhomicide of——————&para;<br>1 Jackson&para;<br>&para;<br>was ineligible for the death penalty under Thompson v.&para;<br>Oklahoma, 487 U.

W. 3d, at ___&para;<br>(Danielson, J., dissenting). And they argued that Jackson’s mandatory sentence ran afoul of Graham’s admonition that “ ‘[a]n offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take&para;<br>defendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be&para;<br>flawed.’ ” Id., at 10–11, ___ S. W. 3d, at ___ (quoting Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25)).2&para;<br>B&para;<br>Like Jackson, petitioner Evan Miller was 14 years old at&para;<br>the time of his crime. Miller had by then been in and out&para;<br>of foster care because his mother suffered from alcoholism&para;<br>and drug addiction and his stepfather abused him. Miller,&para;<br>too, regularly used drugs and alcohol; and he had attempted suicide four times, the first when he was six years&para;<br>old. See E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d 1077, 1081 (Ala.&para;<br>Crim. App. 2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result); App. in&para;<br>No. 10–9646, pp. 26–28 (hereinafter Miller App.).&para;<br>One night in 2003, Miller was at home with a friend,&para;<br>Colby Smith, when a neighbor, Cole Cannon, came to&para;<br>make a drug deal with Miller’s mother. See 6 Record in&para;<br>No. 10–9646, p. 1004. The two boys followed Cannon back&para;<br>to his trailer, where all three smoked marijuana and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 For the first time in this Court, Arkansas contends that Jackson’s&para;<br>sentence was not mandatory. On its view, state law then in effect&para;<br>allowed the trial judge to suspend the life-without-parole sentence and&para;<br>commit Jackson to the Department of Human Services for a “trainingschool program,” at the end of which he could be placed on probation.&para;<br>Brief for Respondent in No. 10–9647, pp. 36–37 (hereinafter Arkansas&para;<br>Brief) (citing Ark. Code Ann. §12–28–403(b)(2) (1999)). But Arkansas&para;<br>never raised that objection in the state courts, and they treated Jackson’s sentence as mandatory. We abide by that interpretation of state&para;<br>law. See, e.g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 690–691 (1975).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

When Cannon passed out, Miller&para;<br>stole his wallet, splitting about $300 with Smith. Miller&para;<br>then tried to put the wallet back in Cannon’s pocket, but&para;<br>Cannon awoke and grabbed Miller by the throat. Smith&para;<br>hit Cannon with a nearby baseball bat, and once released,&para;<br>Miller grabbed the bat and repeatedly struck Cannon with&para;<br>it. Miller placed a sheet over Cannon’s head, told him&para;<br>“ ‘I am God, I’ve come to take your life,’ ” and delivered one&para;<br>more blow. Miller v. State, 63 So. 3d 676, 689 (Ala. Crim.&para;<br>App. 2010). The boys then retreated to Miller’s trailer, but&para;<br>soon decided to return to Cannon’s to cover up evidence of&para;<br>their crime. Once there, they lit two fires. Cannon eventually died from his injuries and smoke inhalation. See&para;<br>id., at 683–685, 689.&para;<br>Alabama law required that Miller initially be charged as&para;<br>a juvenile, but allowed the District Attorney to seek removal of the case to adult court. See Ala. Code §12–15–34&para;<br>(1977). The D. A. did so, and the juvenile court agreed&para;<br>to the transfer after a hearing. Citing the nature of the&para;<br>crime, Miller’s “mental maturity,” and his prior juvenile&para;<br>offenses (truancy and “criminal mischief”), the Alabama&para;<br>Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. E. J. M. v. State, No.&para;<br>CR–03–0915, pp. 5–7 (Aug. 27, 2004) (unpublished memorandum).3 The State accordingly charged Miller as an&para;<br>adult with murder in the course of arson.

Graham further likened life without parole&para;<br>for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking&para;<br>a second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have&para;<br>prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment,&para;<br>requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before&para;<br>sentencing him to death.

Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion&para;<br>that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles&para;<br>violate the Eighth Amendment.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>three dissenting opinions here each take issue with some or all&para;<br>of those precedents. See post, at 5–6 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,&para;<br>at 1–6 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); post, at 1–4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That&para;<br>is not surprising: their authors (and joiner) each dissented from some or&para;<br>all of those precedents. See, e.g., Kennedy, 554 U.

In particular, each disagreed with&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>To start with the first set of cases: Roper and Graham&para;<br>establish that children are constitutionally different from&para;<br>adults for purposes of sentencing. Because juveniles have&para;<br>diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,&para;<br>we explained, “they are less deserving of the most severe&para;<br>punishments.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).&para;<br>Those cases relied on three significant gaps between juveniles and adults. First, children have a “ ‘lack of maturity&para;<br>and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,’ ” leading to&para;<br>recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Roper,&para;<br>543 U. S., at 569. Second, children “are more vulnerable . . . to negative influences and outside pressures,”&para;<br>including from their family and peers; they have limited&para;<br>“contro[l] over their own environment” and lack the ability&para;<br>to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing&para;<br>settings. Ibid. And third, a child’s character is not as&para;<br>“well formed” as an adult’s; his traits are “less fixed” and&para;<br>his actions less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e]&para;<br>deprav[ity].” Id., at 570.&para;<br>Our decisions rested not only on common sense—on&para;<br>what “any parent knows”—but on science and social science as well. Id., at 569. In Roper, we cited studies&para;<br>showing that “‘[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adolescents’ ” who engage in illegal activity “ ‘develop entrenched&para;<br>patterns of problem behavior.’ ” Id., at 570 (quoting Steinberg &amp; Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and&para;<br>the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>the majority’s reasoning in Graham, which is the foundation stone of&para;<br>our analysis. See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C.

While the dissents seek to relitigate old&para;<br>Eighth Amendment battles, repeating many arguments this Court has&para;<br>previously (and often) rejected, we apply the logic of Roper, Graham,&para;<br>and our individualized sentencing decisions to these two cases.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1014 (2003)). And in Graham, we noted that “developments in psychology and brain science continue to show&para;<br>fundamental differences between juvenile and adult&para;<br>minds”—for example, in “parts of the brain involved in&para;<br>behavior control.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).5 We&para;<br>reasoned that those findings—of transient rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences—both&para;<br>lessened a child’s “moral culpability” and enhanced the&para;<br>prospect that, as the years go by and neurological development occurs, his “ ‘deficiencies will be reformed.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570).&para;<br>Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications&para;<br>for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders,&para;<br>even when they commit terrible crimes. Because “ ‘[t]he&para;<br>heart of the retribution rationale’ ” relates to an offender’s&para;<br>blameworthiness, “ ‘the case for retribution is not as strong&para;<br>with a minor as with an adult.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 20–21) (quoting Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S.&para;<br>137, 149 (1987); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Nor can deterrence do the work in this context, because “ ‘the same&para;<br>characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than&para;<br>adults’ ”—their immaturity, recklessness, and impetuosity—make them less likely to consider potential punish——————&para;<br>5 The evidence presented to us in these cases indicates that the science and social science supporting Roper’s and Graham’s conclusions&para;<br>have become even stronger. See, e.g., Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (“[A]n ever-growing body of&para;<br>research in developmental psychology and neuroscience continues to&para;<br>confirm and strengthen the Court’s conclusions”); id., at 4 (“It is increasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in&para;<br>regions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as&para;<br>impulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance”); Brief for J.&para;<br>Lawrence Aber et al. as Amici Curiae 12–28 (discussing post-Graham&para;<br>studies); id., at 26–27 (“Numerous studies post-Graham indicate that&para;<br>exposure to deviant peers leads to increased deviant behavior and is a&para;<br>consistent predictor of adolescent delinquency” (footnote omitted)).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting&para;<br>Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Similarly, incapacitation could&para;<br>not support the life-without-parole sentence in Graham:&para;<br>Deciding that a “juvenile offender forever will be a danger&para;<br>to society” would require “mak[ing] a judgment that [he]&para;<br>is incorrigible”—but “ ‘incorrigibility is inconsistent with&para;<br>youth.’ ” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (quoting Workman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App.&para;<br>1968)). And for the same reason, rehabilitation could not&para;<br>justify that sentence. Life without parole “forswears&para;<br>altogether the rehabilitative ideal.” Graham, 560 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 23). It reflects “an irrevocable judgment&para;<br>about [an offender’s] value and place in society,” at odds&para;<br>with a child’s capacity for change. Ibid.&para;<br>Graham concluded from this analysis that life-withoutparole sentences, like capital punishment, may violate&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment when imposed on children. To be&para;<br>sure, Graham’s flat ban on life without parole applied only&para;<br>to nonhomicide crimes, and the Court took care to distinguish those offenses from murder, based on both moral&para;<br>culpability and consequential harm. See id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 18). But none of what it said about children—about&para;<br>their distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and environmental vulnerabilities—is crime-specific.&para;<br>Those&para;<br>features are evident in the same way, and to the same degree, when (as in both cases here) a botched robbery turns&para;<br>into a killing. So Graham’s reasoning implicates any lifewithout-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its&para;<br>categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.&para;<br>Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters&para;<br>in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole. In the circumstances there, juvenile status precluded a life-withoutparole sentence, even though an adult could receive it for a&para;<br>similar crime. And in other contexts as well, the characteristics of youth, and the way they weaken rationales for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>punishment, can render a life-without-parole sentence&para;<br>disproportionate. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 20–23) (generally doubting the penological justifications for imposing&para;<br>life without parole on juveniles). “An offender’s age,” we&para;<br>made clear in Graham, “is relevant to the Eighth Amendment,” and so “criminal procedure laws that fail to take&para;<br>defendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be&para;<br>flawed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 25). THE CHIEF JUSTICE,&para;<br>concurring in the judgment, made a similar point. Although rejecting a categorical bar on life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences for juveniles, he acknowledged “Roper’s conclusion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults,”&para;<br>and accordingly wrote that “an offender’s juvenile status&para;<br>can play a central role” in considering a sentence’s proportionality. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6); see id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 12) (Graham’s “youth is one factor, among others,&para;<br>that should be considered in deciding whether his punishment was unconstitutionally excessive”).6&para;<br>But the mandatory penalty schemes at issue here prevent the sentencer from taking account of these central&para;<br>considerations. By removing youth from the balance—&para;<br>by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole&para;<br>sentence applicable to an adult—these laws prohibit a&para;<br>sentencing authority from assessing whether the law’s&para;<br>harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a&para;<br>juvenile offender. That contravenes Graham’s (and also&para;<br>Roper’s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 In discussing Graham, the dissents essentially ignore all of this&para;<br>reasoning. See post, at 3–6 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post, at 4&para;<br>(opinion of ALITO, J.). Indeed, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ignores the points&para;<br>made in his own concurring opinion. The only part of Graham that the&para;<br>dissents see fit to note is the distinction it drew between homicide and&para;<br>nonhomicide offenses. See post, at 7–8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,&para;<br>at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But contrary to the dissents’ charge, our&para;<br>decision today retains that distinction: Graham established one rule (a&para;<br>flat ban) for nonhomicide offenses, while we set out a different one&para;<br>(individualized sentencing) for homicide offenses.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed&para;<br>as though they were not children.&para;<br>And Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes’&para;<br>defects in another way: by likening life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself.&para;<br>Life-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, “share some&para;<br>characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no&para;<br>other sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). Imprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of&para;<br>his life “by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.” Ibid. (citing&para;<br>Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300–301 (1983)). And this&para;<br>lengthiest possible incarceration is an “especially harsh&para;<br>punishment for a juvenile,” because he will almost inevitably serve “more years and a greater percentage of his life&para;<br>in prison than an adult offender.” Graham, 560 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 19–20). The penalty when imposed on a&para;<br>teenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore&para;<br>“the same . . . in name only.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).&para;<br>All of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part&para;<br>because we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as&para;<br>akin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that&para;<br>most severe punishment. We imposed a categorical ban on&para;<br>the sentence’s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of&para;<br>imprisonment. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); id., at ___&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (“For the first time&para;<br>in its history, the Court declares an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases&para;<br>alone”). And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription&para;<br>first established in the death penalty context—that the&para;<br>punishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide&para;<br>crimes against individuals. See Kennedy, 554 U. S. 407;&para;<br>Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).&para;<br>That correspondence—Graham’s “[t]reat[ment] [of]&para;<br>juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punishment,” 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>judgment) (slip op., at 5)—makes relevant here a second&para;<br>line of our precedents, demanding individualized sentencing when imposing the death penalty. In Woodson, 428&para;<br>U. S. 280, we held that a statute mandating a death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amendment. We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because&para;<br>it gave no significance to “the character and record of&para;<br>the individual offender or the circumstances” of the offense,&para;<br>and “exclud[ed] from consideration . . . the possibility of&para;<br>compassionate or mitigating factors.” Id., at 304. Subsequent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that&para;<br>capital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and&para;<br>the judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating factors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the&para;<br>most culpable defendants committing the most serious&para;<br>offenses. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 74–&para;<br>76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112&para;<br>(1982); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 597–609 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Of special pertinence here, we insisted in these rulings&para;<br>that a sentencer have the ability to consider the “mitigating qualities of youth.” Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,&para;<br>367 (1993). Everything we said in Roper and Graham&para;<br>about that stage of life also appears in these decisions. As&para;<br>we observed, “youth is more than a chronological fact.”&para;<br>Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115. It is a time of immaturity, irresponsibility, “impetuousness[,] and recklessness.” Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368. It is a moment and “condition&para;<br>of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence&para;<br>and to psychological damage.” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115.&para;<br>And its “signature qualities” are all “transient.” Johnson,&para;<br>509 U. S., at 368. Eddings is especially on point. There, a&para;<br>16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed&para;<br>him. We invalidated his death sentence because the judge&para;<br>did not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent&para;<br>family background (including his mother’s drug abuse and&para;<br>his father’s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We found that evidence “particularly relevant”—more so&para;<br>than it would have been in the case of an adult offender.&para;<br>455 U. S., at 115. We held: “[J]ust as the chronological age&para;<br>of a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great&para;<br>weight, so must the background and mental and emotional&para;<br>development of a youthful defendant be duly considered”&para;<br>in assessing his culpability. Id., at 116.&para;<br>In light of Graham’s reasoning, these decisions too show&para;<br>the flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. Such mandatory&para;<br>penalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from&para;<br>taking account of an offender’s age and the wealth of&para;<br>characteristics and circumstances attendant to it. Under&para;<br>these schemes, every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other—the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old,&para;<br>the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable&para;<br>household and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.&para;<br>And still worse, each juvenile (including these two 14year-olds) will receive the same sentence as the vast majority of adults committing similar homicide offenses—but&para;<br>really, as Graham noted, a greater sentence than those&para;<br>adults will serve.7 In meting out the death penalty, the&para;<br>elision of all these differences would be strictly forbidden.&para;<br>And once again, Graham indicates that a similar rule&para;<br>should apply when a juvenile confronts a sentence of life&para;<br>(and death) in prison.&para;<br>So Graham and Roper and our individualized sentenc——————&para;<br>7 Although adults are subject as well to the death penalty in many&para;<br>jurisdictions, very few offenders actually receive that sentence. See,&para;<br>e.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Rosenmerkel, M.&para;<br>Durose, &amp; D. Farole, Felony Sentences in State Courts 2006—&para;<br>Statistical Tables, p. 28 (Table 4.4) (rev. Nov. 22, 2010). So in practice,&para;<br>the sentencing schemes at issue here result in juvenile homicide&para;<br>offenders receiving the same nominal punishment as almost all adults,&para;<br>even though the two classes differ significantly in moral culpability and&para;<br>capacity for change.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing cases alike teach that in imposing a State’s harshest&para;<br>penalties, a sentencer misses too much if he treats every&para;<br>child as an adult. To recap: Mandatory life without parole&para;<br>for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological&para;<br>age and its hallmark features—among them, immaturity,&para;<br>impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking into account the family and&para;<br>home environment that surrounds him—and from which&para;<br>he cannot usually extricate himself—no matter how brutal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the&para;<br>homicide offense, including the extent of his participation&para;<br>in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures&para;<br>may have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might&para;<br>have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not&para;<br>for incompetencies associated with youth—for example,&para;<br>his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors&para;<br>(including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist&para;<br>his own attorneys. See, e.g., Graham, 560 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 27) (“[T]he features that distinguish juveniles&para;<br>from adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in&para;<br>criminal proceedings”); J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6) (discussing children’s&para;<br>responses to interrogation). And finally, this mandatory&para;<br>punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation&para;<br>even when the circumstances most suggest it.&para;<br>Both cases before us illustrate the problem. Take Jackson’s first. As noted earlier, Jackson did not fire the bullet&para;<br>that killed Laurie Troup; nor did the State argue that&para;<br>he intended her death. Jackson’s conviction was instead&para;<br>based on an aiding-and-abetting theory; and the appellate&para;<br>court affirmed the verdict only because the jury could have&para;<br>believed that when Jackson entered the store, he warned&para;<br>Troup that “[w]e ain’t playin’,” rather than told his friends&para;<br>that “I thought you all was playin’.” See 359 Ark., at&para;<br>90–92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 759–760; supra, at 2. To be sure,&para;<br>Jackson learned on the way to the video store that his&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>friend Shields was carrying a gun, but his age could well&para;<br>have affected his calculation of the risk that posed, as well&para;<br>as his willingness to walk away at that point. All these&para;<br>circumstances go to Jackson’s culpability for the offense.&para;<br>See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (“[W]hen&para;<br>compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who&para;<br>did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral&para;<br>culpability”). And so too does Jackson’s family background&para;<br>and immersion in violence: Both his mother and his&para;<br>grandmother had previously shot other individuals. See&para;<br>Record in No. 10–9647, pp. 80–82. At the least, a sentencer should look at such facts before depriving a 14year-old of any prospect of release from prison.&para;<br>That is true also in Miller’s case. No one can doubt that&para;<br>he and Smith committed a vicious murder. But they did it&para;<br>when high on drugs and alcohol consumed with the adult&para;<br>victim. And if ever a pathological background might have&para;<br>contributed to a 14-year-old’s commission of a crime, it is&para;<br>here. Miller’s stepfather physically abused him; his alcoholic and drug-addicted mother neglected him; he had&para;<br>been in and out of foster care as a result; and he had tried&para;<br>to kill himself four times, the first when he should have&para;<br>been in kindergarten. See 928 So. 2d, at 1081 (Cobb, J.,&para;<br>concurring in result); Miller App. 26–28; supra, at 4.&para;<br>Nonetheless, Miller’s past criminal history was limited—&para;<br>two instances of truancy and one of “second-degree criminal mischief.” No. CR–03–0915, at 6 (unpublished memorandum). That Miller deserved severe punishment for&para;<br>killing Cole Cannon is beyond question. But once again,&para;<br>a sentencer needed to examine all these circumstances&para;<br>before concluding that life without any possibility of parole&para;<br>was the appropriate penalty.&para;<br>We therefore hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a&para;<br>sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without&para;<br>possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Cf. Graham,&para;<br>560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (“A State is not required&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to guarantee eventual freedom,” but must provide “some&para;<br>meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation”). By making youth&para;<br>(and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of&para;<br>that harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too&para;<br>great a risk of disproportionate punishment. Because that&para;<br>holding is sufficient to decide these cases, we do not consider Jackson’s and Miller’s alternative argument that&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life&para;<br>without parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and&para;<br>younger. But given all we have said in Roper, Graham,&para;<br>and this decision about children’s diminished culpability&para;<br>and heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate&para;<br>occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible&para;<br>penalty will be uncommon. That is especially so because&para;<br>of the great difficulty we noted in Roper and Graham of&para;<br>distinguishing at this early age between “the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient&para;<br>immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime&para;<br>reflects irreparable corruption.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 573;&para;<br>Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Although we do&para;<br>not foreclose a sentencer’s ability to make that judgment&para;<br>in homicide cases, we require it to take into account how&para;<br>children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in&para;<br>prison.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Given&para;<br>&para;<br>our holding, and the dissents’ competing position, we see a&para;<br>certain irony in their repeated references to 17-year-olds who have&para;<br>committed the “most heinous” offenses, and their comparison of those&para;<br>defendants to the 14-year-olds here. See post, at 2 (opinion of ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J.) (noting the “17-year old [who] is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent victim”); post, at 3 (“the most heinous murders”); post,&para;<br>at 7 (“the worst types of murder”); post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.)&para;<br>(warning the reader not to be “confused by the particulars” of these two&para;<br>cases); post, at 1 (discussing the “171⁄2-year-old who sets off a bomb in&para;<br>a crowded mall”).

The States (along with the dissents) first&para;<br>contend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of&para;<br>our Eighth Amendment caselaw. And they next assert&para;<br>that the rule is unnecessary because individualized circumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a&para;<br>juvenile offender as an adult. We think the States are&para;<br>wrong on both counts.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The States (along with JUSTICE THOMAS) first claim that&para;<br>Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), precludes our&para;<br>holding. The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a&para;<br>mandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more&para;<br>than 650 grams of cocaine. The Court upheld that penalty, reasoning that “a sentence which is not otherwise cruel&para;<br>and unusual” does not “becom[e] so simply because it is&para;<br>‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. We recognized that a different&para;<br>rule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the&para;<br>death penalty context.

We have by&para;<br>now held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule&para;<br>permissible for adults may not be so for children. Capital&para;<br>punishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment—except it cannot be imposed on&para;<br>children. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Thompson, 487 U. S.&para;<br>815. So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhomicide offenses—except, once again, for children. See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). Nor are these&para;<br>sentencing decisions an oddity in the law. To the contrary,&para;<br>“ ‘[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition’ that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature&para;<br>adults.” J. D. B., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)&para;<br>(quoting Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115–116, citing examples&para;<br>from criminal, property, contract, and tort law). So if (as&para;<br>Harmelin recognized) “death is different,” children are&para;<br>different too. Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not&para;<br>have some form of exception for children. In that context,&para;<br>it is no surprise that the law relating to society’s harshest&para;<br>punishments recognizes such a distinction. Cf. Graham,&para;<br>560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)&para;<br>(slip op., at 7) (“Graham’s age places him in a significantly&para;<br>different category from the defendan[t] in . . . Harmelin”).&para;<br>Our ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor conflicts with Harmelin.&para;<br>Alabama and Arkansas (along with THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO) next contend that because many&para;<br>States impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on&para;<br>juveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional.&para;<br>In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and&para;<br>life without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether&para;<br>“ ‘objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in&para;<br>legislative enactments and state practice,’ ” show a “national consensus” against a sentence for a particular class&para;<br>of offenders. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)&para;<br>(quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). By our count, 29 juris-&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make&para;<br>a life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles&para;<br>convicted of murder in adult court.9 The States argue that&para;<br>this number precludes our holding.&para;<br>We do not agree; indeed, we think the States’ argument&para;<br>on this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham.&para;<br>For starters, the cases here are different from the typical&para;<br>one in which we have tallied legislative enactments. Our&para;<br>decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class&para;<br>of offenders or type of crime—as, for example, we did in&para;<br>Roper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process—considering an offender’s&para;<br>youth and attendant characteristics—before imposing a&para;<br>particular penalty. And in so requiring, our decision flows&para;<br>straightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the&para;<br>principle of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sentencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting&para;<br>out the law’s most serious punishments. When both of&para;<br>those circumstances have obtained in the past, we have&para;<br>not scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The&para;<br>&para;<br>States note that 26 States and the Federal Government make&para;<br>life without parole the mandatory (or mandatory minimum) punishment for some form of murder, and would apply the relevant provision&para;<br>to 14-year-olds (with many applying it to even younger defendants).&para;<br>See Alabama Brief 17–18. In addition, life without parole is mandatory&para;<br>for older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17). See&para;<br>La. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La.

In many of these jurisdictions, life without&para;<br>parole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of&para;<br>murder. That distinction makes no difference to our analysis. We have&para;<br>consistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to&para;<br>particular kinds of murder cannot cure the law’s “constitutional vice” of&para;<br>disregarding the “circumstances of the particular offense and the&para;<br>character and propensities of the offender.” Roberts v. Louisiana, 428&para;<br>U. S. 325, 333 (1976) (plurality opinion); see Sumner v. Shuman, 483&para;<br>U. S. 66 (1987).

We see no difference here.&para;<br>In any event, the “objective indicia” that the States offer&para;<br>do not distinguish these cases from others holding that&para;<br>a sentencing practice violates the Eighth Amendment. In&para;<br>Graham, we prohibited life-without-parole terms for&para;<br>juveniles committing nonhomicide offenses even though&para;<br>39 jurisdictions permitted that sentence. See 560 U.

That is 10 more than impose life&para;<br>without parole on juveniles on a mandatory basis.10 And&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 In assessing indicia of societal standards, Graham discussed “actual sentencing practices” in addition to legislative enactments, noting&para;<br>how infrequently sentencers imposed the statutorily available penalty.&para;<br>560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Here, we consider the constitutionality of mandatory sentencing schemes—which by definition remove a&para;<br>judge’s or jury’s discretion—so no comparable gap between legislation&para;<br>and practice can exist. Rather than showing whether sentencers&para;<br>consider life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders appropriate,&para;<br>the number of juveniles serving this sentence, see post, at 1, 3–4&para;<br>(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), merely reflects the number who have committed homicide in mandatory-sentencing jurisdictions. For the same&para;<br>reason, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s comparison of ratios in this case and Graham carries little weight. He contrasts the number of mandatory&para;<br>life-without-parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the&para;<br>number of juveniles arrested for murder, with “the corresponding&para;<br>number” of sentences in Graham (i.e., the number of life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences for juveniles who committed serious nonhomicide crimes, as&para;<br>compared to arrests for those crimes). Post, at 4. But because the&para;<br>mandatory nature of the sentences here necessarily makes them more&para;<br>common, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s figures do not “correspon[d]” at all. The&para;<br>higher ratio is mostly a function of removing the sentencer’s discretion.&para;<br>Where mandatory sentencing does not itself account for the number&para;<br>of juveniles serving life-without-parole terms, the evidence we have of&para;<br>practice supports our holding. Fifteen jurisdictions make life without&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10–9646, p. 19;&para;<br>Human Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serving Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP), Oct. 2, 2009, online at&para;<br>http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/02/state-distribution-juvenile-offendersserving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and&para;<br>available in Clerk of Court’s case file). That figure indicates that when&para;<br>given the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children&para;<br>relatively rarely. And contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s argument, see&para;<br>post, at 5, n. 2, we have held that when judges and juries do not often&para;<br>choose to impose a sentence, it at least should not be mandatory. See&para;<br>Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 295–296 (1976) (plurality&para;<br>opinion) (relying on the infrequency with which juries imposed the&para;<br>death penalty when given discretion to hold that its mandatory imposition violates the Eighth Amendment).&para;<br>11 In response, THE CHIEF JUSTICE complains: “To say that a sentence&para;<br>may be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it&para;<br>stands precedent on its head.” Post, at 5. To be clear: That description&para;<br>in no way resembles our opinion. We hold that the sentence violates&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment because, as we have exhaustively shown, it&para;<br>conflicts with the fundamental principles of Roper, Graham, and our&para;<br>individualized sentencing cases. We then show why the number of&para;<br>States imposing this punishment does not preclude our holding, and&para;<br>note how its mandatory nature (in however many States adopt it)&para;<br>makes use of actual sentencing numbers unilluminating.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>explained why simply counting them would present a&para;<br>distorted view. Most jurisdictions authorized the death&para;<br>penalty or life without parole for juveniles only through&para;<br>the combination of two independent statutory provisions.&para;<br>One allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to&para;<br>adult court, while another (often in a far-removed part of&para;<br>the code) set out the penalties for any and all individuals&para;<br>tried there. We reasoned that in those circumstances, it&para;<br>was impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed&para;<br>a given penalty for children (or would do so if presented&para;<br>with the choice). In Thompson, we found that the statutes&para;<br>“t[old] us that the States consider 15-year-olds to be old&para;<br>enough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or&para;<br>too old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court),&para;<br>but t[old] us nothing about the judgment these States&para;<br>have made regarding the appropriate punishment for such&para;<br>youthful offenders.” 487 U.

And Graham echoed that&para;<br>reasoning: Although the confluence of state laws “ma[de]&para;<br>life without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide&para;<br>offenders,” it did not “justify a judgment” that many&para;<br>States actually “intended to subject such offenders” to&para;<br>those sentences. 560 U.

But&para;<br>neither Graham nor Thompson suggested such reasoning, presumably&para;<br>because the time frame makes it difficult to comprehend. Those cases&para;<br>considered what legislators intended when they enacted, at different&para;<br>moments, separate juvenile-transfer and life-without-parole provisions—by definition, before they knew or could know how many juvenile life-without-parole sentences would result.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v.

But&para;<br>most States do not have separate penalty provisions for&para;<br>those juvenile offenders. Of the 29 jurisdictions mandating life without parole for children, more than half do so&para;<br>by virtue of generally applicable penalty provisions, imposing the sentence without regard to age.13 And indeed,&para;<br>some of those States set no minimum age for who may be&para;<br>transferred to adult court in the first instance, thus applying life-without-parole mandates to children of any age—&para;<br>be it 17 or 14 or 10 or 6.14 As in Graham, we think that&para;<br>“underscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile&para;<br>offender for life without parole does not indicate that the&para;<br>penalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express,&para;<br>and full legislative consideration.” 560 U.

ALABAMA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Adults: An Analysis of State Transfer Laws and Reporting&para;<br>5 (2011).&para;<br>Even when States give transfer-stage discretion to&para;<br>judges, it has limited utility. First, the decisionmaker&para;<br>typically will have only partial information at this early,&para;<br>pretrial stage about either the child or the circumstances&para;<br>of his offense. Miller’s case provides an example. As&para;<br>noted earlier, see n. 3, supra, the juvenile court denied&para;<br>Miller’s request for his own mental-health expert at the&para;<br>transfer hearing, and the appeals court affirmed on the&para;<br>ground that Miller was not then entitled to the protections&para;<br>and services he would receive at trial. See No. CR–03–&para;<br>0915, at 3–4 (unpublished memorandum). But by then, of&para;<br>course, the expert’s testimony could not change the sentence; whatever she said in mitigation, the mandatory&para;<br>life-without-parole prison term would kick in. The key moment for the exercise of discretion is the transfer—and as&para;<br>Miller’s case shows, the judge often does not know then&para;<br>what she will learn, about the offender or the offense, over&para;<br>the course of the proceedings.&para;<br>Second and still more important, the question at transfer hearings may differ dramatically from the issue at a&para;<br>post-trial sentencing. Because many juvenile systems&para;<br>require that the offender be released at a particular age or&para;<br>after a certain number of years, transfer decisions often&para;<br>present a choice between extremes: light punishment as a&para;<br>child or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without&para;<br>parole). In many States, for example, a child convicted in&para;<br>juvenile court must be released from custody by the age of&para;<br>21. See, e.g., Ala. Code §12–15–117(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011);&para;<br>see generally 2006 National Report 103 (noting limitations&para;<br>on the length of juvenile court sanctions). Discretionary&para;<br>sentencing in adult court would provide different options:&para;<br>There, a judge or jury could choose, rather than a lifewithout-parole sentence, a lifetime prison term with the&para;<br>possibility of parole or a lengthy term of years.

In my view, without such a&para;<br>finding, the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Graham&para;<br>forbids sentencing Jackson to such a sentence, regardless&para;<br>of whether its application is mandatory or discretionary&para;<br>under state law.&para;<br>In Graham we said that “when compared to an adult&para;<br>murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to&para;<br>kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.” Ibid. (emphasis added). For one thing, “compared to adults, juveniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>of responsibility; they are more vulnerable or susceptible&para;<br>to negative influences and outside pressures, including&para;<br>peer pressure; and their characters are not as well&para;<br>formed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). See also ibid. (“[P]sychology and brain&para;<br>science continue to show fundamental differences between&para;<br>juvenile and adult minds” making their actions “less likely&para;<br>to be evidence of ‘irretrievably depraved character’ than&para;<br>are the actions of adults” (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543&para;<br>U. S. 551, 570 (2005))); ante, at 8–9. For another thing,&para;<br>Graham recognized that lack of intent normally diminishes the “moral culpability” that attaches to the crime in&para;<br>question, making those that do not intend to kill “categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>18) (citing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 434–435&para;<br>(2008); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Tison v.&para;<br>Arizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987)). And we concluded that,&para;<br>because of this “twice diminished moral culpability,” the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition upon juveniles&para;<br>of a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide cases.&para;<br>Graham, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 18, 32).&para;<br>Given Graham’s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that&para;<br>can subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must&para;<br>exclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills&para;<br>nor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile&para;<br>either kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks “twice&para;<br>diminished” responsibility. But where the juvenile neither&para;<br>kills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Graham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would&para;<br>permit life without parole for “juveniles who commit the&para;<br>worst types of murder,” post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of&para;<br>one who did not himself kill or intend to kill.&para;<br>I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,&para;<br>the question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>murder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in&para;<br>the course of a felony to all participants who intended to&para;<br>commit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or&para;<br>intended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal&para;<br>Law §§14.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been&para;<br>based on the idea of “transferred intent”; the defendant’s&para;<br>intent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill&para;<br>required for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, &amp; C.&para;<br>Steiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.&para;<br>2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton’s Criminal Law §147 (15th ed.&para;<br>1994).&para;<br>But in my opinion, this type of “transferred intent” is&para;<br>not sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could&para;<br>subject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As&para;<br>an initial matter, this Court has made clear that this&para;<br>artificially constructed kind of intent does not count as&para;<br>intent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not&para;<br>rely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may&para;<br>receive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids&para;<br>imposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in&para;<br>a robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and&para;<br>simply was “in the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting&para;<br>to help the robbers escape.” Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.&para;<br>Tison, supra, at 157–158 (capital punishment permissible for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death&para;<br>because he was “actively involved” in every aspect of the&para;<br>kidnaping and his behavior showed “a reckless disregard&para;<br>for human life”). Given Graham, this holding applies to&para;<br>juvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See&para;<br>ante, at 12–13. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison&para;<br>standard of “reckless disregard” may not be eligible for life&para;<br>without parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The&para;<br>only juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to&para;<br>life without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses&para;<br>who “kill or intend to kill.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 18).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,&para;<br>there is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without&para;<br>parole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to&para;<br>kill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant’s&para;<br>intent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dangerous felony should understand the risk that the victim&para;<br>of the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2&para;<br>LaFave, supra, §14.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the&para;<br>full consequences of a course of action and to adjust one’s&para;<br>conduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles&para;<br>lack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8–9. Justice Frankfurter cautioned, “Legal theories and their phrasing in&para;<br>other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncritically transferred to a determination of a State’s duty toward children.” May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 536&para;<br>(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of&para;<br>transferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to&para;<br>sentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve&para;<br>such “fallacious reasoning.” Ibid.&para;<br>This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation present in Kuntrell Jackson’s case. Jackson simply went&para;<br>along with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he&para;<br>became aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially&para;<br>stayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying something like “We ain’t playin’ ” or “ ‘I thought you all was&para;<br>playin,’ ” before an older confederate shot and killed the&para;<br>store clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S. W. 3d&para;<br>757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of&para;<br>first-degree murder under a statute that permitted them&para;<br>to convict if, Jackson “attempted to commit or committed&para;<br>an aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that offense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk’s] death&para;<br>under circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the&para;<br>value of human life.” Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. §5–10–&para;<br>101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,&para;<br>Jackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>not), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even “extreme indifference.” As long as one of the teenage accomplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to&para;<br>the value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of&para;<br>capital murder. Ibid.&para;<br>The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,&para;<br>might not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.&para;<br>Norris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,&para;<br>J., dissenting) (“[A]ny evidence of [Jackson’s] intent to kill&para;<br>was severely lacking”). In that case, the Eighth Amendment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the&para;<br>possibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a&para;<br>finding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk’s death,&para;<br>the question remains open whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a&para;<br>juvenile in those circumstances as well.

Our role, however, is to&para;<br>apply the law, not to answer such questions. The pertinent law here is the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments.”&para;<br>Today, the Court invokes that Amendment to ban a punishment that the Court does not itself characterize as unusual, and that could not plausibly be described as such.&para;<br>I therefore dissent.&para;<br>The parties agree that nearly 2,500 prisoners are presently serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for murders they committed before the age of 18.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner in No. 10–9647, p. 62, n. 80 (Jackson&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief ); Brief for Respondent in No. 10–9646, p. 30 (Alabama Brief ). The Court accepts that over 2,000 of those&para;<br>prisoners received that sentence because it was mandated&para;<br>by a legislature. Ante, at 22, n. 10. And it recognizes&para;<br>that the Federal Government and most States impose such&para;<br>mandatory sentences. Ante, at 19–20. Put simply, if a 17year-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent&para;<br>victim, it is not “unusual” for the murderer to receive a&para;<br>mandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality&para;<br>should preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment&para;<br>for juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.&para;<br>Our precedent supports this conclusion. When determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this&para;<br>Court typically begins with “ ‘objective indicia of society’s&para;<br>standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and&para;<br>state practice.’ ” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 10); see also, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana,&para;<br>554 U. S. 407, 422 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543&para;<br>U. S. 551, 564 (2005). We look to these “objective indicia” to&para;<br>ensure that we are not simply following our own subjective&para;<br>values or beliefs. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.

Graham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>10). If there is, the punishment may be regarded as “unusual.” But when, as here, most States formally require&para;<br>and frequently impose the punishment in question, there&para;<br>is no objective basis for that conclusion.&para;<br>Our Eighth Amendment cases have also said that we&para;<br>should take guidance from “evolving standards of decency&para;<br>that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Ante, at 6&para;<br>(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976); internal quotation marks omitted). Mercy toward the guilty&para;<br>can be a form of decency, and a maturing society may&para;<br>abandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

A decent society protects the innocent from&para;<br>violence. A mature society may determine that this requires removing those guilty of the most heinous murders&para;<br>from its midst, both as protection for its other members&para;<br>and as a concrete expression of its standards of decency.&para;<br>As judges we have no basis for deciding that progress&para;<br>toward greater decency can move only in the direction of&para;<br>easing sanctions on the guilty.&para;<br>In this case, there is little doubt about the direction of&para;<br>society’s evolution: For most of the 20th century, American&para;<br>sentencing practices emphasized rehabilitation of the&para;<br>offender and the availability of parole. But by the 1980’s,&para;<br>outcry against repeat offenders, broad disaffection with&para;<br>the rehabilitative model, and other factors led many legislatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole,&para;<br>imposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals&para;<br>and prevent them from committing more crimes. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Alschuler, The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punishment, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 1–13 (2003); see generally&para;<br>Crime and Public Policy (J. Wilson &amp; J.

S. 35, 78, and n. 10&para;<br>(2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). And the&para;<br>parties agree that most States have changed their laws&para;<br>relatively recently to expose teenage murderers to mandatory life without parole. Jackson Brief 54–55; Alabama&para;<br>Brief 4–5.&para;<br>The Court attempts to avoid the import of the fact that&para;<br>so many jurisdictions have embraced the sentencing practice at issue by comparing this case to the Court’s prior&para;<br>Eighth Amendment cases. The Court notes that Graham&para;<br>found a punishment authorized in 39 jurisdictions unconstitutional, whereas the punishment it bans today is&para;<br>mandated in 10 fewer. Ante, at 21. But Graham went to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>considerable lengths to show that although theoretically&para;<br>allowed in many States, the sentence at issue in that case&para;<br>was “exceedingly rare” in practice. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 16). The Court explained that only 123 prisoners&para;<br>in the entire Nation were serving life without parole for&para;<br>nonhomicide crimes committed as juveniles, with more&para;<br>than half in a single State. It contrasted that with statistics showing nearly 400,000 juveniles were arrested for&para;<br>serious nonhomicide offenses in a single year. Based on&para;<br>the sentence’s rarity despite the many opportunities to impose it, Graham concluded that there was a national&para;<br>consensus against life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide crimes. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13–16).&para;<br>Here the number of mandatory life without parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of&para;<br>juveniles arrested for murder, is over 5,000 times higher&para;<br>than the corresponding number in Graham. There is thus&para;<br>nothing in this case like the evidence of national consensus in Graham.1&para;<br>The Court disregards these numbers, claiming that the&para;<br>prevalence of the sentence in question results from the&para;<br>number of statutes requiring its imposition. Ante, at 21,&para;<br>n. 10. True enough. The sentence at issue is statutorily&para;<br>mandated life without parole. Such a sentence can only&para;<br>result from statutes requiring its imposition. In Graham&para;<br>the Court relied on the low number of actual sentences to&para;<br>explain why the high number of statutes allowing such&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Graham stated that 123 prisoners were serving life without parole&para;<br>for nonhomicide offenses committed as juveniles, while in 2007 alone&para;<br>380,480 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomicide crimes. 560&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13–14). I use 2,000 as the number of prisoners&para;<br>serving mandatory life without parole sentences for murders committed&para;<br>as juveniles, because all seem to accept that the number is at least that&para;<br>high. And the same source Graham used reports that 1,170 juveniles&para;<br>were arrested for murder and nonnegligent homicide in 2009.

Here, the Court excuses&para;<br>the high number of actual sentences by citing the high&para;<br>number of statutes imposing it. To say that a sentence&para;<br>may be considered unusual because so many legislatures&para;<br>approve it stands precedent on its head.2&para;<br>The Court also advances another reason for discounting&para;<br>the laws enacted by Congress and most state legislatures. Some of the jurisdictions that impose mandatory life&para;<br>without parole on juvenile murderers do so as a result of&para;<br>two statutes: one providing that juveniles charged with&para;<br>serious crimes may be tried as adults, and another generally mandating that those convicted of murder be imprisoned for life. According to the Court, our cases suggest&para;<br>that where the sentence results from the interaction of two&para;<br>such statutes, the legislature can be considered to have&para;<br>imposed the resulting sentences “inadvertent[ly].” Ante,&para;<br>at 22–25. The Court relies on Graham and Thompson v.&para;<br>Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24 (1988) (plurality&para;<br>opinion), for the proposition that these laws are therefore&para;<br>not valid evidence of society’s views on the punishment at&para;<br>issue.&para;<br>It is a fair question whether this Court should ever&para;<br>assume a legislature is so ignorant of its own laws that it&para;<br>does not understand that two of them interact with each&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Court’s reference to discretionary sentencing practices is a distraction. See ante, at 21–22, n. 10. The premise of the Court’s decision&para;<br>is that mandatory sentences are categorically different from discretionary ones. So under the Court’s own logic, whether discretionary sentences are common or uncommon has nothing to do with whether&para;<br>mandatory sentences are unusual. In any event, if analysis of discretionary sentences were relevant, it would not provide objective support&para;<br>for today’s decision. The Court states that “about 15% of all juvenile&para;<br>life-without-parole sentences”—meaning nearly 400 sentences—were&para;<br>imposed at the discretion of a judge or jury. Ante, at 22, n. 10. Thus&para;<br>the number of discretionary life without parole sentences for juvenile&para;<br>murderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is&para;<br>about 1,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>other, especially on an issue of such importance as the one&para;<br>before us. But in Graham and Thompson it was at least&para;<br>plausible as a practical matter. In Graham, the extreme&para;<br>rarity with which the sentence in question was imposed&para;<br>could suggest that legislatures did not really intend the&para;<br>inevitable result of the laws they passed. See 560 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 15–16). In Thompson, the sentencing&para;<br>practice was even rarer—only 20 defendants had received&para;<br>it in the last century. 487 U. S., at 832 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>Perhaps under those facts it could be argued that the legislature was not fully aware that a teenager could receive the particular sentence in question. But here the&para;<br>widespread and recent imposition of the sentence makes it&para;<br>implausible to characterize this sentencing practice as a&para;<br>collateral consequence of legislative ignorance.3&para;<br>Nor do we display our usual respect for elected officials&para;<br>by asserting that legislators have accidentally required&para;<br>2,000 teenagers to spend the rest of their lives in jail. This&para;<br>is particularly true given that our well-publicized decision&para;<br>in Graham alerted legislatures to the possibility that&para;<br>teenagers were subject to life with parole only because of&para;<br>legislative inadvertence. I am aware of no effort in the&para;<br>wake of Graham to correct any supposed legislative oversight. Indeed, in amending its laws in response to Graham one legislature made especially clear that it does&para;<br>intend juveniles who commit first-degree murder to receive mandatory life without parole. See Iowa Code Ann.&para;<br>§902.1 (West Cum. Supp. 2012).&para;<br>In the end, the Court does not actually conclude that&para;<br>mandatory life sentences for juvenile murderers are unusual. It instead claims that precedent “leads to” today’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court claims that I “take issue with some or all of these precedents” and “seek to relitigate” them.

Petitioners argue that the reasoning of those cases&para;<br>“compels” finding in their favor. Jackson Brief 34. The&para;<br>Court is apparently unwilling to go so far, asserting only&para;<br>that precedent points in that direction. But today’s decision invalidates the laws of dozens of legislatures and&para;<br>Congress. This Court is not easily led to such a result.&para;<br>See, e.g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883)&para;<br>(courts must presume an Act of Congress is constitutional&para;<br>“unless the lack of constitutional authority . . . is clearly&para;<br>demonstrated”). Because the Court does not rely on the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment’s text or objective evidence of society’s&para;<br>standards, its analysis of precedent alone must bear the&para;<br>“heavy burden [that] rests on those who would attack the&para;<br>judgment of the representatives of the people.” Gregg, 428&para;<br>U. S., at 175. If the Court is unwilling to say that precedent compels today’s decision, perhaps it should reconsider&para;<br>that decision.&para;<br>In any event, the Court’s holding does not follow from&para;<br>Roper and Graham. Those cases undoubtedly stand for&para;<br>the proposition that teenagers are less mature, less responsible, and less fixed in their ways than adults—not&para;<br>that a Supreme Court case was needed to establish that.&para;<br>What they do not stand for, and do not even suggest, is&para;<br>that legislators—who also know that teenagers are different from adults—may not require life without parole for&para;<br>juveniles who commit the worst types of murder.&para;<br>That Graham does not imply today’s result could not be&para;<br>clearer. In barring life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, Graham stated that “[t]here is a line&para;<br>‘between homicide and other serious violent offenses&para;<br>against the individual.’ ” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18)&para;<br>(quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27)). The&para;<br>whole point of drawing a line between one issue and another is to say that they are different and should be&para;<br>treated differently. In other words, the two are in different&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>categories. Which Graham also said: “defendants who do&para;<br>not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are&para;<br>categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of&para;<br>punishment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 18) (emphasis added). Of course, to be especially&para;<br>clear that what is said about one issue does not apply to&para;<br>another, one could say that the two issues cannot be compared. Graham said that too: “Serious nonhomicide&para;<br>crimes . . . cannot be compared to murder.” Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). A case that expressly puts an&para;<br>issue in a different category from its own subject, draws a&para;<br>line between the two, and states that the two should not&para;<br>be compared, cannot fairly be said to control that issue.&para;<br>Roper provides even less support for the Court’s holding.&para;<br>In that case, the Court held that the death penalty could&para;<br>not be imposed for offenses committed by juveniles, no&para;<br>matter how serious their crimes. In doing so, Roper also&para;<br>set itself in a different category than this case, by expressly invoking “special” Eighth Amendment analysis for&para;<br>death penalty cases. 543 U. S., at 568–569. But more&para;<br>importantly, Roper reasoned that the death penalty was&para;<br>not needed to deter juvenile murderers in part because&para;<br>“life imprisonment without the possibility of parole” was&para;<br>available. Id., at 572. In a classic bait and switch, the&para;<br>Court now tells state legislatures that—Roper’s promise&para;<br>notwithstanding—they do not have power to guarantee&para;<br>that once someone commits a heinous murder, he will&para;<br>never do so again.

See ante, at 11–17. But then—&para;<br>although doing so is entirely unnecessary to the rule it&para;<br>announces—the Court states that even when a life without parole sentence is not mandatory, “we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest&para;<br>possible penalty will be uncommon.” Ante, at 17. Today’s&para;<br>holding may be limited to mandatory sentences, but the&para;<br>Court has already announced that discretionary life without parole for juveniles should be “uncommon”—or, to use&para;<br>a common synonym, “unusual.”&para;<br>Indeed, the Court’s gratuitous prediction appears to be&para;<br>nothing other than an invitation to overturn life without&para;<br>parole sentences imposed by juries and trial judges. If&para;<br>that invitation is widely accepted and such sentences for&para;<br>juvenile offenders do in fact become “uncommon,” the&para;<br>Court will have bootstrapped its way to declaring that the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment absolutely prohibits them.&para;<br>This process has no discernible end point—or at least&para;<br>none consistent with our Nation’s legal traditions. Roper&para;<br>and Graham attempted to limit their reasoning to the&para;<br>circumstances they addressed—Roper to the death penalty,&para;<br>and Graham to nonhomicide crimes. Having cast aside&para;<br>those limits, the Court cannot now offer a credible substitute, and does not even try. After all, the Court tells us,&para;<br>“none of what [Graham] said about children . . . is crimespecific.” Ante, at 10. The principle behind today’s decision seems to be only that because juveniles are different&para;<br>from adults, they must be sentenced differently. See ante,&para;<br>at 14–17. There is no clear reason that principle would&para;<br>not bar all mandatory sentences for juveniles, or any&para;<br>juvenile sentence as harsh as what a similarly situated&para;<br>adult would receive. Unless confined, the only stopping&para;<br>point for the Court’s analysis would be never permitting&para;<br>juvenile offenders to be tried as adults. Learning that an&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

But also for the murderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early.

Of these categorical proportionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis on&para;<br>Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), and Graham v.&para;<br>Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). In Roper, the Court held&para;<br>that the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender&para;<br>who was under 18 at the time of his offense. 543 U. S.,&para;<br>at 578. The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its&para;<br>own sense of parental intuition and “scientific and sociological studies” to conclude that offenders under the age of&para;<br>18 “cannot with reliability be classified among the worst&para;<br>offenders.” Id., at 569. In Graham, the Court relied on&para;<br>similar considerations to conclude that the Constitution&para;<br>prohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a nonhomicide&para;<br>offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his&para;<br>offense. 560 U.

But neither Roper nor&para;<br>Graham held that specific procedural rules are required&para;<br>for sentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic&para;<br>of those cases should not be extended to create such a&para;<br>requirement.&para;<br>The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States&para;<br>by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: “Excessive&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion because it accurately explains&para;<br>that, even accepting the Court’s precedents, the Court’s holding in&para;<br>today’s cases is unsupportable.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

California, 538 U. S. 11, 32 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment); see generally Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.&para;<br>957, 975–985 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.). In short, it&para;<br>does not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment&para;<br>they deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime&para;<br>or to a particular class of offenders. Instead, the clause&para;<br>“leaves the unavoidably moral question of who ‘deserves’ a&para;<br>particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the&para;<br>judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty.”&para;<br>Graham, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 5).&para;<br>The legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like those of&para;<br>27 other jurisdictions, ante, at 19–20, have determined&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Neither the Court nor petitioners argue that petitioners’ sentences&para;<br>would have been among “the ‘modes or acts of punishment that had&para;<br>been considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights&para;<br>was adopted.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip&para;<br>op., at 10, n. 3) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986)).&para;<br>Nor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old at the time they committed their crimes. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds&para;<br>were subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders. See Roper v.&para;<br>Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 609, n. 1 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Further, mandatory death sentences were common at that time. See&para;<br>Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 994–995 (1991). It is therefore&para;<br>implausible that a 14-year-old’s mandatory prison sentence—of any&para;<br>length, with or without parole—would have been viewed as cruel and&para;<br>unusual.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that all offenders convicted of specified homicide offenses,&para;<br>whether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in&para;<br>prison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our&para;<br>Constitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.&para;<br>II&para;<br>To invalidate mandatory life-without-parole sentences&para;<br>for juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases “prohibit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7. The Court reasons that, because Graham&para;<br>compared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the&para;<br>death penalty, the “distinctive set of legal rules” that this&para;<br>Court has imposed in the capital punishment context,&para;<br>including the requirement of individualized sentencing, is&para;<br>“relevant” here. Ante, at 12–13. But even accepting an&para;<br>analogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences, this Court’s cases prohibiting mandatory capital sentencing schemes have no basis in the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot&para;<br>justify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate&para;<br>life-without-parole sentences for juveniles.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In a line of cases following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.&para;<br>238 (1972) (per curiam), this Court prohibited the mandatory imposition of the death penalty. See Woodson v.&para;<br>North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion);&para;<br>Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (same); Sumner&para;<br>v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). Furman first announced&para;<br>the principle that States may not permit sentencers to&para;<br>exercise unguided discretion in imposing the death penalty. See generally 408 U. S. 238. In response to Furman,&para;<br>many States passed new laws that made the death penalty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes,&para;<br>thereby eliminating the offending discretion. See Gregg&para;<br>v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 180–181 (1976) (joint opinion&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The Court invalidated those statutes in Woodson, Roberts, and Sumner.&para;<br>The Court reasoned that mandatory capital sentencing&para;<br>schemes were problematic, because they failed “to allow&para;<br>the particularized consideration” of “relevant facets of the&para;<br>character and record of the individual offender or the&para;<br>circumstances of the particular offense.” Woodson, supra,&para;<br>at 303–304 (plurality opinion).3&para;<br>In my view, Woodson and its progeny were wrongly&para;<br>decided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual&para;<br>Punishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits&para;<br>“torturous methods of punishment.” See Graham, 560&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with&para;<br>whether a particular lawful method of punishment—&para;<br>whether capital or noncapital—is imposed pursuant to a&para;<br>mandatory or discretionary sentencing regime. See Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (“The prohibition of the Eighth Amendment&para;<br>relates to the character of the punishment, and not to the&para;<br>process by which it is imposed”). In fact, “[i]n the early&para;<br>days of the Republic,” each crime generally had a defined&para;<br>punishment “prescribed with specificity by the legislature.” United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45 (1978).&para;<br>Capital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defendants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital cases be permitted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of&para;<br>the defendant. See, e.g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 597–608 (1978)&para;<br>(plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112&para;<br>(1982); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1986); Johnson v.&para;<br>Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 361–368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the&para;<br>requirement that sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating&para;<br>evidence when deciding whether to impose a nonmandatory capital&para;<br>sentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibit mandatory capital&para;<br>sentences. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 488–500 (1993)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>treated no differently. “[M]andatory death sentences&para;<br>abounded in our first Penal Code” and were “common in&para;<br>the several States—both at the time of the founding and&para;<br>throughout the 19th century.” Harmelin, 501 U. S., at&para;<br>994–995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opinion) (“At the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted&para;<br>in 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law&para;<br>practice of making death the exclusive and mandatory&para;<br>sentence for certain specified offenses”). Accordingly, the&para;<br>idea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwiseconstitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and&para;<br>unusual finds “no support in the text and history of the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment.” Harmelin, supra, at 994.&para;<br>Moreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were “a&para;<br>perfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns&para;<br>expressed in Furman” regarding unguided sentencing&para;<br>discretion, in that they “eliminat[ed] explicit jury discretion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.” Graham v.&para;<br>Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring). And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years&para;<br>ago, “a State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide&para;<br>that the commission of certain crimes conclusively establishes that a criminal’s character is such that he deserves&para;<br>death.” Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion). Thus,&para;<br>there is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional. Because the&para;<br>Court’s cases requiring individualized sentencing in the&para;<br>capital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a&para;<br>valid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory&para;<br>life-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court&para;<br>announces today.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In any event, this Court has already declined to extend&para;<br>its individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death penalty context. In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

In accordance with Michigan&para;<br>law, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison&para;<br>without the possibility of parole. Ibid. Citing the same&para;<br>line of death penalty precedents on which the Court relies&para;<br>today, the defendant argued that his sentence, due to its&para;<br>mandatory nature, violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. Id., at 994–995 (opinion of the Court).&para;<br>The Court rejected that argument, explaining that&para;<br>“[t]here can be no serious contention . . . that a sentence&para;<br>which is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so simply because it is ‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. In so doing,&para;<br>the Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases.&para;<br>The Court noted that those cases had “repeatedly suggested&para;<br>that there is no comparable [individualized-sentencing]&para;<br>requirement outside the capital context, because of the&para;<br>qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.” Ibid. The Court observed that, “even where the&para;<br>difference” between a sentence of life without parole and&para;<br>other sentences of imprisonment “is the greatest,” such&para;<br>a sentence “cannot be compared with death.” Id., at 996.&para;<br>Therefore, the Court concluded that the line of cases requiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at capital cases, and that there was “no basis for extending it&para;<br>further.” Ibid.&para;<br>Harmelin’s reasoning logically extends to these cases.&para;<br>Obviously, the younger the defendant, “the great[er]” the&para;<br>difference between a sentence of life without parole and&para;<br>other terms of imprisonment. Ibid. But under Harmelin’s&para;<br>rationale, the defendant’s age is immaterial to the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment analysis. Thus, the result in today’s cases&para;<br>should be the same as that in Harmelin. Petitioners, like&para;<br>the defendant in Harmelin, were not sentenced to death.&para;<br>Accordingly, this Court’s cases “creating and clarifying the&para;<br>individualized capital sentencing doctrine” do not apply.&para;<br>Id., at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v.

S. 584,&para;<br>592 (1977) (plurality opinion))).&para;<br>In this search for objective indicia, the Court toyed with&para;<br>the use of public opinion polls, see Atkins, supra, at 316,&para;<br>n. 21, and occasionally relied on foreign law, see Roper v.&para;<br>Simmons, supra, at 575; Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S.&para;<br>782, 796, n. 22 (1982); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S.&para;<br>815, 830–831 (1988); Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10 (plu­&para;<br>rality opinion).&para;<br>In the main, however, the staple of this inquiry was the&para;<br>tallying of the positions taken by state legislatures. Thus,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>in Coker, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohib­&para;<br>its the imposition of the death penalty for the rape of an&para;<br>adult woman, the Court noted that only one State permit­&para;<br>ted that practice. Id., at 595–596. In Enmund, where the&para;<br>Court held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital&para;<br>punishment for ordinary felony murder, both federal law&para;<br>and the law of 28 of the 36 States that authorized the&para;<br>death penalty at the time rejected that punishment. 458&para;<br>U. S., at 789.&para;<br>While the tally in these early cases may be character­&para;<br>ized as evidence of a national consensus, the evidence&para;<br>became weaker and weaker in later cases. In Atkins,&para;<br>which held that low-IQ defendants may not be sentenced&para;<br>to death, the Court found an anti–death-penalty consen­&para;<br>sus even though more than half of the States that allowed&para;<br>capital punishment permitted the practice. See 536 U. S.,&para;<br>at 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (observing that less than&para;<br>half of the 38 States that permit capital punishment&para;<br>have enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally&para;<br>retarded). The Court attempted to get around this prob­&para;<br>lem by noting that there was a pronounced trend against&para;<br>this punishment. See id., at 313–315 (listing 18 States&para;<br>that had amended their laws since 1986 to prohibit the&para;<br>execution of mentally retarded persons).&para;<br>The importance of trend evidence, however, was not&para;<br>long lived. In Roper, which outlawed capital punishment&para;<br>for defendants between the ages of 16 and 18, the lineup of&para;<br>the States was the same as in Atkins, but the trend in&para;<br>favor of abolition—five States during the past 15 years—&para;<br>was less impressive. Roper, 543 U. S., at 564–565. Never­&para;<br>theless, the Court held that the absence of a strong trend&para;<br>in support of abolition did not matter. See id., at 566&para;<br>(“Any difference between this case and Atkins with respect&para;<br>to the pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the&para;<br>consistent direction of the change”).&para;<br>In Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court went further. Hold­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing that the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punish­&para;<br>ment for the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl, the Court&para;<br>disregarded a nascent legislative trend in favor of permitting capital punishment for this narrowly defined and&para;<br>heinous crime. See 554 U. S., at 433 (explaining that,&para;<br>although “the total number of States to have made child&para;<br>rape a capital offense . . . is six,” “[t]his is not an indication&para;<br>of a trend or change in direction comparable to the one&para;<br>supported by data in Roper”). The Court felt no need to&para;<br>see whether this trend developed further—perhaps be­&para;<br>cause true moral evolution can lead in only one direction.&para;<br>And despite the argument that the rape of a young child&para;<br>may involve greater depravity than some murders, the&para;<br>Court proclaimed that homicide is categorically different&para;<br>from all (or maybe almost all) other offenses. See id.,&para;<br>at 438 (stating that nonhomicide crimes, including child&para;<br>rape, “may be devastating in their harm . . . but in terms&para;<br>of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and&para;<br>to the public, they cannot be compared to murder in their&para;<br>severity and irrevocability” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>and citation omitted)). As the Court had previously put&para;<br>it, “death is different.” Ford, supra, at 411 (plurality&para;<br>opinion).&para;<br>Two years after Kennedy, in Graham v. Florida, any&para;<br>pretense of heeding a legislative consensus was discarded.&para;<br>In Graham, federal law and the law of 37 States and the&para;<br>District of Columbia permitted a minor to be sentenced to&para;<br>life imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide crimes,&para;<br>but despite this unmistakable evidence of a national con­&para;<br>sensus, the Court held that the practice violates the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment. See 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (slip op., at 1–3). The Court, however, drew a&para;<br>distinction between minors who murder and minors who&para;<br>commit other heinous offenses, so at least in that sense&para;<br>the principle that death is different lived on.&para;<br>Today, that principle is entirely put to rest, for here we&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>are concerned with the imposition of a term of imprison­&para;<br>ment on offenders who kill. The two (carefully selected)&para;<br>cases before us concern very young defendants, and de­&para;<br>spite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at&para;<br>least one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy&para;<br>for a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of&para;<br>release. But no one should be confused by the particulars&para;<br>of the two cases before us. The category of murderers that&para;<br>the Court delicately calls “children” (murderers under the&para;<br>age of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are&para;<br>fast approaching the legal age of adulthood. Evan Miller&para;<br>and Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical&para;<br>are murderers like Christopher Simmons, who committed&para;<br>a brutal thrill-killing just seven months shy of his 18th&para;<br>birthday. Roper, 543 U. S., at 556.&para;<br>Seventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of&para;<br>murders every year,1 and some of these crimes are incred­&para;<br>ibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as ma­&para;<br>ture as the average 18-year-old. See Thompson, 487 U. S.,&para;<br>at 854 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that&para;<br>maturity may “vary widely among different individuals of&para;<br>the same age”). Congress and the legislatures of 43 States&para;<br>have concluded that at least some of these murderers&para;<br>should be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28&para;<br>States and the Federal Government have decided that for&para;<br>some of these offenders life without parole should be man­&para;<br>datory. See Ante, at 20–21, and nn. 9–10. The majority of&para;<br>this Court now overrules these legislative judgments.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Between&para;<br>&para;<br>2002 and 2010, 17-year-olds committed an average com­&para;<br>bined total of 424 murders and nonnegligent homicides per year. See&para;<br>Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, §4, Arrests, Age of per­&para;<br>sons arrested (Table 4.7).&para;<br>2 As the Court noted in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366&para;<br>(1989), Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate&para;<br>discretionary sentencing and parole because it concluded that these&para;<br>practices had led to gross abuses. The Senate Report for the 1984 bill&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MILLER v. ALABAMA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>It is true that, at least for now, the Court apparently&para;<br>permits a trial judge to make an individualized decision&para;<br>that a particular minor convicted of murder should be&para;<br>sentenced to life without parole, but do not expect this&para;<br>possibility to last very long. The majority goes out of its&para;<br>way to express the view that the imposition of a sentence&para;<br>of life without parole on a “child” (i.e., a murderer under&para;<br>the age of 18) should be uncommon. Having held in Graham that a trial judge with discretionary sentencing&para;<br>authority may not impose a sentence of life without parole&para;<br>on a minor who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the&para;<br>Justices in the majority may soon extend that holding to&para;<br>minors who commit murder. We will see.&para;<br>What today’s decision shows is that our Eighth Amend­&para;<br>ment cases are no longer tied to any objective indicia of&para;<br>society’s standards. Our Eighth Amendment case law is&para;<br>now entirely inward looking. After entirely disregarding&para;<br>objective indicia of our society’s standards in Graham, the&para;<br>Court now extrapolates from Graham. Future cases may&para;<br>extrapolate from today’s holding, and this process may&para;<br>continue until the majority brings sentencing practices&para;<br>into line with whatever the majority views as truly&para;<br>evolved standards of decency.&para;<br>The Eighth Amendment imposes certain limits on the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>rejected what it called the “outmoded rehabilitation model” for federal&para;<br>criminal sentencing. S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 38 (1983). According to&para;<br>the Report, “almost everyone involved in the criminal justice system now&para;<br>doubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a prison setting,&para;<br>and it is now quite certain that no one can really detect whether or&para;<br>when a prisoner is rehabilitated.” Ibid. The Report also “observed that&para;<br>the indeterminate-sentencing system had two ‘unjustifi[ed] and ‘shame­&para;<br>ful’ consequences. The first was the great variation among sentences&para;<br>imposed by different judges upon similarly situated offenders. The&para;<br>second was uncertainty as to the time the offender would spend in&para;<br>prison. Each was a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective&para;<br>operation of the criminal justice system.” Mistretta, supra, at 366&para;<br>(quoting S. Rep. No. 98–225, at 38, 65 (citation omitted)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sentences that may be imposed in criminal cases, but for&para;<br>the most part it leaves questions of sentencing policy to be&para;<br>determined by Congress and the state legislatures—and&para;<br>with good reason. Determining the length of imprison­&para;<br>ment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a&para;<br>particular offender inevitably involves a balancing of in­&para;<br>terests. If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes&para;<br>the criminal from the general population and prevents&para;<br>him from committing additional crimes in the outside&para;<br>world. When a legislature prescribes that a category of&para;<br>killers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legisla­&para;<br>ture, which presumably reflects the views of the elec­&para;<br>torate, is taking the position that the risk that these&para;<br>offenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing&para;<br>consideration, including reduced culpability due to imma­&para;<br>turity or the possibility of rehabilitation. When the major­&para;<br>ity of this Court countermands that democratic decision,&para;<br>what the majority is saying is that members of society&para;<br>must be exposed to the risk that these convicted murder­&para;<br>ers, if released from custody, will murder again.&para;<br>Unless our cases change course, we will continue to&para;<br>march toward some vision of evolutionary culmination&para;<br>that the Court has not yet disclosed. The Constitution&para;<br>does not authorize us to take the country on this journey.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
