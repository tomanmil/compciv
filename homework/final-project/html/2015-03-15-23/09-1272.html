KING&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY&para;<br>No. 09–1272. Argued January 12, 2011—Decided May 16, 2011&para;<br>Police officers in Lexington, Kentucky, followed a suspected drug dealer&para;<br>to an apartment complex. They smelled marijuana outside an&para;<br>apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence. As&para;<br>soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises coming from&para;<br>the apartment; the officers believed that these noises were consistent&para;<br>with the destruction of evidence. The officers announced their intent&para;<br>to enter the apartment, kicked in the door, and found respondent and&para;<br>others. They saw drugs in plain view during a protective sweep of&para;<br>the apartment and found additional evidence during a subsequent&para;<br>search. The Circuit Court denied respondent’s motion to suppress&para;<br>the evidence, holding that exigent circumstances—the need to pre&para;<br>vent destruction of evidence—justified the warrantless entry. Re&para;<br>spondent entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to ap&para;<br>peal the suppression ruling, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals&para;<br>affirmed. The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. The court as&para;<br>sumed that exigent circumstances existed, but it nonetheless invali&para;<br>dated the search. The exigent circumstances rule did not apply, the&para;<br>court held, because the police should have foreseen that their conduct&para;<br>would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not&para;<br>create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct&para;<br>that violates the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 5–16.&para;<br>(a) The Fourth Amendment expressly imposes two requirements:&para;<br>All searches and seizures must be reasonable; and a warrant may not&para;<br>be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope&para;<br>of the authorized search is set out with particularity. Although&para;<br>“ ‘searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are pre&para;<br>sumptively unreasonable,’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KENTUCKY v. KING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>403, this presumption may be overcome when “ ‘the exigencies of the&para;<br>situation’ make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a]&para;<br>warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment,” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394. One such exi&para;<br>gency is the need “to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.”&para;<br>Brigham City, supra, at 403. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) Under the “police-created exigency” doctrine, which lower&para;<br>courts have developed as an exception to the exigent circumstances&para;<br>rule, exigent circumstances do not justify a warrantless search when&para;<br>the exigency was “created” or “manufactured” by the conduct of the&para;<br>police. The lower courts have not agreed, however, on the test for de&para;<br>termining when police impermissibly create an exigency. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(c) The proper test follows from the principle that permits war&para;<br>rantless searches: warrantless searches are allowed when the cir&para;<br>cumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement. Thus, a&para;<br>warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances is reasonable when&para;<br>the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to&para;<br>engage in conduct violating the Fourth Amendment. A similar ap&para;<br>proach has been taken in other cases involving warrantless searches.&para;<br>For example, officers may seize evidence in plain view if they have&para;<br>not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from&para;<br>which the observation of the evidence is made, see Horton v. Califor&para;<br>nia, 496 U. S. 128, 136–140; and they may seek consent-based en&para;<br>counters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consen&para;<br>sual encounter occurs, see INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 217, n. 5.&para;<br>Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(d) Some courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have&para;<br>imposed additional requirements—asking whether officers “ ‘deliber&para;<br>ately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to&para;<br>avoid the warrant requirement,’ ” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 656 (case below);&para;<br>reasoning that police may not rely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasona&para;<br>bly foreseeable that [their] investigative tactics . . . would create the&para;<br>exigent circumstances,’ ”ibid.; faulting officers for knocking on a door&para;<br>when they had sufficient evidence to seek a warrant but did not do&para;<br>so; and finding that officers created or manufactured an exigency&para;<br>when their investigation was contrary to standard or good law en&para;<br>forcement practices. Such requirements are unsound and are thus&para;<br>rejected. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(e) Respondent contends that an exigency is impermissibly cre&para;<br>ated when officers engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable&para;<br>person to believe that entry was imminent and inevitable, but that&para;<br>approach is also flawed. The ability of officers to respond to an exi&para;<br>gency cannot turn on such subtleties as the officers’ tone of voice in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks. A&para;<br>forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone&para;<br>is at the door, and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough,&para;<br>occupants may not know who is at their doorstep. Respondent’s test&para;<br>would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they&para;<br>may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock with&para;<br>out running afoul of the police-created exigency rule. And in most&para;<br>cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether&para;<br>that threshold had been passed. Pp. 14–15.&para;<br>2. Assuming that an exigency existed here, there is no evidence&para;<br>that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened&para;<br>to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment. Pp. 16–&para;<br>19.&para;<br>(a) Any question about whether an exigency existed here is bet&para;<br>ter addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand. P. 17.&para;<br>(b) Assuming an exigency did exist, the officers’ conduct—&para;<br>banging on the door and announcing their presence—was entirely&para;<br>consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Respondent has pointed to&para;<br>no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort&para;<br>of “demand” to enter the apartment, much less a demand that&para;<br>amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment. If there is&para;<br>contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this Court’s at&para;<br>tention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.&para;<br>Finally, the record makes clear that the officers’ announcement that&para;<br>they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency&para;<br>arose.

In this case, we&para;<br>consider whether this rule applies when police, by knock­&para;<br>ing on the door of a residence and announcing their pres­&para;<br>ence, cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.&para;<br>The Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent cir­&para;<br>cumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand be­&para;<br>cause the police should have foreseen that their conduct&para;<br>would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evi­&para;<br>dence. We reject this interpretation of the exigent circum­&para;<br>stances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their entry&para;<br>into the apartment was entirely lawful.

In&para;<br>such a situation, the exigent circumstances rule applies.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>This case concerns the search of an apartment in Lex­&para;<br>ington, Kentucky.

KING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Officer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an un­&para;<br>marked car in a nearby parking lot. After the deal oc­&para;<br>curred, Gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on&para;<br>the suspect. He told the officers that the suspect was&para;<br>moving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment&para;<br>building, and he urged them to “hurry up and get there”&para;<br>before the suspect entered an apartment. App. 20.&para;<br>In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers&para;<br>drove into the nearby parking lot, left their vehicles, and&para;<br>ran to the breezeway. Just as they entered the breezeway,&para;<br>they heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor of&para;<br>burnt marijuana. At the end of the breezeway, the officers&para;<br>saw two apartments, one on the left and one on the right,&para;<br>and they did not know which apartment the suspect had&para;<br>entered. Gibbons had radioed that the suspect was run­&para;<br>ning into the apartment on the right, but the officers did&para;<br>not hear this statement because they had already left&para;<br>their vehicles. Because they smelled marijuana smoke&para;<br>emanating from the apartment on the left, they ap­&para;<br>proached the door of that apartment.&para;<br>Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed officers who&para;<br>approached the door, testified that the officers banged on&para;<br>the left apartment door “as loud as [they] could” and an­&para;<br>nounced, “ ‘This is the police’ ” or “ ‘Police, police, police.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 22–23. Cobb said that “[a]s soon as [the officers]&para;<br>started banging on the door,” they “could hear people&para;<br>inside moving,” and “[i]t sounded as [though] things were&para;<br>being moved inside the apartment.” Id., at 24. These&para;<br>noises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that drug­&para;<br>related evidence was about to be destroyed.&para;<br>At that point, the officers announced that they “were&para;<br>going to make entry inside the apartment.” Ibid. Cobb&para;<br>then kicked in the door, the officers entered the apart­&para;<br>ment, and they found three people in the front room:&para;<br>respondent Hollis King, respondent’s girlfriend, and a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

In&para;<br>a subsequent search, they also discovered crack cocaine,&para;<br>cash, and drug paraphernalia.&para;<br>Police eventually entered the apartment on the right.&para;<br>Inside, they found the suspected drug dealer who was the&para;<br>initial target of their investigation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In the Fayette County Circuit Court, a grand jury&para;<br>charged respondent with trafficking in marijuana, first­&para;<br>degree trafficking in a controlled substance, and second­&para;<br>degree persistent felony offender status. Respondent filed&para;<br>a motion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless&para;<br>search, but the Circuit Court denied the motion. The&para;<br>Circuit Court concluded that the officers had probable&para;<br>cause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the&para;<br>officers “properly conducted [the investigation] by initially&para;<br>knocking on the door of the apartment unit and awaiting&para;<br>the response or consensual entry.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>9a. Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry,&para;<br>the court held, because “there was no response at all to the&para;<br>knocking,” and because “Officer Cobb heard movement in&para;<br>the apartment which he reasonably concluded were per­&para;<br>sons in the act of destroying evidence, particularly narcot­&para;<br>ics because of the smell.” Ibid. Respondent then entered a&para;<br>conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the&para;<br>denial of his suppression motion. The court sentenced&para;<br>respondent to 11 years’ imprisonment.&para;<br>The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Respondent’s girlfriend leased the apartment, but respondent stayed&para;<br>there part of the time, and his child lived there. Based on these facts,&para;<br>Kentucky conceded in state court that respondent has Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment standing to challenge the search.

KING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry&para;<br>because the police reasonably believed that evidence&para;<br>would be destroyed. The police did not impermissibly&para;<br>create the exigency, the court explained, because they did&para;<br>not deliberately evade the warrant requirement.&para;<br>The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. 302 S. W. 3d&para;<br>649 (2010). As a preliminary matter, the court observed&para;<br>that there was “certainly some question as to whether the&para;<br>sound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was suffi­&para;<br>cient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.” Id.,&para;<br>at 655. But the court did not answer that question. In­&para;<br>stead, it “assume[d] for the purpose of argument that&para;<br>exigent circumstances existed.” Ibid.&para;<br>To determine whether police impermissibly created the&para;<br>exigency, the Supreme Court of Kentucky announced a&para;<br>two-part test. First, the court held, police cannot “deliber­&para;<br>ately creat[e] the exigent circumstances with the bad faith&para;<br>intent to avoid the warrant requirement.” Id., at 656&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Second, even absent&para;<br>bad faith, the court concluded, police may not rely on&para;<br>exigent circumstances if “it was reasonably foreseeable&para;<br>that the investigative tactics employed by the police would&para;<br>create the exigent circumstances.” Ibid. (internal quota­&para;<br>tion marks omitted). Although the court found no evi­&para;<br>dence of bad faith, it held that exigent circumstances could&para;<br>not justify the search because it was reasonably foresee­&para;<br>able that the occupants would destroy evidence when the&para;<br>police knocked on the door and announced their presence.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 After we granted certiorari, respondent filed a motion to dismiss the&para;<br>petition as improvidently granted, which we denied. 562 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2010). Respondent’s principal argument was that the case was moot&para;<br>because, after the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed his conviction, the&para;<br>Circuit Court dismissed the charges against him. Respondent’s argu­&para;<br>ment is foreclosed by United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment provides: &para;<br>&para;<br>“The right of the people to be secure in their per­&para;<br>sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreason­&para;<br>able searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and&para;<br>no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,&para;<br>supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly&para;<br>describing the place to be searched, and the persons or&para;<br>things to be seized.”&para;<br>The text of the Amendment thus expressly imposes two&para;<br>requirements. First, all searches and seizures must be&para;<br>reasonable. Second, a warrant may not be issued unless&para;<br>probable cause is properly established and the scope of the&para;<br>authorized search is set out with particularity. See Payton&para;<br>v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 584 (1980).&para;<br>Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not&para;<br>specify when a search warrant must be obtained, this&para;<br>Court has inferred that a warrant must generally be&para;<br>secured. “It is a ‘basic principle of Fourth Amendment&para;<br>law,’ ” we have often said, “ ‘that searches and seizures&para;<br>inside a home without a warrant are presumptively un­&para;<br>reasonable.’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403&para;<br>(2006) (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559&para;<br>(2004)). But we have also recognized that this presump­&para;<br>tion may be overcome in some circumstances because&para;<br>“[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is&para;<br>‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also&para;<br>——————&para;<br>579, 581, n. 2 (1983). As we explained in Villamonte-Marquez, our&para;<br>reversal of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision “would reinstate the&para;<br>judgment of conviction and the sentence entered” by the Circuit Court.&para;<br>Ibid. The absence of an indictment does not change matters. See&para;<br>ibid.

KING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)&para;<br>(slip op., at 2). Accordingly, the warrant requirement is&para;<br>subject to certain reasonable exceptions. Brigham City,&para;<br>supra, at 403.&para;<br>One well-recognized exception applies when “ ‘the exi­&para;<br>gencies of the situation’ make the needs of law en­&para;<br>forcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is&para;<br>objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”&para;<br>Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978); see also&para;<br>Payton, supra, at 590 (“[T]he Fourth Amendment has&para;<br>drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent&para;<br>exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably&para;<br>be crossed without a warrant”).&para;<br>This Court has identified several exigencies that may&para;<br>justify a warrantless search of a home. See Brigham City,&para;<br>547 U. S., at 403. Under the “emergency aid” exception,&para;<br>for example, “officers may enter a home without a warrant&para;<br>to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or&para;<br>to protect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid.; see&para;<br>also, e.g., Fisher, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (upholding&para;<br>warrantless home entry based on emergency aid excep­&para;<br>tion). Police officers may enter premises without a war­&para;<br>rant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. See&para;<br>United States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 42–43 (1976).&para;<br>And—what is relevant here—the need “to prevent the&para;<br>imminent destruction of evidence” has long been recog­&para;<br>nized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.&para;<br>Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also Georgia v.

Under this doctrine, police&para;<br>may not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evi­&para;<br>dence when that exigency was “created” or “manufactured”&para;<br>by the conduct of the police. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (“[F]or a war­&para;<br>rantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be&para;<br>responding to an unanticipated exigency rather than&para;<br>simply creating the exigency for themselves”); United&para;<br>States v. Gould, 364 F. 3d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc)&para;<br>(“[A]lthough exigent circumstances may justify a war­&para;<br>rantless probable cause entry into the home, they will not&para;<br>do so if the exigent circumstances were manufactured by&para;<br>the agents” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>In applying this exception for the “creation” or “manu­&para;<br>facturing” of an exigency by the police, courts require&para;<br>something more than mere proof that fear of detection by&para;<br>the police caused the destruction of evidence. An addi­&para;<br>tional showing is obviously needed because, as the Eighth&para;<br>Circuit has recognized, “in some sense the police always&para;<br>create the exigent circumstances.” United States v. Duchi,&para;<br>906 F. 2d 1278, 1284 (CA8 1990). That is to say, in the&para;<br>vast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by&para;<br>persons who are engaged in illegal conduct, the reason for&para;<br>the destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the&para;<br>hands of law enforcement. Destruction of evidence issues&para;<br>probably occur most frequently in drug cases because&para;<br>drugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>do so”); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770–771 (1966) (war­&para;<br>rantless testing for blood-alcohol content was justified based on poten­&para;<br>tial destruction of evidence); cf. United States v. Banks, 540 U. S. 31,&para;<br>37–40 (2003) (15 to 20 seconds was a reasonable time for officers to wait&para;<br>after knocking and announcing their presence where there was a risk&para;<br>that suspect would dispose of cocaine).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KENTUCKY v. KING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>toilet or rinsing them down a drain. Persons in possession&para;<br>of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they&para;<br>fear discovery by the police. Consequently, a rule that&para;<br>precludes the police from making a warrantless entry to&para;<br>prevent the destruction of evidence whenever their con­&para;<br>duct causes the exigency would unreasonably shrink the&para;<br>reach of this well-established exception to the warrant&para;<br>requirement.&para;<br>Presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a result,&para;<br>the lower courts have held that the police-created exigency&para;<br>doctrine requires more than simple causation, but the&para;<br>lower courts have not agreed on the test to be applied.&para;<br>Indeed, the petition in this case maintains that “[t]here&para;<br>are currently five different tests being used by the United&para;<br>States Courts of Appeals,” Pet. for Cert. 11, and that some&para;<br>state courts have crafted additional tests, id., at 19–20.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts,&para;<br>the answer to the question presented in this case follows&para;<br>directly and clearly from the principle that permits war­&para;<br>rantless searches in the first place. As previously noted,&para;<br>warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances&para;<br>make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement.&para;<br>Therefore, the answer to the question before us is that the&para;<br>exigent circumstances rule justifies a warrantless search&para;<br>when the conduct of the police preceding the exigency is&para;<br>reasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the police&para;<br>did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to&para;<br>engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment,&para;<br>warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is&para;<br>reasonable and thus allowed.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 There&para;<br>&para;<br>is a strong argument to be made that, at least in most circum­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We have taken a similar approach in other cases involv­&para;<br>ing warrantless searches. For example, we have held that&para;<br>law enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view,&para;<br>provided that they have not violated the Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of&para;<br>the evidence is made. See Horton v. California, 496 U. S.&para;<br>128, 136–140 (1990). As we put it in Horton, “[i]t is . . . an&para;<br>essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of&para;<br>incriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which&para;<br>the evidence could be plainly viewed.” Id., at 136. So long&para;<br>as this prerequisite is satisfied, however, it does not mat­&para;<br>ter that the officer who makes the observation may have&para;<br>gone to the spot from which the evidence was seen with&para;<br>the hope of being able to view and seize the evidence. See&para;<br>id., at 138 (“The fact that an officer is interested in an&para;<br>item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of&para;<br>a search should not invalidate its seizure”). Instead, the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment requires only that the steps preceding&para;<br>the seizure be lawful. See id., at 136–137.&para;<br>Similarly, officers may seek consent-based encounters if&para;<br>they are lawfully present in the place where the consen­&para;<br>sual encounter occurs. See INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S.&para;<br>210, 217, n. 5 (1984) (noting that officers who entered&para;<br>into consent-based encounters with employees in a factory&para;<br>building were “lawfully present [in the factory] pursuant&para;<br>to consent or a warrant”). If consent is freely given, it&para;<br>makes no difference that an officer may have approached&para;<br>the person with the hope or expectation of obtaining con­&para;<br>sent. See id., at 216 (“While most citizens will respond to&para;<br>a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so&para;<br>——————&para;<br>stances, the exigent circumstances rule should not apply where the&para;<br>police, without a warrant or any legally sound basis for a warrantless&para;<br>entry, threaten that they will enter without permission unless admit­&para;<br>ted.

See United States v.&para;<br>MacDonald, 916 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law&para;<br>enforcement officers “do not impermissibly create exigent&para;<br>circumstances” when they “act in an entirely lawful man­&para;<br>ner”); State v.

But others,&para;<br>including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have imposed&para;<br>additional requirements that are unsound and that we&para;<br>now reject.&para;<br>Bad faith. Some courts, including the Kentucky Su­&para;<br>preme Court, ask whether law enforcement officers “ ‘de­&para;<br>liberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad&para;<br>faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.’ ” 302 S. W.&para;<br>3d, at 656 (quoting Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 590); see also, e.g.,&para;<br>Chambers, 395 F. 3d, at 566; United States v. Socey, 846&para;<br>F. 2d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988); United States v. Rengifo,&para;<br>858 F. 2d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).&para;<br>This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our&para;<br>Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. “Our cases have re­&para;<br>peatedly rejected” a subjective approach, asking only&para;<br>whether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the&para;<br>action.” ’Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted); see also Fisher, 558&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–5). Indeed, we have never held,&para;<br>outside limited contexts such as an “inventory search or&para;<br>administrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive&para;<br>invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.&para;<br>806, 812 (1996); see also Brigham City, supra, at 405.&para;<br>The reasons for looking to objective factors, rather than&para;<br>subjective intent, are clear.

Some courts, again including&para;<br>the Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that police may not&para;<br>rely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasonably foreseeable that&para;<br>the investigative tactics employed by the police would&para;<br>create the exigent circumstances.’ ” 302 S. W. 3d, at 656&para;<br>(quoting Mann v. State, 357 Ark. 159, 172, 161 S. W. 3d&para;<br>826, 834 (2004)); see also, e.g., United States v. Mowatt,&para;<br>513 F. 3d 395, 402 (CA4 2008). Courts applying this&para;<br>test have invalidated warrantless home searches on the&para;<br>ground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police&para;<br>officers, by knocking on the door and announcing their&para;<br>presence, would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence.&para;<br>See, e.g., id., at 402–403; 302 S. W. 3d, at 656.&para;<br>Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have rejected&para;<br>the notion that police may seize evidence without a war­&para;<br>rant only when they come across the evidence by happen­&para;<br>stance. In Horton, as noted, we held that the police may&para;<br>seize evidence in plain view even though the officers may&para;<br>be “interested in an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to&para;<br>find it in the course of a search.” 496 U. S., at 138.&para;<br>Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also&para;<br>introduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability. For&para;<br>example, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the&para;<br>door of premises occupied by a person who may be in­&para;<br>volved in the drug trade, there is some possibility that the&para;<br>occupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy&para;<br>them. Under a reasonable foreseeability test, it would be&para;<br>necessary to quantify the degree of predictability that&para;<br>must be reached before the police-created exigency doc­&para;<br>trine comes into play.&para;<br>A simple example illustrates the difficulties that such&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KENTUCKY v. KING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an approach would produce. Suppose that the officers in&para;<br>the present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus&para;<br>knew only that there was a 50% chance that the fleeing&para;<br>suspect had entered the apartment on the left rather than&para;<br>the apartment on the right. Under those circumstances,&para;<br>would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occu­&para;<br>pants of the apartment on the left would seek to destroy&para;<br>evidence upon learning that the police were at the door?&para;<br>Or suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect&para;<br>had disappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with&para;<br>3, 5, 10, or even 20 units? If the police chose a door at&para;<br>random and knocked for the purpose of asking the occu­&para;<br>pants if they knew a person who fit the description of the&para;<br>suspect, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that&para;<br>the occupants would seek to destroy evidence?&para;<br>We have noted that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness&para;<br>must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are&para;<br>often forced to make split-second judgments—in circum­&para;<br>stances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.”&para;<br>Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396–397 (1989). The&para;<br>reasonable foreseeability test would create unacceptable&para;<br>and unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement officers&para;<br>who must make quick decisions in the field, as well as for&para;<br>judges who would be required to determine after the fact&para;<br>whether the destruction of evidence in response to a knock&para;<br>on the door was reasonably foreseeable based on what the&para;<br>officers knew at the time.&para;<br>Probable cause and time to secure a warrant. Some&para;<br>courts, in applying the police-created exigency doctrine,&para;<br>fault law enforcement officers if, after acquiring evidence&para;<br>that is sufficient to establish probable cause to search&para;<br>particular premises, the officers do not seek a warrant but&para;<br>instead knock on the door and seek either to speak with an&para;<br>occupant or to obtain consent to search. See, e.g., Cham&para;<br>bers, supra, at 569 (citing “[t]he failure to seek a warrant&para;<br>in the face of plentiful probable cause” as a factor indicat­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing that the police deliberately created the exigency).&para;<br>This approach unjustifiably interferes with legitimate&para;<br>law enforcement strategies. There are many entirely&para;<br>proper reasons why police may not want to seek a search&para;<br>warrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed&para;<br>to establish probable cause is acquired. Without attempt­&para;<br>ing to provide a comprehensive list of these reasons, we&para;<br>note a few.&para;<br>First, the police may wish to speak with the occupants of&para;<br>a dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to seek&para;<br>authorization for a search. They may think that a short&para;<br>and simple conversation may obviate the need to apply for&para;<br>and execute a warrant. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,&para;<br>412 U. S. 218, 228 (1973). Second, the police may want to&para;<br>ask an occupant of the premises for consent to search&para;<br>because doing so is simpler, faster, and less burdensome&para;<br>than applying for a warrant. A consensual search also&para;<br>“may result in considerably less inconvenience” and em­&para;<br>barrassment to the occupants than a search conducted&para;<br>pursuant to a warrant. Ibid. Third, law enforcement&para;<br>officers may wish to obtain more evidence before submit­&para;<br>ting what might otherwise be considered a marginal war­&para;<br>rant application. Fourth, prosecutors may wish to wait&para;<br>until they acquire evidence that can justify a search that&para;<br>is broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is&para;<br>likely to authorize based on the evidence then available.&para;<br>And finally, in many cases, law enforcement may not want&para;<br>to execute a search that will disclose the existence of an&para;<br>investigation because doing so may interfere with the&para;<br>acquisition of additional evidence against those already&para;<br>under suspicion or evidence about additional but as yet&para;<br>unknown participants in a criminal scheme.&para;<br>We have said that “[l]aw enforcement officers are under&para;<br>no constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal investiga­&para;<br>tion the moment they have the minimum evidence to&para;<br>establish probable cause.” Hoffa v. United States, 385&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KENTUCKY v. KING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 293, 310 (1966). Faulting the police for failing to&para;<br>apply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time&para;<br>after obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is&para;<br>nowhere to be found in the Constitution.&para;<br>Standard or good investigative tactics. Finally, some&para;<br>lower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers&para;<br>may be found to have created or manufactured an exi­&para;<br>gency if the court concludes that the course of their inves­&para;<br>tigation was “contrary to standard or good law enforce­&para;<br>ment practices (or to the policies or practices of their&para;<br>jurisdictions).” Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 591. This approach&para;<br>fails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement officers&para;<br>and authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that&para;<br>are the province of those who are responsible for federal&para;<br>and state law enforcement agencies.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Respondent argues for a rule that differs from those&para;<br>discussed above, but his rule is also flawed. Respondent&para;<br>contends that law enforcement officers impermissibly&para;<br>create an exigency when they “engage in conduct that&para;<br>would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is&para;<br>imminent and inevitable.” Brief for Respondent 24. In&para;<br>respondent’s view, relevant factors include the officers’&para;<br>tone of voice in announcing their presence and the force­&para;<br>fulness of their knocks. But the ability of law enforcement&para;<br>officers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such&para;<br>subtleties.&para;<br>Police officers may have a very good reason to announce&para;<br>their presence loudly and to knock on the door with some&para;<br>force. A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the&para;<br>occupants that someone is at the door. Cf. United States v.&para;<br>Banks, 540 U. S. 31, 33 (2003) (Police “rapped hard&para;<br>enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back&para;<br>door” and announced their presence, but defendant “was&para;<br>in the shower and testified that he heard nothing”).

S. 194, 204 (2002). Citizens who are&para;<br>startled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the&para;<br>sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their door­&para;<br>step may be relieved to learn that these persons are police&para;<br>officers. Others may appreciate the opportunity to make&para;<br>an informed decision about whether to answer the door to&para;<br>the police.&para;<br>If respondent’s test were adopted, it would be extremely&para;<br>difficult for police officers to know how loudly they may&para;<br>announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock&para;<br>on a door without running afoul of the police-created&para;<br>exigency rule. And in most cases, it would be nearly im­&para;<br>possible for a court to determine whether that threshold&para;<br>had been passed. The Fourth Amendment does not re­&para;<br>quire the nebulous and impractical test that respondent&para;<br>proposes.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Contrary to respondent’s argument, see Brief for Respondent 13–18,&para;<br>Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 (1948), does not require affir­&para;<br>mance in this case. In Johnson, officers noticed the smell of burning&para;<br>opium emanating from a hotel room. They then knocked on the door&para;<br>and demanded entry. Upon seeing that Johnson was the only occupant&para;<br>of the room, they placed her under arrest, searched the room, and&para;<br>discovered opium and drug paraphernalia. Id., at 11.&para;<br>Defending the legality of the search, the Government attempted to&para;<br>justify the warrantless search of the room as a valid search incident to&para;<br>a lawful arrest. See Brief for United States in Johnson v. United States,&para;<br>O. T. 1947, No. 329, pp. 13, 16, 36. The Government did not contend&para;<br>that the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of&para;<br>evidence. Although the officers said that they heard a “ ‘shuffling’ ”&para;<br>noise inside the room after they knocked on the door, 333 U. S., at 12,&para;<br>the Government did not claim that this particular noise was a noise&para;<br>that would have led a reasonable officer to think that evidence was&para;<br>about to be destroyed. Thus, Johnson is simply not a case about&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>KENTUCKY v. KING &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>D&para;<br>&para;<br>For these reasons, we conclude that the exigent circum­&para;<br>stances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to&para;<br>premises by means of an actual or threatened violation of&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment. This holding provides ample&para;<br>protection for the privacy rights that the Amendment&para;<br>protects.&para;<br>When law enforcement officers who are not armed with&para;<br>a warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any&para;<br>private citizen might do. And whether the person who&para;<br>knocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak&para;<br>is a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no&para;<br>obligation to open the door or to speak. Cf. Florida v.&para;<br>Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 497–498 (1983). (“[H]e may decline&para;<br>to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way”).&para;<br>When the police knock on a door but the occupants choose&para;<br>not to respond or to speak, “the investigation will have&para;<br>reached a conspicuously low point,” and the occupants&para;<br>“will have the kind of warning that even the most elabo­&para;<br>rate security system cannot provide.” Chambers, 395&para;<br>F. 3d, at 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting). And even if an occu­&para;<br>pant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers,&para;<br>the occupant need not allow the officers to enter the prem­&para;<br>ises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.&para;<br>Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitu­&para;<br>tional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evi­&para;<br>dence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless&para;<br>exigent-circumstances search that may ensue.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>exigent circumstances. See id., at 14–15 (noting that if “exceptional&para;<br>circumstances” existed—for example, if a “suspect was fleeing or likely&para;<br>to take flight” or if “evidence or contraband was threatened with&para;<br>removal or destruction”—then “it may be contended that a magistrate’s&para;<br>warrant for search may be dispensed with”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

This conduct was entirely consistent&para;<br>with the Fourth Amendment, and we are aware of no&para;<br>other evidence that might show that the officers either&para;<br>violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so (for&para;<br>example, by announcing that they would break down the&para;<br>door if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily).&para;<br>Respondent argues that the officers “demanded” entry to&para;<br>the apartment, but he has not pointed to any evidence in&para;<br>the record that supports this assertion. He relies on a&para;<br>passing statement made by the trial court in its opinion&para;<br>denying respondent’s motion to suppress. See App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 3a–4a. In recounting the events that preceded&para;<br>the search, the judge wrote that the officers “banged on&para;<br>the door of the apartment on the back left of the breeze­&para;<br>way identifying themselves as police officers and demand&para;<br>ing that the door be opened by the persons inside.” Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added and deleted). However, at a later point&para;<br>in this opinion, the judge stated that the officers “initially&para;<br>knock[ed] on the door of the apartment unit and await[ed]&para;<br>the response or consensual entry.” Id., at 9a. This later&para;<br>statement is consistent with the testimony at the suppres­&para;<br>sion hearing and with the findings of the state appellate&para;<br>courts. See 302 S.

There is no evidence of a “demand” of any sort,&para;<br>much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment.

United States v.&para;<br>United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407&para;<br>U. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.

United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The&para;<br>Court has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in&para;<br>the main, “per se unreasonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437&para;<br>U. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.

Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1984).&para;<br>That heavy burden has not been carried here. There&para;<br>was little risk that drug-related evidence would have been&para;<br>destroyed had the police delayed the search pending&para;<br>a magistrate’s authorization.

Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the&para;<br>knock at the apartment door, the occupants were appre&para;<br>hensive about police proximity.&para;<br>In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with&para;<br>greater force than in our homes, our most private space&para;<br>which, for centuries, has been regarded as “ ‘entitled to&para;<br>special protection.’ ” Georgia v.

Home intrusions, the&para;<br>Court has said, are indeed “the chief evil against which . . .&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment is directed.” Payton, 445 U. S., at&para;<br>585 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Silverman v.&para;<br>United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961) (“At [the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment’s] very core stands the right of a man to&para;<br>retreat to his own home and there be free from unreason&para;<br>able governmental intrusion.”). “ ‘[S]earches and seizures&para;<br>inside a home without a warrant are [therefore] presump&para;<br>tively unreasonable.’ ” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403&para;<br>(quoting Groh, 540 U. S., at 559). How “secure” do our&para;<br>homes remain if police, armed with no warrant, can pound&para;<br>on doors at will and, on hearing sounds indicative of&para;<br>things moving, forcibly enter and search for evidence of&para;<br>unlawful activity?&para;<br>II&para;<br>As above noted, to justify the police activity in this case,&para;<br>Kentucky invoked the once-guarded exception for emer&para;<br>gencies “in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant&para;<br>. . . threaten[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Schmerber&para;<br>v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (quoting Preston v.&para;<br>United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). To fit within&para;<br>this exception, “police action literally must be [taken] ‘now&para;<br>or never’ to preserve the evidence of the crime.” Roaden v.&para;<br>Kentucky, 413 U.

KING&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The existence of a genuine emergency depends not only&para;<br>on the state of necessity at the time of the warrantless&para;<br>search; it depends, first and foremost, on “actions taken&para;<br>by the police preceding the warrantless search.” United&para;<br>States v. Coles, 437 F. 3d 361, 367 (CA3 2006). See also&para;<br>United States v. Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 565 (CA6 2005)&para;<br>(“[O]fficers must seek a warrant based on probable cause&para;<br>when they believe in advance they will find contraband or&para;<br>evidence of a crime.”). “[W]asting a clear opportunity to&para;<br>obtain a warrant,” therefore, “disentitles the officer from&para;<br>relying on subsequent exigent circumstances.” S. Saltz&para;<br>burg &amp; D. Capra, American Criminal Procedure 376 (8th&para;<br>ed. 2007).&para;<br>Under an appropriately reined-in “emergency” or “exi&para;<br>gent circumstances” exception, the result in this case&para;<br>should not be in doubt. The target of the investigation’s&para;<br>entry into the building, and the smell of marijuana seep&para;<br>ing under the apartment door into the hallway, the Ken&para;<br>tucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police&para;<br>“probable cause . . . sufficient . . . to obtain a warrant to&para;<br>search the . . . apartment.” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 653 (2010).&para;<br>As that court observed, nothing made it impracticable for&para;<br>the police to post officers on the premises while proceeding&para;<br>to obtain a warrant authorizing their entry. Id., at&para;<br>654. Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioner 35, n. 13 (asserting “[i]t should be&para;<br>of no importance whether police could have obtained a&para;<br>warrant”).&para;<br>In Johnson, the Court confronted this scenario: standing&para;<br>outside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium&para;<br>and heard “some shuffling or noise” coming from the room.&para;<br>333 U. S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). Could&para;<br>the police enter the room without a warrant? The Court&para;<br>answered no. Explaining why, the Court said:&para;<br>“The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>is . . . a grave concern, not only to the individual but to&para;<br>a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security&para;<br>and freedom from surveillance. When the right of&para;<br>privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is,&para;<br>as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not a&para;<br>policeman . . . .&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“If the officers in this case were excused from the&para;<br>constitutional duty of presenting their evidence to a&para;<br>magistrate, it is difficult to think of [any] case in&para;<br>which [a warrant] should be required.” Id., at 14–15.&para;<br>I agree, and would not allow an expedient knock to over&para;<br>ride the warrant requirement.* Instead, I would accord&para;<br>that core requirement of the Fourth Amendment full&para;<br>respect. When possible, “a warrant must generally be&para;<br>secured,” the Court acknowledges. Ante, at 5. There is&para;<br>every reason to conclude that securing a warrant was&para;<br>entirely feasible in this case, and no reason to contract the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment’s dominion.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The Court in Johnson was informed that “when [the officer]&para;<br>knocked on [Johnson’s] door the ‘first thing that naturally struck [her]’&para;<br>was to conceal the opium and the equipment for smoking it.” See Brief&para;<br>for United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 1947, No. 329,&para;<br>p. 17, n. 6. Had the Government in Johnson urged that the “shuffling&para;<br>or noise” indicated evidence was at risk, would the result have&para;<br>changed? Justice Jackson’s recognition of the primacy of the warrant&para;<br>requirement suggests not. But see ante, at 15, n. 5 (distinguishing&para;<br>Johnson on the ground that the Government did not contend “that&para;<br>the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of&para;<br>evidence”).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
