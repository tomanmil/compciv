Argued March 4, 2014—Decided May 27, 2014&para;<br>Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase that came&para;<br>to a temporary halt when Rickard spun out into a parking lot. Rickard resumed maneuvering his car, and as he continued to use the accelerator even though his bumper was flush against a patrol car, an&para;<br>officer fired three shots into Rickard’s car. Rickard managed to drive&para;<br>away, almost hitting an officer in the process. Officers fired 12 more&para;<br>shots as Rickard sped away, striking him and his passenger, both of&para;<br>whom died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries&para;<br>suffered when the car eventually crashed.&para;<br>Respondent, Rickard’s minor daughter, filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983&para;<br>action, alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of&para;<br>the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court denied&para;<br>the officers’ motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, holding that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>and was contrary to clearly established law at the time in question.&para;<br>After finding that it had appellate jurisdiction, the Sixth Circuit held&para;<br>that the officers’ conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. It affirmed the District Court’s order, suggesting that it agreed that the&para;<br>officers violated clearly established law.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Sixth Circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1291, which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear appeals from “final decisions” of the district courts. The general rule&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a “final decision[n],” and thus not immediately appealable, does not apply when&para;<br>it is based on a qualified immunity claim. Johnson v. Jones, 515&para;<br>U. S. 304, 311. Respondent argues that Johnson forecloses appellate&para;<br>jurisdiction here, but the order in Johnson was not immediately appealable because it merely decided “a question of ‘evidence sufficiency,’ ” id., at 313, while here, petitioners’ qualified immunity claims&para;<br>raise legal issues quite different from any purely factual issues that&para;<br>might be confronted at trial. Deciding such legal issues is a core responsibility of appellate courts and does not create an undue burden&para;<br>for them. See, e.g., Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>2. The officers’ conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment.&para;<br>Pp. 7–15.&para;<br>(a) Addressing this question first will be “beneficial” in “develop[ing] constitutional precedent” in an area that courts typically consider in cases in which the defendant asserts a qualified immunity&para;<br>defense, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) Respondent’s excessive-force argument requires analyzing the&para;<br>totality of the circumstances from the perspective “of a reasonable officer on the scene.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396. Respondent contends that the Fourth Amendment did not allow the officers to&para;<br>use deadly force to terminate the chase, and that, even if they were&para;<br>permitted to fire their weapons, they went too far when they fired as&para;<br>many rounds as they did. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(1) The officers acted reasonably in using deadly force. A “police officer’s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase&para;<br>that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk&para;<br>of serious injury or death.” Scott, supra, at 385. Rickard’s outrageously reckless driving—which lasted more than five minutes, exceeded 100 miles per hour, and included the passing of more than two&para;<br>dozen other motorists—posed a grave public safety risk, and the record conclusively disproves that the chase was over when Rickard’s&para;<br>car came to a temporary standstill and officers began shooting. Under the circumstances when the shots were fired, all that a reasonable officer could have concluded from Rickard’s conduct was that he&para;<br>was intent on resuming his flight, which would again pose a threat to&para;<br>others on the road. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(2) Petitioners did not fire more shots than necessary to end&para;<br>the public safety risk. It makes sense that, if officers are justified in&para;<br>firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety,&para;<br>they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. Here, during&para;<br>the 10-second span when all the shots were fired, Rickard never&para;<br>abandoned his attempt to flee and eventually managed to drive away.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>A passenger’s presence does not bear on whether officers violated&para;<br>Rickard’s Fourth Amendment rights, which “are personal rights&para;<br>[that] may not be vicariously asserted.” Alderman v. United States,&para;<br>394 U. S. 165, 174. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>3. Even if the officers’ conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, petitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment based&para;<br>on qualified immunity. An official sued under §1983 is entitled to&para;<br>qualified immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a&para;<br>statutory or constitutional right that was “ ‘clearly established’ ” at&para;<br>the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___. Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 201, where an officer shot at&para;<br>a fleeing vehicle to prevent possible harm, makes plain that no clearly established law precluded the officer’s conduct there. Thus, to prevail, respondent must meaningfully distinguish Brosseau or point to&para;<br>any “controlling authority” or “robust ‘consensus of cases of persuasive authority,’ ” al-Kidd, supra, at ___, that emerged between the&para;<br>events there and those here that would alter the qualified-immunity&para;<br>analysis. Respondent has made neither showing. If anything, the&para;<br>facts here are more favorable to the officers than the facts in&para;<br>Brosseau; and respondent points to no cases that could be said to&para;<br>have clearly established the unconstitutionality of using lethal force&para;<br>to end a high-speed car chase.

RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of the driver who attempted to flee. Wilkie v. Robbins, 551&para;<br>U. S. 537, 543, n. 2 (2007). Near midnight on July 18,&para;<br>2004, Lieutenant Joseph Forthman of the West Memphis,&para;<br>Arkansas, Police Department pulled over a white Honda&para;<br>Accord because the car had only one operating headlight.&para;<br>Donald Rickard was the driver of the Accord, and Kelly&para;<br>Allen was in the passenger seat. Forthman noticed an&para;<br>indentation, “ ‘roughly the size of a head or a basketball’ ”&para;<br>in the windshield of the car. Estate of Allen v. West Memphis, 2011 WL 197426, *1 (WD Tenn., Jan. 20, 2011). He&para;<br>asked Rickard if he had been drinking, and Rickard re­&para;<br>sponded that he had not. Because Rickard failed to pro­&para;<br>duce his driver’s license upon request and appeared nerv­&para;<br>ous, Forthman asked him to step out of the car. Rather&para;<br>than comply with Forthman’s request, Rickard sped away.&para;<br>Forthman gave chase and was soon joined by five other&para;<br>police cruisers driven by Sergeant Vance Plumhoff and&para;<br>Officers Jimmy Evans, Lance Ellis, Troy Galtelli, and&para;<br>John Gardner. The officers pursued Rickard east on In­&para;<br>terstate 40 toward Memphis, Tennessee. While on I–40,&para;<br>they attempted to stop Rickard using a “rolling roadblock,”&para;<br>id., at *2, but they were unsuccessful. The District Court&para;<br>described the vehicles as “swerving through traffic at high&para;<br>speeds,” id., at *8, and respondent does not dispute that&para;<br>the cars attained speeds over 100 miles per hour.1 See&para;<br>Memorandum of Law in Response to Defendants’ Motion&para;<br>for Summary Judgment in No. 2:05–cv–2585 (WD Tenn.),&para;<br>p. 16; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 54:23–55:6. During the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 It&para;<br>&para;<br>is also undisputed that Forthman saw glass shavings on the&para;<br>dashboard of Rickard’s car, a sign that the windshield had been broken&para;<br>recently; that another officer testified that the windshield indentation&para;<br>and glass shavings would have justified a suspicion “ ‘that someone had&para;<br>possibly been struck by that vehicle, like a pedestrian’ ”; and that&para;<br>Forthman saw beer in Rickard’s car. See App. 424–426 (Response to&para;<br>Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in No. 2:05–cv–&para;<br>2585 (WD Tenn.), ¶¶15–19).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>chase, Rickard and the officers passed more than two&para;<br>dozen vehicles.&para;<br>Rickard eventually exited I–40 in Memphis, and shortly&para;<br>afterward he made “a quick right turn,” causing “contact&para;<br>[to] occu[r]” between his car and Evans’ cruiser. 2011 WL&para;<br>197426, *3. As a result of that contact, Rickard’s car spun&para;<br>out into a parking lot and collided with Plumhoff ’s cruiser.&para;<br>Now in danger of being cornered, Rickard put his car into&para;<br>reverse “in an attempt to escape.” Ibid. As he did so,&para;<br>Evans and Plumhoff got out of their cruisers and ap­&para;<br>proached Rickard’s car, and Evans, gun in hand, pounded&para;<br>on the passenger-side window. At that point, Rickard’s&para;<br>car “made contact with” yet another police cruiser. Ibid.&para;<br>Rickard’s tires started spinning, and his car “was rocking&para;<br>back and forth,” ibid., indicating that Rickard was using&para;<br>the accelerator even though his bumper was flush against&para;<br>a police cruiser. At that point, Plumhoff fired three shots&para;<br>into Rickard’s car. Rickard then “reversed in a 180 degree&para;<br>arc” and “maneuvered onto” another street, forcing Ellis to&para;<br>“step to his right to avoid the vehicle.” Ibid. As Rickard&para;<br>continued “fleeing down” that street, ibid., Gardner and&para;<br>Galtelli fired 12 shots toward Rickard’s car, bringing the&para;<br>total number of shots fired during this incident to 15.&para;<br>Rickard then lost control of the car and crashed into a&para;<br>building. Ibid. Rickard and Allen both died from some&para;<br>combination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered in&para;<br>the crash that ended the chase. See App. 60, 76.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondent, Rickard’s surviving daughter, filed this&para;<br>action under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, against&para;<br>the six individual police officers and the mayor and chief&para;<br>of police of West Memphis. She alleged that the officers&para;<br>used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendments.&para;<br>The officers moved for summary judgment based on&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>qualified immunity, but the District Court denied that&para;<br>motion, holding that the officers’ conduct violated the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment and was contrary to law that was&para;<br>clearly established at the time in question. The officers&para;<br>appealed, but a Sixth Circuit motions panel initially dis­&para;<br>missed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on this&para;<br>Court’s decision in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 309&para;<br>(1995). Later, however, that panel granted rehearing,&para;<br>vacated its dismissal order, and left the jurisdictional&para;<br>issue to be decided by a merits panel.&para;<br>The merits panel then affirmed the District Court’s&para;<br>decision on the merits. Estate of Allen v. West Memphis,&para;<br>509 Fed. Appx. 388 (CA6 2012). On the issue of appellate&para;<br>jurisdiction, the merits panel began by stating that a&para;<br>“motion for qualified immunity denied on the basis of a&para;<br>district court’s determination that there exists a triable&para;<br>issue of fact generally cannot be appealed on an interlocu­&para;<br>tory basis.” Id., at 391. But the panel then noted that the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit had previously interpreted our decision in&para;<br>Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372 (2007), as creating an “ex­&para;<br>ception to this rule” under which an immediate appeal&para;<br>may be taken to challenge “ ‘blatantly and demonstrably&para;<br>false’ ” factual determinations. 509 Fed. Appx., at 391&para;<br>(quoting Moldowan v. Warren, 578 F. 3d 351, 370 (CA6&para;<br>2009)). Concluding that none of the District Court’s factual determinations ran afoul of that high standard, and&para;<br>distinguishing the facts of this case from those in Scott,&para;<br>the panel held that the officers’ conduct violated the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment. 509 Fed. Appx., at 392, and n. 3.&para;<br>The panel said nothing about whether the officers violated&para;<br>clearly established law, but since the panel affirmed the&para;<br>order denying the officers’ summary judgment motion,2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 After expressing some confusion about whether it should dismiss or&para;<br>affirm, the panel wrote that “it would seem that what we are doing is&para;<br>affirming [the District Court’s] judgment.” 509 Fed. Appx., at 393.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the panel must have decided that issue in respondent’s&para;<br>favor.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ____ (2013).&para;<br>II&para;<br>We start with the question whether the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals properly exercised jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1291, which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to&para;<br>hear appeals from “final decisions” of the district courts.&para;<br>An order denying a motion for summary judgment is&para;<br>generally not a final decision within the meaning of §1291&para;<br>and is thus generally not immediately appealable. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 309. But that general rule does not&para;<br>apply when the summary judgment motion is based on a&para;<br>claim of qualified immunity. Id., at 311; Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 528 (1985). “[Q]ualified immunity is&para;<br>‘an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to&para;<br>liability.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009)&para;<br>(quoting Mitchell, supra, at 526). As a result, pretrial&para;<br>orders denying qualified immunity generally fall within&para;<br>the collateral order doctrine. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556&para;<br>U. S. 662, 671–672 (2009). This is so because such orders&para;<br>conclusively determine whether the defendant is entitled&para;<br>to immunity from suit; this immunity issue is both im­&para;<br>portant and completely separate from the merits of the&para;<br>action, and this question could not be effectively reviewed&para;<br>on appeal from a final judgment because by that time the&para;<br>immunity from standing trial will have been irretrievably&para;<br>lost. See ibid; Johnson, supra, at 311–312 (citing Mitchell,&para;<br>supra, at 525–527).&para;<br>Respondent argues that our decision in Johnson, fore­&para;<br>closes appellate jurisdiction under the circumstances here,&para;<br>but the order from which the appeal was taken in Johnson&para;<br>was quite different from the order in the present case. In&para;<br>Johnson, the plaintiff brought suit against certain police&para;<br>officers who, he alleged, had beaten him. 515 U. S., at&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>307. These officers moved for summary judgment, assert­&para;<br>ing that they were not present at the time of the alleged&para;<br>beating and had nothing to do with it. Id., at 307–308.&para;<br>The District Court determined, however, that the evidence&para;<br>in the summary judgment record was sufficient to support&para;<br>a contrary finding, and the court therefore denied the&para;<br>officers’ motion for summary judgment. Id., at 308. The&para;<br>officers then appealed, arguing that the District Court had&para;<br>not correctly analyzed the relevant evidence. Ibid.&para;<br>This Court held that the Johnson order was not imme­&para;<br>diately appealable because it merely decided “a question of&para;<br>‘evidence sufficiency,’ i.e., which facts a party may, or may&para;<br>not, be able to prove at trial.” Id., at 313. The Court noted&para;<br>that an order denying summary judgment based on a&para;<br>determination of “evidence sufficiency” does not present a&para;<br>legal question in the sense in which the term was used in&para;<br>Mitchell, the decision that first held that a pretrial order&para;<br>rejecting a claim of qualified immunity is immediately&para;<br>appealable. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 314. In addition, the&para;<br>Court observed that a determination of evidence sufficiency&para;<br>is closely related to other determinations that the trial&para;<br>court may be required to make at later stages of the case.&para;<br>Id., at 317. The Court also noted that appellate courts&para;<br>have “no comparative expertise” over trial courts in mak­&para;<br>ing such determinations and that forcing appellate courts&para;<br>to entertain appeals from such orders would impose an&para;<br>undue burden. Id., at 309–310, 316.&para;<br>The District Court order in this case is nothing like the&para;<br>order in Johnson. Petitioners do not claim that other&para;<br>officers were responsible for shooting Rickard; rather, they&para;<br>contend that their conduct did not violate the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment and, in any event, did not violate clearly&para;<br>established law. Thus, they raise legal issues; these issues&para;<br>are quite different from any purely factual issues that the&para;<br>trial court might confront if the case were tried; deciding&para;<br>legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>courts, and requiring appellate courts to decide such is­&para;<br>sues is not an undue burden.&para;<br>The District Court order here is not materially distin­&para;<br>guishable from the District Court order in Scott v. Harris,&para;<br>and in that case we expressed no doubts about the juris­&para;<br>diction of the Court of Appeals under §1291. Accordingly,&para;<br>here, as in Scott, we hold that the Court of Appeals properly exercised jurisdiction, and we therefore turn to the&para;<br>merits.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners contend that the decision of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals is wrong for two separate reasons. They maintain&para;<br>that they did not violate Rickard’s Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights and that, in any event, their conduct did not violate&para;<br>any Fourth Amendment rule that was clearly established&para;<br>at the time of the events in question. When confronted&para;<br>with such arguments, we held in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.&para;<br>194, 200 (2001), that “the first inquiry must be whether a&para;<br>constitutional right would have been violated on the facts&para;<br>alleged.” Only after deciding that question, we concluded,&para;<br>may an appellate court turn to the question whether the&para;<br>right at issue was clearly established at the relevant time.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>We subsequently altered this rigid framework in Pearson, declaring that “Saucier’s procedure should not be&para;<br>regarded as an inflexible requirement.” 555 U. S., at 227.&para;<br>At the same time, however, we noted that the Saucier&para;<br>procedure “is often beneficial” because it “promotes the&para;<br>development of constitutional precedent and is especially&para;<br>valuable with respect to questions that do not frequently&para;<br>arise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is&para;<br>unavailable.” 555 U. S., at 236. Pearson concluded that&para;<br>courts “have the discretion to decide whether that [Saucier] procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.” Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>242.&para;<br>Heeding our guidance in Pearson, we begin in this case&para;<br>with the question whether the officers’ conduct violated&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment. This approach, we believe, will&para;<br>be “beneficial” in “develop[ing] constitutional precedent” in&para;<br>an area that courts typically consider in cases in which the&para;<br>defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense. See&para;<br>Pearson, supra, at 236.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A claim that law-enforcement officers used excessive&para;<br>force to effect a seizure is governed by the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment’s “reasonableness” standard. See Graham v.&para;<br>Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989); Tennessee v. Garner, 471&para;<br>U. S. 1 (1985). In Graham, we held that determining the&para;<br>objective reasonableness of a particular seizure under the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment “requires a careful balancing of the&para;<br>nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s&para;<br>Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing&para;<br>governmental interests at stake.” 490 U. S., at 396 (inter­&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). The inquiry requires ana­&para;<br>lyzing the totality of the circumstances. See ibid.&para;<br>We analyze this question from the perspective “of a&para;<br>reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20&para;<br>vision of hindsight.” Ibid. We thus “allo[w] for the fact&para;<br>that police officers are often forced to make split-second&para;<br>judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain,&para;<br>and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is&para;<br>necessary in a particular situation.” Id., at 396–397.&para;<br>In this case, respondent advances two main Fourth&para;<br>Amendment arguments. First, she contends that the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment did not allow petitioners to use deadly&para;<br>force to terminate the chase. See Brief for Respondent 24–&para;<br>35. Second, she argues that the “degree of force was ex­&para;<br>cessive,” that is, that even if the officers were permitted to&para;<br>fire their weapons, they went too far when they fired as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>many rounds as they did. See id., at 36–38. We address&para;<br>each issue in turn.&para;<br>1&para;<br>In Scott, we considered a claim that a police officer&para;<br>violated the Fourth Amendment when he terminated a&para;<br>high-speed car chase by using a technique that placed a&para;<br>“fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.” 550&para;<br>U. S., at 386. The record in that case contained a vide­&para;<br>otape of the chase, and we found that the events recorded&para;<br>on the tape justified the officer’s conduct. We wrote as&para;<br>follows: “Although there is no obvious way to quantify the&para;<br>risks on either side, it is clear from the videotape that&para;<br>respondent posed an actual and imminent threat to the&para;<br>lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to&para;<br>other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the&para;<br>chase.” Id., at 383–384. We also wrote:&para;<br>“[R]espondent’s vehicle rac[ed] down narrow, two-lane&para;<br>roads in the dead of night at speeds that are shockingly fast. We see it swerve around more than a dozen&para;<br>other cars, cross the double-yellow line, and force cars&para;<br>traveling in both directions to their respective shoul­&para;<br>ders to avoid being hit. We see it run multiple red&para;<br>lights and travel for considerable periods of time in&para;<br>the occasional center left-turn-only lane, chased by&para;<br>numerous police cars forced to engage in the same&para;<br>hazardous maneuvers just to keep up.” Id., at 379–&para;<br>380 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>In light of those facts, “we [thought] it [was] quite clear&para;<br>that [the police officer] did not violate the Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment.” Id., at 381. We held that a “police officer’s attempt&para;<br>to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that&para;<br>threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>motorist at risk of serious injury or death.”3 Id., at 386.&para;<br>We see no basis for reaching a different conclusion here.&para;<br>As we have explained supra, at ___, the chase in this case&para;<br>exceeded 100 miles per hour and lasted over five minutes.&para;<br>During that chase, Rickard passed more than two dozen&para;<br>other vehicles, several of which were forced to alter course.&para;<br>Rickard’s outrageously reckless driving posed a grave&para;<br>public safety risk. And while it is true that Rickard’s car&para;<br>eventually collided with a police car and came temporarily&para;<br>to a near standstill, that did not end the chase. Less than&para;<br>three seconds later, Rickard resumed maneuvering his&para;<br>car. Just before the shots were fired, when the front&para;<br>bumper of his car was flush with that of one of the police&para;<br>cruisers, Rickard was obviously pushing down on the&para;<br>accelerator because the car’s wheels were spinning, and&para;<br>then Rickard threw the car into reverse “in an attempt to&para;<br>escape.” Thus, the record conclusively disproves respond­&para;<br>ent’s claim that the chase in the present case was already&para;<br>over when petitioners began shooting. Under the circum­&para;<br>stances at the moment when the shots were fired, all that&para;<br>a reasonable police officer could have concluded was that&para;<br>Rickard was intent on resuming his flight and that, if he&para;<br>was allowed to do so, he would once again pose a deadly&para;<br>threat for others on the road. Rickard’s conduct even after&para;<br>the shots were fired—as noted, he managed to drive away&para;<br>despite the efforts of the police to block his path—&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 In&para;<br>&para;<br>holding that petitioners’ conduct violated the Fourth Amend­&para;<br>ment, the District Court relied on reasoning that is irreconcilable with&para;<br>our decision in Scott. The District Court held that the danger presented&para;<br>by a high-speed chase cannot justify the use of deadly force because&para;<br>that danger was caused by the officers’ decision to continue the chase.&para;<br>Estate of Allen v. West Memphis, 2011 WL 197426, *8 (WD Tenn., Jan.&para;<br>20, 2011). In Scott, however, we declined to “lay down a rule requiring&para;<br>the police to allow fleeing suspects to get away whenever they drive so&para;<br>recklessly that they put other people’s lives in danger,” concluding that&para;<br>the Constitution “assuredly does not impose this invitation to impunity­&para;<br>earned-by-recklessness.” 550 U. S., at 385–386.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>underscores the point.&para;<br>In light of the circumstances we have discussed, it is&para;<br>beyond serious dispute that Rickard’s flight posed a grave&para;<br>public safety risk, and here, as in Scott, the police acted&para;<br>reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk.&para;<br>2&para;<br>We now consider respondent’s contention that, even if&para;<br>the use of deadly force was permissible, petitioners acted&para;<br>unreasonably in firing a total of 15 shots. We reject that&para;<br>argument. It stands to reason that, if police officers are&para;<br>justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe&para;<br>threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting&para;<br>until the threat has ended. As petitioners noted below, “if&para;<br>lethal force is justified, officers are taught to keep shooting&para;<br>until the threat is over.” 509 Fed. Appx., at 392.&para;<br>Here, during the 10-second span when all the shots were&para;<br>fired, Rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee. In­&para;<br>deed, even after all the shots had been fired, he managed&para;<br>to drive away and to continue driving until he crashed.&para;<br>This would be a different case if petitioners had initiated a&para;<br>second round of shots after an initial round had clearly&para;<br>incapacitated Rickard and had ended any threat of con­&para;<br>tinued flight, or if Rickard had clearly given himself up.&para;<br>But that is not what happened.&para;<br>In arguing that too many shots were fired, respondent&para;<br>relies in part on the presence of Kelly Allen in the front&para;<br>seat of the car, but we do not think that this factor&para;<br>changes the calculus. Our cases make it clear that “Fourth&para;<br>Amendment rights are personal rights which . . . may not&para;<br>be vicariously asserted.” Alderman v. United States, 394&para;<br>U. S. 165, 174 (1969); see also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S.&para;<br>128, 138–143 (1978). Thus, the question before us is&para;<br>whether petitioners violated Rickard’s Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights, not Allen’s. If a suit were brought on behalf of&para;<br>Allen under either §1983 or state tort law, the risk to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Allen would be of central concern.4 But Allen’s presence in&para;<br>the car cannot enhance Rickard’s Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights. After all, it was Rickard who put Allen in danger&para;<br>by fleeing and refusing to end the chase, and it would be&para;<br>perverse if his disregard for Allen’s safety worked to his&para;<br>benefit.&para;<br>C&para;<br>We have held that petitioners’ conduct did not violate&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment, but even if that were not the case,&para;<br>petitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment&para;<br>based on qualified immunity.&para;<br>An official sued under §1983 is entitled to qualified&para;<br>immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a&para;<br>statutory or constitutional right that was “ ‘clearly estab­&para;<br>lished’ ” at the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v.&para;<br>al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). And a&para;<br>defendant cannot be said to have violated a clearly estab­&para;<br>lished right unless the right’s contours were sufficiently&para;<br>definite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s&para;<br>shoes would have understood that he was violating it. Id.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 9). In other words, “existing precedent&para;<br>must have placed the statutory or constitutional question”&para;<br>confronted by the official “beyond debate.” Ibid. In addi­&para;<br>tion, “[w]e have repeatedly told courts . . . not to define&para;<br>clearly established law at a high level of generality,” id., at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 There&para;<br>&para;<br>seems to be some disagreement among lower courts as to&para;<br>whether a passenger in Allen’s situation can recover under a Fourth&para;<br>Amendment theory. Compare Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F. 3d 1323 (CA11&para;<br>2003) (suggesting yes), and Fisher v. Memphis, 234 F. 3d 312 (CA6&para;<br>2000) (same), with Milstead v. Kibler, 243 F. 3d 157 (CA4 2001) (sug­&para;<br>gesting no), and Landol-Rivera v. Cruz Cosme, 906 F. 2d 791 (CA1&para;<br>1990) (same). We express no view on this question. We also note that&para;<br>in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 836 (1998), the Court&para;<br>held that a passenger killed as a result of a police chase could recover&para;<br>under a substantive due process theory only if the officer had “a pur­&para;<br>pose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 10), since doing so avoids the crucial ques­&para;<br>tion whether the official acted reasonably in the particular&para;<br>circumstances that he or she faced. We think our deci­&para;<br>sion in Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194 (2004) (per&para;<br>curiam) squarely demonstrates that no clearly established&para;<br>law precluded petitioners’ conduct at the time in question.&para;<br>In Brosseau, we held that a police officer did not violate&para;<br>clearly established law when she fired at a fleeing vehicle&para;<br>to prevent possible harm to “other officers on foot who&para;<br>[she] believed were in the immediate area, . . . occupied&para;<br>vehicles in [the driver’s] path[,] and . . . any other citizens&para;<br>who might be in the area.” Id., at 197 (quoting 339 F. 3d&para;<br>857, 865 (CA9 2003); internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>After surveying lower court decisions regarding the rea­&para;<br>sonableness of lethal force as a response to vehicular&para;<br>flight, we observed that this is an area “in which the result&para;<br>depends very much on the facts of each case” and that the&para;<br>cases “by no means ‘clearly establish[ed]’ that [the of­&para;<br>ficer’s] conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.” 543&para;<br>U. S., at 201. In reaching that conclusion, we held that&para;<br>Garner and Graham, which are “cast at a high level of&para;<br>generality,” did not clearly establish that the officer’s&para;<br>decision was unreasonable. 543 U. S., at 199.&para;<br>Brosseau makes plain that as of February 21, 1999—the&para;<br>date of the events at issue in that case—it was not clearly&para;<br>established that it was unconstitutional to shoot a fleeing&para;<br>driver to protect those whom his flight might endanger.&para;<br>We did not consider later decided cases because they&para;<br>“could not have given fair notice to [the officer].” Id., at&para;<br>200, n. 4. To defeat immunity here, then, respondent&para;<br>must show at a minimum either (1) that the officers’ con­&para;<br>duct in this case was materially different from the conduct&para;<br>in Brosseau or (2) that between February 21, 1999, and&para;<br>July 18, 2004, there emerged either “ ‘controlling authority’ ”&para;<br>or a “robust ‘consensus of cases of persuasive authority,’ ”&para;<br>al-Kidd, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting Wilson&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999); some internal quota­&para;<br>tion marks omitted), that would alter our analysis of the&para;<br>qualified immunity question. Respondent has made nei­&para;<br>ther showing.&para;<br>To begin, certain facts here are more favorable to the&para;<br>officers. In Brosseau, an officer on foot fired at a driver&para;<br>who had just begun to flee and who had not yet driven his&para;<br>car in a dangerous manner. In contrast, the officers here&para;<br>shot at Rickard to put an end to what had already been a&para;<br>lengthy, high-speed pursuit that indisputably posed a&para;<br>danger both to the officers involved and to any civilians&para;<br>who happened to be nearby. Indeed, the lone dissenting&para;<br>Justice in Brosseau emphasized that in that case, “there&para;<br>was no ongoing or prior high-speed car chase to inform the&para;<br>[constitutional] analysis.” 543 U. S., at 206, n. 4 (opinion&para;<br>of Stevens, J.). Attempting to distinguish Brosseau, re­&para;<br>spondent focuses on the fact that the officer there fired&para;<br>only 1 shot, whereas here three officers collectively fired&para;<br>15 shots. But it was certainly not clearly established at&para;<br>the time of the shooting in this case that the number of&para;<br>shots fired, under the circumstances present here, ren­&para;<br>dered the use of force excessive.&para;<br>Since respondent cannot meaningfully distinguish&para;<br>Brosseau, her only option is to show that its analysis was&para;<br>out of date by 2004. Yet respondent has not pointed us to&para;<br>any case—let alone a controlling case or a robust consen­&para;<br>sus of cases—decided between 1999 and 2004 that could&para;<br>be said to have clearly established the unconstitutionality&para;<br>of using lethal force to end a high-speed car chase. And&para;<br>respondent receives no help on this front from the opinions&para;<br>below. The District Court cited only a single case decided&para;<br>between 1999 and 2004 that identified a possible constitu­&para;<br>tional violation by an officer who shot a fleeing driver, and&para;<br>the facts of that case—where a reasonable jury could have&para;<br>concluded that the suspect merely “accelerated to eighty to&para;<br>eighty-five miles per hour in a seventy-miles-per-hour&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Cox, 343 F. 3d 1323, 1330–1331 (CA11&para;<br>2003)—bear little resemblance to those here.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Under the circumstances present in this case, we hold&para;<br>that the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit petitioners&para;<br>from using the deadly force that they employed to termi­&para;<br>nate the dangerous car chase that Rickard precipitated.&para;<br>In the alternative, we note that petitioners are entitled to&para;<br>qualified immunity for the conduct at issue because they&para;<br>violated no clearly established law.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
