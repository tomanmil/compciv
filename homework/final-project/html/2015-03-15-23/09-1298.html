UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1298. Argued January 18, 2011—Decided May 23, 2011*&para;<br>After petitioners fell behind schedule in developing a stealth aircraft&para;<br>(A–12) for the Navy, the contracting officer terminated their $4.8 bil&para;<br>lion fixed-price contract for default and ordered petitioners to repay&para;<br>approximately $1.35 billion in progress payments for work the Gov&para;<br>ernment never accepted. Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal&para;<br>Claims (CFC), challenging the termination decision under the Con&para;<br>tract Disputes Act of 1978. They argued that Federal Circuit prece&para;<br>dent permitted their default to be excused because the Government&para;<br>had failed to share its “superior knowledge” about how to design and&para;<br>manufacture stealth aircraft. Uncovering the extent of such knowl&para;<br>edge proved difficult because the design, materials, and manufactur&para;<br>ing process for prior stealth aircraft, operated by the Air Force, are&para;<br>closely guarded military secrets. After military secrets were dis&para;<br>closed during discovery, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force warned&para;<br>the CFC that further discovery into the extent of the Government’s&para;<br>superior knowledge would risk disclosing classified information. The&para;<br>CFC terminated such discovery and found the superior-knowledge&para;<br>question nonjusticiable. The CFC subsequently converted the termi&para;<br>nation into a less-Government-friendly termination for convenience&para;<br>and awarded petitioners $1.2 billion. The Federal Circuit reversed.&para;<br>On remand, the CFC sustained the default termination and reaf&para;<br>firmed that petitioners’ superior-knowledge affirmative defense could&para;<br>not be litigated. The Federal Circuit again reversed, but it found&para;<br>that the state-secrets privilege prevented adjudicating petitioners’&para;<br>superior-knowledge defense. On remand, the CFC again found peti&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 09–1302, Boeing Co., Successor to McDonnell&para;<br>Douglas Corp. v. United States, also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tioners had defaulted, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: When, to protect state secrets, a court dismisses a Government&para;<br>contractor’s prima facie valid affirmative defense to the Govern&para;<br>ment’s allegations of contractual breach, the proper remedy is to&para;<br>leave the parties where they were on the day they filed suit. Pp. 5–&para;<br>14.&para;<br>(a) The CFC held that, since invocation of the state-secrets privi&para;<br>lege obscured too many of the facts relevant to the superior&para;<br>knowledge defense, the issue of that defense was nonjusticiable, even&para;<br>though petitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged evi&para;<br>dence for a prima facie showing. In this situation, the Court must&para;<br>exercise its common-law authority to fashion contractual remedies in&para;<br>Government-contracting disputes. The relevant state-secrets juris&para;<br>prudence comes not from United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1,&para;<br>which deals with the Government’s evidentiary privilege against&para;<br>court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets, but from Totten&para;<br>v. United States, 92 U. S. 105, and Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, two&para;<br>cases dealing with alleged contracts to spy.&para;<br>Where liability depends on the validity of a plausible superior&para;<br>knowledge defense, and when full litigation of that defense “would&para;<br>inevitably lead to the disclosure of” state secrets, Totten, supra, at&para;<br>107, neither party can obtain judicial relief. It seems unrealistic to&para;<br>separate the claim from the defense, allowing the former to proceed&para;<br>while barring the latter. Claims and defenses together establish the&para;<br>justification, or lack of justification, for judicial relief; and when pub&para;<br>lic policy precludes judicial intervention for the one it should also&para;<br>preclude judicial intervention for the other. Suit on the contract, or&para;<br>for performance rendered or funds paid under the contract, will not&para;<br>lie, and courts should leave the parties to the agreement where they&para;<br>stood on the day they filed suit. The Government suggests that at&para;<br>the time of suit, petitioners had been held in default by the contract&para;<br>ing officer and were liable for the ensuing consequences. But that&para;<br>was merely one step in the parties’ contractual regime. The “position&para;<br>of the parties” at the time of suit is not their position with regard to&para;<br>legal burdens and the legal consequences of contract-related deter&para;<br>minations, but their position with regard to possession of funds and&para;<br>property. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(b) Neither side will be entirely happy with this resolution. Gen&para;<br>eral Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants to turn the termination into&para;<br>one for convenience and reinstate the CFC’s $1.2 billion award, but&para;<br>that is not an option under the A–12 agreement. Moreover, state se&para;<br>crets would make it impossible to calculate petitioners’ damages.&para;<br>The Government wants a return of the $1.35 billion it paid petition&para;<br>ers for work never accepted, but the validity of that claim depends on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the nonjusticiable issue whether petitioners are in default. As in Tot&para;<br>ten, see 92 U. S., at 106, the Court’s refusal to enforce this contract&para;<br>captures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or rea&para;<br>sonably ought to have been. They must have assumed the risk that&para;<br>state secrets would prevent the adjudication of inadequate perform&para;<br>ance claims. Moreover, this ruling’s impact here is likely much more&para;<br>significant than its impact in future cases, except to the extent that it&para;<br>renders the law more predictable and hence more subject to accom&para;<br>modation by contracting parties. Whether the Government had an&para;<br>obligation to share its superior knowledge about stealth technology is&para;<br>left for the Federal Circuit to address on remand.

The A–12 proved&para;<br>unexpectedly difficult to design and manufacture, and by&para;<br>December 1990, petitioners were almost two years behind&para;<br>schedule and spending $120 to $150 million each month to&para;<br>develop the A–12.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners informed the Government that the cost of&para;<br>completing the contract would exceed the contract price by&para;<br>an “ ‘unacceptable’ ” amount. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.&para;<br>United States, 567 F. 3d 1340, 1343 (CA Fed. 2009); see&para;<br>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 182 F. 3d 1319,&para;<br>1323 (CA Fed. 1999). They proposed restructuring the&para;<br>contract as a cost-reimbursement agreement and offered&para;<br>to absorb a $1.5 billion loss. The Department of Defense&para;<br>had lost faith in the project, however, and Rear Admiral&para;<br>William Morris, the Navy’s contracting officer for the A–12&para;<br>agreement, terminated the contract for default on Jan­&para;<br>uary 7, 1991.&para;<br>By that point, petitioners had spent $3.88 billion at­&para;<br>tempting to develop the A–12, and the Government had&para;<br>provided $2.68 billion in progress payments. A few weeks&para;<br>after terminating the contract, the Navy sent petitioners a&para;<br>letter demanding the return of approximately $1.35 billion&para;<br>in progress payments for work never accepted by the&para;<br>Government. The parties later entered into a deferred&para;<br>payment agreement covering this amount.&para;<br>Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims&para;<br>(CFC) to challenge Admiral Morris’s termination decision&para;<br>under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2388, as&para;<br>amended, 41 U. S. C. §609(a)(1). The Federal Circuit has&para;<br>recognized a governmental obligation not to mislead con­&para;<br>tractors about, or silently withhold, its “superior knowl­&para;<br>edge” of difficult-to-discover information “vital” to contrac­&para;<br>tual performance. GAF Corp. v. United States, 932 F. 2d&para;<br>947, 949 (1991). Petitioners asserted that the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s failure to share its “superior knowledge” about how&para;<br>to design and manufacture stealth aircraft excused their&para;<br>default (and also asserted other claims not relevant here).&para;<br>Uncovering the extent of the Government’s prior experi­&para;<br>ence with stealth technology proved difficult. The design,&para;<br>materials, and manufacturing process for two prior stealth&para;<br>aircraft operated by the Air Force—the B–2 and the F–&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>117A—are some of the Government’s most closely guarded&para;<br>military secrets. “ ‘[N]eed-to-know’ or [special] access con­&para;<br>trols beyond those normally provided for access to Con­&para;<br>fidential, Secret, or Top Secret information” apply. 32&para;<br>CFR §154.3(x) (2010); see App. 384–385. The Government&para;<br>nevertheless granted 10 members of petitioners’ litigation&para;<br>team “access to the Secret/Special Access level of the B–2&para;<br>and F–117A programs.” Id., at 385. Four of those ten&para;<br>individuals received access to even the most sensitive&para;<br>aspects of the programs. See ibid.&para;<br>That neither satisfied petitioners’ thirst for discovery&para;<br>nor prevented the unauthorized disclosure of military&para;<br>secrets. In March 1993, Acting Secretary of the Air Force&para;<br>Michael Donley asserted the state-secrets privilege to bar&para;<br>discovery into certain aspects of stealth technology beyond&para;<br>petitioners’ “need-to-know” authorizations. At a deposi­&para;<br>tion that month, a former Navy official’s responses to&para;<br>questions by petitioners and the Government revealed&para;<br>military secrets neither side’s litigation team was author­&para;<br>ized to know. Copies of the unclassified deposition were&para;<br>widely distributed and quoted in unsealed court filings&para;<br>until Government security officials discovered the breach&para;<br>a month later. A July 1993 deposition caused further&para;<br>unauthorized disclosures of military secrets.&para;<br>These disclosures led Acting Secretary of the Air Force&para;<br>Merrill McPeak to file a declaration with the CFC. He&para;<br>warned that further discovery into the extent of the Gov­&para;<br>ernment’s superior knowledge “would present a continuing&para;<br>threat of disclosure of . . . military and state secrets” sur­&para;<br>rounding the “weight, profile or signature, and materials&para;<br>involved in the design and construction of ‘stealt[h]’ . . .&para;<br>aircraft and weapons systems.” Id., at 633, 635. Even&para;<br>relatively straightforward and innocuous questions, in his&para;<br>opinion, “would pose unacceptable risks of disclosure of&para;<br>classified, special access information,” id., at 636, includ­&para;<br>ing the potential disclosure of covert Government pro­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>grams, id., at 637.&para;<br>The CFC took Secretary McPeak’s concerns seriously&para;<br>and terminated discovery relating to superior knowledge.&para;<br>It later decided that the extent of the Government’s supe­&para;<br>rior knowledge was a nonjusticiable question. Both sides&para;<br>had enough evidence to “present a persuasive case” on&para;<br>the superior-knowledge issue, but the CFC worried that,&para;<br>“wit[h] numerous layers of potentially dispositive facts”&para;<br>hidden by the privilege, its superior-knowledge rulings&para;<br>“would be a sham,” McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United&para;<br>States, 37 Fed. Cl. 270, 280, 284–285 (1996), and one that&para;<br>would threaten national security, see id., at 281–282.&para;<br>In 1996, for reasons not relevant here, the CFC con­&para;<br>verted the termination into a less-Government-friendly&para;<br>termination for convenience and awarded petitioners $1.2&para;<br>billion. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 35 Fed.&para;<br>Cl. 358. The Federal Circuit reversed, 182 F. 3d, at 1332,&para;<br>and left it for the CFC to reconsider on remand whether&para;<br>the need to protect military secrets precluded discovery&para;<br>into the superior-knowledge issue, id., at 1329–1330.&para;<br>After a 6-week trial, the CFC sustained the default&para;<br>termination, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States,&para;<br>50 Fed. Cl. 311, 326 (2001), and reaffirmed that the par­&para;<br>ties could not safely litigate whether the Government’s&para;<br>superior knowledge excused petitioners’ default, id., at&para;<br>325. The Court of Appeals reversed the default termina­&para;<br>tion, but agreed that the state-secrets privilege prevented&para;<br>adjudicating whether the Government’s superior knowl­&para;<br>edge excused the default. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.&para;<br>United States, 323 F. 3d 1006, 1024 (CA Fed. 2003). It&para;<br>rejected petitioners’ assertion that the Government could&para;<br>not pursue a claim against a party and then use the state­&para;<br>secrets privilege to completely preempt defenses to that&para;<br>claim; the Court of Appeals believed United States v.&para;<br>Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 12 (1953), had already “rejected”&para;<br>this “very argument.” 323 F. 3d, at 1023. Litigants can­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 76&para;<br>Fed. Cl. 385, 430 (2007). The Court of Appeals affirmed,&para;<br>see 567 F. 3d, at 1356, and we granted certiorari to review&para;<br>its state-secrets holding. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Many of the Government’s efforts to protect our national&para;<br>security are well known. It publicly acknowledges the size&para;<br>of our military, the location of our military bases, and the&para;<br>names of our ambassadors to Moscow and Peking. But&para;<br>protecting our national security sometimes requires keep­&para;<br>ing information about our military, intelligence, and dip­&para;<br>lomatic efforts secret. See Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 307&para;<br>(1981); Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30–31 (1827). We&para;<br>have recognized the sometimes-compelling necessity of&para;<br>governmental secrecy by acknowledging a Government&para;<br>privilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and&para;<br>military secrets.&para;<br>In Reynolds, three civilian contractors died during a test&para;<br>flight of a B–29 bomber. Their widows filed wrongful­&para;<br>death suits against the Government and sought discovery&para;<br>of the Air Force’s accident-investigation report. Federal&para;<br>discovery rules, then as now, did not require production of&para;<br>documents protected by an evidentiary privilege. See 345&para;<br>U. S., at 6; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1). We held that&para;<br>documents that would disclose state secrets enjoyed such a&para;<br>privilege; the state-secrets privilege, we said, had a “well&para;<br>established” pedigree “in the law of evidence.” 345 U. S.,&para;<br>at 6–7.&para;<br>The penultimate paragraph of Reynolds rejected the&para;<br>widows’ assertion that if the Government invoked the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>state-secrets privilege it had to abandon the claim to&para;<br>which the thereby privileged evidence was relevant. That&para;<br>was, the widows observed, the price paid in criminal cases.&para;<br>If the Government refuses to provide state-secret informa­&para;<br>tion that the accused reasonably asserts is necessary to&para;<br>his defense, the prosecution must be dismissed. See id., at&para;<br>12; Jencks v. United States, 353 U. S. 657, 672 (1957). The&para;<br>penultimate paragraph of Reynolds said that this was a&para;<br>false analogy. A like abandonment of the Government’s&para;<br>claim is not the consequence “in a civil forum where the&para;<br>Government is not the moving party, but is a defendant&para;<br>only on terms to which it has consented.” 345 U. S., at 12.&para;<br>Both petitioners and the Court of Appeals rely upon this&para;<br>statement to support their differing positions.&para;<br>We think that Reynolds has less to do with these cases&para;<br>than the parties believe—and its dictum (of course), less&para;<br>still. Reynolds was about the admission of evidence. It&para;<br>decided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying eviden­&para;<br>tiary rules: The privileged information is excluded and the&para;<br>trial goes on without it. That was to the detriment, of&para;<br>course, of the widows, whom the evidence would have&para;<br>favored. But the Court did not order judgment in favor&para;<br>of the Government. Here, by contrast, the CFC decreed&para;<br>the substantive result that since invocation of the state­&para;<br>secrets privilege obscured too many of the facts relevant to&para;<br>the superior-knowledge defense, the issue of that defense&para;<br>was nonjusticiable, and the defense thus not available.&para;<br>See 37 Fed. Cl., at 284–285. And that was so even though&para;<br>petitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged&para;<br>evidence to “make a prima facie showing.” Id., at 280.&para;<br>While we disagree, for reasons set forth below, with the&para;<br>CFC’s disposition of the remainder of the case, its percep­&para;<br>tion that in the present context the state-secrets issue&para;<br>raises something quite different from a mere evidentiary&para;<br>point seems to us sound. What we are called upon to&para;<br>exercise is not our power to determine the procedural&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rules of evidence, but our common-law authority to fashion&para;<br>contractual remedies in Government-contracting disputes.&para;<br>See Priebe &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, 332 U. S. 407,&para;<br>411 (1947). And our state-secrets jurisprudence bearing&para;<br>upon that authority is not Reynolds, but two cases dealing&para;<br>with alleged contracts to spy.&para;<br>In Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105 (1876), the&para;<br>administrator of a self-styled Civil War spy’s estate&para;<br>brought a breach-of-contract suit against the United&para;<br>States. He alleged that his testator had entered into a&para;<br>contract with President Lincoln to spy on the Confederacy&para;<br>in exchange for $200 a month. After the war ended, the&para;<br>United States reimbursed expenses but did not pay the&para;<br>monthly salary. We recognized that the estate had a&para;<br>potentially valid breach-of-contract claim but dismissed&para;<br>the suit. The contract was for “a secret service,” and&para;<br>litigating the details of that service would risk exposing&para;<br>secret operations and other clandestine operatives “to the&para;<br>serious detriment of the public.” Id., at 106–107. “[P]ublic&para;<br>policy,” we held, “forbids the maintenance of any suit . . .&para;<br>the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of&para;<br>matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and&para;<br>respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be&para;<br>violated.” Id., at 107.&para;<br>Six years ago, we reaffirmed that “public policy for­&para;<br>b[ids]” suits “based on covert espionage agreements.”&para;<br>Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 3 (2005). Such suits threaten to&para;<br>undermine ongoing intelligence-gathering and covert&para;<br>operations—two vital aspects of national security—&para;<br>through inadvertent exposure of espionage relationships.&para;<br>Id., at 11. Rather than tempt fate, we leave the parties to&para;<br>an espionage agreement where we found them the day&para;<br>they filed suit.&para;<br>We think a similar situation obtains here, and that the&para;<br>same consequence should follow. Where liability depends&para;<br>upon the validity of a plausible superior-knowledge de­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fense, and when full litigation of that defense “would&para;<br>inevitably lead to the disclosure of” state secrets, Totten,&para;<br>supra, at 107, neither party can obtain judicial relief. As&para;<br>the CFC concluded, that is the situation here. Disclosure&para;<br>of state secrets occurred twice before the CFC terminated&para;<br>discovery. See 37 Fed. Cl., at 277–278. Every document&para;<br>request or question to a witness would risk further disclo­&para;<br>sure, since both sides have an incentive to probe up to&para;<br>the boundaries of state secrets. State secrets can also be&para;<br>indirectly disclosed. Each assertion of the privilege can&para;<br>provide another clue about the Government’s covert pro­&para;<br>grams or capabilities. See Fitzgerald v. Penthouse Inter&para;<br>national, Ltd., 776 F. 2d 1236, 1243, and n. 10 (CA4 1985).&para;<br>For instance, the fact that the Government had to con­&para;<br>tinue asserting the privilege after granting petitioners&para;<br>access to B–2 and F–117A program information suggests&para;<br>it had other, possibly covert stealth programs in the 1980’s&para;<br>and early 1990’s.&para;<br>It seems to us unrealistic to separate, as the CFC did,&para;<br>the claim from the defense, and to allow the former to&para;<br>proceed while the latter is barred. It is claims and de­&para;<br>fenses together that establish the justification, or lack of&para;<br>justification, for judicial relief; and when public policy&para;<br>precludes judicial intervention for the one it should pre­&para;<br>clude judicial intervention for the other as well.* If, in&para;<br>Totten, it had been the Government seeking return of&para;<br>funds that the estate claimed had been received in pay­&para;<br>ment for espionage activities, it would have been the&para;<br>height of injustice to deny the defense because of the&para;<br>Government’s invocation of state-secret protection, but to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>*Of course, this does not mean the nonjusticiability of one aspect&para;<br>of a case will necessarily end the entire litigation. If, for example, the&para;<br>Government asserts two justifications for its default termination, and if&para;<br>state secrets deprive the contractor of a prima facie valid defense to&para;<br>only one of those claims, the court can still adjudicate the validity of the&para;<br>other.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>maintain jurisdiction over the Government’s claim and&para;<br>award it judgment. Judicial refusal to enforce promises&para;<br>contrary to public policy (here, the Government’s alleged&para;<br>promise to provide superior knowledge, which we could&para;<br>not determine was breached without penetrating several&para;<br>layers of state secrets) is not unknown to the common law,&para;<br>and the traditional course is to leave the parties where&para;<br>they stood when they knocked on the courthouse door.&para;<br>“In general, if a court will not, on grounds of public&para;<br>policy, aid a promisee by enforcing the promise, it will not&para;<br>aid him by granting him restitution for performance that&para;<br>he has rendered in return for the unenforceable promise.&para;<br>Neither will it aid the promisor by allowing a claim in&para;<br>restitution for performance that he has rendered under&para;<br>the unenforceable promise. It will simply leave both&para;<br>parties as it finds them, even though this may result in&para;<br>one of them retaining a benefit that he has received as&para;<br>a result of the transaction.” 2 Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Contracts §197, Comment a, p. 71 (1979); see, e.g., Worlton&para;<br>v. Davis, 73 Idaho 217, 222–223, 249 P. 2d 810, 814 (1952).&para;<br>These cases differ from the common-law cases that we&para;<br>know, in that the unenforceability did not exist at the time&para;<br>the contract was formed, See 2 Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Contracts §179, Comment d, at 18, but arose because&para;<br>of the Government’s assertion of the state-secrets privilege&para;<br>that rendered the promise of superior knowledge unadju­&para;<br>dicable. We do not see why that should affect the remedy.&para;<br>Suit on the contract, or for performance rendered or funds&para;<br>paid under the contract, will not lie, and the parties will&para;<br>be left where they are.&para;<br>The law of contracts contains another doctrine that&para;<br>relates to the CFC’s concern about the reliability of its&para;<br>judgment “without numerous layers of potentially disposi­&para;<br>tive facts,” 37 Fed. Cl., at 284–285. The Statute of Frauds,&para;<br>which has been with us since the 17th century, reflects&para;<br>concerns about the reliability of oral evidence. See Valdez&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Fisheries Development Assn., Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv.&para;<br>Co., 45 P. 3d 657, 669 (Alaska 2002); 9 R. Lord, Williston&para;<br>on Contracts §21:1, pp. 170–172 (4th ed. 1999 and 2010&para;<br>Supp.). It assumes a valid, enforceable agreement be­&para;<br>tween the parties but nevertheless leaves them without a&para;<br>remedy absent reliable evidence—a writing. See 1 id.,&para;<br>§1:21, at 82 (4th ed. 2007 and 2010 Supp.); 9 id., §21:5, at&para;<br>192. So also here, it is preferable to leave the parties&para;<br>without a remedy rather than risk the “potential injus­&para;<br>tice,” Valdez Fisheries, supra, at 669, of misjudging the&para;<br>superior-knowledge issue based on a distorted evidentiary&para;<br>record.&para;<br>The Government suggested at oral argument that where&para;<br>the parties stood at the time of suit was that petitioners&para;<br>had been held in default, liable for the ensuing conse­&para;<br>quences. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49; see also Brief for&para;<br>United States 32, n. 9, 34–35. That had been the declara­&para;<br>tion of the contracting officer, pursuant to Chapter 9&para;<br>(entitled “Contract Disputes”) of Title 41 (entitled “Public&para;<br>Contracts”). See 41 U. S. C. §605. It was “final and con­&para;<br>clusive . . . unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced.”&para;<br>§605(b). We regard that, however, as merely one step in&para;<br>the contractual regime to which the parties had agreed. It&para;<br>has no more bearing upon the question we are discussing&para;<br>than would a provision in a private contract that declara­&para;<br>tion of default by one of the parties is final unless con­&para;<br>tested in court. The “position of the parties” in which we&para;<br>will leave them is not their position with regard to legal&para;<br>burdens and the legal consequences of contract-related&para;<br>determinations, but with regard to possession of funds and&para;<br>property.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Neither side will be entirely happy with the resolution&para;<br>we reach today. General Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants&para;<br>us to convert the termination into one for convenience and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner in No. 09–1298, pp. 58–61. The language of&para;<br>the A–12 agreement does not give us that option. It au­&para;<br>thorizes a court to convert a default termination into a&para;<br>termination for convenience only if it “determine[s] that&para;<br>the Contractor was not in default, or that the default&para;<br>was excusable.” 48 CFR §52.249–9(g) (2010). Our opinion&para;<br>does not express a view on those issues. It holds them&para;<br>nonjusticiable.&para;<br>Moreover, state secrets would make it impossible to&para;<br>calculate petitioners’ damages. A termination for conven­&para;<br>ience ordinarily entitles a contractor to recover its in­&para;<br>curred costs of performance, reasonable termination ex­&para;<br>penses, and a reasonable profit on the work performed (or&para;<br>an offset to account for the contractor’s expected losses&para;<br>had the contract been performed to completion). See&para;<br>§52.249–2(g). The CFC’s $1.2 billion award to petitioners&para;<br>in 1996 simply reflected their actual costs incurred minus&para;<br>progress payments received. The CFC decided it could not&para;<br>calculate petitioners’ expected losses (or profits) without&para;<br>deciding the extent to which the Government’s alleged&para;<br>failure to share its superior knowledge contributed to&para;<br>petitioners’ cost overruns—a nonjusticiable question. See&para;<br>37 Fed. Cl., at 285. Absent proof of the Government’s&para;<br>superior knowledge, and of how the sharing of that would&para;<br>have made this a profitable contract, the $1.2 billion&para;<br>award might represent an undeserved windfall.&para;<br>The Government, for its part, wants a return of the&para;<br>$1.35 billion it paid petitioners in progress payments for&para;<br>work which it says it never approved. But the validity of&para;<br>that claim depends upon whether petitioners are in de­&para;<br>fault on their contract. If they are not, termination for&para;<br>convenience of the Government would entitle them to&para;<br>retain those progress payments (unless, of course, they&para;<br>would have incurred a loss on the entire contract). Nei­&para;<br>ther the question whether they are in default nor the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>question whether performance of the entire contract would&para;<br>have left them with a loss can be judicially determined&para;<br>because of the valid assertion of the state-secret privilege.&para;<br>We leave the parties where they are. As in Totten, see&para;<br>92 U. S., at 106, our refusal to enforce this contract cap­&para;<br>tures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or&para;<br>reasonably ought to have been. Both parties “must have&para;<br>understood,” ibid., that state secrets would prevent courts&para;<br>from resolving many possible disputes under the A–12&para;<br>agreement. The Government asked petitioners to develop&para;<br>an aircraft the design, materials, and manufacturing&para;<br>process for which would be closely guarded military se­&para;<br>crets. See Contract Schedule H–1, App. 73–75; Contract&para;<br>Security Classified Specification, id., at 129–135. The&para;<br>contract itself was a classified document at one point. See&para;<br>Contract Schedule H–1, ¶8, id., at 75. Both parties—the&para;<br>Government no less than petitioners—must have assumed&para;<br>the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication&para;<br>of claims of inadequate performance.&para;<br>We believe, moreover, that the impact of our ruling on&para;<br>these particular cases (which we think produces rough,&para;<br>very rough, equity) is probably much more significant than&para;<br>its impact in future cases, except to the extent that it&para;<br>renders the law more predictable and hence more subject&para;<br>to accommodation by contracting parties. They can ne­&para;<br>gotiate, for example, the timing and amount of progress&para;<br>payments to account for the possibility that state secrets&para;<br>may ultimately render the contract unenforceable. The&para;<br>Government’s concern that contractors will raise frivolous&para;<br>superior-knowledge defenses designed to goad the Gov­&para;<br>ernment into asserting the state-secrets privilege is mis­&para;<br>placed. To begin with, the rule we announce today applies&para;<br>only when the superior-knowledge defense is supported by&para;<br>enough evidence to make out a prima facie case. More­&para;<br>over, Government contractors—especially cutting-edge&para;<br>defense contractors of the sort likely to operate in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>state-secrets field—are repeat players. Even apart from&para;<br>the judicial sanctions available to punish bad conduct,&para;<br>see Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11, 26(g), they have strong incen­&para;<br>tive to behave rather than risk missing out on the next&para;<br>multibillion-dollar defense contract. And finally, while we&para;<br>anticipate that the rule we set forth will ordinarily control&para;<br>Government-contract disputes that become nonjusticiable&para;<br>because of state secrets, what we promulgate today is not&para;<br>a statute but a common-law opinion, which, after the&para;<br>fashion of the common law, is subject to further refine­&para;<br>ment where relevant factors significantly different from&para;<br>those before us here counsel a different outcome.&para;<br>The foregoing analysis assumes that the Government&para;<br>generally has an obligation to share its superior knowl­&para;<br>edge, see GAF Corp., 932 F. 2d, at 949; the parties have&para;<br>not challenged that assumption. The Government argued&para;<br>below, however, that it does not have that obligation with&para;<br>respect to “highly classified information,” and does not&para;<br>have it when (as was the case here) the agreement specifi­&para;<br>cally identifies information that must be shared. Brief for&para;<br>United States 52. The Court of Appeals did not address&para;<br>those questions (it had no reason to, given its disposition&para;<br>of petitioners’ appeal), and we did not grant certiorari to&para;<br>decide them. Those issues (and whether they can safely be&para;<br>litigated without endangering state secrets) therefore&para;<br>remain for the Court of Appeals to address on remand.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In Reynolds, we warned that the state-secrets eviden­&para;<br>tiary privilege “is not to be lightly invoked.” 345 U.
