Argued November 29, 2011—Decided March 26, 2012&para;<br>Under §16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a corporation or&para;<br>security holder of that corporation may sue corporate insiders who&para;<br>realize profits from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of&para;<br>the corporation’s securities within any 6-month period. The Act provides that such suits must be brought within “two years after the&para;<br>date such profit was realized.” 15 U. S. C. §78p(b).&para;<br>In 2007, respondent Simmonds filed numerous §16(b) actions,&para;<br>claiming that, in underwriting various initial public offerings in the&para;<br>late 1990’s and 2000, petitioners and others inflated the stocks’ aftermarket prices, allowing them to profit from the aftermarket sales.&para;<br>She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with §16(a)’s&para;<br>requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership interests. That failure, according to Simmonds, tolled §16(b)’s 2-year&para;<br>time period. The District Court dismissed the complaints as untimely. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Citing its decision in Whittaker v.&para;<br>Whittaker Corp., 639 F. 2d 516, it held that the limitations period is&para;<br>tolled until an insider files the §16(a) disclosure statement “regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.”&para;<br>Held: Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a question on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in&para;<br>determining that it is tolled until a §16(a) statement is filed. The&para;<br>text of §16(b)—which starts the clock from “the date such profit was&para;<br>realized,” §78p(b)—simply does not support the Whittaker rule. The&para;<br>rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling&para;<br>for fraudulent concealment. Under long-settled equitable-tolling&para;<br>principles, a litigant must establish “(1) that he has been pursuing&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances&para;<br>stood in his way.” Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Tolling&para;<br>therefore ceases when fraudulently concealed facts are, or should&para;<br>have been, discovered by the plaintiff. Allowing tolling to continue&para;<br>beyond that point would be inequitable and inconsistent with the&para;<br>general purpose of statutes of limitations: “to protect defendants&para;<br>against stale or unduly delayed claims.” John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.&para;<br>v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133. The Whittaker rule’s inequity is&para;<br>especially apparent here, where the theory of §16(b) liability is so&para;<br>novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware&para;<br>they had to file a §16(a) statement. Under the Whittaker rule, alleged insiders who disclaim the necessity of filing are compelled either to file or to face the prospect of §16(b) litigation in perpetuity.&para;<br>Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it&para;<br>would have said so. Simmonds’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. The lower courts should consider in the first instance&para;<br>how usual equitable tolling rules apply in this case.

S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Petitioners maintain that these suits were properly&para;<br>dismissed because they were filed more than two years after the alleged profits were realized. Pointing to dictum&para;<br>in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson,&para;<br>501 U. S. 350 (1991), petitioners argue that §16(b)’s limitations period is a period of repose, which is not to be&para;<br>“extended to account for a plaintiff ’s discovery of the facts&para;<br>underlying a claim.” Brief for Petitioners 17. See Lampf,&para;<br>supra, at 360, n. 5 (“Section 16(b) . . . sets a 2-year . . .&para;<br>period of repose”). We do not reach that contention, because we conclude that, even assuming that the 2-year&para;<br>period can be extended, the Ninth Circuit erred in determining that it is tolled until the filing of a §16(a)&para;<br>statement.&para;<br>In adopting its rule in Whittaker, the Ninth Circuit expressed its concern that “[i]t would be a simple matter&para;<br>for the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of Section&para;<br>16(b) . . . simply by failing to file . . . reports in violation of&para;<br>subdivision (a) and thereby concealing from prospective&para;<br>plaintiffs the information they would need” to bring a&para;<br>§16(b) action. 639 F. 2d, at 528 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Assuming that is correct, it does not follow that&para;<br>the limitations period is tolled until the §16(a) statement&para;<br>is filed. Section 16 itself quite clearly does not extend the&para;<br>period in that manner. The 2-year clock starts from “the&para;<br>date such profit was realized.” §78p(b). Congress could&para;<br>have very easily provided that “no such suit shall be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>brought more than two years after the filing of a statement&para;<br>under subsection (a)(2)(C).” But it did not. The text of §16&para;<br>simply does not support the Whittaker rule.&para;<br>The Whittaker court suggested that the background rule&para;<br>of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment6 operates&para;<br>to toll the limitations period until the §16(a) statement is&para;<br>filed. See 639 F. 2d, at 527, and n. 9. Even accepting that&para;<br>equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered&para;<br>by the failure to file a §16(a) statement, the Whittaker rule&para;<br>is completely divorced from long-settled equitable-tolling&para;<br>principles. “Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling&para;<br>bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he&para;<br>has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some&para;<br>extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.” Pace v.&para;<br>DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005) (emphasis added).&para;<br>It is well established, moreover, that when a limitations&para;<br>period is tolled because of fraudulent concealment of facts,&para;<br>the tolling ceases when those facts are, or should have&para;<br>been, discovered by the plaintiff. 2 C. Corman, Limitation&para;<br>of Actions §9.7.1, pp. 55–57 (1991). Thus, we have explained that the statute does not begin to run until discov——————&para;<br>6 Relying on our decision in American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. v. Utah,&para;<br>414 U. S. 538 (1974), Simmonds argues that the Whittaker rule is&para;<br>best understood as applying legal—rather than equitable—tolling. In&para;<br>American Pipe, we held that “commencement of a class action suspends&para;<br>the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the&para;<br>class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to&para;<br>continue as a class action.” 414 U. S., at 554. We based our conclusion&para;<br>on “the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose&para;<br>of [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23 class actions].” Id., at 553. Although we did&para;<br>not employ the term “legal tolling,” some federal courts have used that&para;<br>term to describe our holding on the ground that the rule “is derived&para;<br>from a statutory source,” whereas equitable tolling is “judicially created.” Arivella v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 2d 164, 176&para;<br>(Mass. 2009). The label attached to the Whittaker rule does not matter.&para;<br>As we proceed to explain, neither general equitable-tolling principles&para;<br>nor the “statutory source” of §16 supports the conclusion that the&para;<br>limitations period is tolled until the filing of a §16(a) statement.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ery of the fraud “ ‘where the party injured by the fraud&para;<br>remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of&para;<br>diligence or care on his part.’ ” Lampf, supra, at 363 (quoting Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875); emphasis&para;<br>added). Allowing tolling to continue beyond the point at&para;<br>which a §16(b) plaintiff is aware, or should have been&para;<br>aware, of the facts underlying the claim would quite certainly be inequitable and inconsistent with the general&para;<br>purpose of statutes of limitations: “to protect defendants&para;<br>against stale or unduly delayed claims.” John R. Sand &amp;&para;<br>Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133 (2008).&para;<br>The inequity of the Whittaker rule is especially apparent&para;<br>in a case such as this, where the theory of §16(b) liability&para;<br>of underwriters is so novel that petitioners can plausibly&para;<br>claim that they were not aware they were required to file a&para;<br>§16(a) statement. And where they disclaim the necessity&para;<br>of filing, the Whittaker rule compels them either to file or&para;<br>to face the prospect of §16(b) litigation in perpetuity.&para;<br>Simmonds has acknowledged that “under her theory she&para;<br>could buy stocks in companies who had IPOs 20 years ago&para;<br>and bring claims for short-swing transactions if the underwriters had undervalued a stock.” 602 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>1218. The potential for such endless tolling in cases in&para;<br>which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know of the&para;<br>facts underlying the action is out of step with the purpose&para;<br>of limitations periods in general. And it is especially at&para;<br>odds with a provision that imposes strict liability on putative insiders, see Gollust, 501 U. S., at 122. Had Congress&para;<br>intended this result, it most certainly would have said so.&para;<br>Simmonds maintains that failing to apply the Whittaker&para;<br>rule would obstruct Congress’s objective of curbing shortswing speculation by corporate insiders. This objective,&para;<br>according to Simmonds, is served by §16(a) statements,&para;<br>which “provide the information necessary to trigger §16(b)&para;<br>enforcement.” Brief for Respondent 24. Simmonds—like&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit in Whittaker—disregards the most&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>glaring indication that Congress did not intend that the&para;<br>limitations period be categorically tolled until the statement is filed: The limitations provision does not say so.&para;<br>This fact alone is reason enough to reject a departure from&para;<br>settled equitable-tolling principles. Moreover, §16’s purpose is fully served by the rules outlined above, under&para;<br>which the limitations period would not expire until two&para;<br>years after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have&para;<br>learned the facts underlying a §16(b) action. The usual&para;<br>equitable-tolling inquiry will thus take account of the&para;<br>unavailability of sources of information other than the&para;<br>§16(a) filing. Cf., e.g., Ruth v. Unifund CCR Partners, 604&para;<br>F. 3d 908, 911–913 (CA6 2010); Santos ex rel. Beato v.&para;<br>United States, 559 F. 3d 189, 202–203 (CA3 2009). The&para;<br>oddity of Simmonds’ position is well demonstrated by&para;<br>the circumstances of this case. Under the Whittaker rule,&para;<br>because petitioners have yet to file §16(a) statements (as&para;<br>noted earlier they do not think themselves subject to that&para;<br>requirement), Simmonds still has two years to bring suit,&para;<br>even though she is so well aware of her alleged cause of&para;<br>action that she has already sued. If §16(a) statements&para;<br>were, as Simmonds suggests, indispensable to a party’s&para;<br>ability to sue, Simmonds would not be here.&para;<br>Simmonds also asserts that application of established&para;<br>equitable-tolling doctrine in this context would be inconsistent with Congress’s intention to establish in §16&para;<br>a clear rule that is capable of “mechanical application.”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 57 (internal quotation marks omitted). Equitable tolling, after all, involves fact-intensive&para;<br>disputes “about what the notice was, where it was disseminated, who received it, when it was received, and whether&para;<br>it provides sufficient notice of relevant Section 16(a) facts.”&para;<br>Id, at 56–57. Of course this argument counsels just as&para;<br>much in favor of the “statute of repose” rule that petitioners urge (that is, no tolling whatever) as it does in favor of&para;<br>the Whittaker rule. No tolling is certainly an easily ad-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ministrable bright-line rule. And assuming some form of&para;<br>tolling does apply, it is preferable to apply that form which&para;<br>Congress was certainly aware of, as opposed to the rule&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit has fashioned.7 See Meyer v. Holley, 537&para;<br>U. S. 280, 286 (2003) (“Congress’ silence, while permitting&para;<br>an inference that Congress intended to apply ordinary&para;<br>background tort principles, cannot show that it intended&para;<br>to apply an unusual modification of those rules”).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Having determined that §16(b)’s limitations period is&para;<br>not tolled until the filing of a §16(a) statement, we remand&para;<br>for the lower courts to consider how the usual rules of&para;<br>equitable tolling apply to the facts of this case.8 We are&para;<br>divided 4 to 4 concerning, and thus affirm without precedential effect, the Court of Appeals’ rejection of petitioners’&para;<br>contention that §16(b) establishes a period of repose that&para;<br>is not subject to tolling. The judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further&para;<br>proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or&para;<br>decision of this case.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 It is for this reason that we also reject the Second Circuit’s rule that&para;<br>the 2-year period is tolled until the plaintiff “gets actual notice that a&para;<br>person subject to Section 16(a) has realized specific short-swing profits&para;<br>that are worth pursuing,” Litzler v. CC Investments, L. D. C., 362 F. 3d&para;<br>203, 208 (2004). As that court itself recognized, this actual-notice rule&para;<br>departs from usual equitable-tolling principles. See id., at 207.&para;<br>8 The District Court said that “there is no dispute that all of the facts&para;<br>giving rise to Ms. Simmonds’ complaints against [petitioners] were&para;<br>known to the shareholders of the Issuer Defendants for at least five&para;<br>years before these cases were filed,” 602 F.
