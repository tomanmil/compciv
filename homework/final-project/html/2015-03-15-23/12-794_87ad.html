WOODALL&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–794.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 11, 2013—Decided April 23, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent pleaded guilty to capital murder, capital kidnaping, and&para;<br>first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the&para;<br>murder. He was sentenced to death after the trial court denied defense counsel’s request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse&para;<br>inference from respondent’s decision not to testify at the penalty&para;<br>phase. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment’s requirement of a no-adverse-inference instruction to&para;<br>protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v.&para;<br>Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, is not required at the penalty phase. Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief,&para;<br>holding that the trial court’s refusal to give the requested instruction&para;<br>violated respondent’s privilege against self-incrimination. The Sixth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Because the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection of respondent’s&para;<br>Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit erred in granting the writ. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) The difficult-to-meet standard of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) permits a&para;<br>court to grant federal habeas relief on a claim already “adjudicated&para;<br>on the merits in State court” only if that adjudication “resulted in a&para;<br>decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]&para;<br>Court.” “ ‘[C]learly established Federal law’ ” includes only “ ‘the&para;<br>holdings” of the Court’s decisions,’ ” Howes v. Fields, 565 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___; and an “unreasonable application of ” those holdings must be&para;<br>“ ‘objectively unreasonable,’ ” Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75–&para;<br>76. The state-court ruling must rest on “an error well understood&para;<br>and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Here, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion was not “contrary&para;<br>to” the Court’s holdings in Carter, supra, which required a noadverse-inference instruction at the guilt phase; in Estelle v. Smith,&para;<br>451 U. S. 454, which concerned the introduction at the penalty phase&para;<br>of the results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial psychiatric&para;<br>examination; or in Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 327–330,&para;<br>which disapproved a trial judge’s drawing of an adverse inference&para;<br>from the defendant’s silence at sentencing “with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.”&para;<br>Nor was the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion an unreasonable&para;<br>application of the holdings in those cases. This Court need not decide&para;<br>whether a no-adverse-inference instruction is required in these circumstances, for the issue before the Kentucky Supreme Court was, at&para;<br>a minimum, not “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement,” Harrington, supra, at ___. Mitchell in particular leaves open&para;<br>the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from&para;<br>a defendant’s penalty-phase silence. Thus, it cannot be read to require the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested&para;<br>and denied here. Moreover, because respondent’s own admissions of&para;<br>guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the&para;<br>burden of proof, Mitchell’s narrow holding, which implied that it was&para;<br>limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not apply. Pp. 3–9.&para;<br>(b) Respondent contends that the state court was unreasonable in&para;<br>refusing to extend a governing legal principle to a context in which it&para;<br>should have controlled, but this Court has never adopted such a rule.&para;<br>Section 2254(d)(1) provides a remedy for instances in which a state&para;<br>court unreasonably applies this Court’s precedent; it does not require&para;<br>state courts to extend that precedent or license federal courts to treat&para;<br>the failure to do so as error. The appropriate time to consider, as a&para;<br>matter of first impression, whether Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell require a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction would be on&para;<br>direct review, not in a habeas case governed by §2254(d).

Further investigation revealed that respondent’s “fingerprints were on&para;<br>the van the victim was driving,” “[b]lood was found on&para;<br>[respondent’s] front door,” “[b]lood on his clothing and&para;<br>sweatshirt was consistent with the blood of the victim,”&para;<br>and “DNA on . . . vaginal swabs” taken from the victim&para;<br>“was consistent with” respondent’s.

While recognizing that the Fifth Amendment requires a no-adverseinference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant&para;<br>at the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.

The Court of Appeals held,&para;<br>however, that the “Kentucky Supreme Court’s denial of&para;<br>this constitutional claim was an unreasonable application&para;<br>of ” those cases. 685 F. 3d, at 579. In its view, “reading&para;<br>Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell together, the only reasonable&para;<br>conclusion is that” a no-adverse-inference instruction was&para;<br>required at the penalty phase.

For we are&para;<br>satisfied that the issue was, at a minimum, not “beyond&para;<br>any possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).&para;<br>We have, it is true, held that the privilege against selfincrimination applies to the penalty phase. See Estelle,&para;<br>supra, at 463; Mitchell, supra, at 328–329. But it is not&para;<br>uncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat&para;<br>differently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt&para;<br>phase. See, e.g., Bobby v. Mitts, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(per curiam) (slip op., at 4). We have “never directly held&para;<br>that Carter applies at a sentencing phase where the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment interests of the defendant are different.”&para;<br>United States v.

In that case, the District&para;<br>Judge had actually drawn from the defendant’s silence an&para;<br>adverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to&para;<br>the defendant. See 526 U. S., at 317–319. We held that&para;<br>this ran afoul of the defendant’s “right to remain silent at&para;<br>sentencing.” Id., at 325, 327–328 (citing Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965)).

And Mitchell included an express&para;<br>reservation of direct relevance here: “Whether silence&para;<br>bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon&para;<br>acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward&para;<br>adjustment provided in §3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not&para;<br>before us, and we express no view on it.” Ibid.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Courts of Appeals have recognized that Mitchell left this unresolved; their diverging approaches to the question illustrate the possibility of fairminded disagreement. Compare United States v. Caro, 597&para;<br>F. 3d 608, 629–630 (CA4 2010) (direct appeal) (noting that Mitchell&para;<br>“reserved the question of whether silence bears upon lack of remorse,”&para;<br>but reasoning that “Estelle and Mitchell together suggest that the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment may well prohibit considering a defendant’s silence regarding the nonstatutory aggravating factor of lack of remorse”), with Burr&para;<br>v. Pollard, 546 F. 3d 828, 832 (CA7 2008) (habeas) (while the right to&para;<br>remain silent persists at sentencing, “silence can be consistent not only&para;<br>with exercising one’s constitutional right, but also with a lack of remorse,” which “is properly considered at sentencing” (citing Mitchell,&para;<br>526 U.

Crouse, 451 F. 3d 598, 605, n. 3 (CA10&para;<br>2006) (habeas) (“[T]he circuit courts have readily confined Mitchell to&para;<br>its stated holding, and have allowed sentencing courts to rely on, or&para;<br>draw inferences from, a defendant’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment&para;<br>rights for purposes other than determining the facts of the offense of&para;<br>conviction”).&para;<br>Indeed, the Sixth Circuit itself has previously recognized that Mitchell “explicitly limited its holding regarding inferences drawn from a&para;<br>defendant’s silence to facts about the substantive offense and did not&para;<br>address other inferences that may be drawn from a defendant’s silence.” United States v. Kennedy, 499 F. 3d 547, 552 (2007) (direct&para;<br>appeal).

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Mitchell’s reservation is relevant here for two reasons.&para;<br>First, if Mitchell suggests that some actual inferences&para;<br>might be permissible at the penalty phase, it certainly&para;<br>cannot be read to require a blanket no-adverse-inference&para;<br>instruction at every penalty-phase trial. And it was a&para;<br>blanket instruction that was requested and denied in this&para;<br>case; respondent’s requested instruction would have informed the jury that “[a] defendant is not compelled to&para;<br>testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify&para;<br>should not prejudice him in any way.” App. 31 (emphasis&para;<br>added). Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument&para;<br>that remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial,&para;<br>see Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18,&para;<br>yet the proposed instruction would have precluded the&para;<br>jury from considering respondent’s silence as indicative of&para;<br>his lack of remorse. Indeed, the trial judge declined to&para;<br>give the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because&para;<br>he was “aware of no case law that precludes the jury from&para;<br>considering the defendant’s lack of expression of remorse&para;<br>. . . in sentencing.” App. 36. This alone suffices to establish that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion was&para;<br>not “objectively unreasonable.” Andrade, 538 U. S., at 76.&para;<br>Second, regardless of the scope of respondent’s proposed&para;<br>instruction, any inferences that could have been drawn&para;<br>from respondent’s silence would arguably fall within the&para;<br>class of inferences as to which Mitchell leaves the door&para;<br>open. Respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he&para;<br>faced, including the applicable aggravating circumstances.&para;<br>Thus, Kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its&para;<br>“burden of proving facts relevant to the crime,” 526 U. S.,&para;<br>at 330: Respondent’s own admissions had already established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the&para;<br>burden of proof. There are reasonable arguments that the&para;<br>logic of Mitchell does not apply to such cases. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Ronquillo, 508 F. 3d 744, 749 (CA5 2007)&para;<br>(“Mitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>case because ‘the facts of the offense’ were based entirely&para;<br>on Ronquillo’s admissions, not on any adverse inference&para;<br>. . . . Ronquillo, unlike the defendant in Mitchell, admitted&para;<br>all the predicate facts of his offenses”).&para;<br>The dissent insists that Mitchell is irrelevant because it&para;<br>merely declined to create an exception to the “normal&para;<br>rule,” supposedly established by Estelle, “that a defendant&para;<br>is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction”&para;<br>at sentencing. Post, at 5 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That&para;<br>argument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations&para;<br>of Estelle and Mitchell and hence contravenes §2254(d)’s&para;<br>deferential standard of review. Estelle did not involve an&para;<br>adverse inference based on the defendant’s silence or a&para;<br>corresponding jury instruction. See 451 U. S., at 461–469.&para;<br>Thus, whatever Estelle said about the Fifth Amendment,&para;<br>its holding4—the only aspect of the decision relevant&para;<br>here—does not “requir[e]” the categorical rule the dissent&para;<br>ascribes to it. Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).&para;<br>Likewise, fairminded jurists could conclude that Mitchell’s&para;<br>reservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsibility would have served no meaningful purpose if Estelle&para;<br>had created an across-the-board rule against adverse&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The dissent says Estelle “held that ‘so far as the protection of the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment is concerned,’ it could ‘discern no basis to distinguish&para;<br>between the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant’s ‘capital murder&para;<br>trial.’ ” Post, at 2 (quoting Estelle, 451 U. S., at 462–463). Of course, it&para;<br>did not “hold” that. Rather, it held that the defendant’s Fifth Amendment “rights were abridged by the State’s introduction of ” a pretrial&para;<br>psychiatric evaluation that was administered without the preliminary&para;<br>warning required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). 451&para;<br>U. S., at 473. In any event, even Estelle’s dictum did not assume an&para;<br>entitlement to a blanket no-adverse-inference instruction. The quoted&para;<br>language is reasonably read as referring to the availability of the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment privilege at sentencing rather than the precise scope of&para;<br>that privilege when applied in the sentencing context. Indeed, it&para;<br>appears in a passage responding to the State’s argument that the&para;<br>defendant “was not entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment”&para;<br>in the first place.

See&para;<br>529 U. S., at 407–409 (citing Green v. French, 143 F. 3d&para;<br>865, 869–870 (1998)). We described the Fourth Circuit’s&para;<br>interpretation of §2254(d)(1)’s “unreasonable application”&para;<br>clause as “generally correct,” 529 U. S., at 407, and approved its conclusion that “a state-court decision involves&para;<br>an unreasonable application of this Court’s precedent if&para;<br>the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule&para;<br>. . . but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner’s case,” id., at 407–408 (citing Green,&para;<br>supra, at 869–870). But we took no position on the Fourth&para;<br>Circuit’s further conclusion that a state court commits&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>AEDPA error if it “unreasonably refuse[s] to extend a legal&para;<br>principle to a new context where it should apply.” 529&para;<br>U. S., at 408–409 (citing Green, supra, at 869–870). We&para;<br>chose not “to decide how such ‘extension of legal principle’&para;<br>cases should be treated under §2254(d)(1)” because the&para;<br>Fourth Circuit’s proposed rule for resolving them presented&para;<br>several “problems of precision.” 529 U. S., at 408–409.&para;<br>Two months later, a plurality paraphrased and applied&para;<br>the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in Ramdass.&para;<br>See 530 U. S., at 166–170. It did not, however, grant the&para;<br>habeas petitioner relief on that basis, finding that there&para;<br>was no unreasonable refusal to extend. Moreover, Justice&para;<br>O’Connor, whose vote was necessary to form a majority,&para;<br>cited Williams and made no mention of the unreasonablerefusal-to-extend concept in her separate opinion concurring in the judgment.&para;<br>See 530 U. S., at 178–181.&para;<br>Ramdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) set forth in Williams. Aside from one opinion&para;<br>criticizing the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend doctrine, see&para;<br>Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 666 (2004), we&para;<br>have not revisited the issue since Williams and Ramdass.&para;<br>During that same 14-year stretch, however, we have&para;<br>repeatedly restated our “hold[ing]” in Williams, supra, at&para;<br>409, that a state-court decision is an unreasonable application of our clearly established precedent if it correctly&para;<br>identifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule&para;<br>unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner’s case,&para;<br>see, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 380&para;<br>(2005); Yarborough, supra, at 663; Penry v. Johnson, 532&para;<br>U. S. 782, 792 (2001).&para;<br>Thus, this Court has never adopted the unreasonablerefusal-to-extend rule on which respondent relies. It has&para;<br>not been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let&para;<br>alone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief. To&para;<br>the extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from the one embraced in Williams and reiterated many&para;<br>times since, we reject it. Section 2254(d)(1) provides a&para;<br>remedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably&para;<br>applies this Court’s precedent; it does not require state&para;<br>courts to extend that precedent or license federal courts&para;<br>to treat the failure to do so as error. See Scheidegger, Habeas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98&para;<br>Colum. L. Rev. 888, 949 (1998). Thus, “if a habeas court&para;<br>must extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at&para;<br>hand,” then by definition the rationale was not “clearly&para;<br>established at the time of the state-court decision.” Yarborough, 541 U. S., at 666. AEDPA’s carefully constructed&para;<br>framework “would be undermined if habeas courts introduced rules not clearly established under the guise of&para;<br>extensions to existing law.” Ibid.&para;<br>This is not to say that §2254(d)(1) requires an “ ‘identical&para;<br>factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.’ ”&para;<br>Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 953 (2007). To the&para;<br>contrary, state courts must reasonably apply the rules&para;<br>“squarely established” by this Court’s holdings to the facts&para;<br>of each case. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111, 122&para;<br>(2009). “[T]he difference between applying a rule and&para;<br>extending it is not always clear,” but “[c]ertain principles&para;<br>are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will&para;<br>be beyond doubt.” Yarborough, supra, at 666. The critical point is that relief is available under §2254(d)(1)’s&para;<br>unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious&para;<br>that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of&para;<br>facts that there could be no “fairminded disagreement” on&para;<br>the question, Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).&para;<br>Perhaps the logical next step from Carter, Estelle, and&para;<br>Mitchell would be to hold that the Fifth Amendment requires a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction in&para;<br>a case like this one; perhaps not. Either way, we have not&para;<br>yet taken that step, and there are reasonable arguments&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on both sides—which is all Kentucky needs to prevail in&para;<br>this AEDPA case. The appropriate time to consider the&para;<br>question as a matter of first impression would be on direct&para;<br>review, not in a habeas case governed by §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Because the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection of&para;<br>respondent’s Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively&para;<br>unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting the writ.&para;<br>We therefore need not reach its further holding that the&para;<br>trial court’s putative error was not harmless. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The court refused, and the Kentucky Supreme&para;<br>Court agreed that no instruction was warranted. The&para;<br>question before us is whether the Kentucky courts unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law in&para;<br>concluding that the Fifth Amendment did not entitle&para;<br>Woodall to a no-adverse-inference instruction. See 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In my view, the answer is yes.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This Court’s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S.&para;<br>288 (1981), and Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981),&para;<br>clearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a&para;<br>requested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty&para;<br>phase of a capital trial. First consider Carter. The Court&para;<br>held that a trial judge “has the constitutional obligation,&para;<br>upon proper request,” to give a requested no-adverseinference instruction in order “to minimize the danger that&para;<br>the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant’s&para;<br>failure to testify.” 450 U. S., at 305. This is because when&para;<br>“the jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>instincts to guide it,” it may “draw from the defendant’s&para;<br>silence broad inferences of guilt.” Id., at 301. A trial&para;<br>court’s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference&para;<br>instruction thus “exacts an impermissible toll on the full&para;<br>and free exercise of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.” Id.,&para;<br>at 305.&para;<br>Now consider Estelle. The Court held that “so far as the&para;<br>protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned,”&para;<br>it could “discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt&para;<br>and penalty phases” of a defendant’s “capital murder&para;<br>trial.” 451 U. S., at 462–463. The State had introduced at&para;<br>the penalty phase the defendant’s compelled statements to&para;<br>a psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant’s future&para;<br>dangerousness. Defending the admission of those statements, the State argued that the defendant “was not&para;<br>entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment because&para;<br>[his statements were] used only to determine punishment&para;<br>after conviction, not to establish guilt.” Id., at 462. This&para;<br>Court rejected the State’s argument on the ground that&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment applies equally to the penalty phase&para;<br>and the guilt phase of a capital trial. Id., at 462–463.&para;<br>What is unclear about the resulting law? If the Court&para;<br>holds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then&para;<br>holds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is&para;<br>clear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from&para;<br>discriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic,&para;<br>because the Court held in Carter that the Fifth Amendment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverseinference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and&para;<br>held in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing&para;<br>between the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial&para;<br>for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested&para;<br>no-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of a capital trial.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too narrowly. First, it contends that Estelle’s holding that the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty&para;<br>phases was mere dictum. Ante, at 8, and n. 4. But this&para;<br>rule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is&para;<br>binding precedent, not dictum.&para;<br>Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority&para;<br>acknowledges that Estelle “held that the privilege against&para;<br>self-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,” but it&para;<br>concludes that Estelle said nothing about the content of&para;<br>the privilege in the penalty phase. Ante, at 5 (emphasis&para;<br>added). This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale.&para;<br>The reason that Estelle concluded that the Fifth Amendment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that&para;<br>the Court saw “no basis to distinguish between the guilt&para;<br>and penalty phases of [a defendant’s] capital murder trial&para;<br>so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege&para;<br>is concerned.” 451 U. S., at 462–463. And as there is no&para;<br>basis to distinguish between the two contexts for Fifth&para;<br>Amendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either&para;<br>the application or the content of the Fifth Amendment&para;<br>privilege in the two contexts.&para;<br>The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United&para;<br>States, 526 U. S. 314 (1999), to change the legal landscape where it expressly declined to do so. In Mitchell, the&para;<br>Court considered whether to create an exception to the&para;<br>“normal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative inference from the defendant’s failure to testify is permitted.”&para;<br>Id., at 328. We refused: “We decline to adopt an exception&para;<br>for the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to&para;<br>factual determinations respecting the circumstances and&para;<br>details of the crime.” Ibid. Mitchell thus reiterated what&para;<br>Carter and Estelle had already established. The “normal&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rule” is that Fifth Amendment protections apply during&para;<br>trial and sentencing. Because the Court refused “to adopt&para;<br>an exception” to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added),&para;<br>the law before and after Mitchell remained the same.&para;<br>The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell’s&para;<br>holding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception&para;<br>to the normal rule for certain “factual determinations,”&para;<br>Mitchell suggested that inferences about other matters&para;<br>might be permissible at the penalty phase. Ante, at 5–7.&para;<br>The majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts&para;<br>doubt upon whether Estelle’s Fifth Amendment rule applies to matters unrelated to the “circumstances and&para;<br>details of the crime,” such as remorse, or as to which the&para;<br>State does not bear the burden of proof.&para;<br>As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to overrule—or at least substantially limit—Estelle to create an&para;<br>exception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and&para;<br>details of the crime or for matters on which the defendant&para;<br>bears the burden of proof. Sentencing proceedings, particularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on factual matters that do not directly concern facts of the&para;<br>crime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his&para;<br>growing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical&para;<br>or mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family?&para;<br>Is he remorseful? Estelle itself involved compelled statements introduced to establish the defendant’s future&para;<br>dangerousness—another fact often unrelated to the circumstances or details of a defendant’s crime. 451 U. S., at&para;<br>456. In addition, States typically place the burden to&para;<br>prove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the defendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitchell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended&para;<br>to undermine the very case it reaffirmed.&para;<br>Mitchell held, simply and only, that the normal rule of&para;<br>Estelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case&para;<br>before the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>law beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching beyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so.&para;<br>That does not mean that we throw cases involving all&para;<br>other factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal&para;<br>doubt.&para;<br>The majority also places undue weight on dictum in&para;<br>Mitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create additional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter.&para;<br>We noted: “Whether silence bears upon the determination&para;<br>of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility&para;<br>for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in&para;<br>§3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998),&para;<br>is a separate question. It is not before us, and we express&para;<br>no view on it.” 526 U. S., at 330. This dictum, says the&para;<br>majority, suggests that some inferences, including about&para;<br>remorse (which was at issue in Woodall’s case), may be&para;<br>permissible. Ante, at 5–7.&para;<br>When the Court merely reserves a question that is “not&para;<br>before us” for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal&para;<br>principles that are already clearly established. The Court&para;<br>often identifies questions that it is not answering in order&para;<br>to clarify the question it is answering. In so doing—that&para;<br>is, in “express[ing] no view” on questions that are not&para;<br>squarely before us—we do not create a state of uncertainty&para;<br>as to those questions. And in respect to Mitchell, where&para;<br>the Court reserved the question whether to create an&para;<br>exception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The&para;<br>normal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested noadverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well&para;<br>as the guilt phase remained clearly established after&para;<br>Mitchell.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established law, the majority declares&para;<br>that if a court must “extend” the rationale of a case in&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WHITE v. WOODALL&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>order to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.&para;<br>Ante, at 9–11. I read this to mean simply that if there&para;<br>may be “fairminded disagreement” about whether a rationale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will&para;<br>not unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that&para;<br>rationale, and I agree. See Harrington v. Richter, 562&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2011). I do not understand the majority to&para;<br>suggest that reading two legal principles together would&para;<br>necessarily “extend” the law, which would be a proposition&para;<br>entirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fairminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal&para;<br>rules considered together would dictate a particular outcome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it&para;<br>holds otherwise. Ibid.&para;<br>That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court committed here. Failing to consider together the legal principles&para;<br>established by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined&para;<br>those cases to their facts. It held that Carter did not apply&para;<br>because Woodall had already pleaded guilty—that is,&para;<br>because Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his&para;<br>trial. Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 115&para;<br>(Ky. 2001). And it concluded that Estelle did not apply&para;<br>because Estelle was not a “jury instruction case.” 63 S. W.&para;<br>3d, at 115. The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably&para;<br>failed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel&para;<br>a requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty&para;<br>phase of a capital trial. And reading Mitchell to rein in&para;<br>the law in contemplation of never-before-recognized exceptions to this normal rule would be an unreasonable retraction of clearly established law, not a proper failure to&para;<br>“extend” it. Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied&para;<br>clearly established law in granting Woodall’s habeas&para;<br>petition, I would affirm.&para;<br>With respect I dissent from the Court’s contrary&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
