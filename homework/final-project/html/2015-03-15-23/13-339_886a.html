S. C. §9658. Petitioner CTS Corporation sold&para;<br>property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an&para;<br>electronics plant. Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners&para;<br>of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging&para;<br>damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, citing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to&para;<br>a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant’s last culpable act. Because CTS’s last act occurred when it sold the property,&para;<br>the District Court granted the motion. Finding §9658 ambiguous, the&para;<br>Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute’s remedial purpose&para;<br>favored pre-emption.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed.&para;<br>723 F. 3d 434, reversed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to&para;<br>all but Part II–D, concluding that §9658 does not pre-empt state&para;<br>statutes of repose. Pp. 5–16.&para;<br>(a) The outcome here turns on whether §9658 distinguishes between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both&para;<br>used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability. There&para;<br>is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two,&para;<br>but their specified time periods are measured differently and they&para;<br>seek to attain different purposes and objectives. Statutes of limitations are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Stat-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>utes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should&para;<br>be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time&para;<br>and are measured from the date of the defendant’s last culpable act&para;<br>or omission. The application of equitable tolling underscores their&para;<br>difference in purpose. Because a statute of limitations’ purpose is not&para;<br>furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who&para;<br>was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, equitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute. The purpose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and&para;<br>equitable tolling does not apply. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) The text and structure of §9658 resolve this case. Under that&para;<br>provision, pre-emption is characterized as an “[e]xception,”&para;<br>§9658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the “the statute of limitations established under State law” applies. The “applicable limitations period,” the “commencement date” of which is subject to pre-emption, is&para;<br>defined as “the period specified in a statute of limitations.”&para;<br>§9658(b)(2). That term appears four times, and “statute of repose”&para;<br>does not appear at all. While it is apparent from the historical development of the two terms that their general usage has not always&para;<br>been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided §9658’s enactment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both&para;<br>types of statutes. Because that distinction is not similarly reflected&para;<br>in §9658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to preempt statutes of repose.&para;<br>Other textual features further support this conclusion. It would be&para;<br>awkward to use the singular “applicable limitations period” to mandate pre-emption of two different time periods with two different&para;<br>purposes. And the definition of that limitations period as “the period” during which a “civil action” under state law “may be brought,”&para;<br>§9658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists. A statute of repose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into&para;<br>existence. Section 9658’s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that&para;<br>the statute’s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling. Respondents contend that&para;<br>§9658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose&para;<br>create an obstacle to Congress’ purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v.&para;<br>Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563–564. But the level of generality at which&para;<br>the statute’s purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will&para;<br>further or hinder that purpose. Here, where Congress chose to leave&para;<br>many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that&para;<br>statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of&para;<br>statutory purposes.

Section 9658 applies to statutes of limitations&para;<br>governing actions for personal injury or property damage&para;<br>arising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollu­&para;<br>tant, or contaminant into the environment.&para;<br>Section 9658 adopts what is known as the discovery&para;<br>rule. Under this framework, statutes of limitations in&para;<br>covered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or&para;<br>reasonably should have discovered, that the harm in&para;<br>question was caused by the contaminant. A person who is&para;<br>exposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show&para;<br>signs of resulting injury for many years, and so Congress&para;<br>enacted §9658 out of concern for long latency periods.&para;<br>It is undoubted that the discovery rule in §9658 pre­&para;<br>empts state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>its terms. The question presented in this case is whether&para;<br>§9658 also pre-empts state statutes of repose.&para;<br>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth&para;<br>Circuit held that §9658 does pre-empt statutes of repose.&para;<br>That holding was in error, and, for the reasons that follow,&para;<br>the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 “to promote ‘ “the&para;<br>timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites” ’ and to ensure&para;<br>that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those&para;<br>responsible for the contamination.” Burlington N. &amp; S. F.&para;<br>R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. 599, 602 (2009) (quoting&para;<br>Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. UGI Utilities, Inc.,&para;<br>423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005)). The Act provided a federal&para;<br>cause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable&para;<br>entities but not a federal cause of action for personal&para;<br>injury or property damage. Instead, CERCLA directed&para;<br>preparation of an expert report to determine “the adequacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in&para;<br>providing legal redress for harm to man and the environ­&para;<br>ment caused by the release of hazardous substances into&para;<br>the environment,” including “barriers to recovery posed by&para;<br>existing statutes of limitations.” 42 U. S. C. §9651(e)(1),&para;<br>(3)(F).&para;<br>The 1982 report resulting from that statutory directive&para;<br>proposed certain changes to state tort law. Senate Com­&para;<br>mittee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund&para;<br>Section 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from&para;<br>Hazardous Wastes—Analysis and Improvement of Legal&para;<br>Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1982) (here­&para;<br>inafter Study Group Report or Report). As relevant here,&para;<br>the Study Group Report noted the long latency periods&para;<br>involved in harm caused by toxic substances and “recom­&para;<br>mend[ed] that all states that have not already done so,&para;<br>clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or&para;<br>disease and its cause.” Id., at pt. 1, 256. The Report&para;<br>further stated: “The Recommendation is intended also to&para;<br>cover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a num­&para;<br>ber of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of&para;<br>limitation in barring [a] plaintiff ’s claim before he knows&para;<br>that he has one.” Ibid.&para;<br>Congress did not wait long for States to respond to some&para;<br>or all of the Report’s recommendations. Instead, Congress&para;<br>decided to act at the federal level. Congress amended&para;<br>CERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in&para;<br>§9658. Whether §9658 repeals statutes of repose, as the&para;<br>Study Group Report recommended, is the question to be&para;<br>addressed here.&para;<br>The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS&para;<br>Corporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from&para;<br>1959 to 1985. (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran&para;<br>the plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.)&para;<br>The plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and&para;<br>electronic parts. In the process, it stored the chemicals&para;<br>trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE).&para;<br>In 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that&para;<br>the site was environmentally sound. The buyer eventually&para;<br>sold portions of the property to individuals who, along&para;<br>with adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging dam­&para;<br>age from contaminants on the land. Those who alleged&para;<br>the injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court&para;<br>and are respondents here.&para;<br>Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold&para;<br>the property. The suit, filed in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Western District of North Carolina, was a&para;<br>state-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here.&para;<br>Respondents sought “reclamation” of “toxic chemical con­&para;<br>taminants” belonging to petitioner, “remediation of the&para;<br>environmental harm caused” by contaminants, and “mone­&para;<br>tary damages in an amount that will fully compensate&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>them for all the losses and damages they have suffered,&para;<br>. . . and will suffer in the future.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>57a. Respondents claim that in 2009 they learned from&para;<br>the Environmental Protection Agency that their well&para;<br>water was contaminated, allegedly while petitioner oper­&para;<br>ated its electronics plant.&para;<br>Citing North Carolina’s statute of repose, CTS moved to&para;<br>dismiss the claim. That statute prevents subjecting a&para;<br>defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after&para;<br>the last culpable act of the defendant. N. C. Gen. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §1–52(16) (Lexis 2013) (“[N]o cause of action shall&para;<br>accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of&para;<br>the defendant giving rise to the cause of action”); Robinson&para;<br>v. Wadford, ___ N. C. App. ___, ___, 731 S. E. 2d 539, 541&para;<br>(2012) (referring to the provision as a “statute of repose”).&para;<br>Because CTS’ last act occurred in 1987, when it sold the&para;<br>electronics plant, the District Court accepted the recom­&para;<br>mendation of a Magistrate Judge and granted CTS’ motion&para;<br>to dismiss.&para;<br>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth&para;<br>Circuit reversed, ruling that §9658 pre-empted the statute&para;<br>of repose. 723 F. 3d 434 (2013). The majority found §9658&para;<br>“ambiguous,” but also found that the interpretation in&para;<br>favor of pre-emption was preferable because of CERCLA’s&para;<br>remedial purpose. Id., at 443–444.&para;<br>Judge Thacker dissented. Id., at 445–454. She found&para;<br>the statutory text’s exclusion of statutes of repose to be&para;<br>“plain and unambiguous.” Id., at 445. She further indi­&para;<br>cated that, even “if the preemptive effect of §9658 were&para;<br>susceptible to two interpretations, a presumption against&para;<br>preemption would counsel that we should limit §9658’s&para;<br>preemptive reach to statutes of limitations without also&para;<br>extending it to statutes of repose.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court of&para;<br>South Dakota, have rendered conflicting judgments on&para;<br>this question.

S. ___ (2014).&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The outcome of the case turns on whether §9658 makes&para;<br>a distinction between state-enacted statutes of limitations&para;<br>and statutes of repose. Statutes of limitations and stat­&para;<br>utes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the&para;<br>temporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.&para;<br>Both types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff ’s suit,&para;<br>and in each instance time is the controlling factor. There&para;<br>is considerable common ground in the policies underlying&para;<br>the two types of statute. But the time periods specified&para;<br>are measured from different points, and the statutes seek&para;<br>to attain different purposes and objectives. And, as will be&para;<br>explained, §9658 mandates a distinction between the two.&para;<br>In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates “a&para;<br>time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when&para;<br>the claim accrued.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed.&para;<br>2009) (Black’s); see also Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &amp;&para;<br>Accident Ins. Co., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4)&para;<br>(“As a general matter, a statute of limitations begins to&para;<br>run when the cause of action ‘ “accrues” ’—that is, when&para;<br>‘the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief ’ ” (quoting Bay&para;<br>Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.&para;<br>Ferbar Corp. of Cal., Inc., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997))).&para;<br>Measured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal­&para;<br>injury or property-damage action “when the injury oc­&para;<br>curred or was discovered.” Black’s 1546. For example,&para;<br>North Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a&para;<br>statute of limitations that allows a person three years to&para;<br>bring suit for personal injury or property damage, begin­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ning on the date that damage “becomes apparent or ought&para;<br>reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,&para;<br>whichever event first occurs.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–&para;<br>52(16).&para;<br>A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer&para;<br>limit on the right to bring a civil action. That limit is&para;<br>measured not from the date on which the claim accrues&para;<br>but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omis­&para;<br>sion of the defendant. A statute of repose “bar[s] any suit&para;<br>that is brought after a specified time since the defendant&para;<br>acted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product),&para;<br>even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a&para;<br>resulting injury.” Black’s 1546. The statute of repose&para;<br>limit is “not related to the accrual of any cause of action;&para;<br>the injury need not have occurred, much less have been&para;<br>discovered.” 54 C. J. S., Limitations of Actions §7, p. 24&para;<br>(2010) (hereinafter C. J. S.). The repose provision is there­&para;<br>fore equivalent to “a cutoff,” Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,&para;<br>Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 363 (1991),&para;<br>in essence an “absolute . . . bar” on a defendant’s temporal&para;<br>liability, C. J. S. §7, at 24.&para;<br>Although there is substantial overlap between the poli­&para;<br>cies of the two types of statute, each has a distinct purpose&para;<br>and each is targeted at a different actor. Statutes of limi­&para;<br>tations require plaintiffs to pursue “diligent prosecution of&para;<br>known claims.” Black’s 1546. Statutes of limitations&para;<br>“promote justice by preventing surprises through [plain­&para;<br>tiffs’] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber&para;<br>until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and&para;<br>witnesses have disappeared.” Railroad Telegraphers v.&para;<br>Railway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U. S. 342, 348–349&para;<br>(1944). Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to&para;<br>bring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the&para;<br>same reasons. But the rationale has a different emphasis.&para;<br>Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a&para;<br>defendant should “be free from liability after the legisla­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tively determined period of time.” C. J. S. §7, at 24; see&para;<br>also School Board of Norfolk v. United States Gypsum Co.,&para;<br>234 Va. 32, 37, 360 S. E. 2d 325, 328 (1987) (“[S]tatutes&para;<br>of repose reflect legislative decisions that as a matter of&para;<br>policy there should be a specific time beyond which a&para;<br>defendant should no longer be subjected to protracted&para;<br>liability” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Like a&para;<br>discharge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to&para;<br>provide a fresh start or freedom from liability. Indeed, the&para;<br>Double Jeopardy Clause has been described as “a statute&para;<br>of repose” because it in part embodies the idea that at&para;<br>some point a defendant should be able to put past events&para;<br>behind him. Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376, 392 (1989)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>One central distinction between statutes of limitations&para;<br>and statutes of repose underscores their differing purposes.&para;<br>Statutes of limitations, but not statutes of repose, are&para;<br>subject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that “pauses the&para;<br>running of, or ‘tolls,’ a statute of limitations when a liti­&para;<br>gant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordi­&para;<br>nary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely&para;<br>action.” Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S. 1, ___&para;<br>(2014) (slip op., at 7). Statutes of repose, on the other&para;<br>hand, generally may not be tolled, even in cases of ex­&para;<br>traordinary circumstances beyond a plaintiff ’s control.&para;<br>See, e.g., Lampf, supra, at 363 (“[A] period of repose [is]&para;<br>inconsistent with tolling”); 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal&para;<br>Practice and Procedure §1056, p. 240 (3d ed. 2002) (“[A]&para;<br>critical distinction is that a repose period is fixed and its&para;<br>expiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling”);&para;<br>Restatement (Second) of Torts §899, Comment g (1977).&para;<br>Equitable tolling is applicable to statutes of limitations&para;<br>because their main thrust is to encourage the plaintiff to&para;<br>“pursu[e] his rights diligently,” and when an “extraordi­&para;<br>nary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely&para;<br>action,” the restriction imposed by the statute of limita­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions does not further the statute’s purpose. Lozano,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7). But a statute of repose is a&para;<br>judgment that defendants should “be free from liability&para;<br>after the legislatively determined period of time, beyond&para;<br>which the liability will no longer exist and will not be&para;<br>tolled for any reason.” C. J. S. §7, at 24. As an illustrative&para;<br>example, under North Carolina law statutes of limitations&para;<br>may be tolled but statutes of repose may not. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Monson v.

The Court of&para;<br>Appeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute&para;<br>for a conclusion grounded in the statute’s text and struc­&para;<br>ture. After all, almost every statute might be described as&para;<br>remedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to&para;<br>remedy some problem. And even if the Court identified&para;<br>some subset of statutes as especially remedial, the Court&para;<br>has emphasized that “no legislation pursues its purposes&para;<br>at all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522,&para;<br>525–526 (1987) (per curiam). Congressional intent is&para;<br>discerned primarily from the statutory text. In any event,&para;<br>were the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve&para;<br>ambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposi­&para;<br>tion that “the States’ coordinate role in government coun­&para;<br>sels against reading” federal laws such as §9658 “to re­&para;<br>strict the States’ sovereign capacity to regulate” in areas of&para;<br>traditional state concern. FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health&para;<br>System, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 18).&para;<br>Turning to the statutory text, the Court notes first that&para;<br>§9658, in the caption of subsection (a), characterizes pre­&para;<br>emption as an “[e]xception” to the regular rule.&para;<br>§9658(a)(1). Section 9658 contains another subsection,&para;<br>with the heading “State law generally applicable,” that&para;<br>provides the rule that “the statute of limitations estab­&para;<br>lished under State law shall apply.” §9658(a)(2). Under&para;<br>this structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>into the precise terms of the exception.&para;<br>The statute defines the “applicable limitations period,”&para;<br>the “commencement date” of which is subject to pre­&para;<br>emption, as a period specified in “a statute of limitations.”&para;<br>§9658(b)(2). Indeed, §9658 uses the term “statute of limi­&para;<br>tations” four times (not including the caption), but not the&para;<br>term “statute of repose.” This is instructive, but it is not&para;<br>dispositive. While the term “statute of limitations” has&para;<br>acquired a precise meaning, distinct from “statute of&para;<br>repose,” and while that is its primary meaning, it must be&para;<br>acknowledged that the term “statute of limitations” is&para;<br>sometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can&para;<br>refer to any provision restricting the time in which a&para;<br>plaintiff must bring suit. See Black’s 1546; see also Ernst&para;<br>&amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 210 (1976). Con­&para;<br>gress has used the term “statute of limitations” when&para;<br>enacting statutes of repose. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §78u–&para;<br>6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose&para;<br>and placing it in a provision entitled “Statute of limita­&para;<br>tions”); 42 U. S. C. §2278 (same). And petitioner does not&para;<br>point out an example in which Congress has used the term&para;<br>“statute of repose.” So the Court must proceed to examine&para;<br>other evidence of the meaning of the term “statute of&para;<br>limitations” as it is used in §9658. The parties debate the&para;<br>historical development of the terms “statute of limitations”&para;<br>and “statute of repose” in an effort to show how these&para;<br>terms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress&para;<br>enacted §9658. It is apparent that the distinction between&para;<br>statutes of limitations and statutes of repose was under­&para;<br>stood by some courts and scholars before 1986. The 1977&para;<br>Restatement of Torts noted that “[i]n recent years special&para;<br>‘statutes of repose’ have been adopted in some states . . . .&para;<br>The statutory period in these acts is usually longer than&para;<br>that for the regular statute of limitations, but . . . may&para;<br>have run before a cause of action came fully into exist­&para;<br>ence.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §899, Comment g.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>But that usage, now predominant, then was not the only&para;<br>definition of the two terms. One scholar, writing in 1981,&para;<br>described multiple usages of the terms, including both a&para;<br>usage in which the terms are equivalent and also the&para;<br>modern, more precise usage. McGovern, The Variety,&para;<br>Policy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes&para;<br>of Repose, 30 Am. U. L. Rev. 579, 584 (1981) (describing a&para;<br>statute of repose as “distinct from a statute of limitation&para;<br>because [a statute of repose] begins to run at a time unre­&para;<br>lated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action”).&para;<br>Respondents note that an entry in Black’s Law Diction­&para;<br>ary from 1979 describes a statute of limitations as follows:&para;<br>“Statutes of limitations are statutes of repose.” Black’s&para;<br>835 (5th ed.). That statement likely reflects an earlier,&para;<br>broader usage in which the term “statute of repose” re­&para;<br>ferred to all provisions delineating the time in which a&para;<br>plaintiff must bring suit. See, e.g., Pillow v. Roberts, 13&para;<br>How. 472, 477 (1852) (“Statutes of limitation . . . are stat­&para;<br>utes of repose, and should not be evaded by a forced con­&para;<br>struction”); Rosenberg v. North Bergen, 61 N. J. 190, 201,&para;<br>293 A. 2d 662, 667 (1972) (“All statutes limiting in any&para;<br>way the time within which a judicial remedy may be&para;<br>sought are statutes of repose”); Black’s 1077 (rev. 4th ed.&para;<br>1968) (defining “statute of limitations” as “[a] statute . . .&para;<br>declaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . unless&para;<br>brought within a specified period after the right accrued.&para;<br>Statutes of limitation are statutes of repose”); Ballentine’s&para;<br>Law Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar). That usage&para;<br>does not necessarily support respondents’ interpretation,&para;<br>because the broad usage of the term “statute of repose”&para;<br>does not mean that the term “statute of limitations” must&para;<br>refer to both types of statute.&para;<br>From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the&para;<br>legal terms has not always been precise, but the concept&para;<br>that statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are&para;<br>distinct was well enough established to be reflected in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1982 Study Group Report, commissioned by Congress. In&para;<br>one of its recommendations, the Study Group Report&para;<br>called on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied&para;<br>in §9658. Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256. The Report&para;<br>acknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent&para;<br>to statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to&para;<br>pre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former.&para;<br>For immediately it went on to state: “The Recommenda­&para;<br>tion is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of&para;<br>repose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect&para;<br>as some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff ’s&para;<br>claim before he knows that he has one.” Ibid. The schol­&para;<br>ars and professionals who were discussing this matter&para;<br>(and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear dis­&para;<br>tinction between the two.&para;<br>The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose&para;<br>as well as statutes of limitations. But in so doing the&para;<br>Report did what the statute does not: It referred to stat­&para;<br>utes of repose as a distinct category. And when Congress&para;<br>did not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude&para;<br>that Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre­&para;<br>emption power.&para;<br>While the use of the term “statute of limitations” in&para;<br>§9658 is not dispositive, the Court’s textual inquiry does&para;<br>not end there, for other features of the statutory text&para;<br>further support the exclusion of statutes of repose. The&para;<br>text of §9658 includes language describing the covered&para;<br>period in the singular. The statute uses the terms “the&para;<br>applicable limitations period,” “such period shall com­&para;<br>mence,” and “the statute of limitations established under&para;<br>State law.” This would be an awkward way to mandate&para;<br>the pre-emption of two different time periods with two&para;<br>different purposes.&para;<br>True, the Dictionary Act states that “words importing&para;<br>the singular include and apply to several persons, parties,&para;<br>or things” unless “the context indicates otherwise.” 1&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. C. §1. But the Court has relied on this directive&para;<br>when the rule is “ ‘necessary to carry out the evident intent&para;<br>of the statute.’ ” United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415,&para;<br>422, n. 5 (2009) (quoting First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v.&para;<br>Missouri, 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924)). As discussed, the&para;<br>context here shows an evident intent not to cover statutes&para;<br>of repose.&para;<br>Further, to return again to the definition of the “appli­&para;<br>cable limitations period,” the statute describes it as “the&para;<br>period” during which a “civil action” under state law “may&para;<br>be brought.” §9658(b)(2). It is true that in a literal sense&para;<br>a statute of repose limits the time during which a suit&para;<br>“may be brought” because it provides a point after which a&para;<br>suit cannot be brought. Ibid.; see C. J. S. §7, at 24 (“A&para;<br>statute of repose . . . limits the time within which an&para;<br>action may be brought”). But the definition of the “appli­&para;<br>cable limitations period” presupposes that “a [covered]&para;<br>civil action” exists. §9658(b)(2). Black’s Law Dictionary&para;<br>defines a “civil action” as identical to an “action at law,”&para;<br>which in relevant part is defined as a “civil suit stating a&para;<br>legal cause of action.” Black’s 32–33, 279 (9th ed. 2009);&para;<br>see also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).&para;<br>A statute of repose, however, as noted above, “is not&para;<br>related to the accrual of any cause of action.” C. J. S. §7,&para;<br>at 24. Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of&para;<br>action beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action&para;<br>has yet accrued. Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a&para;<br>cause of action from coming into existence. See, e.g., N. C.&para;<br>Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–52(16) (“[N]o cause of action shall&para;<br>accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of&para;<br>the defendant giving rise to the cause of action”); see also&para;<br>Hargett v.

E. 2d&para;<br>784, 787 (1994) (“A statute of repose creates an additional&para;<br>element of the claim itself which must be satisfied in order&para;<br>for the claim to be maintained . . . . If the action is not&para;<br>brought within the specified period, the plaintiff literally&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Wedgewood South Corp., 308 N. C. 419,&para;<br>440–441, 302 S. E. 2d 868, 880 (1983). A statute of repose&para;<br>can be said to define the scope of the cause of action, and&para;<br>therefore the liability of the defendant. See Hargett,&para;<br>supra, at 655–656, 447 S. E. 2d, at 788.&para;<br>In light of the distinct purpose for statutes of repose, the&para;<br>definition of “applicable limitations period” (and thus also&para;<br>the definition of “commencement date”) in §9658(b)(2) is&para;<br>best read to encompass only statutes of limitations, which&para;<br>generally begin to run after a cause of action accrues and&para;<br>so always limit the time in which a civil action “may be&para;<br>brought.” A statute of repose, however, may preclude an&para;<br>alleged tortfeasor’s liability before a plaintiff is entitled to&para;<br>sue, before an actionable harm ever occurs.&para;<br>Another and altogether unambiguous textual indication&para;<br>that §9658 does not pre-empt statutes of repose is that&para;<br>§9658 provides for equitable tolling for “minor or incompe­&para;<br>tent plaintiff[s].” §9658(b)(4)(B). As noted in the preced­&para;<br>ing discussion, a “critical distinction” between statutes of&para;<br>limitations and statutes of repose “is that a repose period&para;<br>is fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel&para;<br>or tolling.” 4 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure&para;<br>§1056, at 240. As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling&para;<br>rule in §9658 suggests that the statute’s reach is limited to&para;<br>statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been&para;<br>subject to tolling. It would be odd for Congress, if it did&para;<br>seek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just&para;<br>the commencement date of statutes of repose but also&para;<br>state law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose—all&para;<br>without an express indication that §9658 was intended to&para;<br>reach the latter.&para;<br>In addition to their argument that §9658 expressly pre­&para;<br>empts statutes of repose, respondents contend that §9658&para;<br>effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose&para;<br>“creat[e] an unacceptable ‘obstacle to the accomplishment&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v.

CERCLA, it&para;<br>must be remembered, does not provide a complete remedial framework. The statute does not provide a general&para;<br>cause of action for all harm caused by toxic contaminants.&para;<br>Section 9658 leaves untouched States’ judgments about&para;<br>causes of action, the scope of liability, the duration of the&para;<br>period provided by statutes of limitations, burdens of&para;<br>proof, rules of evidence, and other important rules govern­&para;<br>ing civil actions. “ ‘The case for federal pre-emption is&para;<br>particularly weak where Congress has indicated its&para;<br>awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal&para;<br>interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both&para;<br>concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] be­&para;<br>tween them.’ ” Wyeth, supra, at 574–575 (quoting Bonito&para;<br>Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166–167&para;<br>(1989)).

But as I see it, the later “federally required&para;<br>commencement date,” §9658(a)(1), (b)(4), displaces the&para;<br>earlier date state law prescribes.&para;<br>Section 9658(b)(3) defines “commencement date” as “the&para;<br>date specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning&para;<br>of the applicable limitations period.” Under North Carolina law, that date is determined by the occurrence of&para;<br>“the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to&para;<br>the [claim].” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 1–52(16). The definition key to this controversy, however, appears in&para;<br>§9658(b)(4)(A): “ ‘[F]ederally required commencement date’&para;<br>means the date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should&para;<br>have known) that [her] injury . . . [was] caused . . . by the&para;<br>hazardous substance . . . concerned.” Congress, in short,&para;<br>directed, in §9658(a)(1), that the federally prescribed&para;<br>discovery rule, set out in §9658(b)(4), shall apply “in lieu&para;<br>of ” the earlier “commencement date” (the defendant’s&para;<br>“last act or omission”) specified in N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§1–52(16).&para;<br>Why does the Court fight this straightforward reading?&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>At length, the Court’s opinion distinguishes statutes of&para;<br>limitations from statutes of repose. See ante, at 5–16. Yet&para;<br>North Carolina itself made its repose period a component&para;<br>of the statute prescribing periods for “the commencement&para;<br>of actions.” §§1–46, 1–52(16). What is a repose period, in&para;<br>essence, other than a limitations period unattended by a&para;<br>discovery rule? See Senate Committee on Environment&para;<br>and Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group,&para;<br>Injuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes—Analysis&para;<br>and Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.,&para;<br>(pt. 1) 255–256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study&para;<br>Group Report).&para;<br>The legislative history of §9658, moreover, shows why&para;<br>the distinction the Court draws between statutes of limitations and repose prescriptions cannot be what Congress&para;<br>ordered. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2–3, Congress&para;<br>amended CERCLA to include §9658 in response to the&para;<br>report of an expert Study Group commissioned when&para;<br>CERCLA was enacted. That report directed its proposals&para;<br>to the States rather than to Congress. It “recommend[ed]&para;<br>that the several states enhance and develop common law&para;<br>and statutory remedies, and that they remove unreasonable procedural and other barriers to recovery in court&para;<br>action for personal injuries resulting from exposure to&para;<br>hazardous waste.” Study Group Report 255. The report&para;<br>then made specific proposals. Under the heading “Statutes of Limitations,” the Study Group proposed (1) “that&para;<br>all [S]tates . . . clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause” and (2) that&para;<br>States repeal “statutes of repose which, in a number of&para;<br>[S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring plaintiff ’s claim before he knows he has&para;<br>one.” Id., at 255–256. Both measures are necessary, the&para;<br>report explained, because “many of the hazardous wastes&para;<br>are carcinogens” with “latency period[s] for the appearance&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of injury or disease . . . likely to [run] for thirty years or&para;<br>more.” Id., at 255.&para;<br>Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period&para;<br>at issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with latency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes&para;<br>of limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little&para;<br>use in States with repose prescriptions.&para;<br>Rather than await action by the States, Congress decided to implement the Study Group’s proposal itself by&para;<br>adopting §9658. Ante, at 3. The Conference Report relates the Study Group Report’s observation that “certain&para;<br>State statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court”&para;<br>because “[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as&para;<br>cancer,” a limitations period that begins to run before the&para;<br>plaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make&para;<br>timely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Conference Report then states that “[t]his section”—§9658—&para;<br>“addresses the problem identified in the [Study Group&para;<br>Report].” Ibid. As the Study Group Report makes clear,&para;<br>“the problem” it identified, to which the Conference Report&para;<br>adverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain&para;<br>operative. The Court’s interpretation thus thwarts Congress’ clearly expressed intent to fix “the problem” the&para;<br>Study Group described.&para;<br>In lieu of uniform application of the “federally required&para;<br>commencement date,” §9658(b)(4), the Court allows those&para;<br>responsible for environmental contamination, if they are&para;<br>located in the still small number of States with repose&para;<br>periods,* to escape liability for the devastating harm they&para;<br>cause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years.&para;<br>Instead of encouraging prompt identification and remedia——————&para;<br>* See Conn.
