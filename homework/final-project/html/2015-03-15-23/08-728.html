UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–728.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 6, 2009—Decided March 8, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) requires a criminal defendant’s trial&para;<br>to commence within 70 days of his indictment or initial appearance,&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §3161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if&para;<br>that deadline is not met, §3162(a)(2). As relevant here, the Act&para;<br>automatically excludes from the 70-day period “delay resulting from&para;<br>. . . proceedings concerning the defendant,” 18 U. S. C. A. §3161(h)(1)&para;<br>(hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court&para;<br>to exclude “delay resulting from a continuance” it grants, provided&para;<br>the court makes findings required by §3161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsec&para;<br>tion (h)(7)). Petitioner’s indictment on federal firearm and drug pos&para;<br>session charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006. After&para;<br>petitioner’s arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to&para;<br>file pretrial motions by September 13. On September 7, the court&para;<br>granted petitioner’s motion to extend that deadline, but on the new&para;<br>due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial&para;<br>motions. On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver vol&para;<br>untary and intelligent. Over the next three months, petitioner’s trial&para;<br>was delayed several times, often at petitioner’s instigation. On Feb&para;<br>ruary 19, 2007—179 days after he was indicted—he moved to dismiss&para;<br>the indictment, claiming that the Act’s 70-day limit had elapsed. In&para;<br>denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from Sep&para;<br>tember 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time. At&para;<br>trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to&para;<br>concurrent prison terms. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of&para;<br>the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7&para;<br>through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day&para;<br>limit under subsection (h)(1).&para;<br>Held: The time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1). Such time&para;<br>may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance&para;<br>based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7). Pp. 6–18.&para;<br>(a) The delay at issue is governed by subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinaf&para;<br>ter subparagraph (D)), the enumerated category that renders auto&para;<br>matically excludable “delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from&para;<br>the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or&para;<br>other prompt disposition of, such motion.” This provision communi&para;<br>cates Congress’ judgment that pretrial motion-related delay is auto&para;<br>matically excludable only from the time a pretrial motion is filed&para;<br>through a specified hearing or disposition point, and that other pre&para;<br>trial motion-related delay is excludable only if it results in a continu&para;<br>ance under subsection (h)(7). This limitation is significant because&para;<br>Congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection (h)(1)’s&para;<br>enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired. Although the pe&para;<br>riod of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results&para;<br>from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period pre&para;<br>cedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay&para;<br>may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically exclud&para;<br>able. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(b) This analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry be&para;<br>cause “[a] specific provision” (here, subparagraph (D)) “controls one[s]&para;<br>of more general application” (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).&para;<br>Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. A contrary result&para;<br>would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the pro&para;<br>priety of this Court’s approach. Subsection (h)(1)’s phrase “including&para;<br>but not limited to” does not show that subsection (h)(1) permits auto&para;<br>matic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of pro&para;<br>ceedings, but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph&para;<br>expressly addressed to that category. That would confuse the illus&para;<br>trative nature of the subsection’s list of categories with the contents&para;<br>of the categories themselves. Reading the “including but not limited&para;<br>to” clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as&para;<br>well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction&para;<br>principles by ignoring subsection (h)(1)’s structure and grammar and&para;<br>in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs inde&para;<br>terminate and virtually superfluous. See generally id., at 410. Sub&para;<br>section (h)(1)’s context supports this Court’s conclusion. Subsection&para;<br>(h)(7) provides that delay “resulting from a continuance granted by&para;<br>any judge” may be excluded, but only if the judge finds that “the ends&para;<br>of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of&para;<br>the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,” and records those&para;<br>findings. In setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection&para;<br>(h)(7) continuance, Congress twice recognized the importance of ade&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>quate pretrial preparation time.&para;<br>See §§3161(h)(7)(B)(ii),&para;<br>3161(h)(7)(B)(iv). The Court’s determination that the delay at issue&para;<br>is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7),&para;<br>and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only&para;<br>where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion. The&para;<br>Court’s precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1). See&para;<br>Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502. Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>(c) The Act does not force a district court to choose between reject&para;<br>ing a defendant’s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and&para;<br>risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the&para;<br>trial. A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection&para;<br>(h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded&para;<br>findings. Subsection (h)(7) provides “[m]uch of the Act’s flexibility,”&para;<br>Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts “discretion . . . to ac&para;<br>commodate limited delays for case-specific needs,” id., at 499. The&para;<br>Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the nec&para;<br>essary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a de&para;<br>fendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit. But dismissal&para;<br>need not represent a windfall. If the court dismisses the charges&para;<br>without prejudice, the Government may refile charges or reindict. In&para;<br>ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should&para;<br>consider, inter alia, the party responsible for the delay. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>(d) This Court does not consider whether any of the Act’s other ex&para;<br>clusions would apply to all or part of the September 7 through Octo&para;<br>ber 4 period that is not automatically excludable under subsection&para;<br>(h)(1).

The police arrested&para;<br>petitioner the next day.&para;<br>On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being&para;<br>a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional pos&para;<br>session with intent to distribute more than five grams of&para;<br>cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. §841(a)(1).

Instead, it renders&para;<br>automatically excludable only the delay that occurs “from&para;<br>the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the&para;<br>hearing on, or other prompt disposition of” the motion.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent argues that this conclusion lacks “force” because “[i]t is&para;<br>at least doubtful . . . that the delay at issue in the present case is delay&para;<br>‘resulting from [a] pretrial motion.’ ” Post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.).&para;<br>According to the dissent, “delay ‘resulting from’ a pretrial motion is&para;<br>delay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion,” which the “type of&para;<br>delay involved in the present case” does not.” Post, at 4–5 (arguing that&para;<br>the delay in this case instead “occurs as a consequence of the court’s&para;<br>granting of a defense request for an extension of time”).&para;<br>The dissent’s position, which rests upon a dictionary definition of two&para;<br>isolated words, does not account for the governing statutory context.&para;<br>For the reasons we explain, the text and structure of subsection (h)&para;<br>support our conclusion that subparagraph (D) governs the automatic&para;<br>excludability of delays “resulting from” proceedings involving pretrial&para;<br>motions. As the dissent concedes, defining “resulting from” to mean “as&para;<br>a consequence of” does not foreclose our interpretation. That is because&para;<br>the dissent’s definition of “resulting from” leaves ample room to con&para;<br>clude that the delay at issue here is “a consequence of” the category of&para;<br>proceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay&para;<br>“as a consequence of” a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or “as a&para;<br>consequence of” a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for addi&para;<br>tional time). At bottom, the dissent’s position is not that our interpre&para;<br>tation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent’s interpretation is&para;<br>preferable. We disagree because the dissent’s interpretation, among&para;<br>other things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsec&para;<br>tion (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

In so doing, the provision communi&para;<br>cates Congress’ judgment that delay resulting from pre&para;<br>trial motions is automatically excludable, i.e., excludable&para;<br>without district court findings, only from the time a mo&para;<br>tion is filed through the hearing or disposition point speci&para;<br>fied in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pre&para;<br>trial motion-related delay are excludable only when&para;<br>accompanied by district court findings.10&para;<br>This limitation is significant because Congress knew&para;<br>how to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion&para;<br>broadly when it so desired. Subsection (h)(1)(A) (hereinaf&para;<br>ter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the auto&para;<br>matic exclusion of “delay resulting from any proceeding,&para;<br>including any examinations, to determine the mental&para;<br>competency or physical capacity of the defendant.” (Em&para;<br>phasis added.) With the word “including,” Congress indi&para;<br>cated that other competency-related proceedings besides&para;<br>“examinations” might fall within subparagraph (A)’s&para;<br>automatic exclusion. In subparagraph (D), by contrast,&para;<br>Congress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term&para;<br>such as “including,” and provided instead that only pre&para;<br>trial motion-related delay “from the filing” of a motion to&para;<br>the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision&para;<br>is automatically excludable from the Act’s 70-day limit.&para;<br>Thus, although the period of delay the Government&para;<br>seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)’s text, but&para;<br>also from its structure. As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the&para;<br>70-day period “delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing&para;<br>of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt&para;<br>disposition of, such motion.” In this case, the comma after the first&para;<br>phrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of exclud&para;<br>able delay referred to in the first. Thus, subparagraph (D)’s automatic&para;<br>exclusion for delay “resulting from” a pretrial motion is limited to delay&para;<br>that occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identi&para;<br>fied in the provision.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v.

The result is that the&para;<br>pretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is&para;<br>not automatically excludable.11&para;<br>B&para;<br>The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into auto&para;<br>matic excludability because “[a] specific provision” (here,&para;<br>subparagraph (D)) “controls one[s] of more general appli&para;<br>cation” (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). Gozlon-Peretz&para;<br>v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991). In arguing&para;<br>that this principle applies, but requires a result different&para;<br>from the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government&para;<br>and several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in&para;<br>a manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.&para;<br>1&para;<br>There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more&para;<br>specific than the “general” language in subsection (h)(1),&para;<br>post, at 2, 6, or that “[g]eneral language of a statutory&para;<br>provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be&para;<br>held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another&para;<br>part of the same enactment,” D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons, Inc. v.&para;<br>Popkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932). We part company with&para;<br>the dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D)&para;<br>governs the period of delay at issue in this case. The&para;<br>dissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground&para;<br>that it is foreclosed by the statute.

This argument takes aim at an exagger&para;<br>ated target.

See infra, at&para;<br>17–18. And even if dismissal is ultimately required on&para;<br>remand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify read&para;<br>ing subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to&para;<br>“other proceedings concerning the defendant”) to permit&para;<br>automatic exclusion of delay resulting from virtually any&para;<br>decision to continue a deadline.&para;<br>The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is&para;<br>automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because&para;<br>the provision’s use of the phrase “including but not limited&para;<br>to” shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclu&para;<br>sion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated&para;<br>subparagraphs. See post, at 3; see also United States v.&para;<br>Oberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 450 (CA2 2008). This argument&para;<br>confuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)’s list of&para;<br>categories of excludable delay (each of which is repre&para;<br>sented by a subparagraph) with the contents of the catego&para;<br>ries themselves. That the list of categories is illustrative&para;<br>rather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclu&para;<br>sion that a delay that falls within the category of delay&para;<br>addressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits&para;<br>in that subparagraph. The “including but not limited to”&para;<br>clause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to&para;<br>modify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list&para;<br>itself.

Our reading avoids these&para;<br>problems by treating the list as illustrative, but construing&para;<br>each of the eight subparagraphs in (h)(1) to govern, con&para;<br>clusively unless the subparagraph itself indicates other&para;<br>wise, see, e.g., §3161(h)(1)(A); supra, at 9, the automatic&para;<br>excludability of the delay resulting from the category of&para;<br>proceedings it addresses.&para;<br>The dissent responds that, even if subparagraph (D)’s&para;<br>limits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative, we&para;<br>should automatically exclude the delay at issue here under&para;<br>subsection (h)(1)’s opening clause, see post, at 2, because it&para;<br>is not “clear” that the delay is governed by the more spe&para;<br>cific (and restrictive) language in subparagraph (D).

The dissent’s reading renders superflu&para;<br>ous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the&para;<br>exclusion of time necessary for “adequate preparation for pretrial&para;<br>proceedings,”&para;<br>§3161(h)(7)(B)(ii),&para;<br>and&para;<br>“effective&para;<br>preparation,”&para;<br>§3161(h)(7)(B)(iv).

The problem with this&para;<br>reading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection&para;<br>(h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the&para;<br>definition of a “proceeding concerning the defendant,” and&para;<br>thus threatens the Act’s manifest purpose of ensuring&para;<br>speedy trials by construing the Act’s automatic exclusion&para;<br>exceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day&para;<br>rule.

In setting forth the statutory factors that justify&para;<br>a continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice&para;<br>recognized the importance of adequate pretrial prepara&para;<br>tion time. See §3161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court&para;<br>to consider whether the “unusual” or “complex” nature of a&para;<br>case makes it “unreasonable to expect adequate prepara&para;<br>tion for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within&para;<br>the time limits” (emphasis added)); §3161(h)(7)(B)(iv)&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v.

This conclusion&para;<br>does not lay a “trap for trial judges” because it limits (in a&para;<br>way the statute requires) only automatic exclusions. In&para;<br>considering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of&para;<br>time will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to&para;<br>devote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay&para;<br>are justified, given both the statutory and constitutional&para;<br>requirement of speedy trials.

Neither are district courts forced to choose be&para;<br>tween rejecting a defendant’s request for time to prepare&para;<br>pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if&para;<br>preparation time delays the trial. Instead, a district court&para;<br>may exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it&para;<br>grants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded&para;<br>findings “that the ends of justice served by taking such&para;<br>action outweigh the best interest of the public and the&para;<br>defendant in a speedy trial.” Subsection (h)(7) provides&para;<br>“[m]uch of the Act’s flexibility,” Zedner, 547 U.

The statutory&para;<br>scheme thus ensures that district courts may grant neces&para;<br>sary pretrial motion preparation time without risking&para;<br>dismissal.&para;<br>Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a&para;<br>district court may fail to make the findings necessary for&para;<br>an exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall&para;<br>gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act’s&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v.

Eight Courts of Appeals have&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>held1—and I agree—that a delay resulting from the grant&para;<br>ing of a defense request for additional time to complete&para;<br>pretrial motions is a delay “resulting from [a] proceedin[g]&para;<br>concerning the defendant” and is thus automatically ex&para;<br>cluded under §3161(h)(1).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In considering the question presented here, I begin with&para;<br>the general language of §3161(h)(1), which, as noted,&para;<br>automatically excludes any “delay resulting from other&para;<br>proceedings concerning the defendant.” (For convenience,&para;<br>I will refer to this portion of the statute as “subsection&para;<br>(h)(1).”) The delay resulting from the granting of a de&para;<br>fense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial&para;<br>motions falls comfortably within the terms of subsection&para;<br>(h)(1).&para;<br>First, the granting of such a defense request qualifies as&para;<br>a “proceeding.” A court proceeding is defined as “[a]n act&para;<br>or step that is part of a larger action” and “an act done by&para;<br>the authority or direction of the court.” Black’s Law Dic&para;<br>tionary 1324 (9th ed. 2009) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted) (hereinafter Black’s Law). The granting of a&para;<br>defense request for an extension of time to prepare pre&para;<br>trial motions constitutes both “[a]n act or step that is part&para;<br>of [the] larger [criminal case]” and “an act done by the&para;<br>authority or direction of the court.” Second, delay caused&para;<br>by the granting of such an extension is obviously “delay&para;<br>resulting from” the successful extension request.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 United States v.

Subpara&para;<br>graph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that&para;<br>are specifically identified as “delay resulting from [a]&para;<br>proceedin[g] concerning the defendant,” but as noted, this&para;<br>list is preceded by the phrase “including but not limited&para;<br>to.” “When ‘include’ is utilized, it is generally improper to&para;<br>conclude that entities not specifically enumerated are&para;<br>excluded.” 2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Sutherland on Stat&para;<br>utes and Statutory Construction §47.23, p. 417 (7th ed.&para;<br>2007). See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.

S. 95, 100 (1941); Black’s&para;<br>Law 831 (“The participle including typically indicates a&para;<br>partial list”). And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the&para;<br>additional phrase “not limited to” reinforces this point.&para;<br>See United States v. Tibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7&para;<br>1985).&para;<br>Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase “including&para;<br>but not limited to,” the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to&para;<br>show that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the&para;<br>general rule set out in subsection (h)(1). The Court’s&para;<br>argument is that subparagraph (D) governs not just “delay&para;<br>resulting from any pretrial motion,” §3161(h)(1)(D), but&para;<br>also delay resulting from “proceedings involving pretrial&para;<br>motions,” ante, at 8, and n. 9 (emphasis added), and “all&para;<br>pretrial motion-related delay,” ante, at 8 (emphasis added).&para;<br>In the Court’s view, Congress has expressed a judgment&para;<br>that if a period of “pretrial motion-related delay” does not&para;<br>fall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it&para;<br>is “excludable only when accompanied by district court&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>findings.” Ante, at 9. Thus, since subparagraph (D) does&para;<br>not provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the&para;<br>granting of a defense request for more time to prepare&para;<br>pretrial motions, the Court holds that such delay is not&para;<br>excluded from the 70-day calculation. The Court’s analy&para;<br>sis, however, is not supported by either the text of sub&para;<br>paragraph (D) or the circumstances that gave rise to its&para;<br>enactment.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The Court’s argument would have some force if it were&para;<br>clear that the delay involved in the present case is “delay&para;<br>resulting from [a] pretrial motion.” §3161(h)(1)(D). It&para;<br>could then be argued that subparagraph (D) reflects a&para;<br>legislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion&para;<br>of delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay&para;<br>occurs during the period “from the filing of the motion&para;<br>through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt&para;<br>disposition of, such motion.” Ibid.2&para;<br>It is at least doubtful, however, that the delay at issue&para;<br>in the present case is delay “resulting from [a] pretrial&para;<br>motion.” Ibid.3 The phrase “resulting from” means “pro&para;<br>ceed[ing], spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect,&para;<br>or conclusion.” Webster’s Third New International Dic&para;<br>tionary 1937 (1971). Thus, delay “resulting from” a pre&para;<br>trial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court hints that the defense’s request for additional time might&para;<br>itself be a pretrial motion within the meaning of §3161(h)(1)(D).&para;<br>Neither party relies on this theory. The Court of Appeals found that&para;<br>“Bloate never filed a pretrial motion.” 534 F. 3d, at 897.&para;<br>3 This much is clear from the Court’s own language. The Court writes&para;<br>that “although the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in&para;<br>this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that&para;<br>period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such&para;<br>delay may be automatically excluded.” Ante, at 9–10 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Subparagraph (D) does not speak of delay that results from a “proceed&para;<br>ing,” ibid.; subsection (h)(1), however, does. See §3161(h)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>motion. The type of delay involved in the present case,&para;<br>however, does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial&para;<br>motion; rather, it occurs as a consequence of the court’s&para;<br>granting of a defense request for an extension of time.&para;<br>The particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this&para;<br>point because petitioner never filed pretrial motions.4&para;<br>It is telling that the Court elides the statutory phrase&para;<br>“resulting from” and substitutes a broader phrase of its&para;<br>own invention. The Court writes that “pretrial motion&para;<br>related delay” that is not captured by subparagraph (D)’s&para;<br>text is “excludable only when accompanied by district&para;<br>court findings.” Ante, at 9. See also ante, at 8 (“Subpara&para;<br>graph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay&para;<br>to automatic exclusion”); ante, at 9 (“[O]nly pretrial mo&para;<br>tion-related delay ‘from the filing’ of a motion to the hear&para;<br>ing or disposition point specified in the provision is auto&para;<br>matically excludable”); ante, at 15, n. 14 (“pretrial motion&para;<br>related delay”); ibid. (“pretrial motion-related proceed&para;<br>ings”). But “pretrial motion-related delay” is not necessar&para;<br>ily delay “resulting from” a pretrial motion.&para;<br>Even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase “re&para;<br>sulting from” to mean “related [to],” see ante, at 9, there&para;<br>are at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading.&para;<br>First, because subparagraphs (A)–(H) are meant to be&para;<br>illustrative, those provisions should not be interpreted as&para;<br>limiting unless the limitation is very clear. Second, the&para;<br>Court’s interpretation of subparagraph (D) leads to an&para;<br>anomalous result that Congress is unlikely to have in&para;<br>tended. Because subparagraph (D) automatically excludes&para;<br>“delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing&para;<br>of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or&para;<br>other prompt disposition of, such motion,” it is clear that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 But even if petitioner had filed pretrial motions, the delay resulting&para;<br>from the granting of the extension still would not be delay “resulting&para;<br>from” the motion.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>subparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting&para;<br>from the granting of a prosecution request for additional&para;<br>time to respond to a defendant’s pretrial motions. The&para;<br>Court has not identified any reason why Congress might&para;<br>have wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay&para;<br>resulting from the granting of a prosecution request for&para;<br>additional time to respond to a defendant’s pretrial mo&para;<br>tions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the&para;<br>defendant’s request for additional time to prepare those&para;<br>very motions. Since there is nothing to suggest that Con&para;<br>gress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the&para;<br>Court’s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should&para;<br>be rejected. Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply&para;<br>only to delay “resulting from [a] pretrial motion,” and&para;<br>because the delay involved here does not result from a&para;<br>pretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that sub&para;<br>paragraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the&para;<br>scope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).&para;<br>E&para;<br>The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the&para;<br>current version of subparagraph (D) in 1979 point to the&para;<br>same conclusion. That language was adopted to expand&para;<br>the reach of the exclusion. As originally enacted, the&para;<br>relevant provision of the Act excluded only “delay result&para;<br>ing from hearings on pretrial motions,” 88 Stat. 2078, and&para;<br>courts had interpreted this language literally to exclude&para;<br>only time actually devoted to hearings. See, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Lewis, 425 F. Supp. 1166, 1171 (Conn. 1977);&para;<br>United States v. Conroy, No. 77 Cr. 607 (CHT), 1978 U. S.&para;<br>Dist.

The House Judiciary Committee stated&para;<br>that the language on which the Court now relies was&para;<br>added “to avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation of the&para;<br>exclusion as extending only to the actual time consumed in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

S. Rep. No. 96–&para;<br>212, p. 18 (1979) (hereinafter S. Rep.). See also id., at 26.&para;<br>Congress’ expansion of the exclusion set out in subpara&para;<br>graph (D) so that it covers, not just the time taken up by&para;<br>hearings on pretrial motions, but all delay resulting from&para;<br>pretrial motions does not support the inference that Con&para;<br>gress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to&para;<br>count against the Speedy Trial Act’s 70-day period.&para;<br>Contending that Congress could have been more explicit&para;<br>if it “wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation&para;<br>time automatically,” the Court cites as an example a&para;<br>legislative proposal by the Department of Justice to pro&para;<br>vide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pre&para;<br>trial motions. Ante, at 14, n. 13. The Court is correct that&para;<br>Congress did not choose this option, but the Court’s argu&para;<br>ment misses the point.&para;<br>First, it bears emphasizing that the Justice Depart&para;<br>ment’s proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a&para;<br>successful defense request for additional time to prepare&para;<br>pretrial motions. That is the delay in dispute here. In&para;<br>stead, the Justice Department’s proposal excluded all&para;<br>“delay resulting from the preparation and service of pre&para;<br>trial motions and responses from hearings thereon.” S.&para;<br>961, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., §5 (1979) (as introduced).&para;<br>Second, the reasons given in the Senate Judiciary Com&para;<br>mittee report for rejecting the Justice Department pro&para;<br>posal do not apply when the delay results from the grant&para;<br>ing of a defense request such as the one at issue here. The&para;<br>Senate Committee report noted that, when excluding time&para;<br>for the preparation of pretrial motions, it will be “quite&para;<br>difficult to determine a point at which preparation actu&para;<br>ally begins.” S. Rep., at 34. But when a district court&para;<br>grants a defendant’s motion for time to prepare pretrial&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>motions, that concern is not present. See United States v.&para;<br>Oberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 451 (CA2 2008) (noting the impor&para;<br>tance of the District Court’s expressly stopping the speedy&para;<br>trial clock to create a point from which to measure prepa&para;<br>ration time).5 In addition, the Committee expressed the&para;<br>view that “in routine cases, preparation time should not be&para;<br>excluded.” S. Rep., at 34. However, cases in which a&para;<br>district court accedes to a defense request for more than&para;<br>the usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial&para;<br>motions are by definition not routine.&para;<br>Third, there is no reason why Congress should have&para;<br>supposed that the language that Congress and the Presi&para;<br>dent enacted did not reach delay resulting from the grant&para;<br>ing of the defendant’s request for additional time to pre&para;<br>pare pretrial motions. As explained above, supra, at 2, 4–&para;<br>6, such delay results from a proceeding concerning&para;<br>the defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial&para;<br>motion.&para;<br>In sum, (1) delay resulting from the granting of a de&para;<br>fense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial mo&para;<br>tions falls within the general rule, set out in subsection&para;<br>(h)(1), that automatically excludes delay “resulting from&para;<br>[a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant;” (2) the sub&para;<br>paragraphs that follow, which are preceded by the phrase&para;<br>“including but not limited to,” are illustrative, not exhaus&para;<br>tive; and (3) neither the text of subparagraph (D) nor the&para;<br>circumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The Court incorrectly states that the Courts of Appeals that have&para;<br>read subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time for pretrial motions&para;<br>have found it necessary to “impos[e] extratextual limitations on exclud&para;<br>ability,” namely, that the trial judge must expressly grant an extension&para;<br>of the time for the completion of pretrial motions. See ante, at 16. This&para;<br>requirement, however, springs from the language of subsection (h)(1),&para;<br>for it is the granting of the extension request that constitutes the&para;<br>“proceedin[g] concerning the defendant” that triggers the exclusion&para;<br>under subsection (h)(1). See supra, at 2.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>intent to narrow the scope of the general rule set out in&para;<br>subsection (h)(1). For these reasons, I would hold that the&para;<br>delay in question here is automatically excluded.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court advances several additional arguments in&para;<br>support of its analysis, but none is persuasive.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Two of these arguments hinge on the Court’s unjustifia&para;<br>bly broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), i.e., that it&para;<br>covers all “pretrial motion-related delay.” First, the Court&para;<br>reasons that under a contrary interpretation, “a court&para;<br>could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that&para;<br>the incursion on the Act’s timeliness guarantee is justified,&para;<br>the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the&para;<br>Act sets a default limit of 70 days.” Ante, at 13. But the&para;<br>same is true of the Court’s interpretation. Even under an&para;<br>interpretation that automatically excludes delay “only&para;<br>from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or&para;<br>disposition point,” ante, at 9, there appears to be no reason&para;<br>why a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the&para;<br>automatically excludable period of time under subpara&para;<br>graph (D) through any number of means, including: (1)&para;<br>extending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see&para;<br>United States v.

Here, there is no conflict be&para;<br>cause, even if subparagraph (D) governs “delay resulting&para;<br>from any pretrial motion,” there is no basis for concluding&para;<br>that subparagraph (D) governs all “pretrial motion-related&para;<br>delay.”&para;<br>B&para;<br>Contrary to the Court’s claim, its decision is not sup&para;<br>ported by §3161(h)(7)(A), which excludes “delay resulting&para;<br>from a continuance” provided that the trial court “sets&para;<br>forth, in the record of the case, . . . its reasons for finding&para;<br>that the ends of justice served by the granting of such&para;<br>continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and&para;<br>the defendant in a speedy trial.” One might argue that a&para;<br>trial judge grants a “continuance” whenever the judge&para;<br>postpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 That the delay in Henderson was delay “resulting from [a] pretrial&para;<br>motion,” §3161(h)(1)(D); see 476 U. S., at 322, 330–331, distinguishes&para;<br>that case from the scenario here, where no pretrial motion has been&para;<br>filed and the delay in question “results from a proceeding” that, in the&para;<br>Court’s view, is “governed by subparagraph (D).” Ante, at 9–10.

See §3161(h)(7)(A) (“[a]ny&para;<br>period of delay resulting from a continuance”). But such a&para;<br>reading would render subsection (h)(1) and subparagraphs&para;<br>(A)–(H) meaningless if it were true that all continuances&para;<br>required ends-of-justice findings. The plain terms of&para;<br>subsection (h)(1) refute this interpretation and show that&para;<br>Congress intended for some periods of delay that postpone&para;<br>the trial date to be automatically excludable.&para;<br>Viewed in their proper context, subsection (h)(1) and its&para;<br>subparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of&para;<br>§3161(h)(7)(A) requiring ends-of-justice findings for con&para;<br>tinuances. See, e.g., United States v. Aviles-Alvarez, 868&para;<br>F. 2d 1108, 1112 (CA9 1989) (noting that when pretrial&para;<br>motion delay is automatically excluded, the District Court&para;<br>“does not have to make findings or consider any factors”).&para;<br>A period of delay resulting from a continuance requires&para;<br>ends-of-justice findings only when it does not also fall&para;<br>within the subset of automatically excludable delay de&para;<br>fined by subsection (h)(1). When a period of delay result&para;<br>ing from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclu&para;<br>sion, a court ordinarily should give effect to the more&para;<br>specific provisions of subsection (h)(1). See Gozlon-Peretz&para;<br>v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (“A specific&para;<br>provision controls over one of more general application”).&para;<br>Cf. ante, at 10.&para;<br>For the reasons discussed, see supra, at 2, the granting&para;<br>of a defense request for an extension of time to complete&para;<br>pretrial motions is a “proceedin[g] concerning the defen&para;<br>dant” within the meaning of subsection (h)(1). It may also&para;<br>qualify as a “continuance” within the meaning of&para;<br>§3161(h)(7)(A) if the delay has the effect of pushing back&para;<br>the trial date. But a court should resolve the conflict by&para;<br>applying the more specific provision of subsection (h)(1).&para;<br>This result is faithful not only to the plain language of the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BLOATE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>statute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of&para;<br>exceptions to the general rule that continuances require&para;<br>ends-of-justice findings. And it also recognizes that when&para;<br>defense counsel argues that adequate pretrial motions&para;<br>cannot be completed within the time allotted and is&para;<br>granted an extension, it will generally go without saying&para;<br>that the judge has considered whether the ends of justice&para;<br>will be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to&para;<br>recite this determination on the record will often be an&para;<br>empty exercise.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court does not believe that its interpretation will&para;<br>have serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by&para;<br>making the on-the-record findings required under&para;<br>§3161(h)(7), may exclude delay resulting from the grant&para;<br>ing of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial&para;<br>motions. As this case illustrates, however, there will be&para;<br>cases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges&para;<br>will fail to make those findings, and indictments will be&para;<br>dismissed for no good reason. If requiring findings on the&para;<br>record were cost- and risk-free, Congress would not have&para;<br>provided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category&para;<br>of delay encompassed by §3161(h)(1).&para;<br>The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation&para;<br>occurs because of delay caused by an extension requested&para;<br>by the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment&para;<br>without prejudice. But as we have recognized, even when&para;<br>a new indictment may be obtained, “substantial delay may&para;<br>well make reprosecution . . . unlikely.” United States v.&para;<br>Taylor, 487 U. S. 326, 342 (1988). Dismissal without&para;<br>prejudice is “not a toothless sanction,” ibid., and it is&para;<br>particularly inappropriate when brought about by a crimi&para;<br>nal defendant’s own delay.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.
