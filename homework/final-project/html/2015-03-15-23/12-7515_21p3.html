UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–7515. Argued November 12, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014&para;<br>Long-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that included using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage. Burrage&para;<br>pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia,&para;<br>that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that “death . . . resulted from the use of th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to a&para;<br>20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhancement provision of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.&para;<br>§841(b)(1)(C). After medical experts testified at trial that Banka&para;<br>might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved&para;<br>for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka’s death could only&para;<br>“result from” heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a butfor cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant&para;<br>here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that&para;<br>heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Burrage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. In affirming, the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit upheld the District Court’s jury instruction.&para;<br>Held: At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not&para;<br>an independently sufficient cause of the victim’s death or serious bodily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement under §841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or injury. Pp. 4–15.&para;<br>(a) Section 841(b)(1)(C)’s “death results” enhancement, which increased the minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was&para;<br>exposed, is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) Because the Controlled Substances Act does not define “results&para;<br>from,” the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. See Asgrow&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. Ordinarily, that phrase&para;<br>imposes a requirement of actual causality, i.e., proof “ ‘that the harm&para;<br>would not have occurred’ in the absence of—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.” University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center&para;<br>v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___. Similar statutory phrases—“because&para;<br>of,” see id., at ___, “ ‘based on,’ ” Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,&para;<br>551 U. S. 47, 63, and “ ‘by reason of,’ ” Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176—have been read to impose a but-for&para;<br>causation requirement. This Court declines to adopt the Government’s permissive interpretation of “results from” to mean that use of&para;<br>a drug distributed by the defendant need only contribute to an aggregate force, e.g., mixed-drug intoxication, that is itself a but-for cause&para;<br>of death. There is no need to address a special rule developed for&para;<br>cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concurrently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Banka’s heroin use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. And&para;<br>though Congress could have written §841(b)(1)(C) to make an act or&para;<br>omission a cause-in-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in producing death, Congress chose instead to use language that&para;<br>imports but-for causality. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(c) Whether adopting the but-for causation requirement or the&para;<br>Government’s interpretation raises policy concerns is beside the&para;<br>point, for the Court’s role is to apply the statute as written.

Banka immediately cooked and in­&para;<br>jected some of the heroin and, after returning home, in­&para;<br>jected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April&para;<br>15. Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after&para;<br>witnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin. When&para;<br>Noragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead&para;<br>in the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple’s&para;<br>home and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin,&para;<br>alprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a&para;<br>bottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.&para;<br>Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment&para;<br>alleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of&para;<br>§841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at&para;<br>issue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of&para;<br>heroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2&para;<br>alleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on&para;<br>April 14, 2010, and that “death . . . resulted from the use&para;<br>of th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to the 20­&para;<br>year mandatory minimum of §841(b)(1)(C).&para;<br>Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the&para;<br>cause of Banka’s death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic&para;<br>toxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present&para;<br>in Banka’s system at the time of his death, including&para;<br>heroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metabolites, and oxycodone. (A metabolite is a “product of&para;<br>metabolism,” Webster’s New International Dictionary&para;<br>1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it,&para;<br>“what a drug breaks down into in the body,” 687 F. 3d&para;<br>1015, 1018, n. 2 (CA8 2012).) Although morphine, a heroin&para;<br>metabolite, was the only drug present at a level above&para;<br>the therapeutic range—i.e., the concentration normally&para;<br>present when a person takes a drug as prescribed—Dr.&para;<br>Schwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived&para;<br>had he not taken the heroin. Dr. Schwilke nonetheless&para;<br>concluded that heroin “was a contributing factor” in&para;<br>Banka’s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cause “respiratory and/or central nervous system depres­&para;<br>sion.” App. 196. The heroin, in other words, contributed&para;<br>to an overall effect that caused Banka to stop breathing.&para;<br>Dr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner,&para;<br>came to similar conclusions. She described the cause of&para;<br>death as “mixed drug intoxication” with heroin, oxycodone,&para;<br>alprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a “contributing”&para;<br>role. Id., at 157. Dr. McLemore could not say whether&para;<br>Banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but&para;<br>observed that Banka’s death would have been “[v]ery less&para;<br>likely.” Id., at 171.&para;<br>The District Court denied Burrage’s motion for a judg­&para;<br>ment of acquittal, which argued that Banka’s death did&para;<br>not “result from” heroin use because there was no evidence&para;<br>that heroin was a but-for cause of death. Id., at 30. The&para;<br>court also declined to give Burrage’s proposed jury instruc­&para;<br>tions regarding causation. One of those instructions&para;<br>would have required the Government to prove that heroin&para;<br>use “was the proximate cause of [Banka’s] death.” Id., at&para;<br>236. Another would have defined proximate cause as&para;<br>“a cause of death that played a substantial part in bring­&para;<br>ing about the death,” meaning that “[t]he death must&para;<br>have been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable&para;<br>consequence of the cause and except for the cause the&para;<br>death would not have occurred.” Id., at 238. The court&para;<br>instead gave an instruction requiring the Government to&para;<br>prove “that the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a&para;<br>contributing cause of Joshua Banka’s death.” Id., at 241–&para;<br>242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the&para;<br>court sentenced him to 20 years’ imprisonment, consistent&para;<br>with §841(b)(1)(C)’s prescribed minimum.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed&para;<br>Burrage’s convictions. 687 F. 3d 1015. As to the causation­&para;<br>in-fact element of count 2, the court held that the&para;<br>District Court’s contributing-cause instruction was con­&para;<br>sistent with its earlier decision in United States v. Mon-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nier, 412 F. 3d 859, 862 (CA8 2005). See 687 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1021. As to proximate cause, the court held that Burrage’s&para;<br>proposed instructions “d[id] not correctly state the law”&para;<br>because “a showing of ‘proximate cause’ is not required.”&para;<br>Id., at 1020 (quoting United States v. McIntosh, 236 F. 3d&para;<br>968, 972–973 (CA8 2001)).&para;<br>We granted certiorari on two questions: Whether the&para;<br>defendant may be convicted under the “death results” pro­&para;<br>vision (1) when the use of the controlled substance was a&para;<br>“contributing cause” of the death, and (2) without sepa­&para;<br>rately instructing the jury that it must decide whether the&para;<br>victim’s death by drug overdose was a foreseeable result of&para;<br>the defendant’s drug-trafficking offense. 569 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2013).&para;<br>II&para;<br>As originally enacted, the Controlled Substances Act, 84&para;<br>Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq., “tied the penalties for&para;<br>drug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity&para;<br>involved, with no provision for mandatory minimum sen­&para;<br>tences.” DePierre v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 3–4). That changed in 1986 when&para;<br>Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 100 Stat.&para;<br>3207, which redefined the offense categories, increased the&para;<br>maximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many&para;<br>offenders, including the “death results” enhancement at&para;<br>issue here. See id., at 3207–4. With respect to violations&para;<br>involving distribution of a Schedule I or II substance (the&para;<br>types of drugs defined as the most dangerous and addic­&para;<br>tive1) the Act imposes sentences ranging from 10 years to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have “a high potential for abuse,”&para;<br>“no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United&para;<br>States,” and “a lack of accepted safety” even “under medical supervision.”&para;<br>§812(b)(1). Schedule II drugs, such as methamphetamine, likewise&para;<br>have “a high potential for abuse” and a propensity to cause “severe&para;<br>psychological or physical dependence” if misused. 21 U. S. C. §812(b)(2).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>life imprisonment for large-scale distributions, §841(b)&para;<br>(1)(A), from 5 to 40 years for medium-scale distribu­&para;<br>tions, §841(b)(1)(B), and not more than 20 years for&para;<br>smaller distributions, §841(b)(1)(C), the type of offense at&para;<br>issue here. These default sentencing rules do not apply,&para;<br>however, when “death or serious bodily injury results from&para;<br>the use of [the distributed] substance.” §841(b)(1)(A)–(C).&para;<br>In those instances, the defendant “shall be sentenced to a&para;<br>term of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than&para;<br>twenty years or more than life,” a substantial fine, “or&para;<br>both.”2 Ibid.&para;<br>Because the “death results” enhancement increased the&para;<br>minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was&para;<br>exposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the&para;<br>jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See Alleyne v.&para;<br>United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14–15);&para;<br>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Thus,&para;<br>the crime charged in count 2 of Burrage’s superseding&para;<br>indictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or&para;<br>intentional distribution of heroin, §841(a)(1),3 and (ii)&para;<br>death caused by (“resulting from”) the use of that drug,&para;<br>§841(b)(1)(C).&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Although this language, read literally, suggests that courts may&para;<br>impose a fine or a prison term, it is undisputed here that the “death&para;<br>results” provision mandates a prison sentence. Courts of Appeals have&para;<br>concluded, in effect, that the “or” is a scrivener’s error, see, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Musser, 856 F. 2d 1484, 1486 (CA11 1988) (per curiam). The&para;<br>best evidence of that is the concluding sentence of §841(b)(1)(C), which&para;<br>states that a court “shall not place on probation or suspend the sen­&para;<br>tence of any person sentenced under the provisions of this subpara­&para;<br>graph which provide for a mandatory term of imprisonment if death or&para;<br>serious bodily injury results.” (Emphasis added.)&para;<br>3 Violation of §841(a)(1) is thus a lesser included offense of the crime&para;<br>charged in count 2. It is undisputed that Burrage is guilty of that&para;<br>lesser included offense.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,&para;<br>consisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal&para;<br>cause. H. Hart &amp; A. Honoré, Causation in the Law 104&para;<br>(1959). When a crime requires “not merely conduct but&para;<br>also a specified result of conduct,” a defendant generally&para;<br>may not be convicted unless his conduct is “both (1) the&para;<br>actual cause, and (2) the ‘legal’ cause (often called the&para;<br>‘proximate cause’) of the result.” 1 W. LaFave, Substan­&para;<br>tive Criminal Law §6.4(a), pp. 464–466 (2d ed. 2003) (here­&para;<br>inafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code §2.03,&para;<br>p. 25 (1985). Those two categories roughly coincide with&para;<br>the two questions on which we granted certiorari. We find&para;<br>it necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of&para;<br>heroin was the actual cause of Banka’s death in the sense&para;<br>that §841(b)(1)(C) requires.&para;<br>The Controlled Substances Act does not define the&para;<br>phrase “results from,” so we give it its ordinary meaning.&para;<br>See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187&para;<br>(1995). A thing “results” when it “[a]rise[s] as an effect,&para;<br>issue, or outcome from some action, process or design.”&para;<br>2 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993).&para;<br>“Results from” imposes, in other words, a requirement of&para;<br>actual causality. “In the usual course,” this requires proof&para;<br>“ ‘that the harm would not have occurred’ in the absence&para;<br>of—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.” University&para;<br>of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting Restatement of&para;<br>Torts §431, Comment a (1934)). The Model Penal Code&para;<br>reflects this traditional understanding; it states that&para;<br>“[c]onduct is the cause of a result” if “it is an antecedent&para;<br>but for which the result in question would not have oc­&para;<br>curred.” §2.03(1)(a). That formulation represents “the&para;<br>minimum requirement for a finding of causation when a&para;<br>crime is defined in terms of conduct causing a particular&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>result.” Id., Explanatory Note (emphasis added); see also&para;<br>United States v. Hatfield, 591 F. 3d 945, 948 (CA7 2010)&para;<br>(but for “is the minimum concept of cause”); Callahan v.&para;<br>Cardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862 (Mo.&para;<br>1993) (same).&para;<br>Thus, “where A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say&para;<br>that A [actually] caused B’s death, since but for A’s con­&para;<br>duct B would not have died.” LaFave 467–468 (italics&para;<br>omitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act&para;<br>combines with other factors to produce the result, so long&para;<br>as the other factors alone would not have done so—if, so to&para;<br>speak, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Thus,&para;<br>if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple&para;<br>diseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those&para;<br>diseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without&para;<br>the incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.&para;<br>See, e.g., State v. Frazier, 339 Mo. 966, 974–975, 98 S. W.&para;<br>2d 707, 712–713 (1936).&para;<br>This but-for requirement is part of the common under­&para;<br>standing of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the&para;<br>visiting team’s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of&para;<br>the first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a&para;<br>score of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English&para;<br>language and familiar with the American pastime would&para;<br>agree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is&para;<br>so because it is natural to say that one event is the out­&para;<br>come or consequence of another when the former would&para;<br>not have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point&para;<br>that the victory also resulted from a host of other neces­&para;<br>sary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach’s decision&para;<br>to put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league’s&para;<br>decision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little&para;<br>sense to say that an event resulted from or was the out­&para;<br>come of some earlier action if the action merely played a&para;<br>nonessential contributing role in producing the event. If&para;<br>the visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page&para;<br>that the victory resulted from the leadoff batter’s early,&para;<br>non-dispositive home run.&para;<br>Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the&para;<br>contrary, courts regularly read phrases like “results from”&para;<br>to require but-for causality. Our interpretation of statutes&para;<br>that prohibit adverse employment action “because of ” an&para;<br>employee’s age or complaints about unlawful workplace&para;<br>discrimination is instructive. Last Term, we addressed&para;<br>Title VII’s antiretaliation provision, which states in part:&para;<br>“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an&para;<br>employer . . . to discriminate against any individual&para;<br>. . . because he has opposed any practice made an un­&para;<br>lawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or&para;<br>participated in any manner in an investigation,&para;<br>proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000e–3(a) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Given the ordinary meaning of the word “because,” we&para;<br>held that §2000e–3(a) “require[s] proof that the desire to&para;<br>retaliate was [a] but-for cause of the challenged employ­&para;<br>ment action.” Nassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).&para;<br>The same result obtained in an earlier case interpreting a&para;<br>provision in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act&para;<br>that makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to discharge&para;<br>any individual or otherwise discriminate against any&para;<br>individual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi­&para;<br>tions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi­&para;<br>vidual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Relying on dictionary definitions of “[t]he words ‘because&para;<br>of ’ ”—which resemble the definition of “results from”&para;<br>recited above—we held that “[t]o establish a disparate­&para;<br>treatment claim under the plain language of [§623(a)(1)]&para;<br>. . . a plaintiff must prove that age was [a] ‘but for’ cause of&para;<br>the employer’s adverse decision.” Gross v.

S. 167, 176 (2009).4&para;<br>Our insistence on but-for causality has not been re­&para;<br>stricted to statutes using the term “because of.” We have,&para;<br>for instance, observed that “[i]n common talk, the phrase&para;<br>‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship,” Safeco&para;<br>Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63 (2007), and&para;<br>that “the phrase, ‘by reason of,’ requires at least a showing&para;<br>of ‘but for’ causation,” Gross, supra, at 176 (citing Bridge&para;<br>v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 653–654&para;<br>(2008)). See also Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection&para;<br>Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 265–268 (1992) (explaining&para;<br>that a statute permitting recovery for injuries suffered&para;<br>“ ‘by reason of ’ ” the defendant’s unlawful conduct “re­&para;<br>quire[s] a showing that the defendant’s violation . . . was,”&para;<br>among other things, “a ‘but for’ cause of his injury”). State&para;<br>courts, which hear and decide the bulk of the Nation’s&para;<br>criminal matters, usually interpret similarly worded criminal statutes in the same manner. See, e.g., People v.&para;<br>Wood, 276 Mich. App. 669, 671, 741 N. W. 2d 574, 575–578&para;<br>(2007) (construing the phrase “[i]f the violation results in&para;<br>the death of another individual” to require proof of but-for&para;<br>causation (emphasis deleted)); State v.

See University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2013) (slip op., at 7–10). Congress later amended the statute to&para;<br>dispense with but-for causality.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>323, 245 S. E. 2d 754, 763 (1978) (statute requiring sup­&para;<br>pression of evidence “ ‘obtained as a result of ’ ” police&para;<br>misconduct “requires, at a minimum,” a but-for causal&para;<br>relationship between the misconduct and collection of the&para;<br>evidence).&para;<br>In sum, it is one of the traditional background principles&para;<br>“against which Congress legislate[s],” Nassar, 570 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 6–7), that a phrase such as “results from”&para;<br>imposes a requirement of but-for causation. The Govern­&para;<br>ment argues, however, that distinctive problems associated&para;<br>with drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with&para;<br>the usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often&para;<br>take drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and&para;<br>according to the National Center for Injury Prevention&para;<br>and Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010&para;<br>involved more than one drug. See Brief for United States&para;<br>28–29. This consideration leads the Government to urge&para;<br>an interpretation of “results from” under which use of a&para;<br>drug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for&para;<br>cause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause&para;<br>death, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such&para;<br>as mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of&para;<br>death.&para;<br>In support of its argument, the Government can point to&para;<br>the undoubted reality that courts have not always re­&para;<br>quired strict but-for causality, even where criminal liabil­&para;<br>ity is at issue. The most common (though still rare) in­&para;<br>stance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes&para;<br>independently, but concurrently, produce a result. See&para;<br>Nassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467&para;<br>(describing these cases as “unusual” and “numerically in&para;<br>the minority”). To illustrate, if “A stabs B, inflicting a&para;<br>fatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting inde­&para;<br>pendently, shoots B in the head . . . also inflicting [a fatal]&para;<br>wound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two&para;<br>wounds,” A will generally be liable for homicide even&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>though his conduct was not a but-for cause of B’s death&para;<br>(since B would have died from X’s actions in any event).&para;<br>Id., at 468 (italics omitted). We need not accept or reject&para;<br>the special rule developed for these cases, since there was&para;<br>no evidence here that Banka’s heroin use was an inde­&para;<br>pendently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was&para;<br>prepared to say that Banka would have died from the&para;<br>heroin use alone.&para;<br>Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less&para;<br>demanding (but also less well established) line of author­&para;<br>ity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause­&para;<br>in-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in&para;<br>producing a given result. Several state courts have adopted&para;<br>such a rule, see State v. Christman, 160 Wash. App.&para;<br>741, 745, 249 P. 3d 680, 687 (2011); People v. Jennings, 50&para;<br>Cal. 4th 616, 643, 237 P. 3d 474, 496 (2010); People v.&para;<br>Bailey, 451 Mich. 657, 676–678, 549 N. W. 2d 325, 334–&para;<br>336 (1996); Commonwealth v. Osachuk, 43 Mass. App. 71,&para;<br>72–73, 681 N. E. 2d 292, 294 (1997), but the American&para;<br>Law Institute declined to do so in its Model Penal Code,&para;<br>see ALI, 39th Annual Meeting Proceedings 135–141&para;<br>(1962); see also Model Penal Code §2.03(1)(a). One promi­&para;<br>nent authority on tort law asserts that “a broader rule . . .&para;<br>has found general acceptance: The defendant’s conduct is&para;<br>a cause of the event if it was a material element and a&para;<br>substantial factor in bringing it about.” W. Keeton, D.&para;<br>Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law&para;<br>of Torts §41, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). But&para;<br>the authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the&para;<br>tort context, “[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated” (an&para;<br>apparent reference to the situation where each of two&para;<br>causes is independently effective) “no case has been found&para;<br>where the defendant’s act could be called a substantial&para;<br>factor when the event would have occurred without it.”&para;<br>Id., at 268. The authors go on to offer an alternative&para;<br>rule—functionally identical to the one the Government&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>argues here—that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more&para;<br>actors is so related to an event that their combined con­&para;<br>duct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,&para;<br>and application of the but-for rule to them individually&para;<br>would absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in&para;<br>fact of the event.” Ibid. Yet, as of 1984, “no judicial opin­&para;<br>ion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.” Ibid., n. 40. The&para;<br>“death results” enhancement became law just two years&para;<br>later.&para;<br>We decline to adopt the Government’s permissive inter­&para;<br>pretation of §841(b)(1). The language Congress enacted&para;<br>requires death to “result from” use of the unlawfully dis­&para;<br>tributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which&para;<br>drug use merely contributed. Congress could have written&para;<br>§841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the&para;<br>underlying crime “contributes to” death or serious bodily&para;<br>injury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to&para;<br>cases involving concurrent causes, as five States have&para;<br>done, see Ala. Code §13A–2–5(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann.&para;<br>§5–2–205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §33&para;<br>(2006); N. D. Cent. Code Ann. §12.1–02–05 (Lexis 2012);&para;<br>Tex. Penal Code Ann. §6.04 (West 2011). It chose instead&para;<br>to use language that imports but-for causality. Especially&para;<br>in the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the&para;<br>rule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,&para;<br>107–108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is&para;<br>different from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that&para;<br>disfavors the defendant.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“results from” will “unduly limi[t] criminal responsibility”&para;<br>and “cannot be reconciled with sound policy.” Brief for&para;<br>United States 24. We doubt that the requirement of but­&para;<br>for causation for this incremental punishment will prove a&para;<br>policy disaster. A cursory search of the Federal Reporter&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reveals that but-for causation is not nearly the insuper­&para;<br>able barrier the Government makes it out to be. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Krieger, 628 F. 3d 857, 870–871 (CA7&para;<br>2010) (affirming “death results” conviction based on expert&para;<br>testimony that, although the victim had several drugs in&para;<br>her system, the drug distributed by the defendant was a&para;<br>but-for cause of death); United States v. Webb, 655 F. 3d&para;<br>1238, 1254–1255 (CA11 2011) (per curiam) (same). More­&para;<br>over, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for&para;<br>causation, the defendant will still be liable for violating&para;<br>§841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence&para;<br>under §841(b)(1).&para;<br>Indeed, it is more likely the Government’s proposal that&para;<br>“cannot be reconciled with sound policy,” given the need&para;<br>for clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The judicial&para;<br>authorities invoking a “substantial” or “contributing”&para;<br>factor test in criminal cases differ widely in their applica­&para;<br>tion of it. Compare Wilson v. State, 24 S. W. 409, 410&para;<br>(Tex. Crim. App. 1893) (an act is an actual cause if it&para;<br>“contributed materially” to a result, even if other concur­&para;<br>rent acts would have produced that result on their own),&para;<br>with Cox v. State, 305 Ark. 244, 248, 808 S. W. 2d 306, 309&para;<br>(1991) (causation cannot be found where other concurrent&para;<br>causes were clearly sufficient to produce the result and the&para;<br>defendant’s act was clearly insufficient to produce it (ap­&para;<br>plying Ark. Code Ann. §5–2–205 (1987)).5 Here the Gov­&para;<br>ernment is uncertain about the precise application of the&para;<br>test that it proposes. Taken literally, its “contributing­&para;<br>cause” test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or&para;<br>omission that makes a positive incremental contribution,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Some cases apply what they call a “substantial factor” test only&para;<br>when multiple independently sufficient causes “operat[e] together to&para;<br>cause the result.” Eversley v. Florida, 748 So. 2d 963, 967 (Fla. 1999);&para;<br>see also Callahan v. Cardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862–&para;<br>863 (Mo. 1993). We will not exaggerate the confusion by counting these&para;<br>as genuine “substantial factor” cases.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BURRAGE v.

See Brief for State&para;<br>of Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “contributing&para;<br>cause” as “[a] factor that—though not the primary cause—&para;<br>plays a part in producing a result”). But at oral argument&para;<br>the Government insisted that its test excludes causes that&para;<br>are “not important enough” or “too insubstantial.” Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 28. Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how&para;<br>important or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.&para;<br>See id., at 41–42. Presumably the lower courts would be&para;<br>left to guess. That task would be particularly vexing since&para;<br>the evidence in §841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms&para;<br>of probabilities and percentages. One of the experts in&para;<br>this case, for example, testified that Banka’s death would&para;<br>have been “[v]ery less likely” had he not used the heroin&para;<br>that Burrage provided. App. 171. Is it sufficient that use&para;<br>of a drug made the victim’s death 50 percent more likely?&para;<br>Fifteen percent? Five? Who knows. Uncertainty of that&para;<br>kind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable­&para;<br>doubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the&para;<br>need to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons&para;<br>can comprehend.
