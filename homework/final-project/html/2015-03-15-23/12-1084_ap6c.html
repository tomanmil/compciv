RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPART-&para;<br>&para;<br>MENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETITIONER v.&para;<br>&para;<br>EDWARD HAROLD SCHAD &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 12–1084. Decided June 24, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Respondent Edward Schad was convicted of first-degree&para;<br>murder and sentenced to death. After an extensive series of&para;<br>state- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this&para;<br>Court’s denial of respondent’s petitions for certiorari and&para;<br>for rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its&para;<br>mandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appel­&para;<br>late Procedure 41(d)(2)(D). The Ninth Circuit instead,&para;<br>sua sponte, construed respondent’s motion to stay the&para;<br>mandate pending the Ninth Circuit’s decision in a sepa­&para;<br>rate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that&para;<br>it had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of&para;<br>that previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a&para;<br>few days before respondent’s scheduled execution. Even&para;<br>assuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, 545 U. S. 794&para;<br>(2005), that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional cir­&para;<br>cumstances justified withholding its mandate. As a result,&para;<br>we conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s failure to issue its&para;<br>mandate constituted an abuse of discretion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1985, an Arizona jury found respondent guilty of&para;<br>first-degree murder for the 1978 strangling of 74-year-old&para;<br>Lorimer Grove.1 The court sentenced respondent to death.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1A&para;<br>&para;<br>state habeas court vacated an earlier guilty verdict and death&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RYAN v.

S. 624&para;<br>(1991), respondent again sought state habeas relief, alleg­&para;<br>ing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at&para;<br>sentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient&para;<br>mitigating evidence. The state courts denied relief.&para;<br>In August 1998, respondent sought federal habeas relief.&para;<br>He again raised a claim of ineffective assistance at sen­&para;<br>tencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evi­&para;<br>dence. The District Court denied respondent’s request&para;<br>for an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evi­&para;<br>dence, concluding that respondent was not diligent in&para;<br>developing the evidence during his state habeas proceed­&para;<br>ings. Schad v. Schriro, 454 F. Supp. 2d 897 (Ariz. 2006).&para;<br>The District Court alternatively held that the proffered&para;<br>new evidence did not demonstrate that trial counsel’s&para;<br>performance was deficient. Id., at 940–947. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded&para;<br>to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether&para;<br>respondent’s state habeas counsel was diligent in develop­&para;<br>ing the state evidentiary record. Schad v. Ryan, 606 F. 3d&para;<br>1022 (2010). Arizona petitioned for certiorari. This Court&para;<br>granted the petition, vacated the Ninth Circuit’s opinion,&para;<br>and remanded for further proceedings in light of Cullen v.&para;<br>Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___ (2011). See Ryan v. Schad, 563&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2011). On remand, the Ninth Circuit affirmed&para;<br>the District Court’s denial of habeas relief. Schad v. Ryan,&para;<br>671 F. 3d 708, 726 (2011). The Ninth Circuit subsequently&para;<br>denied a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc on&para;<br>February 28, 2012.&para;<br>On July 10, 2012, respondent filed in the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>the first motion directly at issue in this case. This motion&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>sentence due to an error in jury instructions. See State v. Schad, 142&para;<br>&para;<br>Ariz. 619, 691 P. 2d 710 (1984). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012).2&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit denied respondent’s motion on July 27,&para;<br>2012. Respondent then filed a petition for certiorari. This&para;<br>Court denied the petition on October 9, 2012, 568 U. S.&para;<br>___, and denied a petition for rehearing on January 7,&para;<br>2013. 568 U. S. ___.&para;<br>Respondent returned to the Ninth Circuit that day and&para;<br>filed a motion requesting a stay of the mandate in light&para;<br>of a pending Ninth Circuit en banc case addressing the&para;<br>interaction between Pinholster and Martinez. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit denied the motion on February 1, 2013, “declin[ing] to issue an indefinite stay of the mandate that&para;<br>would unduly interfere with Arizona’s execution process.”&para;<br>Order in No. 07–99005, Doc. 102, p. 1. But instead of&para;<br>issuing the mandate, the court decided sua sponte to con­&para;<br>strue respondent’s motion “as a motion to reconsider our&para;<br>prior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Re­&para;<br>mand in light of Martinez,” which the court had denied on&para;<br>July 27, 2012. Id., at 2. The court ordered briefing and, in&para;<br>a divided opinion, remanded the case to the District Court&para;<br>to determine whether respondent could establish that he&para;<br>received ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel un­&para;<br>der Martinez, whether he could demonstrate prejudice&para;<br>as a result, and whether his underlying claim of ineffective&para;<br>assistance of trial counsel had merit. No. 07–99005 (Feb.&para;<br>26, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. A–13 to A–15, 2013 WL&para;<br>791610, *6. Judge Graber dissented based on her conclu­&para;<br>sion that respondent could not show prejudice. Id., at A–&para;<br>16 to A–17, 2013 WL 791610, *7. Arizona set an execution&para;<br>date of March 6, 2013, which prompted respondent to file&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Martinez,&para;<br>&para;<br>566 U. S. 1, was decided on March 20, 2012. We are un­&para;<br>aware of any explanation for respondent’s delay in bringing his&para;<br>Martinez-based argument to the Ninth Circuit’s attention.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RYAN v. SCHAD&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>a motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013,&para;<br>with Judge Graber again noting her dissent.&para;<br>On March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing&para;<br>and rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit. The court&para;<br>denied the petition the same day, with eight judges dis­&para;<br>senting in two separate opinions. 709 F. 3d 855 (2013).&para;<br>On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the&para;<br>stay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for&para;<br>certiorari. This Court denied the application, with JUSTICES SCALIA and ALITO noting that they would grant&para;<br>it. 568 U. S. ___ (2013). We now consider the petition.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets&para;<br>forth the default rule that “[t]he court of appeals must&para;<br>issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme&para;<br>Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari&para;<br>is filed.” (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is&para;<br>straightforward: “[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely&para;<br>to allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio­&para;<br>rari.” Bell, 545 U. S., at 806. Hence, once this Court has&para;<br>denied a petition, there is generally no need for further&para;<br>action from the lower courts. See ibid. (“[A] decision by&para;<br>this Court denying discretionary review usually signals&para;<br>the end of litigation”). In Bell, Tennessee argued that&para;<br>Rule 41(d)(2)(D) “admits of no exceptions, so the mandate&para;<br>should have issued on the date” the Court of Appeals&para;<br>received notice of the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari.&para;<br>Id., at 803. There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell&para;<br>because we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused&para;<br>its discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of&para;<br>the mandate after denial of certiorari. Id., at 803–804. As&para;<br>in Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.&para;<br>Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>reviewed in federal habeas proceedings, “finality and comity&para;<br>concerns,” based in principles of federalism, demand&para;<br>that federal courts “accord the appropriate level of respect&para;<br>to” state judgments by allowing them to be enforced&para;<br>when federal proceedings conclude. Id., at 812–813.&para;<br>As we noted, States have an “ ‘ “interest in the finality of&para;<br>convictions that have survived direct review within the&para;<br>state court system.” ’ ” Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v.&para;<br>Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555 (1998), in turn quoting&para;<br>Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Else­&para;<br>where, we explained that “ ‘the profound interests in&para;<br>repose’ attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals”&para;<br>dictate that “the power [to withdraw the mandate] can be&para;<br>exercised only in extraordinary circumstances.” Calderon,&para;<br>supra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E.&para;<br>Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3938, p. 712 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1996)). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is&para;<br>a power “of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave,&para;<br>unforeseen contingencies.” Calderon, supra, at 550. Even&para;<br>assuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it&para;<br>abuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate&para;<br>once the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless&para;<br>extraordinary circumstances justify that action.&para;<br>Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordi­&para;<br>nary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of&para;<br>justice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged&para;<br>in state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel&para;<br>had been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient&para;<br>mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. 545&para;<br>U. S., at 797. On federal habeas review, he made the&para;<br>same argument. Id., at 798. After the Sixth Circuit af­&para;<br>firmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that&para;<br>“placed substantial emphasis” on his argument that the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.&para;<br>Id., at 800. While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it&para;<br>stayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RYAN v. SCHAD&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of&para;<br>the writ. Ibid.&para;<br>When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit waited five months (and until two days before the&para;<br>scheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that vacated the District Court’s denial of habeas and remanded&para;<br>for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistanceof-counsel claim. Id., at 800–801. This Court reversed&para;<br>that decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused&para;<br>its discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate&para;<br>without notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously&para;<br>rejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federal­&para;<br>ism principles.&para;<br>In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its&para;<br>discretion when it did not issue the mandate. As in Bell,&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate&para;<br>based on an argument it had considered and rejected&para;<br>months earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>February 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had&para;<br>been over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly&para;<br>7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.3&para;<br>Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented&para;<br>in the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to&para;<br>those accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following Febru­&para;<br>ary. Respondent styled his July 10 motion a “Motion to&para;<br>Vacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for&para;<br>Additional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.” No.&para;<br>07–99005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p. 1. As its title suggests, the&para;<br>only claim presented in that motion was that respondent’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Respondent&para;<br>&para;<br>did not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>ultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>denied respondent’s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc&para;<br>and more than 3½ months after Martinez was decided.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>postconviction counsel should have developed more evi­&para;<br>dence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claim. Here, as in Bell, respondent’s July 10 motion&para;<br>“pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted&para;<br>by the Court of Appeals.” 545 U. S., at 806. These arguments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion&para;<br>that “[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been&para;<br>clearer.” Id., at 808. The Ninth Circuit had a full “oppor­&para;<br>tunity to consider these arguments” but declined to do so,&para;<br>id., at 806, which “support[s] our determination that the&para;<br>decision to withhold the mandate was in error.” Id., at&para;<br>806–807. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully&para;<br>considers each motion a capital defendant presents on&para;<br>habeas review. See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that&para;<br>“judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of&para;<br>a petition for rehearing”). As a result, there is no indica­&para;<br>tion that there were any extraordinary circumstances here&para;<br>that called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte&para;<br>that it already explicitly rejected.&para;<br>Finally, this case presents an additional issue not pre­&para;<br>sent in Bell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393&para;<br>F. 3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which&para;<br>precedes our Bell decision by more than six months, as­&para;<br>serts the Ninth Circuit’s inherent authority to withhold a&para;<br>mandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–3 to A–4, 2013 WL&para;<br>791610, *1. But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Cir­&para;<br>cuit’s decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee,&para;<br>supra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F. 3d 688, 691–&para;<br>692 (2004)). That opinion, thus, provides no support for&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit’s decision.&para;<br>In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>abused its discretion when it neglected to issue its man­&para;<br>date. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit’s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RYAN v. SCHAD&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to&para;<br>issue the mandate immediately and without any further&para;<br>proceedings.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
