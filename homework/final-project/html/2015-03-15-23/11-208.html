HUFF, ET AL.&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 11–208.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided January 23, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Petitioners Darin Ryburn and Edmundo Zepeda, along&para;<br>with two other officers from the Burbank Police Department, responded to a call from Bellarmine-Jefferson High&para;<br>School in Burbank, California. When the officers arrived&para;<br>at the school, the principal informed them that a student, Vincent Huff, was rumored to have written a letter&para;<br>threatening to “shoot up” the school. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>2. The principal reported that many parents, after hearing the rumor, had decided to keep their children at home.&para;<br>Ibid. The principal expressed concern for the safety of her&para;<br>students and requested that the officers investigate the&para;<br>threat. Id., at 42, 54–55.&para;<br>In the course of conducting interviews with the principal&para;<br>and two of Vincent’s classmates, the officers learned that&para;<br>Vincent had been absent from school for two days and&para;<br>that he was frequently subjected to bullying. Id., at 2. The&para;<br>officers additionally learned that one of Vincent’s classmates believed that Vincent was capable of carrying out&para;<br>the alleged threat. Id., at 44. The officers found Vincent’s&para;<br>absences from school and his history of being subjected to&para;<br>bullying as cause for concern. The officers had received&para;<br>training on targeted school violence and were aware that&para;<br>these characteristics are common among perpetrators of&para;<br>school shootings. Id., at 56–58, 63.&para;<br>The officers decided to continue the investigation by&para;<br>interviewing Vincent. When the officers arrived at Vincent’s house, Officer Zepeda knocked on the door and&para;<br>announced several times that the officers were with the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RYBURN v. HUFF&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Burbank Police Department. No one answered the door or&para;<br>otherwise responded to Officer Zepeda’s knocks. Sergeant&para;<br>Ryburn then called the home telephone. The officers could&para;<br>hear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one answered. Id., at 2.&para;<br>Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of&para;<br>Vincent’s mother, Mrs. Huff. When Mrs. Huff answered&para;<br>the phone, Sergeant Ryburn identified himself and inquired about her location. Mrs. Huff informed Sergeant&para;<br>Ryburn that she was inside the house. Sergeant Ryburn&para;<br>then inquired about Vincent’s location, and Mrs. Huff&para;<br>informed him that Vincent was inside with her. Sergeant&para;<br>Ryburn told Mrs. Huff that he and the other officers were&para;<br>outside and requested to speak with her, but Mrs. Huff&para;<br>hung up the phone. Id., at 2–3.&para;<br>One or two minutes later, Mrs. Huff and Vincent walked&para;<br>out of the house and stood on the front steps. Officer&para;<br>Zepeda advised Vincent that he and the other officers were&para;<br>there to discuss the threats. Vincent, apparently aware of&para;<br>the rumor that was circulating at his school, responded,&para;<br>“I can’t believe you’re here for that.” Id., at 3. Sergeant&para;<br>Ryburn asked Mrs. Huff if they could continue the discussion inside the house, but she refused. Ibid. In Sergeant&para;<br>Ryburn’s experience as a juvenile bureau sergeant, it was&para;<br>“extremely unusual” for a parent to decline an officer’s&para;<br>request to interview a juvenile inside. Id., at 3, 73–74.&para;<br>Sergeant Ryburn also found it odd that Mrs. Huff never&para;<br>asked the officers the reason for their visit. Id., at 73–74.&para;<br>After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburn’s request to&para;<br>continue the discussion inside, Sergeant Ryburn asked her&para;<br>if there were any guns in the house. Mrs. Huff responded&para;<br>by “immediately turn[ing] around and r[unning] into the&para;<br>house.” Id., at 3. Sergeant Ryburn, who was “scared&para;<br>because [he] didn’t know what was in that house” and had&para;<br>“seen too many officers killed,” entered the house behind&para;<br>her. Id., at 75. Vincent entered the house behind Ser-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>geant Ryburn, and Officer Zepeda entered after Vincent.&para;<br>Officer Zepeda was concerned about “officer safety” and&para;<br>did not want Sergeant Ryburn to enter the house alone.&para;<br>Id., at 3. The two remaining officers, who had been standing out of earshot while Sergeant Ryburn and Officer&para;<br>Zepeda talked to Vincent and Mrs. Huff, entered the house&para;<br>last, on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had given Sergeant&para;<br>Ryburn and Officer Zepeda permission to enter. Id., at&para;<br>3–4.&para;<br>Upon entering the house, the officers remained in the&para;<br>living room with Mrs. Huff and Vincent. Eventually,&para;<br>Vincent’s father entered the room and challenged the&para;<br>officers’ authority to be there. The officers remained inside the house for a total of 5 to 10 minutes. During that&para;<br>time, the officers talked to Mr. Huff and Vincent. They&para;<br>did not conduct any search of Mr. Huff, Mrs. Huff, or&para;<br>Vincent, or any of their property. The officers ultimately&para;<br>concluded that the rumor about Vincent was false, and&para;<br>they reported their conclusion to the school. Id., at 4.&para;<br>The Huffs brought this action against the officers under&para;<br>Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. The complaint alleges&para;<br>that the officers violated the Huffs’ Fourth Amendment&para;<br>rights by entering their home without a warrant. Following a 2-day bench trial, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the officers. The District Court resolved&para;<br>conflicting testimony regarding Mrs. Huff’s response to&para;<br>Sergeant Ryburn’s inquiry about guns by finding that Mrs.&para;<br>Huff “immediately turned around and ran into the house.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 3. The District Court concluded that&para;<br>the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because&para;<br>Mrs. Huff’s odd behavior, combined with the information&para;<br>the officers gathered at the school, could have led reasonable officers to believe “that there could be weapons inside&para;<br>the house, and that family members or the officers themselves were in danger.” Id., at 6. The District Court noted&para;<br>that “[w]ithin a very short period of time, the officers were&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RYBURN v. HUFF&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>confronted with facts and circumstances giving rise to&para;<br>grave concern about the nature of the danger they were&para;<br>confronting.” Id., at 6–7. With respect to this kind of&para;<br>“rapidly evolving incident,” the District Court explained,&para;<br>courts should be especially reluctant “to fault the police for&para;<br>not obtaining a warrant.” Id., at 7.&para;<br>A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court as to the two officers who entered the house on&para;<br>the assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but reversed as to petitioners. The majority upheld the District&para;<br>Court’s findings of fact, but disagreed with the District&para;<br>Court’s conclusion that petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity. The majority acknowledged that police&para;<br>officers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if&para;<br>they reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary&para;<br>to protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if&para;<br>the officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has&para;<br>been or is about to be committed. Id., at 24. But the&para;<br>majority determined that, in this case, “any belief that&para;<br>the officers or other family members were in serious, imminent harm would have been objectively unreasonable”&para;<br>given that “[Mrs. Huff] merely asserted her right to end&para;<br>her conversation with the officers and returned to her&para;<br>home.” Id., at 25.&para;<br>Judge Rawlinson dissented. She explained that “the&para;<br>discrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case&para;<br>was Mrs. Huff’s response to the question regarding whether there were guns in the house.” Id., at 31. She faulted&para;<br>the majority for “recit[ing] a sanitized account of this&para;<br>event” that differed markedly from the District Court’s&para;<br>findings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be&para;<br>credited. Judge Rawlinson looked to “cases that specifically address the scenario where officer safety concerns&para;<br>prompted the entry” and concluded that, under the rationale articulated in those cases, “a police officer could&para;<br>have reasonably believed that he was justified in making a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>warrantless entry to ensure that no one inside the house&para;<br>had a gun after Mrs. Huff ran into the house without&para;<br>answering the question of whether anyone had a weapon.”&para;<br>Id., at 31, 33, 37.&para;<br>Judge Rawlinson’s analysis of the qualified immunity&para;<br>issue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a&para;<br>Fourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly comparable to those present in this case. On the contrary,&para;<br>some of our opinions may be read as pointing in the opposite direction.&para;<br>In Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006), we&para;<br>held that officers may enter a residence without a warrant&para;<br>when they have “an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is . . . imminently threatened with&para;<br>[serious injury].” We explained that “ ‘[t]he need to protect&para;<br>or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification&para;<br>for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or&para;<br>emergency.’ ” Id., at 403 (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437&para;<br>U. S. 385, 392 (1978)). In addition, in Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 118 (2006), the Court stated that “it&para;<br>would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a&para;<br>tort by entering [a residence] . . . to determine whether&para;<br>violence . . . is about to (or soon will) occur.”&para;<br>A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to&para;<br>mean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to enter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for&para;<br>concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.&para;<br>In this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners&para;<br>had such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such&para;<br>a conclusion. The District Court wrote:&para;<br>“[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led&para;<br>them to be concerned for their own safety and for the&para;<br>safety of other persons in the residence: the unusual&para;<br>behavior of the parents in not answering the door or&para;<br>the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RYBURN v. HUFF&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>about the reason for their visit or express concern that&para;<br>they were investigating her son; the fact that she&para;<br>hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that&para;<br>she refused to tell them whether there were guns in&para;<br>the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into&para;<br>the house while being questioned. That behavior,&para;<br>combined with the information obtained at the&para;<br>school—that Vincent was a student who was a victim&para;<br>of bullying, who had been absent from school for two&para;<br>days, and who had threatened to ‘shoot up’ the&para;<br>school—led the officers to believe that there could be&para;<br>weapons inside the house, and that family members&para;<br>or the officers themselves were in danger.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 6.&para;<br>This belief, the District Court held, was “objectively reasonable,” particularly since the situation was “rapidly&para;<br>evolving” and the officers had to make quick decisions.&para;<br>Id., at 6–7.&para;<br>The panel majority—far removed from the scene and&para;<br>with the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situation—confidently concluded that the officers really had no&para;<br>reason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As&para;<br>the panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the&para;<br>Huffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the&para;<br>door and announced their presence and when they called&para;<br>the home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation&para;<br>to respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone.&para;<br>The majority attributed no significance to the fact that,&para;<br>when the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell&para;<br>phone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conversation. And, according to the majority, the officers should&para;<br>not have been concerned by Mrs. Huff’s reaction when&para;<br>they asked her if there were any guns in the house because Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her&para;<br>conversation with the officers and returned to her home.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Id., at 25.&para;<br>Confronted with the facts found by the District Court,&para;<br>reasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have&para;<br>come to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat&para;<br>to their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous&para;<br>reasons.&para;<br>First, although the panel majority purported to accept&para;<br>the findings of the District Court, it changed those findings in several key respects. As Judge Rawlinson correctly&para;<br>observed, “the discrete incident that precipitated the entry&para;<br>in this case was Mrs. Huff’s response to the question&para;<br>regarding whether there were guns in the house.” Id., at&para;<br>31. The District Court’s finding that Mrs. Huff “immediately turned around and ran into the house” implicitly&para;<br>rejected Mrs. Huff’s contrary testimony that she walked&para;<br>into the house after telling the officers that she was going&para;<br>to get her husband. Id., at 3. The panel majority upheld&para;<br>the District Court’s findings of fact and acknowledged that&para;<br>it could not reverse the District Court simply because it&para;<br>“may have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and&para;<br>other evidence in another manner.” Id., at 15. But the&para;<br>panel majority’s determination that petitioners were not&para;<br>entitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of&para;<br>the facts that differed markedly from the District Court’s&para;<br>finding. According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the&para;<br>officers and returned to her home” after telling the officers&para;<br>“that she would go get her husband.” Id., at 12, 25.&para;<br>Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the&para;<br>view that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of concern so long as it is lawful. Accordingly, the panel majority concluded that Mrs. Huff’s response to the question&para;<br>whether there were any guns in the house (immediately&para;<br>turning around and running inside) was not a reason for&para;<br>alarm because she was under no legal obligation to con-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RYBURN v. HUFF&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>tinue her conversation with the police. It should go without saying, however, that there are many circumstances in&para;<br>which lawful conduct may portend imminent violence.&para;<br>Third, the panel majority’s method of analyzing the&para;<br>string of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was&para;<br>entirely unrealistic. The majority looked at each separate&para;<br>event in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did&para;<br>not give cause for concern. But it is a matter of common&para;<br>sense that a combination of events each of which is mundane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming&para;<br>picture.&para;<br>Fourth, the panel majority did not heed the District&para;<br>Court’s wise admonition that judges should be cautious&para;<br>about second-guessing a police officer’s assessment, made&para;<br>on the scene, of the danger presented by a particular&para;<br>situation. With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliberation, the panel majority concluded that it was unreasonable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent.&para;<br>But we have instructed that reasonableness “must be&para;<br>judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the&para;<br>scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight” and&para;<br>that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to&para;<br>make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are&para;<br>tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396–397 (1989). Judged from the&para;<br>proper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a&para;<br>split-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding&para;<br>chain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning&para;<br>and running into the house after refusing to answer a&para;<br>question about guns, petitioners’ belief that entry was&para;<br>necessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was&para;<br>eminently reasonable.&para;<br>In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners’ position&para;<br>could have come to the conclusion that the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>there was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that&para;<br>violence was imminent. And a reasonable officer could&para;<br>have come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found&para;<br>by the District Court.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for&para;<br>the entry of judgment in favor of petitioners.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
