AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1025. Argued October 29, 2012—Decided February 26, 2013&para;<br>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA),&para;<br>50 U. S. C. §1881a, added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008,&para;<br>permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly authorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not “United States persons” and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United&para;<br>States. Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence&para;<br>Surveillance Court’s (FISC) approval. Surveillance under §1881a is&para;<br>subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional&para;<br>supervision, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Respondents—attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizations—are United States persons who claim that they engage in sensitive international communications with individuals who they&para;<br>believe are likely targets of §1881a surveillance. On the day that the&para;<br>FISA Amendments Act was enacted, they filed suit, seeking a declaration that §1881a is facially unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against §1881a-authorized surveillance. The District Court&para;<br>found that respondents lacked standing, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that respondents showed (1) an “objectively reasonable likelihood” that their communications will be intercepted at some&para;<br>time in the future, and (2) that they are suffering present injuries resulting from costly and burdensome measures they take to protect&para;<br>the confidentiality of their international communications from possible §1881a surveillance.&para;<br>Held: Respondents do not have Article III standing. Pp. 8–24.&para;<br>(a) To establish Article III standing, an injury must be “concrete,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.” Monsanto Co.&para;<br>v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___. “[T]hreatened injury&para;<br>must be ‘ “certainly impending” ’ to constitute injury in fact,” and&para;<br>“[a]llegations of possible future injury” are not sufficient. Whitmore&para;<br>v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 158. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(b) Respondents assert that they have suffered injury in fact that is&para;<br>fairly traceable to §1881a because there is an objectively reasonable&para;<br>likelihood that their communications with their foreign contacts will&para;<br>be intercepted under §1881a at some point. This argument fails. Initially, the Second Circuit’s “objectively reasonable likelihood” standard is inconsistent with this Court’s “threatened injury” requirement.&para;<br>Respondents’ standing theory also rests on a speculative chain of possibilities that does not establish that their potential injury is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to §1881a. First, it is highly speculative whether the Government will imminently target&para;<br>communications to which respondents are parties. Since respondents, as U. S. persons, cannot be targeted under §1881a, their theory&para;<br>necessarily rests on their assertion that their foreign contacts will be&para;<br>targeted. Yet they have no actual knowledge of the Government’s&para;<br>§1881a targeting practices. Second, even if respondents could&para;<br>demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent,&para;<br>they can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to&para;<br>use §1881a-authorized surveillance instead of one of the Government’s numerous other surveillance methods, which are not challenged here. Third, even if respondents could show that the Government will seek FISC authorization to target respondents’ foreign&para;<br>contacts under §1881a, they can only speculate as to whether the&para;<br>FISC will authorize the surveillance. This Court is reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment. See, e.g., Whitmore,&para;<br>supra, at 159–160. Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain&para;<br>the FISC’s approval to target respondents’ foreign contacts under&para;<br>§1881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed in acquiring those contacts’ communications. And fifth, even if the Government were to target respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents&para;<br>can only speculate as to whether their own communications with&para;<br>those contacts would be incidentally acquired. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>(c) Respondents’ alternative argument is also unpersuasive. They&para;<br>claim that they suffer ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to&para;<br>§1881a because the risk of §1881a surveillance requires them to take&para;<br>costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of&para;<br>their communications. But respondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>harm that is not certainly impending. Because they do not face a&para;<br>threat of certainly impending interception under §1881a, their costs&para;<br>are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, which is insufficient to create standing. See Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 10–15. Accordingly, any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not&para;<br>fairly traceable to §1881a. Pp. 16–20.&para;<br>(d) Respondents’ remaining arguments are likewise unavailing.&para;<br>Contrary to their claim, their alleged injuries are not the same kinds&para;<br>of injuries that supported standing in cases such as Friends of the&para;<br>Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.&para;<br>167, Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, and Monsanto, supra. And their&para;<br>suggestion that they should be held to have standing because otherwise the constitutionality of §1881a will never be adjudicated is both&para;<br>legally and factually incorrect. First, “ ‘[t]he assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is&para;<br>not a reason to find standing.’ ” Valley Forge Christian College v.&para;<br>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.&para;<br>464, 489. Second, the holding in this case by no means insulates&para;<br>§1881a from judicial review.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>before us is whether respondents have Article III standing&para;<br>to seek this prospective relief.&para;<br>Respondents assert that they can establish injury in fact&para;<br>because there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that&para;<br>their communications will be acquired under §1881a at&para;<br>some point in the future. But respondents’ theory of future injury is too speculative to satisfy the well-established&para;<br>requirement that threatened injury must be “certainly&para;<br>impending.” E.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149,&para;<br>158 (1990). And even if respondents could demonstrate&para;<br>that the threatened injury is certainly impending, they&para;<br>still would not be able to establish that this injury is fairly&para;<br>traceable to §1881a. As an alternative argument, respondents contend that they are suffering present injury&para;<br>because the risk of §1881a-authorized surveillance already has forced them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of their international&para;<br>communications. But respondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending. We&para;<br>therefore hold that respondents lack Article III standing.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1978, after years of debate, Congress enacted the&para;<br>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to authorize&para;<br>and regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance&para;<br>of communications for foreign intelligence purposes. See&para;<br>92 Stat. 1783, 50 U. S. C. §1801 et seq.; 1 D. Kris &amp; J.&para;<br>Wilson, National Security Investigations &amp; Prosecutions&para;<br>§§3.1, 3.7 (2d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Kris &amp; Wilson). In&para;<br>enacting FISA, Congress legislated against the backdrop&para;<br>of our decision in United States v. United States Dist.&para;<br>Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297 (1972)&para;<br>(Keith), in which we explained that the standards and&para;<br>procedures that law enforcement officials must follow&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>when conducting “surveillance of ‘ordinary crime’ ” might&para;<br>not be required in the context of surveillance conducted&para;<br>for domestic national-security purposes. Id., at 322–323.&para;<br>Although the Keith opinion expressly disclaimed any&para;<br>ruling “on the scope of the President’s surveillance power&para;<br>with respect to the activities of foreign powers,” id., at 308,&para;<br>it implicitly suggested that a special framework for foreign&para;<br>intelligence surveillance might be constitutionally permissible, see id., at 322–323.&para;<br>In constructing such a framework for foreign intelligence surveillance, Congress created two specialized&para;<br>courts. In FISA, Congress authorized judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to approve&para;<br>electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes if&para;<br>there is probable cause to believe that “the target of the&para;<br>electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a&para;<br>foreign power,” and that each of the specific “facilities or&para;<br>places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is&para;<br>being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an&para;<br>agent of a foreign power.” §105(a)(3), 92 Stat. 1790; see&para;<br>§§105(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), ibid.; 1 Kris &amp; Wilson §7:2, at&para;<br>194–195; id., §16:2, at 528–529. Additionally, Congress&para;<br>vested the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of&para;<br>Review with jurisdiction to review any denials by the&para;<br>FISC of applications for electronic surveillance. §103(b),&para;<br>92 Stat. 1788; 1 Kris &amp; Wilson §5:7, at 151–153.&para;<br>In the wake of the September 11th attacks, President&para;<br>George W. Bush authorized the National Security Agency&para;<br>(NSA) to conduct warrantless wiretapping of telephone&para;<br>and e-mail communications where one party to the communication was located outside the United States and a&para;<br>participant in “the call was reasonably believed to be a&para;<br>member or agent of al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist&para;<br>organization,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 403a. See id., at&para;<br>263a–265a, 268a, 273a–279a, 292a–293a; American Civil&para;<br>Liberties Union v. NSA, 493 F. 3d 644, 648 (CA6 2007)&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(ACLU) (opinion of Batchelder, J.). In January 2007, the&para;<br>FISC issued orders authorizing the Government to target&para;<br>international communications into or out of the United&para;<br>States where there was probable cause to believe that one&para;<br>participant to the communication was a member or agent&para;<br>of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization. App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 312a, 398a, 405a. These FISC orders subjected any electronic surveillance that was then occurring under the NSA’s program to the approval of the FISC.&para;<br>Id., at 405a; see id., at 312a, 404a. After a FISC Judge&para;<br>subsequently narrowed the FISC’s authorization of such&para;<br>surveillance, however, the Executive asked Congress to&para;<br>amend FISA so that it would provide the intelligence&para;<br>community with additional authority to meet the challenges of modern technology and international terrorism.&para;<br>Id., at 315a–318a, 331a–333a, 398a; see id., at 262a,&para;<br>277a–279a, 287a.&para;<br>When Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of&para;<br>2008 (FISA Amendments Act), 122 Stat. 2436, it left much&para;<br>of FISA intact, but it “established a new and independent&para;<br>source of intelligence collection authority, beyond that&para;<br>granted in traditional FISA.” 1 Kris &amp; Wilson §9:11, at&para;<br>349–350. As relevant here, §702 of FISA, 50 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), which was enacted as part&para;<br>of the FISA Amendments Act, supplements pre-existing&para;<br>FISA authority by creating a new framework under which&para;<br>the Government may seek the FISC’s authorization of&para;<br>certain foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the&para;<br>communications of non-U. S. persons located abroad.&para;<br>Unlike traditional FISA surveillance, §1881a does not&para;<br>require the Government to demonstrate probable cause&para;<br>that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.&para;<br>Compare&para;<br>§§1805(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), with §§1881a(d)(1), (i)(3)(A); 638&para;<br>F. 3d 118, 126 (CA2 2011); 1 Kris &amp; Wilson §16:16, at 584.&para;<br>And, unlike traditional FISA, §1881a does not require the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Surveillance under §1881a is subject to statutory&para;<br>conditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervision, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Section 1881a provides that, upon the issuance of an order&para;<br>from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, “the&para;<br>Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence&para;<br>may authorize jointly, for a period of up to 1 year . . . , the&para;<br>targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located&para;<br>outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence&para;<br>information.” §1881a(a). Surveillance under §1881a may&para;<br>not be intentionally targeted at any person known to be in&para;<br>the United States or any U. S. person reasonably believed&para;<br>to be located abroad. §§1881a(b)(1)–(3); see also §1801(i).&para;<br>Additionally, acquisitions under §1881a must comport&para;<br>with the Fourth Amendment. §1881a(b)(5). Moreover,&para;<br>surveillance under §1881a is subject to congressional&para;<br>oversight and several types of Executive Branch review.&para;<br>See §§1881a(f)(2), (l); Amnesty Int’l USA v. McConnell, 646&para;<br>F.

Respondents also assert that they “have ceased&para;<br>engaging” in certain telephone and e-mail conversations.&para;<br>Id., at 400a. According to respondents, the threat of surveillance will compel them to travel abroad in order to&para;<br>have in-person conversations. In addition, respondents&para;<br>declare that they have undertaken “costly and burdensome measures” to protect the confidentiality of sensitive&para;<br>communications.

Second, respondents maintain that the risk&para;<br>of surveillance under §1881a is so substantial that they&para;<br>have been forced to take costly and burdensome measures&para;<br>to protect the confidentiality of their international communications; in their view, the costs they have incurred&para;<br>constitute present injury that is fairly traceable to §1881a.&para;<br>After both parties moved for summary judgment, the&para;<br>District Court held that respondents do not have standing.&para;<br>McConnell, 646 F.

This argument fails.&para;<br>As an initial matter, the Second Circuit’s “objectively&para;<br>reasonable likelihood” standard is inconsistent with our&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Furthermore, respondents’ argument rests on their&para;<br>highly speculative fear that: (1) the Government will&para;<br>decide to target the communications of non-U. S. persons&para;<br>with whom they communicate; (2) in doing so, the Government will choose to invoke its authority under §1881a&para;<br>rather than utilizing another method of surveillance;&para;<br>(3) the Article III judges who serve on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court will conclude that the Government’s proposed surveillance procedures satisfy §1881a’s&para;<br>many safeguards and are consistent with the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment; (4) the Government will succeed in intercepting the communications of respondents’ contacts; and&para;<br>(5) respondents will be parties to the particular communications that the Government intercepts. As discussed&para;<br>below, respondents’ theory of standing, which relies on a&para;<br>highly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy&para;<br>the requirement that threatened injury must be certainly&para;<br>impending. See Summers, supra, at 496 (rejecting a&para;<br>standing theory premised on a speculative chain of possibilities); Whitmore, supra, at 157–160 (same). Moreover,&para;<br>even if respondents could demonstrate injury in fact, the&para;<br>second link in the above-described chain of contingencies—which amounts to mere speculation about whether&para;<br>surveillance would be under §1881a or some other authority—shows that respondents cannot satisfy the requirement that any injury in fact must be fairly traceable to&para;<br>§1881a.&para;<br>First, it is speculative whether the Government will&para;<br>imminently target communications to which respondents&para;<br>are parties. Section 1881a expressly provides that respondents, who are U. S. persons, cannot be targeted for&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>surveillance under §1881a. See §§1881a(b)(1)–(3); 667&para;<br>F. 3d, at 173 (Raggi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Accordingly, it is no surprise that respondents fail to offer any evidence that their communications&para;<br>have been monitored under §1881a, a failure that substantially undermines their standing theory. See ACLU,&para;<br>493 F. 3d, at 655–656, 673–674 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)&para;<br>(concluding that plaintiffs who lacked evidence that their&para;<br>communications had been intercepted did not have standing to challenge alleged NSA surveillance). Indeed, respondents do not even allege that the Government has&para;<br>sought the FISC’s approval for surveillance of their communications. Accordingly, respondents’ theory necessarily&para;<br>rests on their assertion that the Government will target&para;<br>other individuals—namely, their foreign contacts.&para;<br>Yet respondents have no actual knowledge of the&para;<br>Government’s §1881a targeting practices. Instead, respondents merely speculate and make assumptions about&para;<br>whether their communications with their foreign contacts&para;<br>will be acquired under §1881a. See 667 F. 3d, at 185–187&para;<br>(opinion of Raggi, J.). For example, journalist Christopher&para;<br>Hedges states: “I have no choice but to assume that any of&para;<br>my international communications may be subject to government surveillance, and I have to make decisions . . . in&para;<br>light of that assumption.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 366a&para;<br>(emphasis added and deleted). Similarly, attorney Scott&para;<br>McKay asserts that, “[b]ecause of the [FISA Amendments&para;<br>Act], we now have to assume that every one of our international communications may be monitored by the government.” Id., at 375a (emphasis added); see also id., at 337a,&para;<br>343a–344a, 350a, 356a. “The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing” standing—and,&para;<br>at the summary judgment stage, such a party “can no&para;<br>longer rest on . . . ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by&para;<br>affidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts.’ ” Defenders of&para;<br>Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 561. Respondents, however, have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>set forth no specific facts demonstrating that the communications of their foreign contacts will be targeted. Moreover, because §1881a at most authorizes—but does not&para;<br>mandate or direct—the surveillance that respondents fear,&para;<br>respondents’ allegations are necessarily conjectural. See&para;<br>United Presbyterian Church in U. S. A. v. Reagan, 738&para;<br>F. 2d 1375, 1380 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.); 667 F. 3d, at&para;<br>187 (opinion of Raggi, J.). Simply put, respondents can&para;<br>only speculate as to how the Attorney General and the&para;<br>Director of National Intelligence will exercise their discretion in determining which communications to target.4&para;<br>Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the&para;<br>targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, respondents can only speculate as to whether the Government will&para;<br>seek to use §1881a-authorized surveillance (rather than&para;<br>other methods) to do so. The Government has numerous&para;<br>other methods of conducting surveillance, none of which is&para;<br>challenged here. Even after the enactment of the FISA&para;<br>Amendments Act, for example, the Government may still&para;<br>conduct electronic surveillance of persons abroad under&para;<br>the older provisions of FISA so long as it satisfies the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 It was suggested at oral argument that the Government could help&para;<br>resolve the standing inquiry by disclosing to a court, perhaps through&para;<br>an in camera proceeding, (1) whether it is intercepting respondents’&para;<br>communications and (2) what targeting or minimization procedures it&para;<br>is using. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14, 44, 56. This suggestion is puzzling. As an initial matter, it is respondents’ burden to prove their&para;<br>standing by pointing to specific facts, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,&para;<br>504 U. S. 555, 561 (1992), not the Government’s burden to disprove&para;<br>standing by revealing details of its surveillance priorities. Moreover,&para;<br>this type of hypothetical disclosure proceeding would allow a terrorist&para;<br>(or his attorney) to determine whether he is currently under U. S.&para;<br>surveillance simply by filing a lawsuit challenging the Government’s&para;<br>surveillance program. Even if the terrorist’s attorney were to comply&para;<br>with a protective order prohibiting him from sharing the Government’s&para;<br>disclosures with his client, the court’s postdisclosure decision about&para;<br>whether to dismiss the suit for lack of standing would surely signal to&para;<br>the terrorist whether his name was on the list of surveillance targets.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>applicable requirements, including a demonstration of&para;<br>probable cause to believe that the person is a foreign&para;<br>power or agent of a foreign power. See §1805. The Government may also obtain information from the intelligence&para;<br>services of foreign nations. Brief for Petitioners 33. And,&para;<br>although we do not reach the question, the Government&para;<br>contends that it can conduct FISA-exempt human and&para;<br>technical surveillance programs that are governed by&para;<br>Executive Order 12333. See Exec. Order No. 12333, §§1.4,&para;<br>2.1–2.5, 3 CFR 202, 210–212 (1981), reprinted as amended,&para;<br>note following 50 U. S. C. §401, pp. 543, 547–548. Even&para;<br>if respondents could demonstrate that their foreign&para;<br>contacts will imminently be targeted—indeed, even if they&para;<br>could show that interception of their own communications&para;<br>will imminently occur—they would still need to show&para;<br>that their injury is fairly traceable to §1881a. But, because respondents can only speculate as to whether any&para;<br>(asserted) interception would be under §1881a or some&para;<br>other authority, they cannot satisfy the “fairly traceable”&para;<br>requirement.&para;<br>Third, even if respondents could show that the Government will seek the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance&para;<br>Court’s authorization to acquire the communications of&para;<br>respondents’ foreign contacts under §1881a, respondents&para;<br>can only speculate as to whether that court will authorize&para;<br>such surveillance. In the past, we have been reluctant to&para;<br>endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to&para;<br>how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment. In Whitmore, for example, the plaintiff ’s theory of&para;<br>standing hinged largely on the probability that he would&para;<br>obtain federal habeas relief and be convicted upon retrial.&para;<br>In holding that the plaintiff lacked standing, we explained&para;<br>that “[i]t is just not possible for a litigant to prove in advance that the judicial system will lead to any particular&para;<br>result in his case.” 495 U.

Section 1881a mandates that&para;<br>the Government must obtain the Foreign Intelligence&para;<br>Surveillance Court’s approval of targeting procedures,&para;<br>minimization procedures, and a governmental certification&para;<br>regarding proposed surveillance. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2),&para;<br>(i)(3). The Court must, for example, determine whether&para;<br>the Government’s procedures are “reasonably designed . . .&para;<br>to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the&para;<br>dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons.” §1801(h);&para;<br>see §§1881a(i)(2), (i)(3)(A). And, critically, the Court must&para;<br>also assess whether the Government’s targeting and&para;<br>minimization procedures comport with the Fourth Amendment. §1881a(i)(3)(A).&para;<br>Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the&para;<br>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s approval to target respondents’ foreign contacts under §1881a, it is&para;<br>unclear whether the Government would succeed in acquiring the communications of respondents’ foreign contacts.&para;<br>And fifth, even if the Government were to conduct surveillance of respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents can&para;<br>only speculate as to whether their own communications&para;<br>with their foreign contacts would be incidentally acquired.&para;<br>In sum, respondents’ speculative chain of possibilities&para;<br>does not establish that injury based on potential future&para;<br>surveillance is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to&para;<br>§1881a.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Our cases do not uniformly require plaintiffs to demonstrate that it&para;<br>is literally certain that the harms they identify will come about. In&para;<br>some instances, we have found standing based on a “substantial risk”&para;<br>that the harm will occur, which may prompt plaintiffs to reasonably&para;<br>incur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson&para;<br>Seed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12). See also&para;<br>Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 8 (1988); Blum v.

Respondents assert that they are&para;<br>suffering ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to&para;<br>§1881a because the risk of surveillance under §1881a&para;<br>requires them to take costly and burdensome measures to&para;<br>protect the confidentiality of their communications. Respondents claim, for instance, that the threat of surveillance sometimes compels them to avoid certain e-mail and&para;<br>phone conversations, to “tal[k] in generalities rather than&para;<br>specifics,” or to travel so that they can have in-person&para;<br>conversations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38; App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>338a, 345a, 367a, 400a.6 The Second Circuit panel concluded that, because respondents are already suffering&para;<br>such ongoing injuries, the likelihood of interception under&para;<br>§1881a is relevant only to the question whether respondents’ ongoing injuries are “fairly traceable” to §1881a. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>U. S. 991, 1000–1001 (1982); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289,&para;<br>298 (1979). But to the extent that the “substantial risk” standard is&para;<br>relevant and is distinct from the “clearly impending” requirement,&para;<br>respondents fall short of even that standard, in light of the attenuated&para;<br>chain of inferences necessary to find harm here. See supra, at 11–15.&para;<br>In addition, plaintiffs bear the burden of pleading and proving concrete&para;<br>facts showing that the defendant’s actual action has caused the substantial risk of harm. Plaintiffs cannot rely on speculation about “ ‘the&para;<br>unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court.’ ”&para;<br>Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 562.&para;<br>6 For all the focus on respondents’ supposed need to travel abroad in&para;<br>light of potential §1881a surveillance, respondents cite only one specific&para;<br>instance of travel: an attorney’s trip to New York City to meet with&para;<br>other lawyers. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a. This domestic travel&para;<br>had but a tenuous connection to §1881a, because §1881a-authorized&para;<br>acquisitions “may not intentionally target any person known at the&para;<br>time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” §1881a(b)(1); see&para;<br>also 667 F. 3d 163, 202 (CA2 2011) (Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from&para;<br>denial of rehearing en banc); id., at 185 (opinion of Raggi, J. (same)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Analyzing the “fairly traceable” element of standing&para;<br>under a relaxed reasonableness standard, see 638 F. 3d, at&para;<br>133–134, the Second Circuit then held that “plaintiffs&para;<br>have established that they suffered present injuries in&para;<br>fact—economic and professional harms—stemming from a&para;<br>reasonable fear of future harmful government conduct,”&para;<br>id., at 138.&para;<br>The Second Circuit’s analysis improperly allowed respondents to establish standing by asserting that they&para;<br>suffer present costs and burdens that are based on a fear&para;<br>of surveillance, so long as that fear is not “fanciful, paranoid, or otherwise unreasonable.” See id., at 134. This&para;<br>improperly waters down the fundamental requirements of&para;<br>Article III. Respondents’ contention that they have standing because they incurred certain costs as a reasonable&para;<br>reaction to a risk of harm is unavailing—because the harm&para;<br>respondents seek to avoid is not certainly impending. In&para;<br>other words, respondents cannot manufacture standing&para;<br>merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their&para;<br>fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly&para;<br>impending. See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U. S.&para;<br>660, 664 (1976) (per curiam); National Family Planning &amp;&para;<br>Reproductive Health Assn., Inc., 468 F. 3d 826, 831 (CADC&para;<br>2006). Any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not fairly traceable to §1881a.&para;<br>If the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff&para;<br>would be able to secure a lower standard for Article III&para;<br>standing simply by making an expenditure based on a&para;<br>nonparanoid fear. As Judge Raggi accurately noted, under&para;<br>the Second Circuit panel’s reasoning, respondents could,&para;<br>“for the price of a plane ticket, . . . transform their standing burden from one requiring a showing of actual or&para;<br>imminent . . . interception to one requiring a showing that&para;<br>their subjective fear of such interception is not fanciful,&para;<br>irrational, or clearly unreasonable.” 667 F. 3d, at 180&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, allowing respondents to bring this action based on costs they incurred&para;<br>in response to a speculative threat would be tantamount&para;<br>to accepting a repackaged version of respondents’ first&para;<br>failed theory of standing. See ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at 656–&para;<br>657 (opinion of Batchelder, J.).&para;<br>Another reason that respondents’ present injuries are&para;<br>not fairly traceable to §1881a is that even before §1881a&para;<br>was enacted, they had a similar incentive to engage in&para;<br>many of the countermeasures that they are now taking.&para;<br>See id., at 668–670. For instance, respondent Scott&para;<br>McKay’s declaration describes—and the dissent heavily&para;<br>relies on—Mr. McKay’s “knowledge” that thousands of&para;<br>communications involving one of his clients were monitored in the past. App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a; post, at 4,&para;<br>7–8. But this surveillance was conducted pursuant to FISA&para;<br>authority that predated §1881a. See Brief for Petitioners&para;<br>32, n. 11; Al-Kidd v. Gonzales, No. 05–cv–93, 2008 WL&para;<br>5123009 (D Idaho, Dec. 4, 2008). Thus, because the Government was allegedly conducting surveillance of Mr.&para;<br>McKay’s client before Congress enacted §1881a, it is difficult to see how the safeguards that Mr. McKay now claims&para;<br>to have implemented can be traced to §1881a.&para;<br>Because respondents do not face a threat of certainly&para;<br>impending interception under §1881a, the costs that they&para;<br>have incurred to avoid surveillance are simply the product&para;<br>of their fear of surveillance,7 and our decision in Laird&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Although respondents’ alternative theory of standing rests primarily&para;<br>on choices that they have made based on their subjective fear of surveillance, respondents also assert that third parties might be disinclined to&para;<br>speak with them due to a fear of surveillance. See App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>372a–373a, 352a–353a. To the extent that such assertions are based on&para;<br>anything other than conjecture, see Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>makes it clear that such a fear is insufficient to create&para;<br>standing. See 408 U. S., at 10–15. The plaintiffs in Laird&para;<br>argued that their exercise of First Amendment rights was&para;<br>being “chilled by the mere existence, without more, of [the&para;<br>Army’s] investigative and data-gathering activity.” Id., at&para;<br>10. While acknowledging that prior cases had held that&para;<br>constitutional violations may arise from the chilling&para;<br>effect of “regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights,” the&para;<br>Court declared that none of those cases involved a&para;<br>“chilling effect aris[ing] merely from the individual’s&para;<br>knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in&para;<br>certain activities or from the individual’s concomitant fear&para;<br>that, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency&para;<br>might in the future take some other and additional action&para;<br>detrimental to that individual.” Id., at 11. Because&para;<br>“[a]llegations of a subjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate&para;<br>substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or&para;<br>a threat of specific future harm,” id., at 13–14, the plaintiffs in Laird—and respondents here—lack standing. See&para;<br>ibid.; ACLU, supra, at 661–662 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)&para;<br>(holding that plaintiffs lacked standing because they&para;<br>“allege[d] only a subjective apprehension” of alleged NSA&para;<br>surveillance and “a personal (self-imposed) unwillingness&para;<br>to communicate”); United Presbyterian Church, 738 F. 2d,&para;<br>at 1378 (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the legality of an Executive Order relating to surveillance because “the ‘chilling effect’ which is produced by&para;<br>their fear of being subjected to illegal surveillance and&para;<br>which deters them from conducting constitutionally protected activities, is foreclosed as a basis for standing” by&para;<br>Laird).&para;<br>For the reasons discussed above, respondents’ selfinflicted injuries are not fairly traceable to the Government’s purported activities under §1881a, and their&para;<br>subjective fear of surveillance does not give rise to standing.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v.

S., at 467. The Court held that the&para;<br>plaintiff, who was an attorney and a state legislator, had&para;<br>standing because he demonstrated, through “detailed&para;<br>affidavits,” that he “could not exhibit the films without&para;<br>incurring a risk of injury to his reputation and of an impairment of his political career.” Id., at 467, 473–475.&para;<br>Unlike the present case, Keene involved “more than a&para;<br>‘subjective chill’ ” based on speculation about potential&para;<br>governmental action; the plaintiff in that case was unquestionably regulated by the relevant statute, and the&para;<br>films that he wished to exhibit had already been labeled&para;<br>as “political propaganda.” See ibid.; ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at&para;<br>663–664 (opinion of Batchelder, J.); id., at 691 (Gibbons,&para;<br>J., concurring).&para;<br>Monsanto, on which respondents also rely, is likewise&para;<br>inapposite. In Monsanto, conventional alfalfa farmers had&para;<br>standing to seek injunctive relief because the agency’s&para;<br>decision to deregulate a variety of genetically engineered&para;<br>alfalfa gave rise to a “significant risk of gene flow to&para;<br>non-genetically-engineered varieties of alfalfa.” 561 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 13). The standing analysis in that case&para;<br>hinged on evidence that genetically engineered alfalfa&para;<br>“ ‘seed fields [we]re currently being planted in all the&para;<br>major alfalfa seed production areas’ ”; the bees that pollinate alfalfa “ ‘have a range of at least two to ten miles’ ”;&para;<br>and the alfalfa seed farms were concentrated in an area&para;<br>well within the bees’ pollination range. Id., at ___–___,&para;<br>and n. 3 (slip op., at 11–12, and n. 3). Unlike the conventional alfalfa farmers in Monsanto, however, respondents&para;<br>in the present case present no concrete evidence to substantiate their fears, but instead rest on mere conjecture&para;<br>about possible governmental actions.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents also suggest that they should be held to&para;<br>have standing because otherwise the constitutionality&para;<br>of §1881a could not be challenged. It would be wrong,&para;<br>they maintain, to “insulate the government’s surveillance&para;<br>activities from meaningful judicial review.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 60. Respondents’ suggestion is both legally&para;<br>and factually incorrect. First, “ ‘[t]he assumption that if&para;<br>respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have&para;<br>standing, is not a reason to find standing.’ ” Valley Forge&para;<br>Christian College, 454 U. S., at 489; Schlesinger, 418 U. S.,&para;<br>at 227; see also Richardson, 418 U. S., at 179; Raines, 521&para;<br>U. S., at 835 (Souter, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Second, our holding today by no means insulates §1881a&para;<br>from judicial review.&para;<br>As described above, Congress&para;<br>created a comprehensive scheme in which the Foreign&para;<br>Intelligence Surveillance Court evaluates the Government’s&para;<br>certifications, targeting procedures, and minimization&para;<br>procedures—including assessing whether the targeting&para;<br>and minimization procedures comport with the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). Any dissatisfaction that respondents may have about the Foreign&para;<br>Intelligence Surveillance Court’s rulings—or the congressional delineation of that court’s role—is irrelevant to our&para;<br>standing analysis.&para;<br>Additionally, if the Government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived from a §1881a acquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it&para;<br>must provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected&para;<br>person may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition.&para;<br>§§1806(c), 1806(e), 1881e(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The possibility of judicial review in this context is not farfetched. In&para;<br>United States v. Damrah, 412 F. 3d 618 (CA6 2005), for example, the&para;<br>Government made a pretrial disclosure that it intended to use FISA&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Thus, if the Government were to prosecute one of&para;<br>respondent-attorney’s foreign clients using §1881a-authorized&para;<br>surveillance, the Government would be required to make a&para;<br>disclosure. Although the foreign client might not have a&para;<br>viable Fourth Amendment claim, see, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 261 (1990), it is possible&para;<br>that the monitoring of the target’s conversations with his&para;<br>or her attorney would provide grounds for a claim of&para;<br>standing on the part of the attorney. Such an attorney&para;<br>would certainly have a stronger evidentiary basis for&para;<br>establishing standing than do respondents in the present&para;<br>case. In such a situation, unlike in the present case,&para;<br>it would at least be clear that the Government had acquired the foreign client’s communications using §1881aauthorized surveillance.&para;<br>Finally, any electronic communications service provider&para;<br>that the Government directs to assist in §1881a surveillance may challenge the lawfulness of that directive before&para;<br>the FISC. §§1881a(h)(4), (6). Indeed, at the behest of a&para;<br>service provider, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance&para;<br>Court of Review previously analyzed the constitutionality&para;<br>of electronic surveillance directives issued pursuant to a&para;<br>now-expired set of FISA amendments. See In re Directives&para;<br>Pursuant to Section 105B of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 551 F. 3d 1004, 1006–1016 (2008) (holding that&para;<br>the provider had standing and that the directives were&para;<br>constitutional).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>We hold that respondents lack Article III standing&para;<br>because they cannot demonstrate that the future injury&para;<br>——————&para;<br>evidence in a prosecution; the defendant (unsuccessfully) moved to&para;<br>suppress the FISA evidence, even though he had not been the target of&para;<br>the surveillance; and the Sixth Circuit ultimately held that FISA’s&para;<br>procedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.

At the&para;<br>same time, the Court has developed a subsidiary set of&para;<br>legal rules that help to determine when the Constitution’s&para;<br>requirement is met. See Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561; id.,&para;<br>at 583 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, a&para;<br>plaintiff must have “standing” to bring a legal claim. And&para;<br>a plaintiff has that standing, the Court has said, only if&para;<br>the action or omission that the plaintiff challenges has&para;<br>caused, or will cause, the plaintiff to suffer an injury that&para;<br>is “concrete and particularized,” “actual or imminent,” and&para;<br>“redress[able] by a favorable decision.” Id., at 560–561&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>No one here denies that the Government’s interception&para;<br>of a private telephone or e-mail conversation amounts to&para;<br>an injury that is “concrete and particularized.” Moreover,&para;<br>the plaintiffs, respondents here, seek as relief a judgment&para;<br>declaring unconstitutional (and enjoining enforcement of)&para;<br>a statutory provision authorizing those interceptions; and,&para;<br>such a judgment would redress the injury by preventing it.&para;<br>Thus, the basic question is whether the injury, i.e., the&para;<br>interception, is “actual or imminent.”&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Since the plaintiffs fear interceptions of a kind author­&para;<br>ized by §1881a, it is important to understand just what&para;<br>kind of surveillance that section authorizes. Congress&para;<br>enacted §1881a in 2008, as an amendment to the pre­&para;<br>existing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. C. §1801 et seq. Before the amendment, the Act&para;<br>authorized the Government (acting within the United&para;<br>States) to monitor private electronic communications&para;<br>between the United States and a foreign country if (1) the&para;<br>Government’s purpose was, in significant part, to obtain&para;<br>foreign intelligence information (which includes infor­&para;<br>mation concerning a “foreign power” or “territory” related&para;<br>to our “national defense” or “security” or the “conduct of&para;<br>. . . foreign affairs”), (2) the Government’s surveillance&para;<br>target was “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign&para;<br>power,” and (3) the Government used surveillance proce­&para;<br>dures designed to “minimize the acquisition and retention, and&para;<br>prohibit the dissemination, of ” any private information&para;<br>acquired about Americans. §§1801(e), (h), 1804(a).&para;<br>In addition the Government had to obtain the approval&para;<br>of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To do so, it&para;<br>had to submit an application describing (1) each “specific&para;<br>target,” (2) the “nature of the information sought,” and (3)&para;<br>the “type of communications or activities to be subjected&para;<br>to the surveillance.” §1804(a). It had to certify that, in&para;<br>significant part, it sought to obtain foreign intelligence&para;<br>information. Ibid. It had to demonstrate probable cause&para;<br>to believe that each specific target was “a foreign power or&para;<br>an agent of a foreign power.” §§1804(a), 1805(a). It also&para;<br>had to describe instance-specific procedures to be used&para;<br>to minimize intrusions upon Americans’ privacy (compli­&para;<br>ance with which the court subsequently could assess).&para;<br>§§1804(a), 1805(d)(3).&para;<br>The addition of §1881a in 2008 changed this prior law in&para;<br>three important ways. First, it eliminated the require­&para;<br>ment that the Government describe to the court each&para;<br>specific target and identify each facility at which its sur­&para;<br>veillance would be directed, thus permitting surveillance&para;<br>on a programmatic, not necessarily individualized, basis.&para;<br>§1881a(g). Second, it eliminated the requirement that a&para;<br>target be a “foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Third, it diminished the court’s authority to&para;<br>insist upon, and eliminated its authority to supervise,&para;<br>instance-specific privacy-intrusion minimization procedures&para;<br>(though the Government still must use court-approved&para;<br>general minimization procedures). §1881a(e). Thus, using&para;<br>the authority of §1881a, the Government can obtain court&para;<br>approval for its surveillance of electronic communications&para;<br>between places within the United States and targets in&para;<br>foreign territories by showing the court (1) that “a sig­&para;<br>nificant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign&para;<br>intelligence information,” and (2) that it will use general&para;<br>targeting and privacy-intrusion minimization procedures of&para;<br>a kind that the court had previously approved. §1881a(g).&para;<br>B&para;<br>It is similarly important to understand the kinds of&para;<br>communications in which the plaintiffs say they engage&para;<br>and which they believe the Government will intercept.&para;<br>Plaintiff Scott McKay, for example, says in an affidavit (1)&para;<br>that he is a lawyer; (2) that he represented “Mr. Sami&para;<br>Omar Al-Hussayen, who was acquitted in June 2004 on&para;<br>terrorism charges”; (3) that he continues to represent “Mr.&para;<br>Al-Hussayen, who, in addition to facing criminal charges&para;<br>after September 11, was named as a defendant in several&para;<br>civil cases”; (4) that he represents Khalid Sheik Moham­&para;<br>med, a detainee, “before the Military Commissions at&para;<br>Guantánamo Bay, Cuba”; (5) that in representing these&para;<br>clients he “communicate[s] by telephone and email with&para;<br>people outside the United States, including Mr. AlHussayen himself,” “experts, investigators, attorneys,&para;<br>family members . . . and others who are located abroad”;&para;<br>and (6) that prior to 2008 “the U. S. government had&para;<br>intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 email&para;<br>communications involving [his client] Al-Hussayen.” App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 369a–371a.&para;<br>Another plaintiff, Sylvia Royce, says in her affidavit (1)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that she is an attorney; (2) that she “represent[s] Mo­&para;<br>hammedou Ould Salahi, a prisoner who has been held at&para;<br>Guantánamo Bay as an enemy combatant”; (3) that, “[i]n&para;<br>connection with [her] representation of Mr. Salahi, [she]&para;<br>receive[s] calls from time to time from Mr. Salahi’s&para;<br>brother, . . . a university student in Germany”; and (4)&para;<br>that she has been told that the Government has threatened&para;<br>Salahi “that his family members would be arrested and mis­&para;<br>treated if he did not cooperate.” Id., at 349a–351a.&para;<br>The plaintiffs have noted that McKay no longer repre­&para;<br>sents Mohammed and Royce no longer represents Ould&para;<br>Salahi. Brief for Respondents 15, n. 11. But these changes&para;<br>are irrelevant, for we assess standing as of the time a&para;<br>suit is filed, see Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554&para;<br>U. S. 724, 734 (2008), and in any event McKay himself&para;<br>continues to represent Al Hussayen, his partner now&para;<br>represents Mohammed, and Royce continues to represent&para;<br>individuals held in the custody of the U. S. military&para;<br>overseas.&para;<br>A third plaintiff, Joanne Mariner, says in her affidavit&para;<br>(1) that she is a human rights researcher, (2) that “some of&para;<br>the work [she] do[es] involves trying to track down people&para;<br>who were rendered by the CIA to countries in which they&para;<br>were tortured”; (3) that many of those people “the CIA has&para;<br>said are (or were) associated with terrorist organizations”;&para;<br>and (4) that, to do this research, she “communicate[s] by&para;<br>telephone and e-mail with . . . former detainees, lawyers&para;<br>for detainees, relatives of detainees, political activists,&para;<br>journalists, and fixers” “all over the world, including in&para;<br>Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan, [and] the Gaza&para;<br>Strip.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 343a–344a.&para;<br>Other plaintiffs, including lawyers, journalists, and&para;<br>human rights researchers, say in affidavits (1) that they&para;<br>have jobs that require them to gather information from&para;<br>foreigners located abroad; (2) that they regularly com­&para;<br>municate electronically (e.g., by telephone or e-mail) with&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>foreigners located abroad; and (3) that in these communi­&para;<br>cations they exchange “foreign intelligence information” as&para;<br>the Act defines it. Id., at 334a–375a.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Several considerations, based upon the record along&para;<br>with commonsense inferences, convince me that there is a&para;<br>very high likelihood that Government, acting under the&para;<br>authority of §1881a, will intercept at least some of the&para;<br>communications just described. First, the plaintiffs have&para;<br>engaged, and continue to engage, in electronic communica­&para;<br>tions of a kind that the 2008 amendment, but not the prior&para;<br>Act, authorizes the Government to intercept. These com­&para;<br>munications include discussions with family members of&para;<br>those detained at Guantanamo, friends and acquaintances&para;<br>of those persons, and investigators, experts and others&para;<br>with knowledge of circumstances related to terrorist activ­&para;<br>ities. These persons are foreigners located outside the&para;<br>United States. They are not “foreign power[s]” or “agent[s]&para;<br>of . . . foreign power[s].” And the plaintiffs state that they&para;<br>exchange with these persons “foreign intelligence infor­&para;<br>mation,” defined to include information that “relates to”&para;<br>“international terrorism” and “the national defense or the&para;<br>security of the United States.” See 50 U. S. C. §1801 (2006&para;<br>ed. and Supp. V); see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 342a,&para;<br>366a, 373a–374a.&para;<br>Second, the plaintiffs have a strong motive to engage in,&para;<br>and the Government has a strong motive to listen to,&para;<br>conversations of the kind described. A lawyer represent­&para;<br>ing a client normally seeks to learn the circumstances&para;<br>surrounding the crime (or the civil wrong) of which the&para;<br>client is accused. A fair reading of the affidavit of Scott&para;<br>McKay, for example, taken together with elementary&para;<br>considerations of a lawyer’s obligation to his client, indi­&para;<br>cates that McKay will engage in conversations that con­&para;<br>cern what suspected foreign terrorists, such as his client,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>have done; in conversations that concern his clients’ fami­&para;<br>lies, colleagues, and contacts; in conversations that con­&para;<br>cern what those persons (or those connected to them) have&para;<br>said and done, at least in relation to terrorist activities; in&para;<br>conversations that concern the political, social, and com­&para;<br>mercial environments in which the suspected terrorists&para;<br>have lived and worked; and so forth. See, e.g., id., at&para;<br>373a–374a. Journalists and human rights workers have&para;<br>strong similar motives to conduct conversations of this&para;<br>kind. See, e.g., id., at 342a (Declaration of Joanne Mari­&para;<br>ner, stating that “some of the information [she] ex­&para;<br>change[s] by telephone and e-mail relates to terrorism and&para;<br>counterterrorism, and much of the information relates to&para;<br>the foreign affairs of the United States”).&para;<br>At the same time, the Government has a strong motive&para;<br>to conduct surveillance of conversations that contain&para;<br>material of this kind. The Government, after all, seeks to&para;<br>learn as much as it can reasonably learn about suspected&para;<br>terrorists (such as those detained at Guantanamo), as well&para;<br>as about their contacts and activities, along with those of&para;<br>friends and family members. See Executive Office of the&para;<br>President, Office of Management and Budget, Statement&para;<br>of Administration Policy on S. 2248, p. 4 (Dec. 17, 2007)&para;<br>(“Part of the value of the [new authority] is to enable the&para;<br>Intelligence Community to collect expeditiously the com­&para;<br>munications of terrorists in foreign countries who may&para;<br>contact an associate in the United States”). And the Gov­&para;<br>ernment is motivated to do so, not simply by the desire to&para;<br>help convict those whom the Government believes guilty,&para;<br>but also by the critical, overriding need to protect America&para;<br>from terrorism. See id., at 1 (“Protection of the American&para;<br>people and American interests at home and abroad re­&para;<br>quires access to timely, accurate, and insightful intelli­&para;<br>gence on the capabilities, intentions, and activities of . . .&para;<br>terrorists”).&para;<br>Third, the Government’s past behavior shows that it has&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sought, and hence will in all likelihood continue to seek,&para;<br>information about alleged terrorists and detainees&para;<br>through means that include surveillance of electronic&para;<br>communications. As just pointed out, plaintiff Scott&para;<br>McKay states that the Government (under the authority of&para;<br>the pre-2008 law) “intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls&para;<br>and 20,000 email communications involving [his client]&para;<br>Mr. Al-Hussayen.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a.&para;<br>Fourth, the Government has the capacity to conduct&para;<br>electronic surveillance of the kind at issue. To some de­&para;<br>gree this capacity rests upon technology available to the&para;<br>Government. See 1 D. Kris &amp; J. Wilson, National Security&para;<br>Investigations &amp; Prosecutions §16:6, p. 562 (2d ed. 2012)&para;<br>(“NSA’s technological abilities are legendary”); id., §16:12,&para;<br>at 572–577 (describing the National Security Agency’s&para;<br>capacity to monitor “very broad facilities” such as interna­&para;<br>tional switches). See, e.g., Lichtblau &amp; Risen, Spy Agency&para;<br>Mined Vast Data Trove, Officials Report, N. Y. Times, Dec.&para;<br>24, 2005, p.

A1 (reporting that&para;<br>every day, collection systems at the National Security&para;<br>Agency intercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, telephone&para;<br>calls and other types of communications).

This capacity also includes the Government’s&para;<br>authority to obtain the kind of information here at issue&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

We are further told by amici that the&para;<br>Government is expanding that capacity.

But the Gov­&para;<br>ernment rarely files requests that fail to meet the statu­&para;<br>tory criteria. See Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant&para;<br>Attorney General, to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 1 (Apr. 30,&para;<br>2012) (In 2011, of the 1,676 applications to the intelligence&para;<br>court, two were withdrawn by the Government, and the&para;<br>remaining 1,674 were approved, 30 with some mod­&para;<br>ification),&para;<br>online&para;<br>at&para;<br>http://www.justice.gov/nsd/foia/&para;<br>foia_library/2011fisa-ltr.pdf. (as visited Feb. 22, 2013, and&para;<br>available in Clerk of Court’s case file). As the intelligence&para;<br>court itself has stated, its review under §1881a is “nar­&para;<br>rowly circumscribed.” In re Proceedings Required by §702(i)&para;<br>of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08–01&para;<br>(Aug. 17, 2008), p. 3. There is no reason to believe that&para;<br>the communications described would all fail to meet the&para;<br>conditions necessary for approval. Moreover, compared&para;<br>with prior law, §1881a simplifies and thus expedites the&para;<br>approval process, making it more likely that the Govern­&para;<br>ment will use §1881a to obtain the necessary approval.&para;<br>The upshot is that (1) similarity of content, (2) strong&para;<br>motives, (3) prior behavior, and (4) capacity all point to a&para;<br>very strong likelihood that the Government will intercept&para;<br>at least some of the plaintiffs’ communications, including&para;<br>some that the 2008 amendment, §1881a, but not the pre­&para;<br>2008 Act, authorizes the Government to intercept.&para;<br>At the same time, nothing suggests the presence of some&para;<br>special factor here that might support a contrary conclu­&para;<br>sion. The Government does not deny that it has both the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>motive and the capacity to listen to communications of the&para;<br>kind described by plaintiffs. Nor does it describe any&para;<br>system for avoiding the interception of an electronic com­&para;<br>munication that happens to include a party who is an&para;<br>American lawyer, journalist, or human rights worker.&para;<br>One can, of course, always imagine some special circum­&para;<br>stance that negates a virtual likelihood, no matter how&para;<br>strong. But the same is true about most, if not all, ordi­&para;<br>nary inferences about future events. Perhaps, despite&para;<br>pouring rain, the streets will remain dry (due to the pres­&para;<br>ence of a special chemical). But ordinarily a party that&para;<br>seeks to defeat a strong natural inference must bear the&para;<br>burden of showing that some such special circumstance&para;<br>exists. And no one has suggested any such special circum­&para;<br>stance here.&para;<br>Consequently, we need only assume that the Govern­&para;<br>ment is doing its job (to find out about, and combat, terror­&para;<br>ism) in order to conclude that there is a high probability&para;<br>that the Government will intercept at least some elec­&para;<br>tronic communication to which at least some of the plaintiffs&para;<br>are parties. The majority is wrong when it describes the&para;<br>harm threatened plaintiffs as “speculative.”&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The majority more plausibly says that the plaintiffs&para;<br>have failed to show that the threatened harm is “certainly&para;<br>impending.” Ante, at 10 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). But, as the majority appears to concede, see ante, at&para;<br>15–16, and n. 5, certainty is not, and never has been, the&para;<br>touchstone of standing. The future is inherently uncer­&para;<br>tain. Yet federal courts frequently entertain actions for&para;<br>injunctions and for declaratory relief aimed at preventing&para;<br>future activities that are reasonably likely or highly likely,&para;<br>but not absolutely certain, to take place. And that degree&para;<br>of certainty is all that is needed to support standing here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Sometimes the Court has used the phrase&para;<br>“certainly impending” as if the phrase described a sufficient, rather than a necessary, condition for jurisdiction.&para;<br>See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 593&para;<br>(1923) (“If the injury is certainly impending that is&para;<br>enough”). See also Babbitt, 442 U. S., at 298 (same). On&para;<br>other occasions, it has used the phrase as if it concerned&para;<br>when, not whether, an alleged injury would occur. Thus,&para;<br>in Lujan, 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2, the Court considered a&para;<br>threatened future injury that consisted of harm that&para;<br>plaintiffs would suffer when they “soon” visited a gov­&para;<br>ernment project area that (they claimed) would suffer&para;<br>environmental damage. The Court wrote that a “mere pro­&para;<br>fession of an intent, some day, to return” to the project area&para;<br>did not show the harm was “imminent,” for “soon” might&para;<br>mean nothing more than “in this lifetime.” Id., at 564–&para;<br>565, n. 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly,&para;<br>in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93&para;<br>(2003), the Court denied standing because the Senator’s&para;<br>future injury (stemming from a campaign finance law)&para;<br>would not affect him until his reelection. That fact, the&para;<br>Court said, made the injury “too remote temporally to&para;<br>satisfy Article III standing.” Id., at 225–226.&para;<br>On still other occasions, recognizing that “ ‘ imminence’&para;<br>is concededly a somewhat elastic concept,” Lujan, supra,&para;<br>at 565, n. 2, the Court has referred to, or used (sometimes&para;<br>along with “certainly impending”) other phrases such as&para;<br>“reasonable probability” that suggest less than absolute,&para;<br>or literal certainty.

Taken together the case law uses the word “certain­&para;<br>ly” as if it emphasizes, rather than literally defines, the&para;<br>immediately following term “impending.”&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>More important, the Court’s holdings in standing cases&para;<br>show that standing exists here. The Court has often found&para;<br>standing where the occurrence of the relevant injury was&para;<br>far less certain than here. Consider a few, fairly typical,&para;<br>cases. Consider Pennell, supra. A city ordinance forbade&para;<br>landlords to raise the rent charged to a tenant by more&para;<br>than 8 percent where doing so would work an unreasona­&para;<br>bly severe hardship on that tenant. Id., at 4–5. A group of&para;<br>landlords sought a judgment declaring the ordinance&para;<br>unconstitutional. The Court held that, to have standing,&para;<br>the landlords had to demonstrate a “ ‘realistic danger of&para;<br>sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s opera­&para;<br>tion.’ ” Id., at 8 (emphasis added). It found that the land­&para;<br>lords had done so by showing a likelihood of enforcement&para;<br>and a “probability,” ibid., that the ordinance would make&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the landlords charge lower rents—even though the land­&para;<br>lords had not shown (1) that they intended to raise the&para;<br>relevant rents to the point of causing unreasonably severe&para;<br>hardship; (2) that the tenants would challenge those in­&para;<br>creases; or (3) that the city’s hearing examiners and arbi­&para;<br>trators would find against the landlords. Here, even more&para;<br>so than in Pennell, there is a “realistic danger” that the&para;<br>relevant harm will occur.&para;<br>Or, consider Blum, supra. A group of nursing home&para;<br>residents receiving Medicaid benefits challenged the con­&para;<br>stitutionality (on procedural grounds) of a regulation that&para;<br>permitted their nursing home to transfer them to a less&para;<br>desirable home. Id., at 999–1000. Although a Medicaid&para;<br>committee had recommended transfers, Medicaid-initiated&para;<br>transfer had been enjoined and the nursing home itself&para;<br>had not threatened to transfer the plaintiffs. But the&para;<br>Court found “standing” because “the threat of transfers”&para;<br>was “not ‘imaginary or speculative’ ” but “quite realistic,”&para;<br>hence “sufficiently substantial.” Id., at 1000–1001 (quot­&para;<br>ing Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 42 (1971)). The plain­&para;<br>tiffs’ injury here is not imaginary or speculative, but “quite&para;<br>realistic.”&para;<br>Or, consider Davis, supra. The plaintiff, a candidate for&para;<br>the United States House of Representatives, self-financed&para;<br>his campaigns. He challenged the constitutionality of an&para;<br>election law that relaxed the limits on an opponent’s con­&para;<br>tributions when a self-financed candidate’s spending itself&para;<br>exceeded certain other limits. His opponent, in fact, had&para;<br>decided not to take advantage of the increased contribu­&para;<br>tion limits that the statute would have allowed. Id., at&para;<br>734. But the Court nonetheless found standing because&para;<br>there was a “realistic and impending threat,” not a cer­&para;<br>tainty, that the candidate’s opponent would do so at the&para;<br>time the plaintiff filed the complaint. Id., at 734–735.&para;<br>The threat facing the plaintiffs here is as “realistic and&para;<br>impending.”&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Or, consider MedImmune, supra. The plaintiff, a patent&para;<br>licensee, sought a declaratory judgment that the patent&para;<br>was invalid. But, the plaintiff did not face an imminent&para;<br>threat of suit because it continued making royalty pay­&para;<br>ments to the patent holder. In explaining why the plain­&para;<br>tiff had standing, we (1) assumed that if the plaintiff&para;<br>stopped making royalty payments it would have standing&para;<br>(despite the fact that the patent holder might not bring&para;<br>suit), (2) rejected the Federal Circuit’s “reasonable ap­&para;<br>prehension of imminent suit” requirement, and (3) in­&para;<br>stead suggested that a “genuine threat of enforcement” was&para;<br>likely sufficient. Id., at 128, 129, 132, n. 11 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). A “genuine threat” is present&para;<br>here.&para;<br>Moreover, courts have often found probabilistic injuries&para;<br>sufficient to support standing. In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59 (1978),&para;<br>for example, the plaintiffs, a group of individuals living&para;<br>near a proposed nuclear powerplant, challenged the con­&para;<br>stitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act, a statute that&para;<br>limited the plant’s liability in the case of a nuclear acci­&para;<br>dent. The plaintiffs said that, without the Act, the de­&para;<br>fendants would not build a nuclear plant. And the building&para;<br>of the plant would harm them, in part, by emitting&para;<br>“non-natural radiation into [their] environment.” Id., at&para;<br>74. The Court found standing in part due to “our general­&para;<br>ized concern about exposure to radiation and the appre­&para;<br>hension flowing from the uncertainty about the health and&para;<br>genetic consequences of even small emissions.” Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added).

Thus, in Monsanto&para;<br>Co., 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–14) plaintiffs, a group&para;<br>of conventional alfalfa growers, challenged an agency&para;<br>decision to deregulate genetically engineered alfalfa. They&para;<br>claimed that deregulation would harm them because their&para;<br>neighbors would plant the genetically engineered seed,&para;<br>bees would obtain pollen from the neighbors’ plants, and&para;<br>the bees would then (harmfully) contaminate their own&para;<br>conventional alfalfa with the genetically modified gene.&para;<br>The lower courts had found a “reasonable probability” that&para;<br>this injury would occur. Ibid. (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Without expressing views about that probability, we&para;<br>found standing because the plaintiffs would suffer present&para;<br>harm by trying to combat the threat. Ibid. The plaintiffs,&para;<br>for example, “would have to conduct testing to find out&para;<br>whether and to what extent their crops have been contam­&para;<br>inated.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). And they would have&para;<br>to take “measures to minimize the likelihood of potential&para;<br>contamination and to ensure an adequate supply of&para;<br>non-genetically-engineered alfalfa.” Ibid. We held that these&para;<br>“harms, which [the plaintiffs] will suffer even if their crops&para;<br>are not actually infected with” the genetically modified&para;<br>gene, “are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact&para;<br>prong of the constitutional standing analysis.” Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 13).&para;<br>Virtually identical circumstances are present here.&para;<br>Plaintiff McKay, for example, points out that, when he&para;<br>communicates abroad about, or in the interests of, a client&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(e.g., a client accused of terrorism), he must “make an&para;<br>assessment” whether his “client’s interests would be com­&para;<br>promised” should the Government “acquire the communi­&para;<br>cations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. If so, he must either&para;<br>forgo the communication or travel abroad. Id., at 371a–&para;<br>372a (“I have had to take measures to protect the confi­&para;<br>dentiality of information that I believe is particularly&para;<br>sensitive,” including “travel that is both time-consuming&para;<br>and expensive”).&para;<br>Since travel is expensive, since forgoing communication&para;<br>can compromise the client’s interests, since McKay’s as­&para;<br>sessment itself takes time and effort, this case does not&para;<br>differ significantly from Monsanto. And that is so whether&para;<br>we consider the plaintiffs’ present necessary expenditure&para;<br>of time and effort as a separate concrete, particularized,&para;<br>imminent harm, or consider it as additional evidence that&para;<br>the future harm (an interception) is likely to occur. See&para;<br>also Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U. S., at 183–184 (hold­&para;<br>ing that plaintiffs who curtailed their recreational activi­&para;<br>ties on a river due to reasonable concerns about the effect&para;<br>of pollutant discharges into that river had standing);&para;<br>Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 475 (1987) (stating that “the&para;<br>need to take . . . affirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm&para;<br>. . . constitutes a cognizable injury”).&para;<br>3&para;<br>The majority cannot find support in cases that use the&para;<br>words “certainly impending” to deny standing. While I do&para;<br>not claim to have read every standing case, I have exam­&para;<br>ined quite a few, and not yet found any such case. The&para;<br>majority refers to Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149&para;<br>(1990). But in that case the Court denied standing to a&para;<br>prisoner who challenged the validity of a death sentence&para;<br>given to a different prisoner who refused to challenge his&para;<br>own sentence. The plaintiff feared that in the absence of&para;<br>an appeal, his fellow prisoner’s death sentence would be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>missing from the State’s death penalty database and&para;<br>thereby skew the database against him, making it less&para;<br>likely his challenges to his own death penalty would suc­&para;<br>ceed. The Court found no standing. Id., at 161. But the&para;<br>fellow prisoner’s lack of appeal would have harmed the&para;<br>plaintiff only if (1) the plaintiff separately obtained federal&para;<br>habeas relief and was then reconvicted and resentenced to&para;<br>death, (2) he sought review of his new sentence, and (3)&para;<br>during that review, his death sentence was affirmed only&para;<br>because it was compared to an artificially skewed data­&para;<br>base. Id., at 156–157. These events seemed not very&para;<br>likely to occur.&para;<br>In DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332 (2006),&para;<br>taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a tax break&para;<br>offered by state and local governments to a car manufac­&para;<br>turer. We found no standing. But the plaintiffs would&para;<br>have suffered resulting injury only if that the tax break&para;<br>had depleted state and local treasuries and the legislature&para;<br>had responded by raising their taxes. Id., at 344.&para;<br>In Lujan, the case that may come closest to supporting&para;<br>the majority, the Court also found no standing. But, as I&para;<br>pointed out, supra, at 11, Lujan is a case where the Court&para;<br>considered when, not whether, the threatened harm would&para;<br>occur. 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2. The relevant injury there&para;<br>consisted of a visit by environmental group’s members to a&para;<br>project site where they would find (unlawful) environmen­&para;<br>tal depredation. Id., at 564. The Court pointed out that&para;<br>members had alleged that they would visit the project&para;<br>sites “soon.” But it wrote that “soon” might refer to almost&para;<br>any time in the future. Ibid., n. 2. By way of contrast, the&para;<br>ongoing threat of terrorism means that here the relevant&para;<br>interceptions will likely take place imminently, if not now.&para;<br>The Court has, of course, denied standing in other cases.&para;<br>But they involve injuries less likely, not more likely, to&para;<br>occur than here. In a recent case, Summers v. Earth&para;<br>Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488 (2009), for example, the&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>plaintiffs challenged a regulation exempting certain tim­&para;<br>ber sales from public comment and administrative appeal.&para;<br>The plaintiffs claimed that the regulations injured them&para;<br>by interfering with their esthetic enjoyment and recrea­&para;<br>tional use of the forests. The Court found this harm too&para;<br>unlikely to occur to support standing. Id., at 496. The&para;<br>Court noted that one plaintiff had not pointed to a specific&para;<br>affected forest that he would visit. The Court concluded&para;<br>that “[t]here may be a chance, but . . . hardly a likelihood,”&para;<br>that the plaintiff ’s “wanderings will bring him to a parcel&para;<br>about to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the&para;<br>regulations.” Id., at 495 (emphasis added).&para;<br>4&para;<br>In sum, as the Court concedes, see ante, at 15–16, and&para;<br>n. 5, the word “certainly” in the phrase “certainly impend­&para;<br>ing” does not refer to absolute certainty. As our case law&para;<br>demonstrates, what the Constitution requires is some­&para;<br>thing more akin to “reasonable probability” or “high prob­&para;<br>ability.” The use of some such standard is all that is&para;<br>necessary here to ensure the actual concrete injury that&para;<br>the Constitution demands. The considerations set forth in&para;<br>Parts II and III, supra, make clear that the standard is&para;<br>readily met in this case.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>While I express no view on the merits of the plaintiffs’&para;<br>constitutional claims, I do believe that at least some of the&para;<br>plaintiffs have standing to make those claims. I dissent,&para;<br>with respect, from the majority’s contrary conclusion.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
