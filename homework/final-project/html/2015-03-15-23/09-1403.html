ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1403. Argued April 25, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011&para;<br>Petitioner Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a&para;<br>putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co.&para;<br>and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton). EPJ Fund alleges&para;<br>that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate&para;<br>the company’s stock price, in violation of §10(b) of the Securities Ex&para;<br>change Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule&para;<br>10b–5. EPJ Fund also contends that Halliburton later made a num&para;<br>ber of corrective disclosures that caused the stock price to drop and,&para;<br>consequently, investors to lose money. EPJ Fund sought to have its&para;<br>proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure&para;<br>23. The District Court found that the suit could proceed as a class&para;<br>action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Fifth Circuit prece&para;<br>dent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove “loss causation”—&para;<br>i.e., that the defendant’s deceptive conduct caused the investors’&para;<br>claimed economic loss—in order to obtain class certification. The&para;<br>District Court concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to satisfy that re&para;<br>quirement. The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed the denial of&para;<br>class certification.&para;<br>Held: Securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation in order&para;<br>to obtain class certification. Pp. 3–10.&para;<br>(a) In order to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a court must find&para;<br>“that the questions of law or fact common to class members predomi&para;<br>nate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that&para;<br>a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and ef&para;<br>ficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Considering whether “ques&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tions of law or fact common to class members predominate” begins, of&para;<br>course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action. The ele&para;<br>ments of a private securities fraud claim based on violations of §10(b)&para;<br>and Rule 10b–5 are: “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by&para;<br>the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresen&para;<br>tation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance&para;<br>upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6)&para;<br>loss causation.” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___.&para;<br>Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in such an&para;<br>action often turns on the element of reliance. The traditional way a&para;<br>plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of&para;<br>a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction—e.g.,&para;<br>purchasing common stock—based on that specific misrepresentation.&para;<br>The Court recognized in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, how&para;<br>ever, that “[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance from each&para;<br>member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would” prevent such&para;<br>plaintiffs “from proceeding with a class action, since individual is&para;<br>sues” would “overwhelm[ ] the common ones.” Id., at 242. The Court&para;<br>in Basic sought to alleviate that concern by permitting plaintiffs to&para;<br>invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on what is known&para;<br>as the “fraud-on-the-market” theory. According to that theory, “the&para;<br>market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all&para;<br>publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepre&para;<br>sentations.” Id., at 246. Under that doctrine, the Court explained,&para;<br>one can assume an investor relies on public misstatements whenever&para;<br>he “buys or sells stock at the price set by the market.” Id., at 247.&para;<br>The Court also made clear that the presumption could be rebutted by&para;<br>appropriate evidence. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>(b) It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove cer&para;<br>tain things in order to invoke Basic’s rebuttable presumption of reli&para;<br>ance. According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund had to prove the&para;<br>separate element of loss causation in order to trigger the presump&para;<br>tion. That requirement is not justified by Basic or its logic. This&para;<br>Court has never mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invok&para;<br>ing Basic’s rebuttable presumption. Loss causation addresses a mat&para;<br>ter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,&para;<br>presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.&para;<br>The Court has referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule&para;<br>10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss causation. Dura&para;<br>Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342. Consistent&para;<br>with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied&para;<br>on a misrepresentation, the Court has typically focused on facts sur&para;<br>rounding the investor’s decision to engage in the transaction. Loss&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that the misrepre&para;<br>sentation caused a subsequent economic loss. That has nothing to do&para;<br>with whether an investor relied on that misrepresentation in the first&para;<br>place, either directly or through the fraud-on-the-market theory. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ rule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—&para;<br>that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long&para;<br>as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.&para;<br>Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(c) Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not&para;<br>be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke Basic’s pre&para;<br>sumption of reliance. Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment&para;<br>below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually re&para;<br>quire EPJ Fund to prove “loss causation” as the Court has used that&para;<br>term. According to Halliburton, “loss causation” was shorthand for a&para;<br>different analysis. The lower court’s actual inquiry, Halliburton in&para;<br>sists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated “price impact”—that&para;<br>is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price&para;<br>in the first place.&para;<br>The Court does not accept Halliburton’s interpretation of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals’ opinion. Loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept&para;<br>in securities law; it is not price impact. Whatever Halliburton thinks&para;<br>the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.&para;<br>The Court takes the Court of Appeals at its word.

EPJ Fund contends that&para;<br>Halliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures&para;<br>that caused its stock price to drop and, consequently,&para;<br>investors to lose money.&para;<br>After defeating a motion to dismiss, EPJ Fund sought to&para;<br>have its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule&para;<br>of Civil Procedure 23. The parties agreed, and the District&para;<br>Court held, that EPJ Fund satisfied the general require&para;<br>ments for class actions set out in Rule 23(a): The class was&para;<br>sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of&para;<br>law or fact, the claims of the representative parties were&para;<br>typical, and the representative parties would fairly and&para;<br>adequately protect the interests of the class. See App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 3a.&para;<br>The District Court also found that the action could&para;<br>proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one&para;<br>problem: Circuit precedent required securities fraud plain&para;<br>tiffs to prove “loss causation” in order to obtain class certi&para;<br>fication. Id., at 4a, and n. 2 (citing Oscar Private Equity&para;<br>Invs. v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., 487 F. 3d 261, 269 (CA5&para;<br>2007)).

After&para;<br>reviewing the alleged misrepresentations and corrective&para;<br>disclosures, the District Court concluded that it could not&para;<br>certify the class in this case because EPJ Fund had “failed&para;<br>to establish loss causation with respect to any” of its&para;<br>claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. The court made clear,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>however, that absent “this stringent loss causation re&para;<br>quirement,” it would have granted the Fund’s certification&para;<br>request. Ibid.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of class certifi&para;<br>cation. See 597 F. 3d 330 (CA5 2010).

Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals con&para;<br>cluded that EPJ Fund had failed to meet the “require&para;<br>ments for proving loss causation at the class certification&para;<br>stage.” Id., at 344.&para;<br>We granted the Fund’s petition for certiorari, 562 U.

We&para;<br>agree.&para;<br>A&para;<br>As noted, the sole dispute here is whether EPJ Fund&para;<br>satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(3). In order to&para;<br>certify a class under that Rule, a court must find “that the&para;<br>questions of law or fact common to class members pre&para;<br>dominate over any questions affecting only individual&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ERICA P.

Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). Consider&para;<br>ing whether “questions of law or fact common to class&para;<br>members predominate” begins, of course, with the ele&para;<br>ments of the underlying cause of action. The elements of a&para;<br>private securities fraud claim based on violations of §10(b)&para;<br>and Rule 10b–5 are: “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or&para;<br>omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection&para;<br>between the misrepresentation or omission and the pur&para;<br>chase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss&para;<br>causation.’ ” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting Stoneridge&para;<br>Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552&para;<br>U. S. 148, 157 (2008)).&para;<br>Whether common questions of law or fact predominate&para;<br>in a securities fraud action often turns on the element of&para;<br>reliance. The courts below determined that EPJ Fund had&para;<br>to prove the separate element of loss causation in order to&para;<br>establish that reliance was capable of resolution on a&para;<br>common, classwide basis.&para;<br>“Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive&para;<br>acts is an essential element of the §10(b) private cause of&para;<br>action.” Stoneridge, supra, at 159. This is because proof of&para;<br>reliance ensures that there is a proper “connection be&para;<br>tween a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s&para;<br>injury.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 243 (1988).&para;<br>The traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can&para;<br>demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware&para;<br>of a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant&para;<br>transaction—e.g., purchasing common stock—based on&para;<br>that specific misrepresentation. In that situation, the&para;<br>plaintiff plainly would have relied on the company’s decep&para;<br>tive conduct. A plaintiff unaware of the relevant state&para;<br>ment, on the other hand, could not establish reliance on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that basis.&para;<br>We recognized in Basic, however, that limiting proof of&para;<br>reliance in such a way “would place an unnecessarily&para;<br>unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b–5 plaintiff&para;<br>who has traded on an impersonal market.” Id., at 245.&para;<br>We also observed that “[r]equiring proof of individualized&para;<br>reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class&para;<br>effectively would” prevent such plaintiffs “from proceeding&para;<br>with a class action, since individual issues” would “over&para;<br>whelm[ ] the common ones.” Id., at 242.&para;<br>The Court in Basic sought to alleviate those related&para;<br>concerns by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable&para;<br>presumption of reliance based on what is known as the&para;<br>“fraud-on-the-market” theory. According to that theory,&para;<br>“the market price of shares traded on well-developed&para;<br>markets reflects all publicly available information, and,&para;<br>hence, any material misrepresentations.” Id., at 246.&para;<br>Because the market “transmits information to the investor&para;<br>in the processed form of a market price,” we can assume,&para;<br>the Court explained, that an investor relies on public&para;<br>misstatements whenever he “buys or sells stock at the&para;<br>price set by the market.” Id., at 244, 247 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted); see also Stoneridge, supra, at 159;&para;<br>Dura Pharmaceuticals, 544 U. S., at 341–342. The Court&para;<br>also made clear that the presumption was just that, and&para;<br>could be rebutted by appropriate evidence. See Basic,&para;<br>supra, at 248.&para;<br>B&para;<br>It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must&para;<br>prove certain things in order to invoke Basic’s rebuttable&para;<br>presumption of reliance. It is common ground, for exam&para;<br>ple, that plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged&para;<br>misrepresentations were publicly known (else how would&para;<br>the market take them into account?), that the stock traded&para;<br>in an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>took place “between the time the misrepresentations were&para;<br>made and the time the truth was revealed.” Basic, 485&para;<br>U. S., at 248, n. 27; id., at 241–247; see also Stoneridge,&para;<br>supra, at 159.&para;<br>According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund also had to&para;<br>establish loss causation at the certification stage to “trig&para;<br>ger the fraud-on-the-market presumption.” 597 F. 3d, at&para;<br>335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ibid. (EPJ&para;<br>Fund must “establish a causal link between the alleged&para;<br>falsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the fraud-on&para;<br>the-market presumption”). The court determined that, in&para;<br>order to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance, EPJ&para;<br>Fund needed to prove that the decline in Halliburton’s&para;<br>stock was “because of the correction to a prior misleading&para;<br>statement” and “that the subsequent loss could not other&para;<br>wise be explained by some additional factors revealed then&para;<br>to the market.” Id., at 336 (emphasis deleted). This is the&para;<br>loss causation requirement as we have described it. See&para;<br>Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 342; see also 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§78u–4(b)(4).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ requirement is not justified by&para;<br>Basic or its logic. To begin, we have never before men&para;<br>tioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking Basic’s&para;<br>rebuttable presumption of reliance. The term “loss causa&para;<br>tion” does not even appear in our Basic opinion. And for&para;<br>good reason: Loss causation addresses a matter different&para;<br>from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,&para;<br>presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a&para;<br>stock.&para;<br>We have referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule 10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss&para;<br>causation. Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 341–342&para;<br>(citing Basic, supra, at 248–249). Consistent with that&para;<br>description, when considering whether a plaintiff has&para;<br>relied on a misrepresentation, we have typically focused&para;<br>on facts surrounding the investor’s decision to engage in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the transaction. See Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at&para;<br>342. Under Basic’s fraud-on-the-market doctrine, an in&para;<br>vestor presumptively relies on a defendant’s misrepre&para;<br>sentation if that “information is reflected in [the] market&para;<br>price” of the stock at the time of the relevant transaction.&para;<br>See Basic, 485 U. S., at 247.&para;<br>Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show&para;<br>that a misrepresentation that affected the integrity of the&para;<br>market price also caused a subsequent economic loss. As&para;<br>we made clear in Dura Pharmaceuticals, the fact that a&para;<br>stock’s “price on the date of purchase was inflated because&para;<br>of [a] misrepresentation” does not necessarily mean that&para;<br>the misstatement is the cause of a later decline in value.&para;<br>544 U. S., at 342 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). We observed that the drop could instead&para;<br>be the result of other intervening causes, such as “changed&para;<br>economic circumstances, changed investor expectations,&para;<br>new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or&para;<br>other events.” Id., at 342–343. If one of those factors were&para;<br>responsible for the loss or part of it, a plaintiff would not&para;<br>be able to prove loss causation to that extent. This is true&para;<br>even if the investor purchased the stock at a distorted&para;<br>price, and thereby presumptively relied on the misrepre&para;<br>sentation reflected in that price.&para;<br>According to the Court of Appeals, however, an inability&para;<br>to prove loss causation would prevent a plaintiff from&para;<br>invoking the rebuttable presumption of reliance. Such a&para;<br>rule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—that an&para;<br>investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so&para;<br>long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of&para;<br>his transaction. The fact that a subsequent loss may have&para;<br>been caused by factors other than the revelation of a mis&para;<br>representation has nothing to do with whether an investor&para;<br>relied on the misrepresentation in the first place, either&para;<br>directly or presumptively through the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>theory. Loss causation has no logical connection to the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>facts necessary to establish the efficient market predicate&para;<br>to the fraud-on-the-market theory.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund&para;<br>to show loss causation as a condition of obtaining class&para;<br>certification.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs&para;<br>should not be required to prove loss causation in order to&para;<br>invoke Basic’s presumption of reliance or otherwise&para;<br>achieve class certification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–29.&para;<br>Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on&para;<br>the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually&para;<br>require plaintiffs to prove “loss causation” as we have used&para;<br>that term. See id., at 27 (“it’s not loss causation as this&para;<br>Court knows it in Dura”). According to Halliburton, “loss&para;<br>causation” was merely “shorthand” for a different analysis.&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 18. The lower court’s actual in&para;<br>quiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had&para;<br>demonstrated “price impact”—that is, whether the alleged&para;<br>misrepresentations affected the market price in the first&para;<br>place. See, e.g., id., at 16–19, 24–27, 50–51; see also Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 27 (stating that the Court of Appeals’ “test is&para;<br>simply price impact” and that EPJ Fund’s “only burden&para;<br>under the Fifth Circuit case law was to show price&para;<br>impact”).*&para;<br>“Price impact” simply refers to the effect of a misrepre&para;<br>sentation on a stock price. Halliburton’s theory is that if a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Halliburton further concedes that, even if its conception of what the&para;<br>Court of Appeals meant by “loss causation” is correct, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals erred by placing the initial burden on EPJ Fund. See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 29 (“We agree . . . that the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden&para;<br>of production on the plaintiff, and that’s contrary to Basic”). According&para;<br>to Halliburton, a plaintiff must prove price impact only after Basic’s&para;<br>presumption has been successfully rebutted by the defendant. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 28, 38–40. We express no views on the merits of such a&para;<br>framework.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>misrepresentation does not affect market price, an inves&para;<br>tor cannot be said to have relied on the misrepresentation&para;<br>merely because he purchased stock at that price. If the&para;<br>price is unaffected by the fraud, the price does not reflect&para;<br>the fraud.&para;<br>We do not accept Halliburton’s wishful interpretation of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals’ opinion. As we have explained, loss&para;<br>causation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities&para;<br>law; it is not price impact. While the opinion below may&para;<br>include some language consistent with a “price impact”&para;<br>approach, see, e.g., 597 F. 3d, at 336, we simply cannot&para;<br>ignore the Court of Appeals’ repeated and explicit refer&para;<br>ences to “loss causation,” see id., at 334 (three times), 334&para;<br>n. 2, 335, 335 n. 10 (twice), 335 n. 11, 336, 336 n. 19, 336&para;<br>n. 20, 337, 338, 341 (twice), 341 n. 46, 342 n. 47, 343, 344&para;<br>(three times).&para;<br>Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals&para;<br>meant to say, what it said was loss causation: “[EPJ Fund]&para;<br>was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the cor&para;<br>rected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the&para;<br>stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.” 597 F. 3d, at&para;<br>334; see id., at 335 (“we require plaintiffs to establish loss&para;<br>causation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>presumption” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We&para;<br>take the Court of Appeals at its word. Based on those&para;<br>words, the decision below cannot stand.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Because we conclude the Court of Appeals erred by&para;<br>requiring EPJ Fund to prove loss causation at the certifi&para;<br>cation stage, we need not, and do not, address any other&para;<br>question about Basic, its presumption, or how and when it&para;<br>may be rebutted. To the extent Halliburton has preserved&para;<br>any further arguments against class certification, they&para;<br>may be addressed in the first instance by the Court of&para;<br>Appeals on remand.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
