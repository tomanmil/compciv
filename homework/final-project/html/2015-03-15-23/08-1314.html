Argued November 3, 2010—Decided February 23, 2011&para;<br>The 1989 version of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208&para;<br>(FMVSS 208) requires, as relevant here, auto manufacturers to in&para;<br>stall seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles. They must in&para;<br>stall lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicle’s doors or&para;<br>frames, but may install either those belts or simple lap belts on rear&para;<br>inner seats, e.g., those next to a minivan’s aisle.&para;<br>The Williamson family and Thanh Williamson’s estate brought this&para;<br>California tort suit, claiming that Thanh died in an accident because&para;<br>the rear aisle seat of the Mazda minivan in which she was riding had&para;<br>a lap belt instead of lap-and-shoulder belts. The state trial court&para;<br>dismissed their claim on the pleadings. The State Court of Appeal af&para;<br>firmed, relying on Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,&para;<br>in which this Court found that an earlier (1984) version of FMVSS&para;<br>208—which required installation of passive restraint devices—pre&para;<br>empted a state tort suit against an auto manufacturer on a failure to&para;<br>install airbags.&para;<br>Held: FMVSS 208 does not pre-empt state tort suits claiming that&para;<br>manufacturers should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts, instead&para;<br>of lap belts, on rear inner seats. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) Because this case involves (1) the same statute as Geier, (2) a&para;<br>later version of the same regulation, and (3) a somewhat similar&para;<br>claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation, the&para;<br>answers to two of the subsidiary questions posed in Geier apply di&para;<br>rectly here. Thus, the statute’s express pre-emption clause cannot&para;<br>pre-empt the common-law tort action here; but neither can its saving&para;<br>clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict pre-emption&para;<br>principles. The Court consequently turns to Geier’s third subsidiary&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>question, whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the fed&para;<br>eral regulation. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>(b) Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that&para;<br>“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment” of a federal law is pre&para;<br>empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67. In Geier, the state&para;<br>law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant fed&para;<br>eral regulatory objective, namely, giving manufacturers a choice&para;<br>among different kinds of passive restraint systems. This conclusion&para;<br>was supported by the regulation’s history, the agency’s contempora&para;<br>neous explanation, and the Government’s current understanding of&para;<br>the regulation. The history showed that the Department of Trans&para;<br>portation (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manufactur&para;<br>ers with a choice of systems. DOT’s contemporaneous explanation of&para;<br>the regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an impor&para;<br>tant means for achieving DOT’s basic objectives. It phased in passive&para;<br>restraint requirements to give manufacturers time to improve airbag&para;<br>technology and develop better systems; it worried that requiring air&para;<br>bags would cause a public backlash; and it was concerned about air&para;<br>bag safety and cost. Finally, the Government’s current understand&para;<br>ing was that a tort suit insisting upon airbag use would “ ‘ “stan[d] as&para;<br>an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objec&para;<br>tives.” ’ ” 529 U. S., at 883. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(c) Like the regulation in Geier, the instant regulation leaves the&para;<br>manufacturer with a choice, and the tort suit here would restrict that&para;<br>choice. But in contrast to Geier, the choice here is not a significant&para;<br>regulatory objective. The regulation’s history resembles the history&para;<br>of airbags to some degree. DOT rejected a regulation requiring lap&para;<br>and-shoulder belts in rear seats in 1984. But by 1989, changed cir&para;<br>cumstances led DOT to require manufacturers to install lap-and&para;<br>shoulder belts for rear outer seats but to retain a manufacturer&para;<br>choice for rear inner seats. Its reasons for doing so differed consid&para;<br>erably from its 1984 reasons for permitting a choice of passive re&para;<br>straint. It was not concerned about consumer acceptance; it thought&para;<br>that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety and did not pose&para;<br>additional safety risks; and it was not seeking to use the regulation to&para;<br>spur development of alternative safety devices. Instead, DOT&para;<br>thought that the requirement would not be cost effective. That fact&para;<br>alone cannot show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort suits.&para;<br>For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would remain frozen.&para;<br>For another, many federal safety regulations embody a cost&para;<br>effectiveness judgment. To infer pre-emptive intent from the mere&para;<br>existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment would eliminate the&para;<br>possibility that the agency seeks only to set forth a minimum stan&para;<br>dard. Finally, the Solicitor General represents that DOT’s regulation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>does not pre-empt this tort suit. As in Geier, “the agency’s own views&para;<br>should make a difference,” 529 U. S., at 883, and DOT has not ex&para;<br>pressed inconsistent views on this subject. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>167 Cal. App. 4th 905, 84 Cal.

They must install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats&para;<br>next to a vehicle’s doors or frames. But they have a choice&para;<br>about what to install on rear inner seats (say, middle seats&para;<br>or those next to a minivan’s aisle). There they can install&para;<br>either (1) simple lap belts or (2) lap-and-shoulder belts. 54&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 46257–46258 (1989); 49 CFR §571.208 (1993),&para;<br>promulgated pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor&para;<br>Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1381 et seq. (1988 ed.) (recodified without substantive&para;<br>change at 49 U. S. C. §30101 et seq. (2006 ed.)).&para;<br>The question presented here is whether this federal&para;<br>regulation pre-empts a state tort suit that, if successful,&para;<br>would deny manufacturers a choice of belts for rear inner&para;<br>seats by imposing tort liability upon those who choose to&para;<br>install a simple lap belt. We conclude that providing&para;<br>manufacturers with this seatbelt choice is not a significant&para;<br>objective of the federal regulation. Consequently, the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>regulation does not pre-empt the state tort suit.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 2002, the Williamson family, riding in their 1993&para;<br>Mazda minivan, was struck head on by another vehicle.&para;<br>Thanh Williamson was sitting in a rear aisle seat, wearing&para;<br>a lap belt; she died in the accident. Delbert and Alexa&para;<br>Williamson were wearing lap-and-shoulder belts; they&para;<br>survived. They, along with Thanh’s estate, subsequently&para;<br>brought this California tort suit against Mazda. They&para;<br>claimed that Mazda should have installed lap-and&para;<br>shoulder belts on rear aisle seats, and that Thanh died&para;<br>because Mazda equipped her seat with a lap belt instead.&para;<br>The California trial court dismissed this tort claim on&para;<br>the basis of the pleadings. And the California Court of&para;<br>Appeal affirmed. The appeals court noted that in Geier v.&para;<br>American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), this&para;<br>Court considered whether a different portion of (an older&para;<br>version of) Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208&para;<br>(FMVSS 208)—a portion that required installation of&para;<br>passive restraint devices—pre-empted a state tort suit&para;<br>that sought to hold an auto manufacturer liable for failure&para;<br>to install a particular kind of passive restraint, namely,&para;<br>airbags. We found that the federal regulation intended to&para;<br>assure manufacturers that they would retain a choice of&para;<br>installing any of several different passive restraint de&para;<br>vices. And the regulation sought to assure them that they&para;<br>would not have to exercise this choice in favor of airbags.&para;<br>For that reason we thought that the federal regulation&para;<br>pre-empted a state tort suit that, by premising tort liabil&para;<br>ity on a failure to install airbags, would have deprived the&para;<br>manufacturers of the choice that the federal regulation&para;<br>had assured them. Id., at 874–875.&para;<br>The court saw considerable similarity between this case&para;<br>and Geier. The federal regulation at issue here gives&para;<br>manufacturers a choice among two different kinds of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>seatbelts for rear inner seats. And a state lawsuit that&para;<br>premises tort liability on a failure to install a particular&para;<br>kind of seatbelt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, would in&para;<br>effect deprive the manufacturer of that choice. The court&para;<br>concluded that, as in Geier, the federal regulation pre&para;<br>empts the state tort suit. 167 Cal. App. 4th 905, 84 Cal.&para;<br>Rptr. 3d 545 (2008).&para;<br>The Williamsons sought certiorari. And we granted&para;<br>certiorari in light of the fact that several courts have&para;<br>interpreted Geier as indicating that FMVSS 208 pre-empts&para;<br>state tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have&para;<br>installed lap-and-shoulder belts, not lap belts, on rear&para;<br>inner seats. Carden v. General Motors Corp., 509 F. 3d&para;<br>227 (CA5 2007); Roland v. General Motors Corp., 881 N. E.&para;<br>2d 722 (Ind. App. 2008); Heinricher v. Volvo Car Corp., 61&para;<br>Mass. App. 313, 809 N. E. 2d 1094 (2004).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In Geier, we considered a portion of an earlier (1984)&para;<br>version of FMVSS 208. That regulation required manu&para;<br>facturers to equip their vehicles with passive restraint&para;<br>systems, thereby providing occupants with automatic&para;<br>accident protection. 49 Fed. Reg. 28983 (1984). But that&para;<br>regulation also gave manufacturers a choice among sev&para;<br>eral different passive restraint systems, including airbags&para;<br>and automatic seatbelts. Id., at 28996. The question&para;<br>before the Court was whether the Act, together with the&para;<br>regulation, pre-empted a state tort suit that would have&para;<br>held a manufacturer liable for not installing airbags. 529&para;<br>U. S., at 865. By requiring manufacturers to install air&para;<br>bags (in order to avoid tort liability) the tort suit would&para;<br>have deprived the manufacturers of the choice among&para;<br>passive restraint systems that the federal regulation gave&para;<br>them. See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical&para;<br>Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 713 (1985) (“[S]tate laws&para;<br>can be pre-empted by federal regulations as well as by&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal statutes”).&para;<br>We divided this basic pre-emption question into three&para;<br>subsidiary questions. 529 U. S., at 867. First, we asked&para;<br>whether the statute’s express pre-emption provision pre&para;<br>empted the state tort suit. That statutory clause says that&para;<br>“no State” may “establish, or . . . continue in effect . . . any&para;<br>safety standard applicable to the same aspect of perform&para;<br>ance” of a motor vehicle or item of equipment “which is not&para;<br>identical to the Federal standard.” 15 U. S. C. §1392(d)&para;<br>(1988 ed.) (emphasis added). We had previously held that&para;<br>a word somewhat similar to “standard,” namely, “require&para;<br>ments” (found in a similar statute) included within its&para;<br>scope state “common-law duties,” such as duties created by&para;<br>state tort law. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 502–&para;<br>503 (1996) (plurality opinion); id., at 503–505 (BREYER, J.,&para;<br>concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at&para;<br>509–512 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting&para;<br>in part). But we nonetheless held that the state tort suit&para;<br>in question fell outside the scope of this particular pre&para;<br>emption clause. That is primarily because the statute also&para;<br>contains a saving clause, which says that “[c]ompliance&para;<br>with” a federal safety standard “does not exempt any&para;<br>person from any liability under common law.” 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1397(k) (emphasis added). Since tort law is ordinarily&para;<br>“common law,” we held that “the presence of the saving&para;<br>clause,” makes clear that Congress intended state tort&para;<br>suits to fall outside the scope of the express pre-emption&para;<br>clause. Geier, 529 U. S., at 868.&para;<br>Second, we asked the converse question: The saving&para;<br>clause at least removes tort actions from the scope of the&para;<br>express pre-emption clause. Id., at 869. But does it do&para;<br>more? Does it foreclose or limit “the operation of ordinary&para;<br>pre-emption principles insofar as those principles instruct&para;<br>us to read” federal statutes as pre-empting state laws&para;<br>(including state common-law standards) that “actually&para;<br>conflict” with the federal statutes (or related regulations)?&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded&para;<br>that the saving clause does not foreclose or limit the op&para;<br>eration of “ordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in&para;<br>longstanding precedent.” Id., at 874.&para;<br>These two holdings apply directly to the case before us.&para;<br>We here consider (1) the same statute, 15 U. S. C. §1381 et&para;<br>seq.; (2) a later version of the same regulation, FMVSS&para;<br>208; and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort&para;<br>action conflicts with the federal regulation. In light of&para;<br>Geier, the statute’s express pre-emption clause cannot pre&para;<br>empt the common-law tort action; but neither can the&para;<br>statute’s saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of&para;<br>ordinary conflict pre-emption principles. We consequently&para;<br>turn our attention to Geier’s third subsidiary question,&para;<br>whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the&para;<br>federal regulation.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state&para;<br>law that “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and&para;<br>execution of the full purposes and objectives” of a federal&para;<br>law is pre-empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67&para;<br>(1941). See ibid. (federal statute can pre-empt a state&para;<br>statute); Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504&para;<br>(1992) (federal statute can pre-empt a state tort suit);&para;<br>Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S.&para;<br>141 (1982) (federal regulation can pre-empt a state stat&para;<br>ute); Geier, supra (federal regulation can pre-empt a state&para;<br>tort suit). In Geier we found that the state law stood as an&para;<br>“ ‘obstacle’ to the accomplishment” of a significant federal&para;<br>regulatory objective, namely, the maintenance of manufac&para;<br>turer choice. 529 U. S., at 886. We must decide whether&para;<br>the same is true here.&para;<br>A&para;<br>At the heart of Geier lies our determination that giving&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>auto manufacturers a choice among different kinds&para;<br>of passive restraint devices was a significant objective of&para;<br>the federal regulation. We reached this conclusion on&para;<br>the basis of our examination of the regulation, including&para;<br>its history, the promulgating agency’s contemporaneous&para;<br>explanation of its objectives, and the agency’s current&para;<br>views of the regulation’s pre-emptive effect.&para;<br>The history showed that the Department of Transporta&para;<br>tion (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manu&para;<br>facturers with a choice. In 1967 DOT required manufac&para;<br>turers to install manual seat belts. Geier, supra, at 875;&para;<br>32 Fed. Reg. 2408, 2415 (1967). Because many car occu&para;<br>pants did not “buckle up,” DOT began to require passive&para;<br>protection, such as airbags or automatic seatbelts, but&para;<br>without “favor[ing] or “expect[ing]” the use of airbags.&para;<br>Geier, supra, at 875 (internal quotation marks omitted); 35&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 16927 (1970). DOT subsequently approved the&para;<br>use of ignition interlocks, which froze the ignition until the&para;<br>occupant buckled the belt, as a substitute for passive&para;<br>restraints. Geier, supra, at 876; 37 Fed. Reg. 3911 (1972).&para;<br>But the interlock devices were unpopular with the public,&para;<br>and Congress soon forbade the agency to make them a&para;<br>means of compliance. Geier, supra, at 876; Motor Vehicle&para;<br>and Schoolbus Safety Amendments of 1974, §109, 88 Stat.&para;<br>1482 (previously codified at 15 U. S. C. §1410(b) (1988&para;<br>ed.)). DOT then temporarily switched to the use of dem&para;<br>onstration projects, but later it returned to mandating&para;<br>passive restraints, again leaving manufacturers with a&para;<br>choice of systems. Geier, supra, at 876–877; see 49 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 28962 (1984).&para;<br>DOT’s contemporaneous explanation of its 1984 regula&para;<br>tion made clear that manufacturer choice was an impor&para;<br>tant means for achieving its basic objectives. The 1984&para;<br>regulation gradually phased in passive restraint require&para;<br>ments, initially requiring manufacturers to equip only&para;<br>10% of their new fleets with passive restraints. DOT&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>explained that it intended its phasing period partly to give&para;<br>manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and to&para;<br>develop “other, better” passive restraint systems. Geier,&para;<br>529 U. S., at 879. DOT further explained that it had&para;<br>rejected an “ ‘all airbag’ ” system. Ibid. It was worried&para;<br>that requiring airbags in most or all vehicles would cause&para;<br>a public backlash, like the backlash against interlock&para;<br>devices. Ibid. DOT also had concerns about the safety of&para;<br>airbags, for they could injure out-of-place occupants, par&para;<br>ticularly children. Id., at 877–878. And, given the cost of&para;<br>airbags, vehicle owners might not replace them when&para;<br>necessary, leaving occupants without passive protection.&para;<br>Ibid. The regulation therefore “deliberately sought vari&para;<br>ety—a mix of several different passive restraint systems.”&para;<br>Id., at 878. DOT hoped that this mix would lead to better&para;<br>information about the devices’ comparative effectiveness&para;<br>and to the eventual development of “alternative, cheaper,&para;<br>and safer passive restraint systems.” Id., at 879.&para;<br>Finally, the Solicitor General told us that a tort suit that&para;<br>insisted upon use of airbags, as opposed to other federally&para;<br>permissible passive restraint systems, would “stan[d] as&para;<br>an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these&para;<br>objectives.” Id., at 883 (quoting Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.,&para;<br>O. T. 1999, No. 98–1811, pp. 25–26 (hereinafter United&para;<br>States Brief in Geier) (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>And we gave weight to the Solicitor General’s view in light&para;<br>of the fact that it “ ‘embodie[d] the Secretary’s policy judg&para;<br>ment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers&para;<br>installed alternative protection systems in their fleets&para;<br>rather than one particular system in every car.’ ” 529&para;<br>U. S., at 881 (quoting United States Brief in Geier 25–26).&para;<br>Taken together, this history, the agency’s contempora&para;<br>neous explanation, and the Government’s current under&para;<br>standing of the regulation convinced us that manufacturer&para;<br>choice was an important regulatory objective. And since&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the tort suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of&para;<br>that objective, we found the tort suit pre-empted.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We turn now to the present case. Like the regulation in&para;<br>Geier, the regulation here leaves the manufacturer with a&para;<br>choice. And, like the tort suit in Geier, the tort suit here&para;<br>would restrict that choice. But unlike Geier, we do not&para;<br>believe here that choice is a significant regulatory objec&para;<br>tive.&para;<br>We concede that the history of the regulation before us&para;<br>resembles the history of airbags to some degree. In 1984,&para;<br>DOT rejected a regulation that would have required the&para;<br>use of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear seats. 49 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>15241. Nonetheless, by 1989 when DOT promulgated the&para;<br>present regulation, it had “concluded that several factors&para;<br>had changed.” 54 Fed. Reg. 46258.&para;<br>DOT then required manufacturers to install a particular&para;<br>kind of belt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, for rear outer&para;<br>seats. In respect to rear inner seats, it retained manufac&para;<br>turer choice as to which kind of belt to install. But its&para;<br>1989 reasons for retaining that choice differed considera&para;<br>bly from its 1984 reasons for permitting manufacturers a&para;<br>choice in respect to airbags. DOT here was not concerned&para;<br>about consumer acceptance; it was convinced that lap-and&para;<br>shoulder belts would increase safety; it did not fear addi&para;<br>tional safety risks arising from use of those belts; it had&para;<br>no interest in assuring a mix of devices; and, though it&para;<br>was concerned about additional costs, that concern was&para;<br>diminishing.&para;<br>In respect to consumer acceptance, DOT wrote that if&para;<br>“people who are familiar with and in the habit of&para;<br>wearing lap/shoulder belts in the front seat find&para;<br>lap/shoulder belts in the rear seat, it stands to reason&para;<br>that they would be more likely to wear those belts&para;<br>when riding in the rear seat.” 53 Fed. Reg. 47983&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1988).&para;<br>In respect to safety, DOT wrote that, because an in&para;<br>creasing number of rear seat passengers wore seatbelts,&para;<br>rear seat lap-and-shoulder belts would have “progressively&para;<br>greater actual safety benefits.” 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.&para;<br>It added:&para;<br>“[s]tudies of occupant protection from 1968 forward&para;<br>show that the lap-only safety belts installed in rear&para;<br>seating positions are effective in reducing the risk of&para;<br>death and injury. . . . However, the agency believes&para;<br>that rear-seat lap/shoulder safety belts would be even&para;<br>more effective.” Ibid.&para;<br>Five years earlier, DOT had expressed concern that lap&para;<br>and-shoulder belts might negatively impact child safety by&para;<br>interfering with the use of certain child car seats that&para;<br>relied upon a tether. But by 1989, DOT found that car&para;<br>seat designs “had shifted away” from tethers. 53 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>47983. And rear lap-and-shoulder belts could therefore&para;<br>offer safety benefits for children old enough to use them&para;<br>without diminishing the safety of smaller children in car&para;<br>seats. Id., at 47988–47989 (“[T]he agency believes that&para;<br>this proposal for rear seat lap/shoulder belts would offer&para;<br>benefits for children riding in some types of booster seats,&para;<br>would have no positive or negative effects on children&para;<br>riding in most designs of car seats and children that are&para;<br>too small to use shoulder belts, and would offer older&para;<br>children the same incremental safety protection [as&para;<br>adults]”). Nor did DOT seek to use its regulation to spur&para;<br>the development of alternative kinds of rear aisle or mid&para;<br>dle seat safety devices. See 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.&para;<br>Why then did DOT not require lap-and-shoulder belts in&para;<br>these seats? We have found some indication that it&para;<br>thought use of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear aisle seats&para;<br>could cause “entry and exit problems for occupants of&para;<br>seating positions to the rear” by “stretch[ing] the shoulder&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>belt across the aisleway,” id., at 46258. However, DOT&para;<br>encouraged manufacturers to address this issue through&para;<br>innovation:&para;<br>“[I]n those cases where manufacturers are able to de&para;<br>sign and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions&para;<br>adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the&para;<br>aisleway’s purpose of allowing access to more rear&para;<br>ward seating positions[, the agency] encourages the&para;<br>manufacturers to do so.” 54 Fed. Reg. 46258.&para;<br>And there is little indication that DOT considered this&para;<br>matter a significant safety concern. Cf. Letter from Philip&para;<br>R. Recht, Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety&para;<br>Admin., to Roger Matoba (Dec. 28, 1994), App. to Reply&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 2 (“With respect to your concerns&para;<br>about the safety of shoulder safety belts which cross an&para;<br>aisle, I note that such belts do not in fact prevent rear&para;<br>ward passengers from exiting the vehicle. Such passen&para;<br>gers may . . . g[o] under or over the belt. They may also&para;<br>move the belt aside”).&para;<br>The more important reason why DOT did not require&para;<br>lap-and-shoulder belts for rear inner seats was that it&para;<br>thought that this requirement would not be cost-effective.&para;<br>The agency explained that it would be significantly more&para;<br>expensive for manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder&para;<br>belts in rear middle and aisle seats than in seats next to&para;<br>the car doors. Ibid. But that fact—the fact that DOT&para;<br>made a negative judgment about cost effectiveness—&para;<br>cannot by itself show that DOT sought to forbid common&para;<br>law tort suits in which a judge or jury might reach a&para;<br>different conclusion.&para;<br>For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would&para;<br>remain frozen. Rather it pointed out that costs were&para;<br>falling as manufacturers were “voluntarily equipping more&para;<br>and more of their vehicles with rear seat lap/shoulder&para;<br>belts.” Ibid. For another thing, many, perhaps most,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal safety regulations embody some kind of cost&para;<br>effectiveness judgment. While an agency could base a&para;<br>decision to pre-empt on its cost-effectiveness judgment, we&para;<br>are satisfied that the rulemaking record at issue here&para;<br>discloses no such pre-emptive intent. And to infer from&para;<br>the mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment&para;<br>that the federal agency intends to bar States from impos&para;<br>ing stricter standards would treat all such federal stan&para;<br>dards as if they were maximum standards, eliminating the&para;<br>possibility that the federal agency seeks only to set forth a&para;<br>minimum standard potentially supplemented through&para;<br>state tort law. We cannot reconcile this consequence with&para;<br>a statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood of a&para;<br>continued meaningful role for state tort law. Supra, at 4.&para;<br>Finally, the Solicitor General tells us that DOT’s regula&para;<br>tion does not pre-empt this tort suit. As in Geier, “the&para;<br>agency’s own views should make a difference.” 529 U. S.,&para;<br>at 883.&para;<br>“Congress has delegated to DOT authority to imple&para;<br>ment the statute; the subject matter is technical; and&para;<br>the relevant history and background are complex and&para;<br>extensive. The agency is likely to have a thorough&para;<br>understanding of its own regulation and its objectives&para;<br>and is ‘uniquely qualified’ to comprehend the likely&para;<br>impact of state requirements.” Ibid.&para;<br>There is “no reason to suspect that the Solicitor General’s&para;<br>representation of DOT’s views reflects anything other than&para;<br>‘the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the mat&para;<br>ter.’ ” Id., at 884 (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452,&para;<br>462 (1997)).&para;<br>Neither has DOT expressed inconsistent views on this&para;<br>subject. In Geier, the Solicitor General pointed out that&para;<br>“state tort law does not conflict with a federal ‘minimum&para;<br>standard’ merely because state law imposes a more strin&para;<br>gent requirement.” United States Brief in Geier 21 (cita&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion omitted). And the Solicitor General explained that a&para;<br>standard giving manufacturers “multiple options for the&para;<br>design of” a device would not pre-empt a suit claiming that&para;<br>a manufacturer should have chosen one particular option,&para;<br>where “the Secretary did not determine that the availabil&para;<br>ity of options was necessary to promote safety.” Id., at 22;&para;<br>see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Wood v.&para;<br>General Motors Corp., O.

This&para;<br>last statement describes the present case.&para;<br>In Geier, then, the regulation’s history, the agency’s&para;<br>contemporaneous explanation, and its consistently held&para;<br>interpretive views indicated that the regulation sought to&para;<br>maintain manufacturer choice in order to further signifi&para;<br>cant regulatory objectives. Here, these same considera&para;<br>tions indicate the contrary.

After scrutinizing the 1989 Federal Regis&para;<br>ter, a letter written in 1994, and the Solicitor General’s&para;<br>present-day assurances, the Court finds that Department&para;<br>of Transportation liked the idea of lap-and-shoulder seat&para;<br>belts in all seats, but did not require them, primarily for&para;<br>cost-efficiency reasons and also because of some concern&para;<br>for ingress-egress around the belt mounts. Ante, at 8–11.&para;<br>From all of this, the majority determines that although&para;<br>the regulators specifically and intentionally gave manu&para;<br>facturers a choice between types of seatbelts, that choice&para;<br>was not a “significant regulatory objective” and so does not&para;<br>pre-empt state tort lawsuits.&para;<br>That the Court in Geier reached an opposite conclusion&para;<br>reveals the utterly unconstrained nature of purposes-and&para;<br>objectives pre-emption.

Pre&para;<br>emption is then proper if the court decides that the regula&para;<br>tors thought the choice especially important, but not if the&para;<br>choice was only somewhat important.
