JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–551.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided May 5, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>During the early morning hours of New Year’s Eve,&para;<br>2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at&para;<br>Robert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punctured Tolan’s right lung. At the time of the shooting,&para;<br>Tolan was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about 15 to&para;<br>20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning&para;<br>that regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he&para;<br>was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not&para;<br>violate any clearly established right. 713 F. 3d 299 (2013).&para;<br>In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a&para;<br>motion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence of the&para;<br>nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences&para;<br>are to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,&para;<br>Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986). For that reason, we vacate&para;<br>its decision and remand the case for further proceedings&para;<br>consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The following facts, which we view in the light most&para;<br>favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and&para;<br>the opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of&para;<br>December 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on&para;<br>patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TOLAN v. COTTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential&para;<br>street. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of&para;<br>the street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and&para;<br>his cousin, Anthony Cooper.&para;<br>Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of&para;<br>the vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed&para;<br>an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number&para;<br>696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number&para;<br>matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This&para;<br>match caused the squad car’s computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that&para;<br>Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.&para;<br>Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and&para;<br>ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused&para;<br>Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper responded, “That’s not true.” Record 1295. And Tolan explained, “That’s my car.” Ibid. Tolan then complied with&para;<br>the officer’s demand to lie face-down on the home’s front&para;<br>porch.&para;<br>As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home&para;<br>where Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commotion, Tolan’s parents exited the front door in their pajamas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from&para;<br>escalating into something more, Tolan’s father instructed&para;<br>Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to&para;<br>say nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.&para;<br>Edwards told Tolan’s parents that he believed Tolan and&para;<br>Cooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan’s father&para;<br>identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan’s mother explained&para;<br>that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime&para;<br>had been committed. Tolan’s father explained, with his&para;<br>hands in the air, “[T]his is my nephew. This is my son.&para;<br>We live here. This is my house.” Id., at 2059. Tolan’s&para;<br>mother similarly offered, “[S]ir this is a big mistake. This&para;<br>car is not stolen. . . . That’s our car.” Id., at 2075.&para;<br>While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and&para;<br>drew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and&para;<br>Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan’s mother reiterated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan&para;<br>had been driving and the home where these events were&para;<br>unfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the&para;<br>family’s garage door. In response to Cotton’s order, Tolan’s mother asked, “[A]re you kidding me? We’ve lived&para;<br>her[e] 15 years. We’ve never had anything like this happen before.” Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.&para;<br>The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan’s&para;<br>mother and Cooper testified during Cotton’s criminal trial1&para;<br>that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the&para;<br>garage door with such force that she fell to the ground.&para;<br>Id., at 2035, 2078–2080. Tolan similarly testified that&para;<br>Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door. Id., at&para;<br>2479. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother&para;<br>and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton&para;<br>used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back&para;<br>that lasted for days. Id., at 2078–2079, 2089–2091. By&para;<br>contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he&para;<br>was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her&para;<br>arm up and told him to get his hands off her. Id., at 1043.&para;<br>He also testified that he did not know whether he left&para;<br>bruises but believed that he had not. Id., at 1044.&para;<br>The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan&para;<br>responded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during&para;<br>the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being&para;<br>pushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.&para;<br>Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The events described here led to Cotton’s criminal indictment in&para;<br>Harris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant. 713&para;<br>F. 3d 299, 303 (CA5 2013). He was acquitted. Ibid. The testimony of&para;<br>Tolan’s mother during Cotton’s trial is a part of the record in this civil&para;<br>action. Record 2066–2087.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TOLAN v. COTTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Id., at 1051–1052, 1121.&para;<br>Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from&para;<br>roughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F. 3d, at 303, “[G]et your&para;<br>fucking hands off my mom.” Record 1928. The parties&para;<br>also agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three&para;<br>shots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these&para;<br>shots came with no verbal warning. Id., at 2019, 2080.&para;<br>One of the bullets entered Tolan’s chest, collapsing his&para;<br>right lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he&para;<br>suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding&para;<br>professional baseball career and causes him to experience&para;<br>pain on a daily basis.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan’s parents filed&para;<br>this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims&para;<br>under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Tolan claimed,&para;<br>among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force&para;<br>against him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.2 After&para;<br>discovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing&para;<br>that the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.&para;<br>That doctrine immunizes government officials from damages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly&para;<br>established right.&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. 854 F. Supp. 2d 444 (SD Tex. 2012). It reasoned that&para;<br>Cotton’s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore&para;<br>did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 477–478.&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis. 713&para;<br>F. 3d 299. It declined to decide whether Cotton’s actions&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The complaint also alleged that the officers’ actions violated the&para;<br>Equal Protection Clause to the extent they were motivated by Tolan’s&para;<br>and Cooper’s race. 854 F. Supp. 2d 444, 465 (SD Tex. 2012). In addition, the complaint alleged that Cotton used excessive force against&para;<br>Tolan’s mother. Id., at 468. Those claims, which were dismissed, id., at&para;<br>465, 470, are not before this Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that&para;<br>even if Cotton’s conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because&para;<br>he did not violate a clearly established right. Id., at 306.&para;<br>In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by&para;<br>noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, “it was . . .&para;<br>clearly established that an officer had the right to use&para;<br>deadly force if that officer harbored an objective and reasonable belief that a suspect presented an ‘immediate&para;<br>threat to [his] safety.’ ” Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v.&para;<br>Marcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)). The Court&para;<br>of Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the&para;<br>qualified-immunity bar because “an objectively-reasonable&para;<br>officer in Sergeant Cotton’s position could have . . . believed” that Tolan “presented an ‘immediate threat to the&para;<br>safety of the officers.’ ” 713 F. 3d, at 307.3 In support of&para;<br>this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the&para;<br>front porch had been “dimly-lit”; Tolan’s mother had “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm”; and Tolan’s&para;<br>words had amounted to a “verba[l] threa[t].” Ibid. Most&para;<br>critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that&para;<br>Tolan was “moving to intervene in” Cotton’s handling of&para;<br>his mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could&para;<br>reasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307. Accordingly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan.&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 538 Fed.&para;<br>Appx. 374 (2013). Three judges voted to grant rehearing.&para;<br>Judge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel&para;<br>opinion “fail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Tolan argues that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly analyzed the reasonableness of Sergeant Cotton’s beliefs under the second prong of the&para;<br>qualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Pet. for Cert. 12,&para;<br>20. Because we rule in Tolan’s favor on the narrow ground that the&para;<br>Fifth Circuit erred in its application of the summary judgment standard, we express no view as to Tolan’s additional argument.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TOLAN v. COTTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine&para;<br>issues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in&para;<br>Cotton’s position could have reasonably and objectively&para;<br>believed that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant&para;<br>threat of substantial injury to him.” Id., at 377.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In resolving questions of qualified immunity at summary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.&para;<br>The first asks whether the facts, “[t]aken in the light most&para;<br>favorable to the party asserting the injury, . . . show the&para;<br>officer’s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]” Saucier v.&para;<br>Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). When a plaintiff alleges&para;<br>excessive force during an investigation or arrest, the&para;<br>federal right at issue is the Fourth Amendment right&para;<br>against unreasonable seizures. Graham v. Connor, 490&para;<br>U. S. 386, 394 (1989). The inquiry into whether this right&para;<br>was violated requires a balancing of “ ‘the nature and&para;<br>quality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth&para;<br>Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.’ ”&para;<br>Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8 (1985); see Graham,&para;<br>supra, at 396.&para;<br>The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis&para;<br>asks whether the right in question was “clearly established” at the time of the violation. Hope v. Pelzer, 536&para;<br>U. S. 730, 739 (2002). Governmental actors are “shielded&para;<br>from liability for civil damages if their actions did not&para;<br>violate ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional&para;<br>rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. “[T]he salient question . . . is whether the state of&para;<br>the law” at the time of an incident provided “fair warning”&para;<br>to the defendants “that their alleged [conduct] was unconstitutional.” Id., at 741.&para;<br>Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>engage these two prongs. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S.&para;<br>223, 236 (2009). But under either prong, courts may not&para;<br>resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543&para;<br>U. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at&para;<br>201; Hope, supra, at 733, n. 1. This is not a rule specific to&para;<br>qualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more&para;<br>general rule that a “judge’s function” at summary judgment is not “to weigh the evidence and determine the&para;<br>truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a&para;<br>genuine issue for trial.” Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.&para;<br>Summary judgment is appropriate only if “the movant&para;<br>shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material&para;<br>fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of&para;<br>law.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In making that determination, a court must view the evidence “in the light most&para;<br>favorable to the opposing party.” Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp;&para;<br>Co., 398 U. S. 144, 157 (1970); see also Anderson, supra, at&para;<br>255.&para;<br>Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance&para;<br>of drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even&para;<br>when, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established&para;<br>prong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable&para;<br>searches or seizures, we have instructed that courts&para;<br>should define the “clearly established” right at issue on&para;<br>the basis of the “specific context of the case.” Saucier,&para;<br>supra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.&para;<br>635, 640–641 (1987). Accordingly, courts must take care&para;<br>not to define a case’s “context” in a manner that imports&para;<br>genuinely disputed factual propositions. See Brosseau,&para;<br>supra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated&para;<br>clearly established law “ ‘in light of the specific context&para;<br>of the case’ ” and construing “facts . . . in a light most&para;<br>favorable to” the nonmovant).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TOLAN v. COTTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>In holding that Cotton’s actions did not violate clearly&para;<br>established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to&para;<br>Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By&para;<br>failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key&para;<br>factual conclusions, the court improperly “weigh[ed] the&para;<br>evidence” and resolved disputed issues in favor of the&para;<br>moving party, Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.&para;<br>First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the&para;<br>shooting, the Tolans’ front porch was “dimly-lit.” 713&para;<br>F. 3d, at 307. The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cotton’s statements in a deposition that&para;<br>when he fired at Tolan, the porch was “ ‘fairly dark,’ ” and&para;<br>lit by a gas lamp that was “ ‘decorative.’ ” Id., at 302. In&para;<br>his own deposition, however, Tolan’s father was asked&para;<br>whether the gas lamp was in fact “more decorative than&para;<br>illuminating.” Record 1552. He said that it was not. Ibid.&para;<br>Moreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,&para;<br>at 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two&para;<br>motion-activated lights in front of the house. Id., at 1034.&para;<br>And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he&para;<br>was “not in darkness.” Id., at 2498–2499.&para;<br>Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan’s mother&para;<br>“refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,” thereby “compound[ing]” Cotton’s belief that Tolan “presented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.” 713 F. 3d, at&para;<br>307 (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the&para;<br>court did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Although the parties agree that Tolan’s mother repeatedly&para;<br>informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in&para;<br>the home in front of which he had parked, and that the&para;<br>vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this&para;<br>information. Cotton stated during his deposition that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Tolan’s mother was “very agitated” when she spoke to the&para;<br>officers. Record 1032–1033. By contrast, Tolan’s mother&para;<br>testified at Cotton’s criminal trial that she was neither&para;<br>“aggravated” nor “agitated.” Id., at 2075, 2077.&para;<br>Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was “shouting,”&para;<br>713 F. 3d, at 306, 308, and “verbally threatening” the&para;<br>officer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.&para;<br>The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton&para;<br>was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton,&para;<br>“[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” Record 1928. But&para;<br>Tolan testified that he “was not screaming.” Id., at 2544.&para;<br>And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict&para;<br>harm. Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5&para;<br>2001) (“A threat imports ‘[a] communicated intent to&para;<br>inflict physical or other harm’ ” (quoting Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F. 3d&para;<br>1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words “Why&para;<br>was you talking to Mama that way” did not constitute an&para;<br>“overt threa[t]”). Tolan’s mother testified in Cotton’s&para;<br>criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door&para;<br>with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.&para;<br>Record 2078–2079. A jury could well have concluded that&para;<br>a reasonable officer would have heard Tolan’s words not as&para;<br>a threat, but as a son’s plea not to continue any assault of&para;<br>his mother.&para;<br>Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the&para;<br>shooting, Tolan was “moving to intervene in Sergeant&para;<br>Cotton’s” interaction with his mother. 713 F. 3d, at&para;<br>305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolan’s behavior&para;<br>as “abruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,”&para;<br>thereby “inflam[ing] an already tense situation”). The&para;<br>court appears to have credited Edwards’ account that at&para;<br>the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet “[i]n a&para;<br>crouch” or a “charging position” looking as if he was going&para;<br>to move forward. Record 1121–1122. Tolan testified at&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TOLAN v. COTTON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot&para;<br>him, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at&para;<br>2081. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he “wasn’t&para;<br>going anywhere,” id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did&para;<br>not “jump up,” id., at 2544.&para;<br>Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable&para;<br>conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of&para;<br>the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly&para;<br>to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing&para;<br>that motion. And while “this Court is not equipped to&para;<br>correct every perceived error coming from the lower federal&para;<br>courts,” Boag v. MacDougall 454 U. S. 364, 366 (1982)&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the&para;<br>opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents. Cf.&para;<br>Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 197–198 (summarily reversing&para;<br>decision in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case “to&para;<br>correct a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity&para;<br>standard”); see also Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U. S.&para;<br>147, 150 (1981) (per curiam) (summarily reversing an&para;<br>opinion that could not “be reconciled with the principles&para;<br>set out” in this Court’s sovereign immunity jurisprudence).&para;<br>The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their&para;<br>own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases.&para;<br>It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are&para;<br>generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By&para;<br>weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences&para;<br>contrary to Tolan’s competent evidence, the court below&para;<br>neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at&para;<br>the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences&para;<br>should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.&para;<br>Applying that principle here, the court should have&para;<br>acknowledged and credited Tolan’s evidence with regard&para;<br>to the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he shouted&para;<br>words that were an overt threat, and his positioning&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>during the shooting. This is not to say, of course, that&para;<br>these are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should consider, or that no other facts might contribute to the reasonableness of the officer’s actions as a matter of law. Nor&para;<br>do we express a view as to whether Cotton’s actions violated clearly established law. We instead vacate the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit’s judgment so that the court can determine whether,&para;<br>when Tolan’s evidence is properly credited and factual&para;<br>inferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton’s&para;<br>actions violated clearly established law.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund’s motion to file an amicus&para;<br>curiae brief are granted.

I note,&para;<br>however, that the granting of review in this case sets a&para;<br>precedent that, if followed in other cases, will very substantially alter the Court’s practice. See, e.g., this Court’s&para;<br>Rule 10 (“A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted&para;<br>when the asserted error consists of erroneous factual&para;<br>findings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of&para;<br>law”); S.

The present case falls into&para;<br>that very large category. There is no confusion in the&para;<br>courts of appeals about the standard to be applied in&para;<br>ruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals invoked the correct standard here.

Thus, the only issue is whether the&para;<br>relevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to&para;<br>the nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment&para;<br>for that party. In the courts of appeals, cases presenting&para;<br>this question are utterly routine. There is no question&para;<br>that this case is important for the parties, but the same is&para;<br>true for a great many other cases that fall into the same&para;<br>category.&para;<br>On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily&para;<br>agree in all respects with the Court’s characterization of&para;<br>the evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of&para;<br>material fact and that this is a case in which summary&para;<br>judgment should not have been granted.&para;<br>I therefore concur in the judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
