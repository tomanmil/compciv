ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1195. Argued November 28, 2011—Decided January 18, 2012&para;<br>Consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for example, computerized calls to private homes—prompted Congress to pass&para;<br>the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 47&para;<br>U. S. C. §227. Congress determined that federal legislation was&para;<br>needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping&para;<br>state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act bans certain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited&para;<br>practices and recover damages on their residents’ behalf, 47 U. S. C.&para;<br>A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these&para;<br>state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts,&para;<br>§227(g)(2). It also permits a private person to seek redress for violations of the Act or regulations “in an appropriate court of [a] State,”&para;<br>“if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of&para;<br>court of [that] State.” 47 U. S. C. §§227(b)(3), (c)(5).&para;<br>Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court,&para;<br>alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the&para;<br>TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or&para;<br>prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims’s cellular phone without&para;<br>his consent. Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction,&para;<br>i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . .&para;<br>of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The District Court, affirmed&para;<br>by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested jurisdiction over private actions exclusively in state courts.&para;<br>Held: The TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does&para;<br>not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7–18.&para;<br>(a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the&para;<br>rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in §1331’s words, plainly&para;<br>“aris[es] under” the “laws . . . of the United States.” Arrow agrees&para;<br>that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress&para;<br>vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in&para;<br>state courts. In cases “arising under” federal law, there is a presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if “Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458–459. Arrow&para;<br>acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that §1331 creates no&para;<br>converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,&para;<br>Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces&para;<br>§1331, an earlier, more general prescription.&para;<br>Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331 when&para;<br>federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal&para;<br>courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.&para;<br>Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642. Accordingly,&para;<br>the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction over Mims’s complaint&para;<br>unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federalcourt adjudication. See id., at 644. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(b) Arrow’s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress&para;<br>eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title 47&para;<br>U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s language may be state-court oriented, but “the&para;<br>grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive,” United States v. Bank of New York &amp;&para;<br>Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479. Nothing in §227(b)(3)’s permissive language makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports&para;<br>to oust federal courts of their §1331 jurisdiction. The provision does&para;<br>not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action “only” or&para;<br>“exclusively” in state court. In contrast, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2)&para;<br>(Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction” over state-initiated TCPA&para;<br>suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription&para;<br>“reinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s] silence . . .&para;<br>leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched. For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.” Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644.&para;<br>Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private&para;<br>action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean&para;<br>to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have concurrent jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all. But, as&para;<br>already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court ju-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>risdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state&para;<br>authorities, see 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simply have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was&para;<br>also exclusive for private actions. Moreover, by providing that private actions may be brought in state court “if otherwise permitted by&para;<br>the laws or rules of court of [the] State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Congress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to decide whether to entertain TCPA claims.&para;<br>Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over&para;<br>§227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress’ objective of enabling&para;<br>States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded&para;<br>state law. Even so, jurisdiction conferred by 28 U. S. C. §1331 should&para;<br>hold firm against “mere implication flowing from subsequent legislation.” Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424&para;<br>U. S. 800, 808, 809, n. 15. Furthermore, had Congress sought only to&para;<br>fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities, it could have provided that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be&para;<br>subject to the receiving State’s laws. Instead, Congress enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a&para;<br>regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.&para;<br>Arrow’s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s&para;<br>sponsor, is misplaced. The remarks nowhere mention federal-court&para;<br>jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) is intended to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims. Even if&para;<br>Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to proceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this&para;<br>Court’s judgment on §1331’s compass. Arrow’s arguments that federal courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or&para;<br>that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claimscourt plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.&para;<br>Pp. 10–18.&para;<br>421 Fed.

It authorizes&para;<br>States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices&para;<br>and to recover damages on their residents’ behalf. The&para;<br>Commission must be notified of such suits and may intervene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA&para;<br>suits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U.

Congress also provided for civil actions by&para;<br>private parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA&para;<br>or of the Commission’s implementing regulations.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple&para;<br>violations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Services, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced&para;<br>an action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District&para;<br>Court for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked&para;<br>the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, i.e., its authority&para;<br>to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . of&para;<br>the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The District Court,&para;<br>affirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subjectmatter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress’ specification, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek&para;<br>redress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission’s&para;<br>regulations thereunder) “in an appropriate court of [a]&para;<br>State,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the&para;<br>laws or rules of court of [that] State.” 47 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§227(b)(3), (c)(5).&para;<br>The question presented is whether Congress’ provision&para;<br>for private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state&para;<br>courts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. We have long&para;<br>recognized that “[a] suit arises under the law that creates&para;<br>the cause of action.” American Well Works Co. v. Layne &amp;&para;<br>Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916). Beyond doubt, the&para;<br>TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims&para;<br>has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will&para;<br>govern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into&para;<br>the TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts&para;<br>any barrier to the U. S. district courts’ exercise of the&para;<br>general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed&para;<br>since 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 18 Stat. 470; 13D&para;<br>C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; R. Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure §3561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter&para;<br>Wright &amp; Miller). We hold, therefore, that federal and&para;<br>state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits&para;<br>arising under the TCPA.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

S. C. §227&para;<br>(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, Congress reported, “[m]any consumers&para;<br>are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance&para;<br>[telemarketing] calls to their homes.” Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). “[A]utomated or prerecorded&para;<br>telephone calls” made to private residences, Congress&para;<br>found, were rightly regarded by recipients as “an invasion&para;<br>of privacy.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Although over half the States had enacted statutes restricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal&para;<br>law was needed because “telemarketers [could] evade&para;<br>[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.”&para;<br>Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep.&para;<br>No. 102–178, p. 3 (1991) (“[B]ecause States do not have&para;<br>jurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have&para;<br>expressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .”).1&para;<br>Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA principally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it&para;<br>unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system&para;<br>or an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the&para;<br>prior express consent of the called party, to call any emergency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular&para;<br>telephone, or other service for which the receiver is&para;<br>charged for the call.

Sec——————&para;<br>1 In general, the Communications Act of 1934 grants to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) authority to&para;<br>regulate interstate telephone communications and reserves to the&para;<br>States authority to regulate intrastate telephone communications.

ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded&para;<br>voice messages to call residential telephone lines without prior express consent. §227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act&para;<br>proscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines. §227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic&para;<br>telephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a&para;<br>business’ telephone lines simultaneously. §227(b)(1)(D).2&para;<br>The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban artificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,&para;<br>§227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from&para;<br>the law’s requirements, §§227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also&para;<br>directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the&para;<br>privacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly&para;<br>through the creation of a national “do not call” system.&para;<br>§227(c).3&para;<br>Congress provided complementary means of enforcing&para;<br>the Act. State Attorneys General may “bring a civil action&para;<br>on behalf of [State] residents,” if the Attorney General&para;<br>“has reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in&para;<br>a pattern or practice” of violating the TCPA or FCC regulations thereunder. 47 U.
