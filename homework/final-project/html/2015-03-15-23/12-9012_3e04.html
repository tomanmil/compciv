UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–9012. Argued February 25, 2014—Decided May 5, 2014&para;<br>Petitioner Robers was convicted of a federal crime for submitting&para;<br>fraudulent mortgage loan applications to two banks. On appeal, he&para;<br>argued that the District Court had miscalculated his restitution obligation under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §§3663A–3664, a provision of which requires property crime&para;<br>offenders to pay “an amount equal to . . . the value of the property”&para;<br>less “the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of&para;<br>the property that is returned,” §3663A(b)(1)(B). The District Court&para;<br>had ordered Robers to pay the difference between the amount lent to&para;<br>him and the amount the banks received in selling the houses that&para;<br>had served as collateral for the loans. Robers claimed that the District Court should have instead reduced the restitution amount by&para;<br>the value of the houses on the date the banks took title to them since&para;<br>that was when “part of the property” was “returned.” The Seventh&para;<br>Circuit rejected Robers’ argument.&para;<br>Held: The phrase “any part of the property . . . returned” refers to the&para;<br>property the banks lost, namely, the money they lent to Robers, and&para;<br>not to the collateral the banks received, namely, the houses. Read&para;<br>naturally, the words “the property,” which appear seven times in&para;<br>§3663A(b)(1), refer to the property that was lost as a result of the&para;<br>crime, here, the money. Because “[g]enerally, ‘identical words used&para;<br>in different parts of the same statute are . . . presumed to have the&para;<br>same meaning,’ ” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Dabit,&para;<br>547 U. S. 71, 86 (quoting IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34), “the&para;<br>property . . . returned” must also be the property lost as a result of&para;<br>the crime. Any awkwardness or redundancy that comes from substituting an amount of money for the words “the property” is the linguistic price paid for having a single statutory provision that covers&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>different kinds of property. Since valuing money is easier than valuing other types of property, the natural reading also facilitates the&para;<br>statute’s administration.&para;<br>Robers’ contrary arguments are unconvincing. First, other provisions of the statute, see, e.g., §§3664(f)(2), (3)(A), (4), seem to give&para;<br>courts adequate authority to avoid Robers’ false dichotomy of having&para;<br>to choose between refusing to award restitution and requiring the offender to pay the full amount lent where a victim has not sold the collateral by the time of sentencing. Second, for purposes of the statute’s proximate-cause requirement, see §§3663A(a)(2), 3664(e),&para;<br>normal market fluctuations do not break the causal chain between&para;<br>the offender’s fraud and the losses incurred by the victim. Third,&para;<br>even assuming that the return of collateral compensates lenders for&para;<br>their losses under state mortgage law, the issue here is whether the&para;<br>statutory provision, which does not purport to track state mortgage&para;<br>law, requires that collateral received be valued at the time the victim&para;<br>received it. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here. See Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[May 5, 2014]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 requires&para;<br>certain offenders to restore property lost by their victims&para;<br>as a result of the crime. 18 U. S. C. §3663A. A provision&para;<br>in the statute says that, when return of the property lost by&para;<br>the victim is “impossible, impracticable, or inadequate,”&para;<br>the offender must pay the victim “an amount equal to . . .&para;<br>the value of the property” less “the value (as of the date&para;<br>the property is returned) of any part of the property that is&para;<br>returned.” §3663A(b)(1)(B). The question before us is&para;<br>whether “any part of the property” is “returned” when a&para;<br>victim takes title to collateral securing a loan that an&para;<br>offender fraudulently obtained from the victim.&para;<br>We hold that it is not. In our view, the statutory phrase&para;<br>“any part of the property” refers only to the specific property lost by a victim, which, in the case of a fraudulently&para;<br>obtained loan, is the money lent. Therefore, no “part of&para;<br>the property” is “returned” to the victim until the collateral is sold and the victim receives money from the sale.&para;<br>The import of our holding is that a sentencing court must&para;<br>reduce the restitution amount by the amount of money the&para;<br>victim received in selling the collateral, not the value of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the collateral when the victim received it.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The relevant facts, as simplified, are the following: In&para;<br>2005 petitioner Benjamin Robers, acting as a straw buyer,&para;<br>submitted fraudulent loan applications to two banks. The&para;<br>banks lent Robers about $470,000 for the purchase of two&para;<br>houses, upon which the banks took mortgages. When&para;<br>Robers failed to make loan payments, the banks foreclosed&para;<br>on the mortgages. In 2006 they took title to the two houses.&para;<br>In 2007 they sold one house for about $120,000. And&para;<br>in 2008 they sold the other house for about $160,000. The&para;<br>sales took place in a falling real estate market.&para;<br>In 2010 Robers was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. See §§371, 1343. He was&para;<br>sentenced to three years of probation. And the court&para;<br>ordered him to pay restitution of about $220,000, roughly&para;<br>the $470,000 the banks lent to Robers less the $280,000&para;<br>the banks received from the sale of the two houses (minus&para;<br>certain expenses incurred in selling them).&para;<br>On appeal Robers argued that the sentencing court had&para;<br>miscalculated his restitution obligation. In his view, “part&para;<br>of the property” was “returned” to the banks when they&para;<br>took title to the houses. And, since the statute says that&para;<br>“returned” property shall be valued “as of the date the&para;<br>property is returned,” the sentencing court should have&para;<br>reduced the restitution amount by more than $280,000:&para;<br>$280,000 was what the banks received from the sale of the&para;<br>houses, but since the banks sold the houses in a falling&para;<br>real estate market, the houses had been worth more when&para;<br>the banks took title to them.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals rejected Robers’ argument. 698&para;<br>F. 3d 937 (CA7 2012). And, because different Circuits&para;<br>have come to different conclusions about this kind of&para;<br>matter, we granted Robers’ petition for certiorari. Compare id., at 942 (case below) (restitution obligation reduced&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>by money received from sale of collateral), with United&para;<br>States v. Yeung, 672 F. 3d 594, 604 (CA9 2012) (restitution&para;<br>obligation reduced by value of collateral at time lender&para;<br>took title).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In our view, the phrase “any part of the property . . .&para;<br>returned” refers to the property the banks lost, namely,&para;<br>the money they lent to Robers, and not to the collateral&para;<br>the banks received, namely, the two houses. For one&para;<br>thing, that is what the statute says. The phrase is part of&para;<br>a long sentence that reads as follows:&para;<br>“(b) The order of restitution shall require that [the]&para;<br>defendant—&para;<br>“(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to&para;<br>or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the&para;<br>offense—&para;<br>“(A) return the property to the owner of the property&para;<br>. . . ; or&para;<br>“(B) if return of the property under subparagraph&para;<br>(A) is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, pay an&para;<br>amount equal to—&para;<br>“(i) the greater of—&para;<br>“(I) the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or&para;<br>“(II) the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less&para;<br>“(ii) the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned&para;<br>. . . .” §3663A (emphasis added).&para;<br>The words “the property” appear seven times in this sentence. If read naturally, they refer to the “property” that&para;<br>was “damage[d],” “los[t],” or “destr[oyed]” as a result of the&para;<br>crime. §3663A(b)(1). “Generally, ‘identical words used in&para;<br>different parts of the same statute are . . . presumed to&para;<br>have the same meaning.’ ” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 86 (2006) (quoting IBP,&para;<br>Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005)). And, if the “property” that was “damage[d],” “los[t],” or “destr[oyed]” was&para;<br>the money, then “the property . . . returned” must also be&para;<br>the money. Money being fungible, however, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Ransom v. FIA Card Services, N. A., 562 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 17); Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.&para;<br>600, 606 (2004), “the property . . . returned” need not be&para;<br>the very same bills or checks.&para;<br>We concede that substituting an amount of money, say,&para;<br>$1,000, for the words “the property” will sometimes seem&para;<br>awkward or unnecessary as, for example:&para;<br>“[I]f return of [$1,000] . . . is impossible, . . . pay an&para;<br>amount equal to . . . the greater of . . . the value of&para;<br>[$1,000] on the date of the . . . loss . . . or . . . the value&para;<br>of [$1,000] on the date of sentencing . . . .”&para;<br>§3663A(b)(1)(B).&para;<br>But any such awkwardness or redundancy is the linguistic&para;<br>price paid for having a single statutory provision that&para;<br>covers property of many different kinds. The provision is&para;<br>not awkward as applied to, say, a swindler who obtains&para;<br>jewelry, is unable to return all of the jewelry, and must&para;<br>then instead pay an amount equal to the value of all of the&para;<br>jewelry obtained less the value (as of the date of the return) of any of the jewelry that he did return. It directs&para;<br>the court to value the returned jewelry as of the date it&para;<br>was returned and subtract that amount from the value of&para;<br>all of the jewelry the swindler obtained. As applied to&para;<br>money, the provision is in part unnecessary but reading&para;<br>the statute similarly does no harm. And the law does not&para;<br>require legislators to write extra language specifically&para;<br>exempting, phrase by phrase, applications in respect to&para;<br>which a portion of a phrase is not needed.&para;<br>The natural reading also facilitates the statute’s administration. Many victims who lose money but subsequently&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>receive other property (e.g., collateral securing a loan) will&para;<br>sell that other property and receive money from the sale.&para;<br>And often that sale will take place fairly soon after the&para;<br>victim receives the property. Valuing the money from the&para;<br>sale is easy. But valuing other property as of the time it&para;<br>was received may provoke argument, requiring time,&para;<br>expense, and expert testimony to resolve.&para;<br>We are not convinced by Robers’ arguments to the contrary. First, Robers says that, when a victim has not sold&para;<br>the collateral by the time of sentencing, our interpretation&para;<br>will lead to unfair results. A sentencing court will have&para;<br>only two choices, both undesirable. The court will either&para;<br>have to refuse to award restitution, thereby undercompensating the victim, or have to require the offender to pay&para;<br>the full amount lent to him, thereby giving the victim a&para;<br>windfall.&para;<br>In our view, however, the dilemma is a false one. Other&para;<br>provisions of the statute allow the court to avoid an undercompensation or a windfall. Where, for example, a sale of&para;<br>the collateral is foreseen but has not yet taken place, the&para;<br>court may postpone determination of the restitution&para;<br>amount for two to three months after sentencing, thereby&para;<br>providing the victim with additional time to sell. See&para;<br>§3664(d)(5). Where a victim receives, say, collateral, but&para;<br>does not intend to sell it, other provisions of the statute&para;<br>may come into play. Section 3664(f)(2) provides that upon&para;<br>“determination of the amount of restitution owed to&para;<br>each victim, the court shall . . . specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid.”&para;<br>Section 3664(f)(3)(A) says that a&para;<br>“restitution order may direct the defendant to make a&para;<br>single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination&para;<br>of payments at specified intervals and in-kind&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>payments.”&para;<br>And §3664(f)(4) defines “in-kind payment” as including&para;<br>“replacement of property.” These provisions would seem&para;<br>to give a court adequate authority to count, as part of the&para;<br>restitution paid, the value of collateral previously received&para;<br>but not sold. Regardless, Robers has not pointed us to any&para;<br>case suggesting an unfairness problem. And the Government has conceded that the statute (whether through&para;<br>these or other provisions) provides room for “credit[s]”&para;<br>against an offender’s restitution obligation “to prevent&para;<br>double recovery to the victim.” Brief for United States 30&para;<br>(emphasis deleted).&para;<br>Robers also points out, correctly, that the statute has a&para;<br>proximate cause requirement. See §3663A(a)(2) (defining&para;<br>“victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a&para;<br>result of the commission of ” the offense (emphasis added));&para;<br>§3664(e) (Government bears the “burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a&para;<br>result of the offense” (emphasis added)). Cf. Paroline v.&para;<br>United States, ante, at 6–11. And Robers argues that&para;<br>where, as here, a victim receives less money from a later&para;<br>sale than the collateral was worth when received, the&para;<br>market and not the offender is the proximate cause of the&para;<br>deficiency.&para;<br>We are not convinced. The basic question that a proximate cause requirement presents is “whether the harm&para;<br>alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct”&para;<br>at issue. Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components,&para;<br>Inc., ante, at 14. Here, it does. Fluctuations in property&para;<br>values are common. Their existence (though not direction&para;<br>or amount) is foreseeable. And losses in part incurred&para;<br>through a decline in the value of collateral sold are directly related to an offender’s having obtained collateralized&para;<br>property through fraud. That is not to say that an offender&para;<br>is responsible for everything that reduces the amount of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>money a victim receives for collateral. Market fluctuations are normally unlike, say, an unexpected natural&para;<br>disaster that destroys collateral or a victim’s donation of&para;<br>collateral or its sale to a friend for a nominal sum—any of&para;<br>which, as the Government concedes, could break the causal&para;<br>chain. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25–27, 38–39, 46, 50–51.&para;<br>Further, Robers argues that “principles” of state mortgage law “confirm that the return of mortgage collateral&para;<br>compensates a lender for its losses.” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>30. But whether the collateral compensates a victim for&para;<br>its losses is not the question before us. That question is&para;<br>whether the particular statutory provision at issue here&para;<br>requires that collateral received be valued at the time the&para;<br>victim received it. That statutory provision does not purport to track the details of state mortgage law. Thus, even&para;<br>were we to assume that Robers is right about the details of&para;<br>state mortgage law, we would not find them sufficient to&para;<br>change our interpretation.&para;<br>Finally, Robers invokes the rule of lenity. To apply this&para;<br>rule, we would have to assume that we could interpret the&para;<br>statutory provision to help an offender like Robers, who is&para;<br>hurt when the market for collateral declines, without&para;<br>harming other offenders, who would be helped when the&para;<br>market for collateral rises. We cannot find such an interpretation. Regardless, the rule of lenity applies only if,&para;<br>after using the usual tools of statutory construction, we&para;<br>are left with a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the&para;<br>statute.” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139&para;<br>(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having come&para;<br>to the end of our analysis, we are left with no such ambiguity or uncertainty here. The statutory provision refers&para;<br>to the money lost, not to the collateral received.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals&para;<br>is affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

I write separately, however, to clarify that I see its analysis as applying only in&para;<br>cases where a victim intends to sell collateral but encounters a reasonable delay in doing so. See ante, at 5–6 (explaining that where a victim “does not intend to sell”&para;<br>collateral, “other provisions of the statute may come into&para;<br>play,” enabling a court “to count, as part of the restitution&para;<br>paid, the value of collateral previously received but not&para;<br>sold”). If a victim chooses to hold collateral rather than to&para;<br>reduce it to cash within a reasonable time, then the victim&para;<br>must bear the risk of any subsequent decline in the value&para;<br>of the collateral, because the defendant is not the proximate cause of that decline.&para;<br>Here, although the banks did not immediately sell the&para;<br>homes they received as collateral, Robers did not adequately argue below that their delay reflected a choice to&para;<br>hold the homes as investments.* Such an argument would&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Before the District Court, Robers suggested precisely the opposite:&para;<br>that the banks had sold the homes too hastily, at fire-sale prices in a&para;<br>falling market. See App. 35 (“The drop in value could have been due to&para;<br>the housing market itself, or due to the victim’s rush to cut their losses&para;<br>with the properties and take whatever price they could get at a sheriff’s&para;<br>sale, regardless of whether the sale price reflected the fair market value&para;<br>of the property at the time”). Before the Seventh Circuit, Robers did&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERS v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>likely have been fruitless, because the delay appears&para;<br>consistent with a genuine desire to dispose of the collateral. Real property is not a liquid asset, which means that&para;<br>converting it to cash often takes time. See, e.g., 698 F. 3d&para;<br>937, 947 (CA7 2012) (“[R]eal property is not liquid and,&para;<br>absent a huge price discount, cannot be sold immediately”).&para;<br>And indeed, the delays here appear to have resulted&para;<br>from illiquidity. See App. 70 (one of the two homes was&para;<br>placed on the market but did not immediately sell); id., at&para;<br>89 (the other attracted no bids at a foreclosure sale).&para;<br>Because such delays are foreseeable, it is fair for Robers to&para;<br>bear their cost: the diminution in the homes’ value. See&para;<br>ante, at 6 (analysis of proximate causation).&para;<br>In other cases, however, a defendant might be able to&para;<br>show that a significant delay in the sale of collateral&para;<br>evinced the victim’s choice to hold it as an investment&para;<br>rather than reducing it to cash. Suppose, for example,&para;<br>that a bank received shares of a public company as collateral for a fraudulently obtained loan. “Common stock&para;<br>traded on a national exchange is . . . readily convertible&para;<br>into cash,” Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 494 U. S. 56, 69&para;<br>(1990), so if the bank waited more than a reasonable time&para;<br>to sell the shares, a district court could infer that the bank&para;<br>was not really trying to sell but instead was holding the&para;<br>shares as investment assets. If the shares declined in&para;<br>value after the bank chose to hold them, it would be wrong&para;<br>for the court to make the defendant bear that loss. As the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>suggest that the banks should have sold more quickly. See Brief for&para;<br>Appellant in No. 10–3794, p. 35 (“[T]here is no ‘loss causation’ here, . . .&para;<br>because the kind of loss that occurred (due to the market, or to the&para;<br>victims holding the property longer than they should have in a declining market, or to other unknown factors) was not the kind for which the&para;<br>defendant’s acts could have controlled or accounted”). But this argument does not imply that the banks’ delay reflected a choice to hold the&para;<br>homes as investments, only that the banks misjudged the timing of the&para;<br>sales.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 38–39, 44–45.&para;<br>If the collateral loses value after the victim chooses to hold&para;<br>it, then that “part of the victim’s net los[s]” is “attributable&para;<br>to” the victim’s “independent decisions.” Id., at 39. The&para;<br>defendant cannot be regarded as the “proximate cause” of&para;<br>that part of the loss, ibid., and so cannot be made to bear&para;<br>it.&para;<br>In such cases, I would place on the defendant the burden to show—with evidence specific to the market at&para;<br>issue—that a victim delayed unreasonably in selling collateral, manifesting a choice to hold the collateral.
