P., ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–1182. Argued December 10, 2013—Decided April 29, 2014*&para;<br>Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency)&para;<br>have, over the course of several decades, made many efforts to deal&para;<br>with the complex challenge of curtailing air pollution emitted in upwind States, but causing harm in other, downwind States. As relevant here, the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) directs EPA to establish&para;<br>national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at&para;<br>levels that will protect public health. 42 U. S. C. §§7408, 7409. Once&para;<br>EPA settles on a NAAQS, the Agency must designate “nonattainment” areas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated pollutant exceeds the NAAQS. §7407(d). Each State must submit a&para;<br>State Implementation Plan, or SIP, to EPA within three years of any&para;<br>new or revised NAAQS. §7410(a)(1). From the date EPA determines&para;<br>that a State SIP is inadequate, the Agency has two years to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP. §7410(c)(1). Among&para;<br>other components, the CAA mandates SIP compliance with the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision, which requires SIPs to “contain adequate provisions . . . prohibiting . . . any source or other type of emissions activity&para;<br>within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which&para;<br>will . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with&para;<br>maintenance by, any other State with respect to any . . . [NAAQS].”&para;<br>§7410(a)(2)(D)(i).&para;<br>Several times over the past two decades, EPA has attempted to&para;<br>delineate the Good Neighbor Provision’s scope by identifying when&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 12–1183, American Lung Association et al. v.&para;<br>EME Homer City Generation, L. P., et al., also on certiorari to the same&para;<br>court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>upwind States “contribute significantly” to nonattainment downwind.&para;<br>The D. C. Circuit found fault with the Agency’s 2005 attempt, the&para;<br>Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, which regulated both nitrogen&para;<br>oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the gasses at issue&para;<br>here. The D. C. Circuit nevertheless left CAIR temporarily in place,&para;<br>while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in dealing with problems&para;<br>the court had identified.&para;<br>EPA’s response to that decision is the Cross-State Air Pollution&para;<br>Rule (Transport Rule), which curbs NOX and SO2 emissions in 27 upwind States to achieve downwind attainment of three NAAQS. Under the Transport Rule, an upwind State “contribute[d] significantly”&para;<br>to downwind nonattainment to the extent its exported pollution both&para;<br>(1) produced one percent or more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as determined&para;<br>by EPA. Upwind States are obliged to eliminate only emissions&para;<br>meeting both of these criteria. Through complex modeling, EPA created an annual emissions “budget” for each regulated State upwind,&para;<br>representing the total quantity of pollution an upwind State could&para;<br>produce in a given year under the Transport Rule. Having earlier determined each regulated State’s SIP to be inadequate, EPA, contemporaneous with the Transport Rule, promulgated FIPs allocating&para;<br>each State’s emissions budgets among its in-state pollution sources.&para;<br>A group of state and local governments (State respondents), joined&para;<br>by industry and labor groups (Industry respondents), petitioned for&para;<br>review of the Transport Rule in the D. C. Circuit. The court vacated&para;<br>the rule in its entirety, holding that EPA’s actions exceeded the&para;<br>Agency’s statutory authority in two respects. Acknowledging that&para;<br>EPA’s FIP authority is generally triggered when the Agency disapproves a SIP, the court was nevertheless concerned that States would&para;<br>be incapable of fulfilling the Good Neighbor Provision without prior&para;<br>EPA guidance. The court thus concluded that EPA must give States&para;<br>a reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets before issuing FIPs. The court also found the Agency’s two-part interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision unreasonable, concluding that&para;<br>EPA must disregard costs and consider exclusively each upwind&para;<br>State’s physically proportionate responsibility for air quality problems downwind.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The CAA does not command that States be given a second opportunity to file a SIP after EPA has quantified the State’s interstate&para;<br>pollution obligations. Pp. 13–18.&para;<br>(a) The State respondents do not challenge EPA’s disapproval of&para;<br>any particular SIP. Instead, they argue that, notwithstanding these&para;<br>disapprovals, the Agency was still obliged to grant upwind States an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>additional opportunity to promulgate adequate SIPs after EPA had&para;<br>set the State’s emission budget. This claim does not turn on the validity of the prior SIP disapprovals, but on whether the CAA requires&para;<br>EPA do more than disapprove a SIP to trigger the Agency’s authority&para;<br>to issue a FIP. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(b) The CAA’s plain text supports the Agency: Disapproval of a&para;<br>SIP, without more, triggers EPA’s obligation to issue a FIP. The&para;<br>statute sets precise deadlines for the States and EPA. Once EPA issues any new or revised NAAQS, a State “shall” propose a SIP within&para;<br>three years, 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(1), and that SIP “shall” include, inter alia, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision,&para;<br>§7410(a)(2). If the EPA finds a SIP inadequate, the Agency has a&para;<br>statutory duty to issue a FIP “at any time” within two years.&para;<br>§7410(c)(1). However sensible the D. C. Circuit’s exception to this&para;<br>strict time prescription may be, a reviewing court’s “task is to apply&para;<br>the text [of the statute], not to improve upon it.” Pavelic &amp; LeFlore v.&para;<br>Marvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp., 493&para;<br>U. S. 120, 126. Nothing in the Act differentiates the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision from the several other matters a State must address in its&para;<br>SIP. Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP on&para;<br>EPA’s having first quantified an upwind State’s good neighbor obligations. By altering Congress’ SIP and FIP schedule, the D. C. Circuit&para;<br>allowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an information&para;<br>submission obligation on EPA Congress did not impose. Pp. 14–17.&para;<br>(c) The fact that EPA had previously accorded upwind States a&para;<br>chance to allocate emission budgets among their in-state sources does&para;<br>not show that the Agency acted arbitrarily by refraining to do so&para;<br>here. EPA retained discretion to alter its course provided it gave a&para;<br>reasonable explanation for doing so. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of&para;<br>United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.&para;<br>29, 42. Here, the Agency had been admonished by the D. C. Circuit&para;<br>to act with dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR. Endeavoring to&para;<br>satisfy that directive, EPA acted speedily, issuing FIPs and the&para;<br>Transport Rule contemporaneously. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>2. EPA’s cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among upwind States is a permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation&para;<br>of the Good Neighbor Provision. Pp. 18–31.&para;<br>(a) Respondents’ attack on EPA’s interpretation of the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision is not foreclosed by §7607(d)(7)(B), which provides that “[o]nly an objection to a rule . . . raised with reasonable&para;<br>specificity during the period for public comment . . . may be raised&para;<br>during judicial review.” Even assuming that respondents failed to&para;<br>object to the Transport Rule with “reasonable specificity,” that lapse&para;<br>is not jurisdictional. Section 7607(d)(7)(B) is a “mandatory,” but not&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“jurisdictional,” rule, see Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 510,&para;<br>which speaks to a party’s procedural obligations, not a court’s authority, see Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Because EPA did not&para;<br>press this argument unequivocally before the D. C. Circuit, it does&para;<br>not pose an impassable hindrance to this Court’s review. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>(b) This Court routinely accords dispositive effect to an agency’s&para;<br>reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language. The&para;<br>Good Neighbor Provision delegates authority to EPA at least as certainly as the CAA provisions involved in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.&para;<br>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. EPA’s authority to reduce upwind pollution extends only to those “amounts” of&para;<br>pollution that “contribute significantly to nonattainment” in downwind States. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i). Because a downwind State’s excess&para;<br>pollution is often caused by multiple upwind States, however, EPA&para;<br>must address how to allocate responsibility among multiple contributors. The Good Neighbor Provision does not dictate a method of apportionment. Nothing in the provision, for example, directs the proportional allocation method advanced by the D. C. Circuit, a method&para;<br>that works neither mathematically nor in practical application. Under Chevron, Congress’ silence effectively delegates authority to EPA&para;<br>to select from among reasonable options. See United States v. Mead&para;<br>Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229.&para;<br>EPA’s chosen allocation method is a “permissible construction of&para;<br>the statute.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843. The Agency, tasked with&para;<br>choosing which among equal “amounts” to eliminate, has chosen sensibly to reduce the amount easier, i.e., less costly, to eradicate. The&para;<br>Industry respondents argue that the final calculation cannot rely on&para;<br>costs, but nothing in the Good Neighbor Provision’s text precludes&para;<br>that choice. And using costs in the Transport Rule calculus is an efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision compels the Agency to address. Efficient because&para;<br>EPA can achieve the same levels of attainment, i.e., of emission reductions, the proportional approach aims to achieve, but at a much&para;<br>lower overall cost. Equitable because, by imposing uniform cost&para;<br>thresholds on regulated States, EPA’s rule subjects to stricter regulation those States that have done less in the past to control their pollution. Pp. 20–28.&para;<br>(c) Wholesale invalidation of the Transport Rule is not justified&para;<br>by either of the D. C. Circuit’s remaining objections: that the&para;<br>Transport Rule leaves open the possibility that a State might be&para;<br>compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every affected downwind State is in attainment, so-called “over-control”; and&para;<br>that EPA’s use of costs does not foreclose the possibility that an upwind State would be required to reduce its emissions by so much that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the State would be placed below the one-percent mark EPA set as the&para;<br>initial threshold of “significan[ce].” First, instances of “over-control”&para;<br>in particular downwind locations may be incidental to reductions&para;<br>necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere. As the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision seeks attainment in every downwind State, however, exceeding attainment in one State cannot rank as “over-control” unless&para;<br>unnecessary to achieving attainment in any downwind State. Second, the EPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate to&para;<br>balance the possibilities of over-control and “under-control,” i.e., to&para;<br>maximize achievement of attainment downwind. Finally, in a voluminous record, involving thousands of upwind-to-downwind linkages,&para;<br>respondents point to only a few instances of “unnecessary” emission&para;<br>reductions, and even those are contested by EPA.

Left unregulated,&para;<br>the emitting or upwind State reaps the benefits of the&para;<br>economic activity causing the pollution without bearing all&para;<br>the costs. See Revesz, Federalism and Interstate Envi­&para;<br>ronmental Externalities, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2341, 2343&para;<br>(1996). Conversely, downwind States to which the pollu­&para;<br>tion travels are unable to achieve clean air because of the&para;<br>influx of out-of-state pollution they lack authority to con­&para;<br>trol. See S. Rep. No. 101–228, p. 49 (1989). To tackle the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>problem, Congress included a Good Neighbor Provision in&para;<br>the Clean Air Act (Act or CAA). That provision, in its&para;<br>current phrasing, instructs States to prohibit in-state&para;<br>sources “from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which&para;<br>will . . . contribute significantly” to downwind States’&para;<br>“nonattainment . . . , or interfere with maintenance,” of&para;<br>any EPA-promulgated national air quality standard. 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i).&para;<br>Interpreting the Good Neighbor Provision, EPA adopted&para;<br>the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (commonly and herein­&para;<br>after called the Transport Rule). The rule calls for consid­&para;<br>eration of costs, among other factors, when determining&para;<br>the emission reductions an upwind State must make to&para;<br>improve air quality in polluted downwind areas. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit vacated the rule in&para;<br>its entirety. It held, 2 to 1, that the Good Neighbor Provi­&para;<br>sion requires EPA to consider only each upwind State’s&para;<br>physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind&para;<br>State’s air quality problem. That reading is demanded,&para;<br>according to the D. C. Circuit, so that no State will be&para;<br>required to decrease its emissions by more than its ratable&para;<br>share of downwind-state pollution.&para;<br>In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense&para;<br>Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), we reversed a D. C.&para;<br>Circuit decision that failed to accord deference to EPA’s&para;<br>reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous Clean Air Act&para;<br>provision. Satisfied that the Good Neighbor Provision&para;<br>does not command the Court of Appeals’ cost-blind con­&para;<br>struction, and that EPA reasonably interpreted the provi­&para;<br>sion, we reverse the D. C. Circuit’s judgment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Air pollution is transient, heedless of state boundaries.&para;<br>Pollutants generated by upwind sources are often trans­&para;<br>ported by air currents, sometimes over hundreds of miles,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to downwind States. As the pollution travels out of state,&para;<br>upwind States are relieved of the associated costs. Those&para;<br>costs are borne instead by the downwind States, whose&para;<br>ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory air quality is&para;<br>hampered by the steady stream of infiltrating pollution.&para;<br>For several reasons, curtailing interstate air pollution&para;<br>poses a complex challenge for environmental regulators.&para;<br>First, identifying the upwind origin of downwind air pollu­&para;<br>tion is no easy endeavor. Most upwind States propel&para;<br>pollutants to more than one downwind State, many&para;<br>downwind States receive pollution from multiple upwind&para;<br>States, and some States qualify as both upwind and&para;<br>downwind. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 6. The over­&para;<br>lapping and interwoven linkages between upwind and&para;<br>downwind States with which EPA had to contend number&para;<br>in the thousands.1&para;<br>Further complicating the problem, pollutants do not&para;<br>emerge from the smokestacks of an upwind State and&para;<br>uniformly migrate downwind. Some pollutants stay with­&para;<br>in upwind States’ borders, the wind carries others to&para;<br>downwind States, and some subset of that group drifts to&para;<br>States without air quality problems. “The wind bloweth&para;<br>where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but&para;<br>canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.”&para;<br>The Holy Bible, John 3:8 (King James Version). In craft­&para;<br>ing a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution,&para;<br>regulators must account for the vagaries of the wind.&para;<br>Finally, upwind pollutants that find their way down­&para;<br>wind are not left unaltered by the journey. Rather, as the&para;<br>gases emitted by upwind polluters are carried downwind,&para;<br>they are transformed, through various chemical processes,&para;<br>into altogether different pollutants. The offending gases&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 For the rule challenged here, EPA evaluated 2,479 separate link­&para;<br>ages between downwind and upwind States.

P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at issue in these cases—nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur&para;<br>dioxide (SO2)—often develop into ozone and fine particu­&para;<br>late matter (PM2.5) by the time they reach the atmos­&para;<br>pheres of downwind States. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48222–&para;<br>48223 (2011). See also 69 Fed. Reg. 4575–4576 (2004)&para;<br>(describing the components of ozone and PM2.5). Down­&para;<br>wind air quality must therefore be measured for ozone and&para;<br>PM2.5 concentrations. EPA’s chore is to quantify the&para;<br>amount of upwind gases (NOX and SO2) that must be&para;<br>reduced to enable downwind States to keep their levels of&para;<br>ozone and PM2.5 in check.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Over the past 50 years, Congress has addressed inter­&para;<br>state air pollution several times and with increasing rigor.&para;<br>In 1963, Congress directed federal authorities to “encour­&para;<br>age cooperative activities by the States and local govern­&para;<br>ments for the prevention and control of air pollution.” 77&para;<br>Stat. 393, 42 U. S. C. §1857a (1964 ed.). In 1970, Congress&para;<br>made this instruction more concrete, introducing features&para;<br>still key to the Act. For the first time, Congress directed&para;<br>EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards&para;<br>(NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public&para;<br>health. See 84 Stat. 1679–1680, as amended, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§7408, 7409 (2006 ed.). Once EPA settles on a NAAQS,&para;<br>the Act requires the Agency to designate “nonattainment”&para;<br>areas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated&para;<br>pollutant exceeds the NAAQS. §7407(d).&para;<br>The Act then shifts the burden to States to propose&para;<br>plans adequate for compliance with the NAAQS. Each&para;<br>State must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP,&para;<br>to EPA within three years of any new or revised NAAQS.&para;<br>§7410(a)(1). If EPA determines that a State has failed to&para;<br>submit an adequate SIP, either in whole or in part, the Act&para;<br>requires the Agency to promulgate a Federal Implementa­&para;<br>tion Plan, or FIP, within two years of EPA’s determina­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion, “unless the State corrects the deficiency” before a FIP&para;<br>is issued. §7410(c)(1).2&para;<br>The Act lists the matters a SIP must cover. Among SIP&para;<br>components, the 1970 version of the Act required SIPs to&para;<br>include “adequate provisions for intergovernmental coop­&para;<br>eration” concerning interstate air pollution. §110(a)(2)(E),&para;<br>84 Stat. 1681, 42 U. S. C. §1857c–5(a)(2)(E). This statutory&para;<br>requirement, with its text altered over time, has come&para;<br>to be called the Good Neighbor Provision.&para;<br>In 1977, Congress amended the Good Neighbor Provi­&para;<br>sion to require more than “cooperation.” It directed States&para;<br>to submit SIPs that included provisions “adequate” to&para;<br>“prohibi[t] any stationary source within the State from&para;<br>emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will . . .&para;<br>prevent attainment or maintenance [of air quality stand­&para;<br>ards] by any other State.” §108(a)(4), 91 Stat. 693, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(E) (1976 ed., Supp. II). The amended&para;<br>provision thus explicitly instructed upwind States to&para;<br>reduce emissions to account for pollution exported beyond&para;<br>their borders. As then written, however, the provision&para;<br>regulated only individual sources that, considered alone,&para;<br>emitted enough pollution to cause nonattainment in a&para;<br>downwind State. Because it is often “impossible to say&para;<br>that any single source or group of sources is the one which&para;<br>actually prevents attainment” downwind, S. Rep. No. 101–&para;<br>228, p. 21 (1989), the 1977 version of the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision proved ineffective, see ibid. (noting the provi­&para;<br>sion’s inability to curb the collective “emissions [of] multi­&para;<br>ple sources”).&para;<br>Congress most recently amended the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision in 1990. The statute, in its current form, re­&para;<br>quires SIPs to “contain adequate provisions . . . prohibiting&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 FIPs and SIPs were introduced in the 1970 version of the Act; the&para;<br>particular deadlines discussed here were added in 1990.

The controversy before us centers on EPA’s&para;<br>most recent attempt to construe this provision.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Three times over the past two decades, EPA has at­&para;<br>tempted to delineate the Good Neighbor Provision’s scope&para;<br>by identifying when upwind States “contribute significantly”&para;<br>to nonattainment downwind. In 1998, EPA issued a&para;<br>rule known as the “NOX SIP Call.” That regulation lim­&para;<br>ited NOX emissions in 23 upwind States to the extent such&para;<br>emissions contributed to nonattainment of ozone stand­&para;<br>ards in downwind States. See 63 Fed. Reg. 57356, 57358.&para;<br>In Michigan v. EPA, 213 F. 3d 663 (2000), the D. C. Cir­&para;<br>cuit upheld the NOX SIP Call, specifically affirming EPA’s&para;<br>use of costs to determine when an upwind State’s contri­&para;<br>bution was “significan[t]” within the meaning of the stat­&para;<br>ute. Id., at 674–679.&para;<br>In 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or&para;<br>CAIR. 70 Fed. Reg. 25162.

Circuit’s North Carolina decision.&para;<br>Finalized in August 2011, the Transport Rule curtails NOX&para;<br>and SO2 emissions of 27 upwind States to achieve down­&para;<br>wind attainment of three different NAAQS: the two 1997&para;<br>NAAQS previously addressed by CAIR, and the 2006&para;<br>NAAQS for PM2.5 levels measured on a daily basis. See 76&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 48208–48209.&para;<br>Under the Transport Rule, EPA employed a “two-step&para;<br>approach” to determine when upwind States “contribute[d]&para;<br>significantly to nonattainment,” id., at 48254, and there­&para;<br>fore in “amounts” that had to be eliminated. At step one,&para;<br>called the “screening” analysis, the Agency excluded as de&para;<br>minimis any upwind State that contributed less than one&para;<br>percent of the three NAAQS3 to any downwind State&para;<br>“receptor,” a location at which EPA measures air quality.&para;<br>See id., at 48236–48237.4 If all of an upwind State’s con­&para;<br>tributions fell below the one-percent threshold, that State&para;<br>would be considered not to have “contribute[d] significantly” to the nonattainment of any downwind State. Id.,&para;<br>at 48236. States in that category were screened out and&para;<br>exempted from regulation under the rule.&para;<br>The remaining States were subjected to a second in­&para;<br>quiry, which EPA called the “control” analysis. At this&para;<br>stage, the Agency sought to generate a cost-effective allo­&para;<br>cation of emission reductions among those upwind States&para;<br>“screened in” at step one.&para;<br>The control analysis proceeded this way. EPA first&para;<br>calculated, for each upwind State, the quantity of emis­&para;<br>sions the State could eliminate at each of several cost&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 With respect to each NAAQS addressed by the rule, the one-percent&para;<br>threshold corresponded to levels of 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter&para;<br>(µg/m3) for annual PM2.5, 0.35 µg/m3 for daily PM2.5, and 0.8 parts per&para;<br>billion (ppb) for 8-hour ozone. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48236–48237.&para;<br>4 If, for example, the NAAQS for ozone were 100 ppb, a contribution of&para;<br>less than 1 ppb to any downwind location would fall outside EPA’s&para;<br>criteria for significance.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>thresholds. See id., at 48248–48249. Cost for these pur­&para;<br>poses is measured as cost per ton of emissions prevented,&para;<br>for instance, by installing scrubbers on powerplant smoke­&para;<br>stacks.5 EPA estimated, for example, the amount each&para;<br>upwind State’s NOX emissions would fall if all pollution&para;<br>sources within each State employed every control measure&para;<br>available at a cost of $500 per ton or less. See id., at&para;<br>48249–48251. The Agency then repeated that analysis at&para;<br>ascending cost thresholds. See ibid.6&para;<br>Armed with this information, EPA conducted complex&para;<br>modeling to establish the combined effect the upwind&para;<br>reductions projected at each cost threshold would have on&para;<br>air quality in downwind States. See id., at 48249. The&para;<br>Agency then identified “significant cost threshold[s],”&para;<br>points in its model where a “noticeable change occurred in&para;<br>downwind air quality, such as . . . where large upwind&para;<br>emission reductions become available because a certain&para;<br>type of emissions control strategy becomes cost-effective.”&para;<br>Ibid. For example, reductions of NOX sufficient to resolve&para;<br>or significantly curb downwind air quality problems could&para;<br>be achieved, EPA determined, at a cost threshold of $500&para;<br>per ton (applied uniformly to all regulated upwind States).&para;<br>“Moving beyond the $500 cost threshold,” EPA concluded,&para;<br>“would result in only minimal additional . . . reductions [in&para;<br>emissions].” Id., at 48256.7&para;<br>Finally, EPA translated the cost thresholds it had se­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 To&para;<br>&para;<br>illustrate, a technology priced at $5,000 and capable of eliminat­&para;<br>ing two tons of pollution would be stated to “cost” $2,500 per ton.&para;<br>6 For SO2, EPA modeled reductions that would be achieved at cost&para;<br>levels of $500, $1,600, $2,300, $2,800, $3,300, and $10,000 per ton&para;<br>eliminated. See id., at 48251–48253.&para;<br>7 For SO2, EPA determined that, for one group of upwind States, all&para;<br>downwind air quality problems would be resolved at the $500 per ton&para;<br>threshold. See id., at 48257. For another group of States, however,&para;<br>this level of controls would not suffice. For those States, EPA found&para;<br>that pollution controls costing $2,300 per ton were necessary. See id.,&para;<br>at 48259.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lected into amounts of emissions upwind States would be&para;<br>required to eliminate. For each regulated upwind State,&para;<br>EPA created an annual emissions “budget.” These budg­&para;<br>ets represented the quantity of pollution an upwind State&para;<br>would produce in a given year if its in-state sources im­&para;<br>plemented all pollution controls available at the chosen&para;<br>cost thresholds. See id., at 48249.8 If EPA’s projected&para;<br>improvements to downwind air quality were to be realized,&para;<br>an upwind State’s emissions could not exceed the level this&para;<br>budget allocated to it, subject to certain adjustments not&para;<br>relevant here.&para;<br>Taken together, the screening and control inquiries&para;<br>defined EPA’s understanding of which upwind emissions&para;<br>were within the Good Neighbor Provision’s ambit. In&para;<br>short, under the Transport Rule, an upwind State “con­&para;<br>tribute[d] significantly” to downwind nonattainment to the&para;<br>extent its exported pollution both (1) produced one percent&para;<br>or more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State (step&para;<br>one) and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as deter­&para;<br>mined by EPA (step two). See id., at 48254. Upwind&para;<br>States would be obliged to eliminate all and only emis­&para;<br>sions meeting both of these criteria.9&para;<br>For each State regulated by the Transport Rule, EPA&para;<br>contemporaneously promulgated a FIP allocating that&para;<br>State’s emission budget among its in-state sources. See&para;<br>id., at 48271, 48284–48287.10 For each of these States,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 In&para;<br>&para;<br>2014, for example, pollution sources within Texas would be per­&para;<br>mitted to emit no more than 243,954 tons of SO2, subject to variations&para;<br>specified by EPA. See id., at 48269 (Table VI.F–1).&para;<br>9 Similarly, upwind States EPA independently determined to be “in­&para;<br>terfer[ing] with [the] maintenance” of NAAQS downwind were required&para;<br>to eliminate pollution only to the extent their emissions satisfied both&para;<br>of these criteria. See id., at 48254.&para;<br>10 These FIPs specified the maximum amount of pollution each in­&para;<br>state pollution source could emit. Sources below this ceiling could sell&para;<br>unused “allocations” to sources that could not reduce emissions to the&para;<br>necessary level as cheaply. See id., at 48271–48272. This type of “cap­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA had determined that the State had failed to submit&para;<br>a SIP adequate for compliance with the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision. These determinations regarding SIPs became&para;<br>final after 60 days, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1)(2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. V ), and many went unchallenged.11 EPA views the&para;<br>SIP determinations as having triggered its statutory&para;<br>obligation to promulgate a FIP within two years, see&para;<br>§7410(c), a view contested by respondents, see Part II,&para;<br>infra.&para;<br>D&para;<br>A group of state and local governments (State respond­&para;<br>ents), joined by industry and labor groups (Industry re­&para;<br>spondents), petitioned for review of the Transport Rule in&para;<br>the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit. Over the&para;<br>dissent of Judge Rogers, the Court of Appeals vacated the&para;<br>rule in its entirety. See 696 F. 3d 7, 37 (2012).&para;<br>EPA’s actions, the appeals court held, exceeded the&para;<br>Agency’s statutory authority in two respects. By promul­&para;<br>gating FIPs before giving States a meaningful opportunity&para;<br>to adopt their own implementation plans, EPA had, in the&para;<br>court’s view, upset the CAA’s division of responsibility&para;<br>between the States and the Federal Government. In the&para;<br>main, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, EPA’s FIP&para;<br>authority is triggered at the moment the Agency disap­&para;<br>proves a SIP. See id., at 30. Thus, when a State proposes&para;<br>——————&para;<br>and-trade” system cuts costs while still reducing pollution to target&para;<br>levels.&para;<br>11 Three States did challenge EPA’s determinations.

See&para;<br>id., at 32.&para;<br>But the Court of Appeals ruled that a different regime&para;<br>applies to a State’s failure to meet its obligations under&para;<br>the Good Neighbor Provision. While a NAAQS was a&para;<br>“clear numerical target,” a State’s good neighbor obligation&para;<br>remained “nebulous and unknown,” the court observed,&para;<br>until EPA calculated the State’s emission budget. Ibid.&para;<br>Without these budgets, the Court of Appeals said, upwind&para;<br>States would be compelled to take a “stab in the dark” at&para;<br>calculating their own significant contribution to interstate&para;<br>air pollution. Id., at 35. The D. C. Circuit read the Act to&para;<br>avoid putting States in this position: EPA had an implicit&para;<br>statutory duty, the court held, to give upwind States a&para;<br>reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets&para;<br>among in-state sources before the Agency’s authority to&para;<br>issue FIPs could be triggered. Id., at 37.&para;<br>The D. C. Circuit also held that the Agency’s two-part&para;<br>interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision ignored&para;<br>three “red lines . . . cabin[ing the] EPA’s authority.” Id., at&para;<br>19. First, the D. C. Circuit interpreted the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision to require upwind States to reduce emissions in&para;<br>“a manner proportional to their contributio[n]” to pollution&para;<br>in downwind States. Id., at 21. The Transport Rule,&para;<br>however, treated all regulated upwind States alike, re­&para;<br>gardless of their relative contribution to the overall prob­&para;<br>lem. See id., at 23. It required all upwind States&para;<br>“screened in” at step one to reduce emissions in accord&para;<br>with the uniform cost thresholds set during the step two&para;<br>control analysis. Imposing these uniform cost thresholds,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals observed, could force some upwind&para;<br>States to reduce emissions by more than their “fair share.”&para;<br>Id., at 27.&para;<br>According to the Court of Appeals, EPA had also failed&para;<br>to ensure that the Transport Rule did not mandate up­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>wind States to reduce pollution unnecessarily. The Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision, the D. C. Circuit noted, “targets [only]&para;<br>those emissions from upwind States that ‘contribute sig­&para;<br>nificantly to nonattainment’ ” of a NAAQS in downwind&para;<br>States. Id., at 22. Pollution reduction beyond that goal&para;<br>was “unnecessary over-control,” outside the purview of the&para;<br>Agency’s statutory mandate. Ibid. Because the emission&para;<br>budgets were calculated by reference to cost alone, the&para;<br>court concluded that EPA had done nothing to guard&para;<br>against, or even measure, the “over-control” potentially&para;<br>imposed by the Transport Rule. See ibid.&para;<br>Finally, by deciding, at the screening analysis, that&para;<br>upwind contributions below the one-percent threshold&para;<br>were insignificant, EPA had established a “floor” on the&para;<br>Agency’s authority to act. See id., at 20, and n. 13. Again&para;<br>pointing to the rule’s reliance on costs, the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals held that EPA had failed to ensure that upwind&para;<br>States were not being forced to reduce emissions below the&para;<br>one-percent threshold. See ibid.&para;<br>In dissent, Judge Rogers criticized the majority for&para;<br>deciding two questions that were not, in her view, properly&para;<br>before the court. See id., at 40–46, 51–58. First, she&para;<br>addressed the majority’s insistence that FIPs abide a&para;<br>State’s opportunity to allocate its emission budget among&para;<br>in-state sources. She regarded the respondents’ plea to&para;<br>that effect as an untimely attack on EPA’s previous SIP&para;<br>disapprovals. See id., at 40–46. Second, in Judge Rogers’&para;<br>assessment, the respondents had failed to raise their&para;<br>substantive objections to the Transport Rule with the&para;<br>specificity necessary to preserve them for review. See id.,&para;<br>at 51–58. On the merits, Judge Rogers found nothing in&para;<br>the Act to require, or even suggest, that EPA must quantify a State’s good neighbor obligations before it promul­&para;<br>gated a FIP. See id., at 46–51. She also disagreed with&para;<br>the court’s conclusion that the Transport Rule unreasona­&para;<br>bly interpreted the Act. See id., at 58–60.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Once EPA has calculated emission budgets, the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit held, the Agency must give upwind States the&para;<br>opportunity to propose SIPs allocating those budgets&para;<br>among in-state sources before issuing a FIP. 696 F. 3d, at&para;<br>37. As the State respondents put it, a FIP allocating a&para;<br>State’s emission budget “must issue after EPA has quanti­&para;<br>fied the States’ good-neighbor obligations [in an emission&para;<br>budget] and given the States a reasonable opportunity to&para;<br>meet those obligations in SIPs.” Brief for State Respond­&para;<br>ents 20.&para;<br>Before reaching the merits of this argument, we first&para;<br>reject EPA’s threshold objection that the claim is untimely.&para;<br>According to the Agency, this argument—and the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit’s opinion accepting it—rank as improper collateral&para;<br>attacks on EPA’s prior SIP disapprovals. As earlier re­&para;<br>counted, see supra, at 9–10, EPA, by the time it issued the&para;<br>Transport Rule, had determined that each regulated&para;<br>upwind State had failed to submit a SIP adequate to&para;<br>satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision. Many of those de­&para;<br>terminations, because unchallenged, became final after 60&para;<br>days, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1), and did so before the&para;<br>petitions here at issue were filed. EPA argues that the&para;<br>Court cannot question exercise of the Agency’s FIP author­&para;<br>ity without subjecting these final SIP disapprovals to&para;<br>untimely review.&para;<br>We disagree. The gravamen of the State respondents’&para;<br>challenge is not that EPA’s disapproval of any particular&para;<br>SIP was erroneous. Rather, respondents urge that, not­&para;<br>withstanding these disapprovals, the Agency was obliged&para;<br>to grant an upwind State a second opportunity to promul­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gate adequate SIPs once EPA set the State’s emission&para;<br>budget. This claim does not depend on the validity of the&para;<br>prior SIP disapprovals. Even assuming the legitimacy of&para;<br>those disapprovals, the question remains whether EPA&para;<br>was required to do more than disapprove a SIP, as the&para;<br>State respondents urge, to trigger the Agency’s statutory&para;<br>authority to issue a FIP.12&para;<br>B&para;<br>Turning to the merits, we hold that the text of the stat­&para;<br>ute supports EPA’s position. As earlier noted, see supra,&para;<br>at 4–5, the CAA sets a series of precise deadlines to which&para;<br>the States and EPA must adhere. Once EPA issues any&para;<br>new or revised NAAQS, a State has three years to adopt a&para;<br>SIP adequate for compliance with the Act’s requirements.&para;<br>See 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(1). Among those requirements is&para;<br>the Act’s mandate that SIPs “shall” include provisions&para;<br>sufficient to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision.&para;<br>§7410(a)(2).&para;<br>If EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, the Agency’s&para;<br>mandate to replace it with a FIP is no less absolute:&para;<br>“[EPA] shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within&para;<br>2 years after the [Agency]&para;<br>“(A) finds that a State has failed to make a required&para;<br>submission or finds that the plan or plan revision&para;<br>submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum&para;<br>[relevant] criteria . . . , or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 The State respondents make a second argument we do not reach.&para;<br>They urge that EPA could not impose FIPs on several upwind States&para;<br>whose SIPs had been previously approved by the Agency under CAIR.&para;<br>EPA changed those approvals to disapprovals when it issued the&para;<br>Transport Rule, see 76 Fed. Reg. 48220, and the States assert that the&para;<br>process by which EPA did so was improper. That argument was not&para;<br>passed on by the D. C. Circuit, see 696 F. 3d 7, 31, n. 29 (2012), and we&para;<br>leave it for the Court of Appeals to consider in the first instance on&para;<br>remand.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

C. Circuit, however, found an unwritten excep­&para;<br>tion to this strict time prescription for SIPs aimed at&para;<br>implementing the Good Neighbor Provision. Expecting&para;<br>any one State to develop a “comprehensive solution” to the&para;<br>“collective problem” of interstate air pollution without first&para;<br>receiving EPA’s guidance was, in the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>assessment, “set[ting] the States up to fail.” 696 F. 3d, at&para;<br>36–37. The D. C. Circuit therefore required EPA, after&para;<br>promulgating each State’s emission budget, to give the&para;<br>State a “reasonable” period of time to propose SIPs im­&para;<br>plementing its budget. See id., at 37.&para;<br>However sensible (or not) the Court of Appeals’ posi­&para;<br>tion,13 a reviewing court’s “task is to apply the text [of the&para;<br>statute], not to improve upon it.” Pavelic &amp; LeFlore v.&para;<br>Marvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries&para;<br>Corp., 493 U. S. 120, 126 (1989). Nothing in the Act dif­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 On this point, the dissent argues that it is “beyond responsible&para;<br>debate that the States cannot possibly design FIP-proof SIPs without&para;<br>knowing the EPA-prescribed targets at which they must aim.” Post, at&para;<br>18. Many of the State respondents thought otherwise, however, when&para;<br>litigating the matter in Michigan v. EPA, 213 F. 3d 663 (CADC 2000).&para;<br>See Final Brief for Petitioning States in No. 98–1497 (CADC), p. 34&para;<br>(“EPA has the responsibility to establish NAAQS,” but without further&para;<br>intervention by EPA, “States [have] the duty and right to develop . . .&para;<br>SIPs . . . to meet those NAAQS.”). See also id., at 37 (“EPA’s role is to&para;<br>determine whether the SIP submitted is ‘adequate’ . . . not to dictate&para;<br>contents of the submittal in the first instance. . . . [E]ach State has the&para;<br>right and the obligation to write a SIP that complies with §[74]10(a)(2),&para;<br>including the ‘good neighbor’ provision.”).&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ferentiates the Good Neighbor Provision from the several&para;<br>other matters a State must address in its SIP. Rather, the&para;<br>statute speaks without reservation: Once a NAAQS has&para;<br>been issued, a State “shall” propose a SIP within three&para;<br>years, §7410(a)(1), and that SIP “shall” include, among&para;<br>other components, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision, §7410(a)(2).&para;<br>Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP&para;<br>on EPA’s having first quantified an upwind State’s good&para;<br>neighbor obligations. As Judge Rogers observed in her&para;<br>dissent from the D. C. Circuit’s decision, the Act does not&para;<br>require EPA to furnish upwind States with information of&para;<br>any kind about their good neighbor obligations before a&para;<br>FIP issues. See 696 F. 3d, at 47. Instead, a SIP’s failure&para;<br>to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, without more,&para;<br>triggers EPA’s obligation to issue a federal plan within&para;<br>two years. §7410(c). After EPA has disapproved a SIP,&para;<br>the Agency can wait up to two years to issue a FIP, during&para;<br>which time the State can “correc[t] the deficiency” on its&para;<br>own. Ibid. But EPA is not obliged to wait two years or&para;<br>postpone its action even a single day: The Act empowers&para;<br>the Agency to promulgate a FIP “at any time” within the&para;<br>two-year limit. Ibid. Carving out an exception to the Act’s&para;<br>precise deadlines, as the D. C. Circuit did, “rewrites a&para;<br>decades-old statute whose plain text and structure estab­&para;<br>lish a clear chronology of federal and State responsibili­&para;<br>ties.” 696 F. 3d, at 47 (Rogers, J., dissenting).&para;<br>The practical difficulties cited by the Court of Appeals&para;<br>do not justify departure from the Act’s plain text. See&para;<br>Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461–462&para;<br>(2002) (We “must presume that a legislature says in a&para;<br>statute what it means and means in a statute what it says&para;<br>there.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

A State’s obli­&para;<br>gation to adopt a SIP, moreover, arises only after EPA has&para;<br>first set the NAAQS the State must meet. §7410(a)(1).&para;<br>Had Congress intended similarly to defer States’ discharge&para;<br>of their obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision,&para;<br>Congress, we take it, would have included a similar direc­&para;<br>tion in that section. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005) (“We do not&para;<br>lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted&para;<br>text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply,&para;<br>and our reluctance is even greater when Congress has&para;<br>shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to&para;<br>make such a requirement manifest.”).&para;<br>In short, nothing in the statute places EPA under an&para;<br>obligation to provide specific metrics to States before they&para;<br>undertake to fulfill their good neighbor obligations. By&para;<br>altering the schedule Congress provided for SIPs and&para;<br>FIPs, the D. C. Circuit stretched out the process.

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense&para;<br>Council, Inc., 467 U.

Chevron concerned EPA’s definition of the term&para;<br>“source,” as used in the 1977 Amendments to the CAA.&para;<br>Id., at 840, n. 1. Those amendments placed additional&para;<br>restrictions on companies’ liberty to add new pollution&para;<br>“sources” to their factories. See id., at 840. Although&para;<br>“source” might have been interpreted to refer to an indi­&para;<br>vidual smokestack, EPA construed the term to refer to an&para;<br>entire plant, thereby “treat[ing] all of the pollution­&para;<br>emitting devices within the [plant] as though they were&para;<br>encased within a single ‘bubble.’” Ibid. Under the Agency’s&para;<br>interpretation, a new pollution-emitting device would not&para;<br>subject a plant to the additional restrictions if the “altera­&para;<br>tion [did] not increase the total emissions [produced by]&para;<br>the plant.” Ibid.&para;<br>This Court held EPA’s interpretation of “source” a rea­&para;<br>sonable construction of an ambiguous statutory term.&para;<br>When “Congress has not directly addressed the precise&para;<br>[interpretative] question at issue,” we cautioned, a review­&para;<br>ing court cannot “simply impose its own construction o[f]&para;<br>the statute.” Id., at 843.

Because “ ‘a full understanding of the force of the&para;<br>statutory policy . . . depend[s] upon more than ordinary&para;<br>knowledge’ ” of the situation, the administering agency’s&para;<br>construction is to be accorded “controlling weight unless&para;<br>. . . arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the&para;<br>statute.” Id., at 844 (quoting United States v.

The statute requires States to&para;<br>eliminate those “amounts” of pollution that “contribute&para;<br>significantly to nonattainment” in downwind States. 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i) (emphasis added). Thus, EPA’s&para;<br>task15 is to reduce upwind pollution, but only in “amounts”&para;<br>that push a downwind State’s pollution concentrations&para;<br>above the relevant NAAQS. As noted earlier, however, the&para;<br>nonattainment of downwind States results from the collec­&para;<br>tive and interwoven contributions of multiple upwind&para;<br>States. See supra, at 3. The statute therefore calls&para;<br>upon the Agency to address a thorny causation problem:&para;<br>How should EPA allocate among multiple contributing upwind States responsibility for a downwind State’s excess&para;<br>pollution?&para;<br>A simplified example illustrates the puzzle EPA faced.&para;<br>Suppose the Agency sets a NAAQS, with respect to a&para;<br>particular pollutant, at 100 parts per billion (ppb), and&para;<br>that the level of the pollutant in the atmosphere of down­&para;<br>wind State A is 130 ppb. Suppose further that EPA has&para;<br>determined that each of three upwind States—X, Y, and&para;<br>Z—contributes the equivalent of 30 ppb of the relevant&para;<br>pollutant to State A’s airspace. The Good Neighbor Provi­&para;<br>sion, as just observed, prohibits only upwind emissions&para;<br>that contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment.&para;<br>EPA’s authority under the provision is therefore limited to&para;<br>eliminating a total of 30 ppb,16 i.e., the overage caused by&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 Though we speak here of “EPA’s task,” the Good Neighbor Provi­&para;<br>sion is initially directed to upwind States.

See Brief&para;<br>for Federal Petitioners 50 (noting EPA’s consideration of&para;<br>different approaches). The Good Neighbor Provision does&para;<br>not answer that question for EPA. Cf. Chevron, 467 U. S.,&para;<br>at 860 (“[T]he language of [the CAA] simply does not&para;<br>compel any given interpretation of the term ‘source.’ ”).&para;<br>Under Chevron, we read Congress’ silence as a delegation&para;<br>of authority to EPA to select from among reasonable op­&para;<br>tions. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229&para;<br>(2001).18&para;<br>Yet the Court of Appeals believed that the Act speaks&para;<br>clearly, requiring EPA to allocate responsibility for reduc­&para;<br>ing emissions in “a manner proportional to” each State’s&para;<br>“contributio[n]” to the problem. 696 F. 3d, at 21. Nothing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 For&para;<br>&para;<br>simplicity’s sake, the hypothetical assumes that EPA has not&para;<br>required any emission reductions by the downwind State itself.&para;<br>18 The statutory gap identified also exists in the Good Neighbor Provi­&para;<br>sion’s second instruction. That instruction requires EPA to eliminate&para;<br>amounts of upwind pollution that “interfere with maintenance” of a&para;<br>NAAQS by a downwind State. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i). This mandate con­&para;<br>tains no qualifier analogous to “significantly,” and yet it entails a&para;<br>delegation of administrative authority of the same character as the one&para;<br>discussed above. Just as EPA is constrained, under the first part of the&para;<br>Good Neighbor Provision, to eliminate only those amounts that “con­&para;<br>tribute . . . to nonattainment,” EPA is limited, by the second part of the&para;<br>provision, to reduce only by “amounts” that “interfere with maintenance,” i.e., by just enough to permit an already-attaining State to&para;<br>maintain satisfactory air quality. (Emphasis added.) With multiple&para;<br>upwind States contributing to the maintenance problem, however, EPA&para;<br>confronts the same challenge that the “contribute significantly” man­&para;<br>date creates: How should EPA allocate reductions among multiple&para;<br>upwind States, many of which contribute in amounts sufficient to&para;<br>impede downwind maintenance? Nothing in either clause of the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision provides the criteria by which EPA is meant to&para;<br>apportion responsibility.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in the text of the Good Neighbor Provision propels EPA&para;<br>down this path. Understandably so, for as EPA notes, the&para;<br>D. C. Circuit’s proportionality approach could scarcely be&para;<br>satisfied in practice. See App. in No. 11–1302 etc.&para;<br>(CADC), p. 2312 (“[W]hile it is possible to determine an&para;<br>emission reduction percentage if there is a single down­&para;<br>wind [receptor], most upwind states contribute to multiple&para;<br>downwind [receptors] (in multiple states) and would have&para;<br>a different reduction percentage for each one.”).&para;<br>To illustrate, consider a variation on the example set out&para;<br>above. Imagine that States X and Y now contribute air&para;<br>pollution to State A in a ratio of one to five, i.e., State Y&para;<br>contributes five times the amount of pollution to State A&para;<br>than does State X. If State A were the only downwind&para;<br>State to which the two upwind States contributed, the&para;<br>D. C. Circuit’s proportionality requirement would be easy&para;<br>to meet: EPA could require State Y to reduce its emissions&para;<br>by five times the amount demanded of State X.&para;<br>The realities of interstate air pollution, however, are not&para;<br>so simple. Most upwind States contribute pollution to&para;<br>multiple downwind States in varying amounts. See 76&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 48239–48246. See also Brief for Respondent&para;<br>Calpine Corp. et al. in Support of Petitioners 48–49 (offer­&para;<br>ing examples). Suppose then that States X and Y also&para;<br>contribute pollutants to a second downwind State (State&para;<br>B), this time in a ratio of seven to one. Though State Y&para;<br>contributed a relatively larger share of pollution to State&para;<br>A, with respect to State B, State X is the greater offender.&para;<br>Following the proportionality approach with respect to&para;<br>State B would demand that State X reduce its emissions&para;<br>by seven times as much as State Y. Recall, however, that&para;<br>State Y, as just hypothesized, had to effect five times as&para;<br>large a reduction with respect to State A. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ proportionality edict with respect to both State A&para;<br>and State B appears to work neither mathematically nor&para;<br>in practical application.

And where, as is generally true, up­&para;<br>wind States contribute pollution to more than two down­&para;<br>wind receptors, proportionality becomes all the more&para;<br>elusive.&para;<br>Neither the D. C. Circuit nor respondents face up to this&para;<br>problem. The dissent, for its part, strains to give meaning&para;<br>to the D. C. Circuit’s proportionality constraint as applied&para;<br>to a world in which multiple upwind States contribute&para;<br>emissions to multiple downwind locations. In the dissent’s&para;<br>view, upwind States must eliminate emissions by “what­&para;<br>ever minimum amount reduces” their share of the overage&para;<br>in each and every one of the downwind States to which&para;<br>they are linked. See post, at 8. In practical terms, this&para;<br>means each upwind State will be required to reduce emis­&para;<br>sions by the amount necessary to eliminate that State’s&para;<br>largest downwind contribution. The dissent’s formulation,&para;<br>however, does not account for the combined and cumulative effect of each upwind State’s reductions on attain­&para;<br>ment in multiple downwind locations. See ibid. (“Under a&para;<br>proportional-reduction approach, State X would be required&para;<br>to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by whatever min­&para;<br>imum amount reduces both State A’s level by 0.2 unit and&para;<br>State B’s by 0.7 unit.” (emphasis added)). The result&para;<br>would be costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed&para;<br>in conflict with, the Good Neighbor Provision’s goal of&para;<br>attainment.19&para;<br>——————&para;<br>19 To see why, one need only slightly complicate the world envisioned&para;<br>by the dissent. Assume the world is made up of only four States—two&para;<br>upwind (States X and Y), and two downwind (States A and B). Suppose&para;<br>also, as the dissent allows, see post, at 9, that the reductions State X&para;<br>must make to eliminate its share of the amount by which State A is in&para;<br>nonattainment are more than necessary for State X to eliminate its&para;<br>share of State B’s nonattainment. As later explained, see infra, at 29–&para;<br>30, this kind of “over-control,” we agree with the dissent, is acceptable&para;<br>under the statute.

The dissent admits there are “multiple&para;<br>ways” EPA might answer those questions. Ibid. But&para;<br>proportionality cannot be one of those ways, for the&para;<br>proportional-reduction approach is what led to the over­&para;<br>regulation in the first place. And if a nonproportional&para;<br>approach can play a role in setting the final allocation of&para;<br>reduction obligations, then it is hardly apparent why EPA,&para;<br>free to depart from proportionality at the back end, cannot&para;<br>do so at the outset.&para;<br>Persuaded that the Good Neighbor Provision does not&para;<br>dictate the particular allocation of emissions among con­&para;<br>tributing States advanced by the D.

In this case, the&para;<br>dissent would have State X reduce by just enough to eliminate its share&para;<br>of State A’s nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its&para;<br>share of State B’s overage. The converse will be true as to State Y:&para;<br>Under the dissent’s approach, State Y would have to reduce by the&para;<br>“minimum” necessary to eliminate its proportional share of State B’s&para;<br>nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its proportion of&para;<br>State A’s overage. The result is that the total amount by which both&para;<br>States X and Y are required to reduce will exceed what is necessary for&para;<br>attainment in all downwind States involved (i.e., in both State A and&para;<br>State B). Over-control thus unnecessary to achieving attainment in all&para;<br>involved States is impermissible under the Good Neighbor Provision.&para;<br>See infra, at 30, n. 23.

Id., at&para;<br>465 (internal quotation marks omitted). Not so of the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision, which grants EPA discretion to eliminate “amounts [of&para;<br>pollution that] . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment” down­&para;<br>wind. On the particular “amounts” that should qualify for elimination,&para;<br>the statute is silent. Unlike the provision at issue in Whitman, which&para;<br>provides express criteria by which EPA is to set NAAQS, the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision, as earlier explained, fails to provide any metric by&para;<br>which EPA can differentiate among the contributions of multiple&para;<br>upwind States.

If EPA requires an upwind State to&para;<br>reduce emissions by more than the amount necessary to&para;<br>achieve attainment in every downwind State to which it is&para;<br>linked, the Agency will have overstepped its authority,&para;<br>under the Good Neighbor Provision, to eliminate those&para;<br>“amounts [that] contribute . . . to nonattainment.” Nor&para;<br>can EPA demand reductions that would drive an upwind&para;<br>State’s contribution to every downwind State to which it is&para;<br>linked below one percent of the relevant NAAQS. Doing&para;<br>so would be counter to step one of the Agency’s interpreta­&para;<br>tion of the Good Neighbor Provision. See 76 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>48236 (“[S]tates whose contributions are below th[e]&para;<br>thresholds do not significantly contribute to nonattain­&para;<br>ment . . . of the relevant NAAQS.”).&para;<br>Neither possibility, however, justifies wholesale invali­&para;<br>dation of the Transport Rule. First, instances of “over­&para;<br>control” in particular downwind locations, the D. C.

For reasons earlier explained, see supra,&para;<br>at 3–4, a degree of imprecision is inevitable in tackling the&para;<br>problem of interstate air pollution. Slight changes in wind&para;<br>patterns or energy consumption, for example, may vary&para;<br>downwind air quality in ways EPA might not have antici­&para;<br>pated. The Good Neighbor Provision requires EPA to seek&para;<br>——————&para;<br>West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Indiana each contribute in varying&para;<br>amounts to five different nonattainment areas in three downwind&para;<br>States. Id., at 52. Implementation of the Transport Rule, EPA model­&para;<br>ing demonstrates, will bring three of these five areas into attainment&para;<br>by a comfortable margin, and a fourth only barely. See id., at 53, fig. 2.&para;<br>The fifth downwind receptor, however, will still fall short of attainment&para;<br>despite the reductions the rule requires. See ibid. But if EPA were to&para;<br>lower the emission reductions required of the upwind States to reduce&para;<br>over-attainment in the first three areas, the area barely achieving&para;<br>attainment would no longer do so, and the area still in nonattainment&para;<br>would fall even further behind. Thus, “over-control” of the first three&para;<br>downwind receptors is essential to the attainment achieved by the&para;<br>fourth and to the fifth’s progress toward that goal.&para;<br>23 The dissent suggests that our qualification of the term “over­&para;<br>control” is tantamount to an admission that “nothing stands in the way&para;<br>of [a] proportional-reduction approach.” Post, at 9. Not so. Permitting&para;<br>“over-control” as to one State for the purpose of achieving attainment in&para;<br>another furthers the stated goal of the Good Neighbor Provision, i.e.,&para;<br>attainment of NAAQS. By contrast, a proportional-reduction scheme is&para;<br>neither necessary to achieve downwind attainment, nor mandated by&para;<br>the terms of the statute, as earlier discussed, see supra, at 21–25.&para;<br>Permitting “over-control” for the purpose of achieving proportionality&para;<br>would thus contravene the clear limits the statute places on EPA’s good&para;<br>neighbor authority, i.e., to eliminate only those “amounts” of upwind&para;<br>pollutants essential to achieving attainment downwind.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The Agency came forward with&para;<br>a textual justification for its action, relying on a farfetched&para;<br>meaning of the word “significantly” in the statutory text.&para;<br>That justification is so feeble that today’s majority does&para;<br>not even recite it, much less defend it.

By accord­&para;<br>ing the States primacy in deciding how to attain the gov­&para;<br>erning air-quality standards, the Clean Air Act is preg­&para;<br>nant with an obligation for the Agency to set those&para;<br>standards before the States can be expected to achieve&para;<br>them. The majority nonetheless approves EPA’s promul­&para;<br>gation of federal plans implementing good-neighbor&para;<br>benchmarks before the States could conceivably have met&para;<br>those benchmarks on their own.&para;<br>I would affirm the judgment of the D.

The Transport Rule&para;<br>“It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power to&para;<br>promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the author­&para;<br>ity delegated by Congress.” Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 I agree with the majority’s analysis turning aside EPA’s threshold&para;<br>objections to judicial review. See ante, at 13–14, 18–19.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988). Yet today the majority treats the text of the Clean Air Act not as the source&para;<br>and ceiling of EPA’s authority to regulate interstate air&para;<br>pollution, but rather as a difficulty to be overcome in&para;<br>pursuit of the Agency’s responsibility to “craf[t] a solution&para;<br>to the problem of interstate air pollution.” Ante, at 3. In&para;<br>reality, Congress itself has crafted the solution. The Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision requires each State to eliminate what­&para;<br>ever “amounts” of “air pollutant[s]” “contribute significantly&para;<br>to nonattainment” or “interfere with maintenance” of&para;<br>national ambient air-quality standards (NAAQS) in other&para;<br>States. 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The statute ad­&para;<br>dresses solely the environmental consequences of emis­&para;<br>sions, not the facility of reducing them; and it requires&para;<br>States to shoulder burdens in proportion to the size of&para;<br>their contributions, not in proportion to the ease of bearing&para;<br>them. EPA’s utterly fanciful “from each according to its&para;<br>ability” construction sacrifices democratically adopted text&para;<br>to bureaucratically favored policy. It deserves no defer­&para;<br>ence under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).&para;<br>A. Alleged Textual Support: “Significantly”&para;<br>In the Government’s argument here, the asserted tex­&para;<br>tual support for the efficient-reduction approach adopted by&para;<br>EPA in the Transport Rule is the ambiguity of the word&para;<br>“significantly” in the statutory requirement that each&para;<br>State eliminate those “amounts” of pollutants that “con­&para;<br>tribute significantly to nonattainment” in downwind&para;<br>States. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (emphasis added). As de­&para;<br>scribed in the Government’s briefing:&para;<br>“[T]he term ‘significantly’ . . . is ambiguous, and . . .&para;<br>EPA may permissibly determine the amount of a&para;<br>State’s ‘significant’ contribution by reference to the&para;<br>amount of emissions reductions achievable through&para;<br>application of highly cost-effective controls.” Reply&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Federal Petitioners 15–16 (emphasis added;&para;<br>some internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>And as the Government stated at oral argument:&para;<br>“[I]n terms of the language, ‘contribute significantly,’&para;<br>. . . EPA reasonably construed that term to include a&para;<br>component of difficulty of achievement [i.e., cost]; that&para;<br>is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a&para;<br>basketball is a more significant achievement for&para;<br>somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6&para;<br>feet 10.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (emphasis added).&para;<br>But of course the statute does not focus on whether the&para;<br>upwind State has “achieved significantly”; it asks whether&para;<br>the State has “contributed significantly” to downwind&para;<br>pollution. The provision addresses the physical effects of&para;<br>physical causes, and it is only the magnitude of the rela­&para;<br>tionship sufficient to trigger regulation that admits of&para;<br>some vagueness. Stated differently, the statute is ambig­&para;<br>uous as to how much of a contribution to downwind pollu­&para;<br>tion is “significant,” but it is not at all ambiguous as to&para;<br>whether factors unrelated to the amounts of pollutants&para;<br>that make up a contribution affect the analysis. Just as&para;<br>“[i]t does not matter whether the word ‘yellow’ is ambigu­&para;<br>ous when the agency has interpreted it to mean ‘purple,’ ”&para;<br>United States v. Home Concrete &amp; Supply, LLC, 566 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, n. 1 (2012) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1), it does not&para;<br>matter whether the phrase “amounts which . . . contribute&para;<br>significantly [to downwind NAAQS nonattainment]” is&para;<br>ambiguous when EPA has interpreted it to mean&para;<br>“amounts which are inexpensive to eliminate.”&para;<br>It would be extraordinary for Congress, by use of the&para;<br>single word “significantly,” to transmogrify a statute that&para;<br>assigns responsibility on the basis of amounts of pollut­&para;<br>ants emitted into a statute authorizing EPA to reduce&para;<br>interstate pollution in the manner that it believes most&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>efficient. We have repeatedly said that Congress “does not&para;<br>alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in&para;<br>vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one&para;<br>might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v.&para;<br>American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001)&para;<br>(citing MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994); FDA v.&para;<br>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159–&para;<br>160 (2000)).&para;<br>The statute’s history demonstrates that “significantly” is&para;<br>not code for “feel free to consider compliance costs.” The&para;<br>previous version of the Good Neighbor Provision required&para;<br>each State to prohibit emissions that would “prevent at­&para;<br>tainment or maintenance by any other State of any&para;<br>[NAAQS].” 91 Stat. 693 (emphasis added). It is evident&para;<br>that the current reformulation (targeting “any air pollutant in amounts which will . . . contribute significantly to&para;<br>nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any&para;<br>other State with respect to any [NAAQS]”) was meant&para;<br>simply to eliminate any implication that the polluting&para;<br>State had to be a but-for rather than merely a contributing&para;<br>cause of the downwind nonattainment or maintenance&para;<br>problem—not to allow cost concerns to creep in through&para;<br>the back door.&para;<br>In another respect also EPA’s reliance upon the word&para;<br>“significantly” is plainly mistaken. The Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision targets for elimination not only those emissions&para;<br>that “contribute significantly to nonattainment [of&para;<br>NAAQS] in . . . any other State,” but also those that “inter­&para;<br>fere with maintenance [of NAAQS] by . . . any other&para;<br>State.” §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The wiggle-word “significantly”&para;<br>is absent from the latter phrase.&para;<br>EPA does not—&para;<br>cannot—provide any textual justification for the conclu­&para;<br>sion that, when the same amounts of a pollutant travel&para;<br>downwind from States X and Y to a single area in State A,&para;<br>the emissions from X but not Y can be said to “interfere&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>with maintenance” of the NAAQS in A just because they&para;<br>are cheaper to eliminate. Yet EPA proposes to use the&para;<br>“from each according to its ability” approach for nonat­&para;<br>tainment areas and maintenance areas.&para;<br>To its credit, the majority does not allude to, much less&para;<br>try to defend, the Government’s “significantly” argument.&para;<br>But there is a serious downside to this. The sky-hook of&para;<br>“significantly” was called into service to counter the crite­&para;<br>rion of upwind-state responsibility plainly provided in the&para;<br>statute’s text: amounts of pollutants contributed to down­&para;<br>wind problem areas. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 42–&para;<br>45. Having forsworn reliance on “significantly” to convert&para;<br>responsibility for amounts of pollutants into responsibility&para;<br>for easy reduction of pollutants, the majority is impaled&para;<br>upon the statutory text.&para;<br>B. The Alleged “Gap”&para;<br>To fill the void created by its abandonment of EPA’s&para;<br>“significantly” argument, the majority identifies a sup­&para;<br>posed gap in the text, which EPA must fill: While the text&para;<br>says that each upwind State must be responsible for its&para;<br>own contribution to downwind pollution, it does not say&para;<br>how responsibility is to be divided among multiple States&para;<br>when the total of their combined contribution to downwind&para;<br>pollution in a particular area exceeds the reduction that&para;<br>the relevant NAAQS requires. In the example given by&para;<br>the majority, ante, at 21–22, when each of three upwind&para;<br>States contributes 30 units of a pollutant to a downwind&para;<br>State but the reduction required for that State to comply&para;<br>with the NAAQS is only 30 units, how will responsibility&para;<br>for that 30 units be apportioned? Wow, that’s a hard&para;<br>one—almost the equivalent of asking who is buried in&para;<br>Grant’s Tomb. If the criterion of responsibility is amounts&para;<br>of pollutants, then surely shared responsibility must be&para;<br>based upon relative amounts of pollutants—in the major­&para;<br>ity’s example, 10 units for each State. The statute makes&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>no sense otherwise. The Good Neighbor Provision contains a gap only for those who blind themselves to the&para;<br>obvious in order to pursue a preferred policy.&para;<br>But not only does the majority bring in cost-benefit&para;<br>analysis to fill a gap that does not really exist. Having&para;<br>filled that “gap,” it then extends the efficiency-based principle to situations beyond the imaginary gap—that is,&para;<br>situations where no apportionment is required. Even&para;<br>where only a single upwind State contributes pollutants to&para;<br>a downwind State, its annual emissions “budget” will be&para;<br>based not upon the amounts of pollutants it contributes,&para;<br>but upon what “pollution controls [are] available at the&para;<br>chosen cost thresholds.” Ante, at 9. EPA’s justification&para;<br>was its implausible (and only half-applicable) notion that&para;<br>“significantly” imports cost concerns into the provision.&para;<br>The majority, having abandoned that absurdity, is left to&para;<br>deal with the no-apportionment situation with no defense—not even an imaginary gap—against a crystal-clear&para;<br>statutory text.&para;<br>C. The Majority’s Criticisms of Proportional Reduction&para;<br>1. Impossibility&para;<br>The majority contends that a proportional-reduction&para;<br>approach “could scarcely be satisfied in practice” and&para;<br>“appears to work neither mathematically nor in practical&para;<br>application,” ante, at 23—in essence, that the approach is&para;<br>impossible of application. If that were true, I know of no&para;<br>legal authority and no democratic principle that would&para;<br>derive from it the consequence that EPA could rewrite the&para;<br>statute, rather than the consequence that the statute&para;<br>would be inoperative. “There are sometimes statutes&para;<br>which no rule or canon of interpretation can make effective or applicable to the situations of fact which they&para;<br>purport to govern. In such cases the statute must simply&para;<br>fail.” 3 R. Pound, Jurisprudence 493 (1959) (footnote&para;<br>omitted). In other words, the impossibility argument has&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>no independent force: It is relevant only if the majority’s&para;<br>textual interpretation is permissible. But in any event,&para;<br>the argument is wrong.&para;<br>The impossibility theorem rests upon the following&para;<br>scenario: “Imagine that States X and Y . . . contribute air&para;<br>pollution to State A in a ratio of one to five . . . .” Ante, at&para;<br>23. And suppose that “States X and Y also contribute&para;<br>pollutants to a second downwind State (State B), this time&para;<br>in a ratio of seven to one.” Ibid. The majority concludes&para;<br>that “[t]he Court of Appeals’ proportionality edict with&para;<br>respect to both State A and State B appears to work nei­&para;<br>ther mathematically nor in practical application.” Ibid.&para;<br>But why not? The majority’s model relies on two faulty&para;<br>premises—one an oversimplification and the other a mis­&para;<br>apprehension.&para;<br>First, the majority’s formulation suggests that EPA&para;<br>measures the comparative downwind drift of pollutants in&para;<br>free-floating proportions between States. In reality, how­&para;<br>ever, EPA assesses quantities (in physical units), not&para;<br>proportions. So, the majority’s illustration of a 1-to-5 ratio&para;<br>describing the relative contributions of States X and Y to&para;<br>State A’s pollution might mean (for example) that X is&para;<br>responsible for 0.2 unit of some pollutant above the&para;<br>NAAQS in A and that Y is responsible for 1 unit. And&para;<br>the second example, assuming a 7-to-1 ratio underlying&para;<br>State X’s and Y’s contributions to State B’s pollution,&para;<br>might mean that State X supplies 0.7 unit of the same pol­&para;<br>lutant above the NAAQS and State Y, 0.1 unit. Under a&para;<br>proportional-reduction approach, State X would be re­&para;<br>quired to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by whatever minimum amount reduces both State A’s level by 0.2&para;<br>unit and State B’s by 0.7 unit. State Y, in turn, would be&para;<br>required to curtail its emissions by whatever minimum&para;<br>amount decreases both State A’s measure by 1 unit and&para;<br>State B’s by 0.1 unit.&para;<br>But, the majority objects, the reductions that State X&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>must make to help bring State B into compliance may be&para;<br>more than those necessary for it to help bring State A into&para;<br>compliance, resulting in “over-control” of X with respect to&para;<br>A. See ante, at 23–25, and n. 19. This objection discloses&para;<br>the second flaw in the impossibility theorem. Echoing&para;<br>EPA, see Brief for Federal Petitioners 47–48, the majority&para;<br>believes that the D. C. Circuit’s interpretation of the Good&para;<br>Neighbor Provision forbids over-control with respect to&para;<br>even a single downwind receptor. That is the only way in&para;<br>which the proportional-reduction approach could be&para;<br>deemed “to work neither mathematically nor in practical&para;<br>application” on its face. Ante, at 23. But the premise is&para;<br>incorrect. Although some of the D. C. Circuit’s simplified&para;<br>examples might support that conclusion, its opinion explic­&para;<br>itly acknowledged that the complexity of real-world condi­&para;<br>tions demands the contrary: “To be sure, . . . there may be&para;<br>some truly unavoidable over-control in some downwind&para;<br>States that occurs as a byproduct of the necessity of reduc­&para;<br>ing upwind States’ emissions enough to meet the NAAQS&para;<br>in other downwind States.” 696 F. 3d 7, 22 (2012). More­&para;<br>over, the majority itself recognizes that the Good Neighbor&para;<br>Provision does not categorically prohibit over-control. “As&para;<br>the Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment in every&para;<br>downwind State, . . . exceeding attainment in one State&para;<br>cannot rank as ‘over-control’ unless unnecessary to achiev­&para;<br>ing attainment in any downwind State.” Ante, at 29–30.&para;<br>The majority apparently fails to appreciate that, having&para;<br>cleared up that potential point of confusion, nothing&para;<br>stands in the way of the proportional-reduction approach.&para;<br>The majority relies on an EPA document preceding the&para;<br>Transport Rule to establish the Agency’s supposed belief&para;<br>that the proportional-reduction approach “could scarcely&para;<br>be satisfied in practice.” Ante, at 23. But the document&para;<br>says no such thing.

The document labels as&para;<br>a “technical difficulty” (not an impossibility) the fact that&para;<br>“most upwind states contribute to multiple downwind&para;<br>[receptors] (in multiple states) and would have a different&para;<br>reduction percentage for each one.” Id., at 2312. The&para;<br>Clean Air Act is full of technical difficulties, and this one&para;<br>is overcome by requiring each State to make the greatest&para;<br>reduction necessary with respect to any downwind area.&para;<br>2. Over-Control&para;<br>Apparently conceding that the proportional-reduction&para;<br>approach may not be impossible of application after all,&para;<br>the majority alternatively asserts that it would cause&para;<br>“costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed in conflict&para;<br>with, the Good Neighbor Provision’s goal of attainment.”&para;<br>Ante, at 24. This assertion of massive overregulation&para;<br>assumes that a vast number of downwind States will be&para;<br>the accidental beneficiaries of collateral pollution reduc­&para;<br>tions—that is, nontargeted reductions that occur as a&para;<br>consequence of required reductions targeted at neighbor­&para;<br>ing downwind States. (Collateral pollution reduction is&para;<br>the opposite of collateral damage, so to speak.) The major­&para;<br>ity contends that the collateral pollution reductions en­&para;<br>joyed by a downwind State will cause the required upwind&para;<br>reductions actually targeting that State to exceed the level&para;<br>necessary to assure attainment or maintenance, thus&para;<br>producing unnecessary over-control. I have no reason to&para;<br>believe that the problem of over-control is as extensive and&para;<br>thus “costly” as the majority alleges, and the majority&para;<br>provides none.&para;<br>But never mind that. It suffices to say that over-control&para;<br>is no more likely to occur when the required reductions are&para;<br>apportioned among upwind States on the basis of amounts&para;<br>of pollutants contributed than when they are apportioned&para;<br>on the basis of cost. There is no conceivable reason why&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

See&para;<br>696 F. 3d, at 27. What causes the problem of over-control&para;<br>is not the manner of apportioning the required reductions,&para;<br>but the composite volume of the required reductions in&para;<br>each downwind State. If the majority’s approach reduces&para;<br>over-control (it admittedly does not entirely eliminate it),&para;<br>that is only because EPA applies its cost-effectiveness&para;<br>principle not just to determining the proportions of re­&para;<br>quired reductions that each upwind State must bear, but&para;<br>to determining the volume of those required reductions.&para;<br>See supra, at 7.&para;<br>In any case, the solution to over-control under a propor­&para;<br>tional-reduction system is not difficult to discern. In&para;<br>calculating good-neighbor responsibilities, EPA would&para;<br>simply be required to make allowance for what I have&para;<br>called collateral pollution reductions. The Agency would&para;<br>set upwind States’ obligations at levels that, after taking&para;<br>into account those reductions, suffice to produce attain­&para;<br>ment in all downwind States. Doubtless, there are multi­&para;<br>ple ways for the Agency to accomplish that task in accord­&para;<br>ance with the statute’s amounts-based, proportional&para;<br>focus.2 The majority itself invokes an unexplained device&para;<br>to prevent over-control “in uncommon particular applica­&para;<br>tions” of its scheme. Ante, at 31. Whatever that device is,&para;<br>it can serve just as well to prevent over-control under the&para;<br>approach I have outlined.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The majority insists that “proportionality cannot be one of those&para;<br>ways.” Ante, at 25. But it is easy to imagine precluding unnecessary&para;<br>over-control by reducing in a percent-based manner the burdens of each&para;<br>upwind State linked to a given downwind area, which would retain the&para;<br>proportionality produced by my approach.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v.

I am confident, however, that&para;<br>EPA’s skilled number-crunchers can adhere to the statute’s quantitative (rather than efficiency) mandate by&para;<br>crafting quantitative solutions. Indeed, those calculations&para;<br>can be performed at the desk, whereas the “from each&para;<br>according to its ability” approach requires the unwieldy&para;<br>field examination of many pollution-producing sources&para;<br>with many sorts of equipment.&para;<br>D.

Efficient, probably. Equitable?&para;<br>Perhaps so, but perhaps not. See Brief for Industry Respondents 35–36. But the point is that whether efficiency&para;<br>should have a dominant or subordinate role is for Congress, not this Court, to determine.&para;<br>This is not the first time parties have sought to convert&para;<br>the Clean Air Act into a mandate for cost-effective regulation. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531&para;<br>U. S. 457 (2001), confronted the contention that EPA&para;<br>should consider costs in setting NAAQS. The provision at&para;<br>issue there, like this one, did not expressly bar cost-based&para;<br>decisionmaking—and unlike this one, it even contained&para;<br>words that were arguably ambiguous in the relevant&para;<br>respect. Specifically, §7409(b)(1) instructed EPA to set&para;<br>primary NAAQS “the attainment and maintenance of&para;<br>which . . . are requisite to protect the public health” with&para;<br>“an adequate margin of safety.” One could hardly over-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

As the respondents in American Trucking argued, setting NAAQS&para;<br>without considering costs may bring about failing industries and fewer jobs, which in turn may produce poorer&para;<br>and less healthy citizens. See id., at 466. But we concluded that “in the context of ” the entire provision, that interpretation “ma[de] no sense.” Ibid. As quoted earlier, we&para;<br>said that Congress “does not alter the fundamental details&para;<br>of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not . . . hide elephants in mouseholes.” Id.,&para;<br>at 468.&para;<br>In American Trucking, the Court “refused to find implicit in ambiguous sections of the [Clear Air Act] an&para;<br>authorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so&para;<br>often, been expressly granted,” id., at 467, citing a tradition&para;<br>dating back to Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U. S. 246, 257,&para;<br>and n. 5 (1976). There are, indeed, numerous Clean Air&para;<br>Act provisions explicitly permitting costs to be taken into&para;<br>account. See, e.g., §7404(a)(1); §7521(a)(2); §7545(c)(2);&para;<br>§7547(a)(3); §7554(b)(2); §7571(b); §7651c(f)(1)(A). American Trucking thus demanded “a textual commitment of&para;<br>authority to the EPA to consider costs,” 531 U. S., at 468—&para;<br>a hurdle that the Good Neighbor Provision comes nowhere&para;<br>close to clearing. Today’s opinion turns its back upon that&para;<br>case and is incompatible with that opinion.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority shrugs off American Trucking in a footnote, reasoning&para;<br>that because it characterized the provision there in question as “absolute,” it has nothing to say about the Good Neighbor Provision, which is&para;<br>not absolute. See ante, at 28, n. 21. This is a textbook example of&para;<br>begging the question: Since the Good Neighbor Provision is not absolute&para;<br>(the very point at issue here), American Trucking, which dealt with a&para;<br>provision that is absolute, is irrelevant.

The majority rejects that ruling on the ground&para;<br>that “the Act does not require EPA to furnish upwind&para;<br>States with information of any kind about their good&para;<br>neighbor obligations before a FIP issues.” Ante, at 16.&para;<br>“[N]othing in the statute,” the majority says, “places EPA&para;<br>under an obligation to provide specific metrics to States&para;<br>before they undertake to fulfill their good neighbor obliga­&para;<br>tions.” Ante, at 17. This remarkably expansive reasoning&para;<br>makes a hash of the Clean Air Act, transforming it from a&para;<br>program based on cooperative federalism to one of central­&para;<br>ized federal control. Nothing in the Good Neighbor Provi­&para;<br>sion suggests such a stark departure from the Act’s fun­&para;<br>damental structure.&para;<br>A. Implications of State Regulatory Primacy&para;<br>Down to its very core, the Clean Air Act sets forth a&para;<br>federalism-focused regulatory strategy. The Act begins by&para;<br>declaring that “air pollution prevention (that is, the reduc­&para;<br>tion or elimination, through any measures, of the amount&para;<br>of pollutants produced or created at the source) and air&para;<br>pollution control at its source is the primary responsibility&para;<br>of States and local governments.” §7401(a)(3) (emphasis&para;<br>added). State primacy permeates Title I, which addresses&para;<br>the promulgation and implementation of NAAQS, in par­&para;<br>ticular. Under §7409(a), EPA must promulgate NAAQS&para;<br>for each pollutant for which air-quality criteria have been&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>here is even more categorical (“absolute”) than the provision at issue in&para;<br>&para;<br>American Trucking. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Section 7410(a)(1), in turn,&para;<br>requires each State, usually within three years of each&para;<br>new or revised NAAQS, to submit a SIP providing for its&para;<br>“implementation, maintenance, and enforcement.” EPA&para;<br>may step in to take over that responsibility if, and only if,&para;<br>a State discharges it inadequately. Specifically, if the&para;<br>Agency finds that a State has failed to make a required or&para;<br>complete submission or disapproves a SIP, it “shall prom­&para;<br>ulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2 years . . . , unless the&para;<br>State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA] approves the [SIP]&para;<br>or [SIP] revision.” §7410(c)(1).&para;<br>To describe the effect of this statutory scheme in simple&para;<br>terms: After EPA sets numerical air-quality benchmarks,&para;<br>“Congress plainly left with the States . . . the power to&para;<br>determine which sources would be burdened by regulation&para;<br>and to what extent.” Union Elec. Co., 427 U. S., at 269.&para;<br>The States are to present their chosen means of achieving&para;<br>EPA’s benchmarks in SIPs, and only if a SIP fails to meet&para;<br>those goals may the Agency commandeer a State’s author­&para;<br>ity by promulgating a FIP. “[S]o long as the ultimate&para;<br>effect of a State’s choice of emission limitations is compli­&para;<br>ance with the [NAAQS], the State is at liberty to adopt&para;<br>whatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited&para;<br>to its particular situation.” Train v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 421 U. S. 60, 79 (1975). EPA, we&para;<br>have emphasized, “is relegated by the Act to a secondary&para;<br>role in the process of determining and enforcing the specific, source-by-source emission limitations which are&para;<br>necessary if the [NAAQS] are to be met.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Good Neighbor Provision is one of the requirements&para;<br>with which SIPs must comply. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The&para;<br>statutory structure described above plainly demands that&para;<br>EPA afford States a meaningful opportunity to allocate&para;<br>reduction responsibilities among the sources within their&para;<br>borders. But the majority holds that EPA may in effect&para;<br>force the States to guess at what those responsibilities&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L.

In 1998, when it issued the NOX SIP&para;<br>Call under §7410(k)(5), EPA acknowledged that “[w]ithout&para;<br>determining an acceptable level of NOX reductions, the&para;<br>upwind State would not have guidance as to what is an&para;<br>acceptable submission.” 63 Fed. Reg. 57370. EPA deemed&para;<br>it “most efficient—indeed necessary—for the Federal&para;<br>government to establish the overall emissions levels for&para;<br>the various States.” Ibid. Accordingly, the Agency quanti­&para;<br>fied good-neighbor responsibilities and then allowed&para;<br>States a year to submit SIPs to implement them. Id., at&para;<br>57450–57451.&para;<br>Similarly, when EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate&para;<br>Rule (CAIR) in 2005 under §7410(c), it explicitly “recog­&para;<br>nize[d] that States would face great difficulties in develop­&para;<br>ing transport SIPs to meet the requirements of today’s&para;<br>action without th[e] data and policies” provided by the&para;<br>Rule, including “judgments from EPA concerning the&para;<br>appropriate criteria for determining whether upwind&para;<br>sources contribute significantly to downwind nonattain­&para;<br>ment under [§74]10(a)(2)(D).” 70 id., at 25268–25269.&para;<br>The Agency thus gave the States 18 months to submit&para;<br>SIPs implementing their new good-neighbor responsibili­&para;<br>ties. See id., at 25166–25167, 25176. Although EPA&para;<br>published FIPs before that window closed, it specified that&para;<br>they were meant to serve only as a “Federal backstop” and&para;<br>would not become effective unless necessary “a year after&para;<br>the CAIR SIP submission deadline.” 71 id., at 25330–&para;<br>25331 (2006).&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>EPA v.

Abuse of Discretion&para;<br>The majority attempts to place the blame for hollowing&para;<br>out the core of the Clean Air Act on “the Act’s plain text.”&para;<br>Ante, at 16. The first textual element to which it refers is&para;<br>§7410(c)’s requirement that after EPA has disapproved a&para;<br>SIP, it “shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2&para;<br>years.” That is to say, the Agency has discretion whether&para;<br>to act at once or to defer action until some later point&para;<br>during the 2-year period. But it also has discretion to&para;<br>work within the prescribed timetable to respect the right­&para;<br>ful role of States in the statutory scheme by delaying the&para;<br>issuance or enforcement of FIPs pending the resubmission&para;<br>and approval of SIPs—as EPA’s conduct surrounding&para;<br>CAIR clearly demonstrates. And all of this assumes that&para;<br>the Agency insists on disapproving SIPs before promulgat­&para;<br>ing the applicable good-neighbor standards—though in&para;<br>fact EPA has discretion to publicize those metrics before&para;<br>the window to submit SIPs closes in the first place.&para;<br>The majority states that the Agency “retained discretion&para;<br>to alter its course” from the one pursued in the NOX SIP&para;<br>Call and CAIR, ante, at 17, but that misses the point.&para;<br>The point is that EPA has discretion to arrange things so&para;<br>as to preserve the Clean Air Act’s core principle of state&para;<br>primacy—and that it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to&para;<br>do so. See §7607(d)(9)(A); see also 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)&para;<br>(identical text in the Administrative Procedure Act).&para;<br>Indeed, the proviso in §7410(c)(1) that the Agency’s au­&para;<br>thority to promulgate a FIP within the 2-year period&para;<br>terminates if “the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA]&para;<br>approves the [SIP] or [SIP] revision” explicitly contem­&para;<br>plates just such an arrangement.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 I am unimpressed, by the way, with the explanation that the majority accepts for EPA’s about-face: that the D.

From that premise, the&para;<br>majority reasons that “[h]ad Congress intended similarly&para;<br>to defer States’ discharge of their obligations under the&para;<br>Good Neighbor Provision, Congress . . . would have included&para;<br>a similar direction in that section.” Ante, at 17. Per­&para;<br>haps so. But EPA itself read the statute differently when&para;<br>it declared in the NOX SIP Call that “[d]etermining the&para;<br>overall level of air pollutants allowed to be emitted in a&para;<br>State is comparable to determining [NAAQS], which the&para;<br>courts have recognized as EPA’s responsibility, and is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>North Carolina v.

Nor can&para;<br>the encouragement to act illegally qualify as a “good reaso[n]” for an&para;<br>agency’s alteration of course under FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,&para;<br>556 U.
