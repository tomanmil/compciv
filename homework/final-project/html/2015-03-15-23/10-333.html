DAMON COOKE &para;<br>&para;<br>MATTHEW CATE, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA &para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND &para;<br>&para;<br>REHABILITATION v. ELIJAH CLAY &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10–333.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided January 24, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>I&para;<br>California’s parole statute provides that the Board of&para;<br>Prison Terms “shall set a release date unless it determines&para;<br>that . . . consideration of the public safety requires a more&para;<br>lengthy period of incarceration.” Cal. Penal Code Ann.&para;<br>§3041(b) (West Supp. 2010). If the Board denies parole,&para;<br>the prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas&para;<br>petition. The California Supreme Court has explained&para;<br>that “the standard of review properly is characterized as&para;<br>whether ‘some evidence’ supports the conclusion that the&para;<br>inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently&para;<br>is dangerous.” In re Lawrence, 44 Cal. 4th 1181, 1191, 190&para;<br>P. 3d 535, 539 (2008). See also In re Shaputis, 44 Cal. 4th&para;<br>1241, 1253–1254, 190 P. 3d 573, 580 (2008); In re Rosen&para;<br>krantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 625–626, 59 P. 3d 174, 183 (2002).&para;<br>A&para;<br>Respondent Damon Cooke was convicted of attempted&para;<br>first-degree murder in 1991, and a California court sen&para;<br>tenced him to an indeterminate term of seven years to life&para;<br>in prison with the possibility of parole. In November 2002,&para;<br>the board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for&para;<br>parole, basing its decision on the “especially cruel and&para;<br>callous manner” of his commitment offense, App. to Pet.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SWARTHOUT v. COOKE&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>for Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilita&para;<br>tive programs; his failure to develop marketable skills;&para;<br>and three incidents of misconduct while in prison. The&para;<br>board admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psy&para;<br>chological report, but it dismissed the report as not credi&para;<br>ble because it included several inconsistent and erroneous&para;<br>statements.&para;<br>Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in&para;<br>State Superior Court. The court denied his petition. “The&para;<br>record indicates,” it said, “that there was some evidence,&para;<br>including but certainly not limited to the life offense, to&para;<br>support the board’s denial.” Id., at 42a. Cooke subse&para;<br>quently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of&para;<br>Appeal and a petition for direct review by the California&para;<br>Supreme Court. Both were denied.&para;<br>In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition&para;<br>pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254 challenging the parole&para;<br>board’s determination. The District Court denied his&para;<br>petition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Cali&para;<br>fornia’s parole statute created a liberty interest protected&para;<br>by the Due Process Clause, and that “California’s ‘some&para;<br>evidence’ requirement” was a “component” of that feder&para;<br>ally protected liberty interest. Cooke v. Solis, 606 F. 3d&para;<br>1206, 1213 (2010). It then concluded that the state court&para;<br>had made an “unreasonable determination of the facts in&para;<br>light of the evidence” under §2254(d)(2) by finding any&para;<br>evidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public&para;<br>safety if released. Id., at 1215.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree&para;<br>murder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to&para;<br>imprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of&para;<br>parole. In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole,&para;<br>but the Governor exercised his authority to review the&para;<br>case and found Clay unsuitable for parole. See Cal.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Const., Art. 5, §8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §3041.2 (West&para;<br>2000). The Governor cited the gravity of Clay’s crime;&para;<br>his extensive criminal history, which reflected “the culmi&para;<br>nation of a life of crime,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;&para;<br>his failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his&para;<br>unrealistic plans for employment and housing after being&para;<br>paroled. Regarding the last factor, the Governor con&para;<br>cluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given&para;<br>his propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable&para;<br>means of employment.&para;<br>Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State&para;<br>Superior Court. That court denied Clay’s petition, as did&para;<br>the California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme&para;<br>Court denied review.&para;<br>Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus, which the District Court granted. The&para;<br>District Court concluded that the Governor’s reliance on&para;<br>the nature of Clay’s long-past commitment offense vio&para;<br>lated Clay’s right to due process, and dismissed each of&para;<br>the other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the&para;<br>record. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the&para;<br>District Court’s conclusion that “the Governor’s decision&para;<br>was an unreasonable application of California’s ‘some&para;<br>evidence’ rule and was an unreasonable determination of&para;<br>the facts in light of the evidence presented.” Clay v. Kane,&para;<br>384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that&para;<br>the state courts had misapplied California’s “some evi&para;<br>dence” rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either&para;<br>that federal habeas relief is available for an error of state&para;<br>law, or that correct application of the State’s “some evi&para;<br>dence” standard is required by the federal Due Process&para;<br>Clause. Neither assumption is correct.&para;<br>As to the first: The habeas statute “unambiguously&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SWARTHOUT v. COOKE&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>provides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas&para;<br>corpus to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground that he is in&para;<br>custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties&para;<br>of the United States.’ ” Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(a)). “We have stated many times that ‘federal&para;<br>habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”&para;<br>Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis&para;<br>v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780 (1990)).&para;<br>As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under&para;<br>that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether&para;<br>there exists a liberty or property interest of which a per&para;<br>son has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the&para;<br>procedures followed by the State were constitutionally&para;<br>sufficient. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490&para;<br>U. S. 454, 460 (1989). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that&para;<br>California law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1213. While we have no need to review that&para;<br>holding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.&para;<br>See Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369, 373–381&para;<br>(1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correc&para;<br>tional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 12 (1979).&para;<br>Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state&para;<br>interest created by California law. There is no right under&para;<br>the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released&para;<br>before the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States&para;<br>are under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners. Id., at&para;<br>7. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the&para;<br>Due Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindi&para;<br>cation—and federal courts will review the application of&para;<br>those constitutionally required procedures. In the context&para;<br>of parole, we have held that the procedures required are&para;<br>minimal. In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject&para;<br>to a parole statute similar to California’s received ade&para;<br>quate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be&para;<br>heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>parole was denied. 442 U. S., at 16. “The Constitution,”&para;<br>we held, “does not require more.” Ibid. Cooke and Clay&para;<br>received at least this amount of process: They were al&para;<br>lowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the&para;<br>evidence against them, were afforded access to their re&para;<br>cords in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why&para;<br>parole was denied. 606 F. 3d, at 1208–1212; App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 69a–80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§3041, 3041.5&para;<br>(West Supp. 2010).&para;<br>That should have been the beginning and the end of the&para;<br>federal habeas courts’ inquiry into whether Cooke and&para;<br>Clay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals reviewed the state courts’ decisions on the merits&para;<br>and concluded that they had unreasonably determined the&para;<br>facts in light of the evidence. See 606 F. 3d, at 1213–1216;&para;<br>384 Fed. Appx., at 545–546. Other Ninth Circuit cases&para;<br>have done the same. See, e.g., Pearson v. Muntz, 606 F. 3d&para;<br>606, 611 (2010). No opinion of ours supports converting&para;<br>California’s “some evidence” rule into a substantive fed&para;<br>eral requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the&para;<br>interest in receiving parole when the California standards&para;<br>for parole have been met, and the minimum procedures&para;<br>adequate for due-process protection of that interest are&para;<br>those set forth in Greenholtz.* See Hayward v. Marshall,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the&para;<br>revocation of good-time credits should apply, citing In re Rosenkrantz,&para;<br>29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59 P. 3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Su&para;<br>preme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in&para;<br>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472&para;<br>U. S. 445 (1985). But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate Califor&para;<br>nia’s parole system with good-time credits. It cites Hill twice. The first&para;<br>citation merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier&para;<br>opinion adopting the “some evidence” test for decisions to revoke parole&para;<br>that had previously been granted. 29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P. 3d, at 204.&para;<br>The second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discuss&para;<br>ing the need for “some evidence” review in parole decisions, simply&para;<br>borrows language from Hill to support the proposition that “ ‘[r]equiring&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SWARTHOUT v. COOKE&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>603 F. 3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc). Greenholtz did&para;<br>not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite&para;<br>procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that&para;<br>the evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern&para;<br>here whether California’s “some evidence” rule of judicial&para;<br>review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution de&para;<br>mands) was correctly applied.&para;<br>It will not do to pronounce California’s “some evidence”&para;<br>rule to be “a component” of the liberty interest, 606 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1213. Such reasoning would subject to federal-court&para;<br>merits review the application of all state-prescribed proce&para;<br>dures in cases involving liberty or property interests,&para;<br>including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That&para;<br>has never been the law. To the contrary, we have long&para;<br>recognized that “a ‘mere error of state law’ is not a denial&para;<br>of due process.” Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21&para;<br>(1982); see also Estelle, 502 U. S., at 67–68. Because the&para;<br>only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant&para;<br>inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not&para;<br>whether the state court decided the case correctly.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit’s questionable finding that there was&para;<br>no evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is&para;<br>irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as&para;<br>§2254(a) requires. See id., at 67. The short of the matter&para;<br>is that the responsibility for assuring that the constitu&para;<br>tionally adequate procedures governing California’s parole&para;<br>system are properly applied rests with California courts,&para;<br>and is no part of the Ninth Circuit’s business.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents’&para;<br>——————&para;<br>a modicum of evidence’ ” can “ ‘help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.’ ”&para;<br>29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P. 3d, at 205 (quoting Hill, 472 U. S., at 455). In&para;<br>any event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one&para;<br>of federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes&para;<br>close to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved&para;<br>by a subsequent footnote stating that the court’s decision is premised&para;<br>only on state law. 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n. 12, 59 P. 3d, at 205, n. 12.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.
