Respon&para;<br>dents, six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law,&para;<br>brought this federal civil rights action, claiming that the failure of&para;<br>the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal&para;<br>Due Process Clause. The District Court dismissed the case based on&para;<br>Circuit precedent, but, on appeal, the Seventh Circuit departed from&para;<br>that precedent and ruled for respondents. This Court granted certio&para;<br>rari to review the Seventh Circuit’s due process determination, but&para;<br>at oral argument the Court learned that all of the actual property&para;<br>disputes between the parties had been resolved.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The case is moot. The Constitution permits this Court to decide&para;<br>legal questions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Controver&para;<br>sies,” Art. III, §2, and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of&para;<br>review, not just when the complaint is filed, Preiser v. Newkirk, 422&para;<br>U. S. 395, 401. Here there is no longer any actual controversy re&para;<br>garding ownership or possession of the underlying property. There is&para;<br>no claim for damages before this Court; there is no properly certified&para;<br>class or dispute over class certification; and this case does not fit&para;<br>within the category of cases that are “capable of repetition” while&para;<br>“evading review.” Only an abstract dispute about the law remains.&para;<br>Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>2. The judgment below is vacated. In moot cases, this Court nor&para;<br>mally vacates the lower court judgment, which clears the path for re&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALVAREZ v.

Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.&para;<br>Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 25. This case more closely re&para;<br>sembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.&para;<br>In Bancorp, the party seeking review caused the mootness by volun&para;<br>tarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation. Here,&para;<br>the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no&para;<br>significant role in the termination of plaintiffs’ state-court forfeiture&para;<br>proceedings. Plaintiffs’ forfeiture cases took place with no procedural&para;<br>link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substan&para;<br>tive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Court’s knowledge,&para;<br>no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.&para;<br>This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary prac&para;<br>tice and order vacatur.

At the time of oral argument, however,&para;<br>we learned that the underlying property disputes have all&para;<br>ended. The State has returned all the cars that it seized,&para;<br>and the individual property owners have either forfeited&para;<br>any relevant cash or have accepted as final the State’s&para;<br>return of some of it. We consequently find the case moot,&para;<br>and we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals and remand the case to that court with instruc­&para;<br>tions to dismiss. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340&para;<br>U. S. 36, 39 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.&para;<br>Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp; E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac­&para;<br>tice 941–942 (9th ed. 2007).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALVAREZ v. SMITH &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal&para;<br>property (including cars and cash) used “to facilitate” a&para;<br>drug crime. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §570/505(a)(6) (West&para;<br>2008). It permits a police officer to seize that property&para;<br>without a warrant where (1) the officer has “probable&para;<br>cause to believe” the property was so used and (2) a “war­&para;<br>rantless seizure . . . would be reasonable” in the circum­&para;<br>stances. §570/505(b). When an officer has seized property&para;<br>without a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency&para;<br>must notify the State’s Attorney within 52 days of the&para;<br>seizure; the State’s Attorney must notify the property&para;<br>owner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45&para;<br>days; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the&para;<br>State’s Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings&para;<br>within yet a further 45 days. See ch. 725, §§150/5–150/6.&para;<br>Thus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly&para;<br>five months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings—&para;<br>during which time the statute permits the State to keep&para;<br>the car or cash within its possession.&para;<br>On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents&para;<br>or “plaintiffs”) brought this federal civil rights action&para;<br>against defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent&para;<br>of the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County&para;<br>State’s Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call&para;<br>the “State’s Attorney”). See Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1983. Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Ed­&para;<br>manuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in&para;<br>2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars&para;<br>without a warrant. See Complaint ¶25, App. 34a (Smith,&para;<br>seizure on Jan. 19, 2006); id., ¶26, at 34a (Perez, seizure&para;<br>on Mar. 8, 2006); id., ¶27, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on&para;<br>Apr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8,&para;<br>at 39a. The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk&para;<br>Yunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006&para;<br>police had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>warrant. See Complaint ¶28, at 34a–35a (Waldo, seizure&para;<br>on Jan. 20, 2006); id., ¶29, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on&para;<br>Sept. 26, 2006); id., ¶30, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July&para;<br>2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8, at 39a.&para;<br>The plaintiffs added that the police department still had&para;<br>custody of their property. See Complaint ¶¶24–30, at&para;<br>34a–35a. They claimed that the failure of the State to&para;<br>provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal&para;<br>Due Process Clause. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1. And&para;<br>they asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class ac­&para;<br>tion, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a&para;<br>prompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare&para;<br>that the hearing must take place within 10 days of any&para;<br>seizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants’ current practice&para;<br>of keeping the property in custody for a longer time with­&para;<br>out a judicial determination of probable cause. See Com­&para;<br>plaint ¶36, App. 36a.&para;<br>The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the&para;<br>ground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that&para;<br>“the Constitution does not require any procedure prior to&para;<br>the actual forfeiture proceeding.” Jones v. Takaki, 38&para;<br>F. 3d 321, 324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249).&para;<br>On February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the&para;<br>motion to dismiss. It also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for&para;<br>class certification. The plaintiffs appealed.&para;<br>On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal&para;<br>in the plaintiffs’ favor. Smith v. Chicago, 524 F. 3d 834.&para;<br>It reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent.&para;<br>Id., at 836–839. It held that “the procedures set out in”&para;<br>the Illinois statute “show insufficient concern for the due&para;<br>process right of the plaintiffs.” Id., at 838. And it added&para;<br>that, “given the length of time which can result between&para;<br>the seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner&para;<br>to contest the seizure under” Illinois law, “some sort of&para;<br>mechanism to test the validity of the retention of the&para;<br>property is required.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals re­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ALVAREZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>versed the judgment of the District Court and remanded&para;<br>the case for further proceedings. Id., at 839. Its mandate&para;<br>issued about seven weeks thereafter.&para;<br>On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit’s “due process” determination. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals then recalled its mandate. The parties&para;<br>filed briefs in this Court. We then recognized that&para;<br>the case might be moot, and we asked the parties to ad­&para;<br>dress the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral&para;<br>argument.&para;<br>At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that&para;<br>there was no longer any dispute about ownership or pos­&para;<br>session of the relevant property. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5&para;<br>(State’s Attorney); id., at 56–57 (plaintiffs). The State had&para;<br>returned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.&para;<br>See id., at 5. Two of the plaintiffs had “defaulted,” appar­&para;<br>ently conceding that the State could keep the cash. Ibid.&para;<br>And the final plaintiff and the State’s Attorney agreed&para;<br>that the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash&para;<br>at issue. Id., at 5, 56–57. As counsel for the State’s Attor­&para;<br>ney told us, “[T]hose cases are over.” Id., at 5.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal&para;<br>questions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Contro­&para;<br>versies.” U. S. Const., Art. III, §2. An “ ‘actual controversy&para;<br>must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the&para;<br>time the complaint is filed.’ ” Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S.&para;<br>395, 401 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.&para;<br>452, 459, n. 10 (1974)). In this case there is no longer any&para;<br>actual controversy between the parties about ownership or&para;<br>possession of the underlying property.&para;<br>The State’s Attorney argues that there is a continuing&para;<br>controversy over damages. We concede that the plaintiffs&para;<br>filed a motion in the District Court seeking damages. But&para;<br>the plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issued its opinion. And, after this Court granted certio­&para;<br>rari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the&para;<br>case away from the District Court before the District&para;<br>Court could respond to the motion. Thus, we have before&para;<br>us a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive&para;<br>relief, not damages.&para;<br>The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of&para;<br>a class. And a class might well contain members who&para;<br>continue to dispute ownership of seized property. But that&para;<br>fact is beside the point. The District Court denied the&para;<br>plaintiffs’ class certification motion. The plaintiffs did not&para;<br>appeal that denial. Hence the only disputes relevant here&para;<br>are those between these six plaintiffs and the State’s&para;<br>Attorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and&para;<br>those disputes are now over.&para;<br>United States Parole&para;<br>Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980) (“A named&para;<br>plaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press&para;<br>the appeal on the merits until a class has been properly&para;<br>certified”).&para;<br>The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawful­&para;<br>ness of the State’s hearing procedures. But that dispute is&para;<br>no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the&para;<br>plaintiffs’ particular legal rights. Rather, it is an abstract&para;<br>dispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs&para;<br>any more than it affects other Illinois citizens. And a&para;<br>dispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from&para;<br>any concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the&para;<br>scope of the constitutional words “Cases” and “Controver­&para;<br>sies.” See, e.g., Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S.&para;<br>472, 477 (1990); North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U. S. 244, 246&para;<br>(1971) (per curiam); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300&para;<br>U. S. 227, 241 (1937); Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653&para;<br>(1895).&para;<br>We can find no special circumstance here that might&para;<br>warrant our continuing to hear the case. We have some­&para;<br>times heard attacks on practices that no longer directly&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ALVAREZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>affect the attacking party, but are “capable of repetition”&para;<br>while “evading review.”&para;<br>See, e.g., Federal Election&para;<br>Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 462&para;<br>(2007); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S.&para;<br>498, 515 (1911). Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing&para;<br>suggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again&para;<br>prove subject to the State’s seizure procedures. See Los&para;<br>Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (“[T]he capable­&para;<br>of-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situa­&para;<br>tions, and generally only where the named plaintiff can&para;<br>make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected&para;<br>to the alleged illegality”); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S.&para;<br>312, 318–319 (1974) (per curiam). And in any event, since&para;<br>those who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices&para;<br>might bring damages actions, the practices do not “evade&para;<br>review.” See Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft,&para;<br>436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978) (damages claim saves case from&para;<br>mootness). Consequently, the case is moot. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Preiser, supra, at 403–404; Mills, supra, at 658.&para;<br>III&para;<br>It is less easy to say whether we should order the judg­&para;<br>ment below vacated. The statute that enables us to vacate&para;<br>a lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is&para;<br>flexible, allowing a court to “direct the entry of such ap­&para;<br>propriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such&para;<br>further proceedings to be had as may be just under the&para;<br>circumstances.” 28 U. S. C. §2106; see also U. S. Bancorp&para;<br>Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21&para;<br>(1994). Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the&para;<br>lower court judgment in a moot case because doing so&para;<br>“clears the path for future relitigation of the issues be­&para;<br>tween the parties,” preserving “the rights of all parties,”&para;<br>while prejudicing none “by a decision which . . . was only&para;<br>preliminary.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.&para;<br>In Bancorp, however, we described circumstances where&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>we would not do so. We said that, “[w]here mootness&para;<br>results from settlement” rather than “ ‘happenstance,’ ” the&para;<br>“losing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy . . .&para;<br>[and] thereby surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable&para;<br>remedy of vacatur.” 513 U. S., at 25. The plaintiffs, point­&para;<br>ing out that the State’s Attorney agreed to return all three&para;<br>cars and some of the cash, claim that, with respect to at&para;<br>least four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within Bancorp’s&para;<br>“settlement” exception.&para;<br>In our view, however, this case more closely resembles&para;<br>mootness through “happenstance” than through “settle­&para;<br>ment”—at least the kind of settlement that the Court&para;<br>considered in Bancorp. Bancorp focused upon a bank­&para;<br>ruptcy-related dispute that involved a legal question&para;<br>whether a bankruptcy court could lawfully confirm a&para;<br>debtor’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan if the plan relied&para;<br>upon what the debtor said was a special exception (called&para;<br>the “new value exception”) to ordinary creditor priority&para;<br>rules. Id., at 19–20. The parties contested that legal issue&para;<br>in the Bankruptcy Court; they contested it in an appeal of&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Court’s order to the Federal District&para;<br>Court; they contested it in a further appeal to the Court of&para;<br>Appeals; and eventually they contested it in this Court.&para;<br>Id., at 20. While the case was pending here, the parties&para;<br>settled their differences in the Bankruptcy Court (the&para;<br>court where the case originated)—including their differ­&para;<br>ences on this particular contested legal point. Ibid. They&para;<br>agreed upon a reorganization plan, which they said would&para;<br>constitute a settlement that mooted the federal case. Ibid.&para;<br>Recognizing that the reorganization plan that the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settle­&para;<br>ment that mooted the case, this Court did not vacate the&para;<br>lower court’s judgment. The Court’s reason for leaving the&para;<br>lower court’s judgment in place was that mootness was not&para;<br>a result of “the vagaries of circumstance.” Id., at 25.&para;<br>Rather the party seeking review had “caused the mootness&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ALVAREZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>by voluntary action.” Id., at 24 (emphasis added). By&para;<br>virtue of the settlement, that party had “voluntarily for­&para;<br>feited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal&para;<br>or certiorari.” Id., at 25. Hence, compared to mootness&para;<br>caused by “happenstance,” considerations of “equity” and&para;<br>“fairness” tilted against vacatur. Id., at 25–26.&para;<br>Applying these principles to the case before us, we&para;<br>conclude that the terminations here fall on the “happen­&para;<br>stance” side of the line. The six individual cases proceeded&para;<br>through a different court system without any procedural&para;<br>link to the federal case before us. To our knowledge (and&para;<br>we have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in&para;<br>those cases raised the procedural question at issue here.&para;<br>Rather, the issues in those six cases were issues solely of&para;<br>state substantive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeit­&para;<br>able or not? And court docket sheets suggest that the six&para;<br>state cases terminated on substantive grounds in the&para;<br>ordinary course of such state proceedings. In the three&para;<br>automobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the&para;<br>proceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40&para;<br>months after the seizures, a long enough time for the&para;<br>State to have investigated the matters and to have deter­&para;<br>mined (after the termination of any related criminal pro­&para;<br>ceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to&para;<br>claim the cars. See Dockets in People v. 2004 Chevrolet&para;<br>Impala, No. 2006–COFO–000296 (Cook County, IL)&para;<br>(Brunston’s car returned on July 27, 2009); People v.&para;<br>Smith, No. 2006–COFO–000036 (Cook County, IL)&para;<br>(Smith’s car returned on May 5, 2008); and People v. 1999&para;<br>Chevrolet Malibu, No. 2006–COFO–000288 (Cook County,&para;<br>IL) (Perez’s car returned on Jan. 29, 2007). In the remain­&para;<br>ing contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily&para;<br>dismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long&para;<br>enough time for the State to have weighed the evidence&para;<br>and found a compromise settlement appropriate on the&para;<br>merits. See Docket in People v. $1,500 in U. S. Currency,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 2006–COFO–000201 (Cook County, IL) (Waldo’s cash&para;<br>returned on Mar. 19, 2007). The disparate dates at which&para;<br>plaintiffs’ forfeiture proceedings terminated—11, 14, 27,&para;<br>and 40 months after the seizures—indicate that the&para;<br>State’s Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of plain­&para;<br>tiffs’ state-court cases, either with each other or with&para;<br>plaintiffs’ federal civil rights case. Cf. Munsingwear, 340&para;<br>U. S., at 39–40 (stating that a lower court judgment would&para;<br>have been vacated even though an action of the party&para;<br>seeking review had brought about the mootness because&para;<br>that action—a commodity being decontrolled by Executive&para;<br>Order—was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v.&para;<br>Munsingwear, Inc., 162 F. 2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947).&para;<br>For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this&para;<br>federal case played no significant role in the termination&para;<br>of the separate state-court proceedings. This conclusion is&para;<br>reinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware&para;<br>of Bancorp, suggested the contrary at oral argument.&para;<br>Indeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral&para;<br>argument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to&para;<br>avoid review in this case played no role at all in producing&para;<br>the state case terminations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–11, 33–38.&para;<br>And if the presence of this federal case played no role in&para;<br>causing the termination of those state cases, there is not&para;<br>present here the kind of “voluntary forfeit[ure]” of a legal&para;<br>remedy that led the Court in Bancorp to find that consid­&para;<br>erations of “fairness” and “equity” tilted against vacatur.&para;<br>We consequently conclude that we should follow our&para;<br>ordinary practice, thereby “clear[ing] the path for future&para;<br>relitigation of the issues.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.&para;<br>Thus, nothing in this opinion prevents the plaintiffs from&para;<br>bringing a claim for damages based on the conduct alleged&para;<br>in their complaint. Id., at 37–40.&para;<br>We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals and remand the case to that court with instructions&para;<br>to dismiss.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>_________________&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–351&para;<br>_________________&para;<br>&para;<br>ANITA ALVAREZ, COOK COUNTY STATE’S &para;<br>&para;<br>ATTORNEY, PETITIONER v. CHERMANE &para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[December 8, 2009] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in&para;<br>part.&para;<br>While I agree that this case is moot and join Parts I and&para;<br>II of the Court’s opinion, I would not vacate the judgment&para;<br>of the Court of Appeals. Following the teaching of our&para;<br>decision in U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall&para;<br>Partnership, 513 U. S. 18 (1994), I would apply the general&para;<br>rule against vacating appellate judgments that have be&para;<br>come moot because the parties settled.&para;<br>Bancorp set forth the basic principles for determining&para;<br>whether to vacate a case that has become moot. The&para;<br>overriding concern is equitable: “From the beginning we&para;<br>have disposed of moot cases in the manner ‘ “most conso&para;<br>nant to justice” . . . in view of the nature and character of&para;<br>the conditions which have caused the case to become&para;<br>moot.’ ” Id., at 24 (quoting United States v. HamburgAmerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, 239 U. S.&para;<br>466, 477–478 (1916), in turn quoting South Spring Hill&para;<br>Gold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., 145&para;<br>U. S. 300, 302 (1892) (alteration in original)). The “public&para;<br>interest” must be considered as part of this equitable&para;<br>inquiry, Bancorp, 513 U. S., at 26, 27, and that interest is&para;<br>generally better served by leaving appellate judgments&para;<br>intact. “ ‘Judicial precedents are presumptively correct&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALVAREZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>and valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are&para;<br>not merely the property of private litigants . . . .’ ” Id., at&para;<br>26 (quoting Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v.&para;<br>U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 40 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting)). Hence, we will typically vacate a judgment&para;<br>when the party seeking review has been “frustrated by the&para;<br>vagaries of circumstance” or “when mootness results from&para;<br>unilateral action of the party who prevailed below.” Ban&para;<br>corp, 513 U. S., at 25. But we will typically decline to&para;<br>vacate when “the party seeking relief from the judgment&para;<br>below caused the mootness by voluntary action,” id., at 24,&para;<br>including action taken in good faith and in conjunction&para;<br>with the opposing party. Even when “respondent agreed&para;<br>to [a] settlement that caused the mootness,” it remains&para;<br>“petitioner’s burden, as the party seeking relief from the&para;<br>status quo of the appellate judgment, to demonstrate not&para;<br>merely equivalent responsibility for the mootness, but&para;<br>equitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of&para;<br>vacatur.” Id., at 26. “[M]ootness by reason of settlement&para;<br>does not justify vacatur of a judgment under review.” Id.,&para;<br>at 29.&para;<br>In my view, the Court has misapplied these principles.&para;<br>To be sure, the “settlement” between the parties in this&para;<br>case might be distinguished from the more conventional&para;<br>settlement reached by the parties in Bancorp. And we&para;<br>have no evidence to suggest that petitioner returned re&para;<br>spondents’ property prior to the conclusion of our review&para;<br>with the purpose or expectation of manufacturing moot&para;<br>ness. Nevertheless, petitioner’s decision to return the&para;<br>automobiles when it did appears to have been legally&para;<br>discretionary, as was the “compromise settlement” that it&para;<br>reached with respondent Waldo regarding her cash, ante,&para;<br>at 8. In light of petitioner’s purposive and voluntary&para;<br>action that caused the mootness—along with its failure to&para;<br>alert us to the relevant facts or to explain why vacatur&para;<br>would serve the public interest—I believe it has failed to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>carry its burden to “demonstrate . . . equitable entitlement&para;<br>to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.” Bancorp, 513&para;<br>U. S., at 26.&para;<br>There was a third option for disposing of this case: We&para;<br>could have dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvi&para;<br>dently granted. Like denying the petition in the first&para;<br>place, that disposition would have preserved the judgment&para;<br>below. At the time we granted certiorari on February 23,&para;<br>2009, petitioner had already resolved the underlying&para;<br>property disputes for five of the six named respondents.&para;<br>See ante, at 4, 8–9. It was entirely predictable that the&para;<br>final settlement would soon follow. Moreover, the briefing&para;<br>in this case has revealed a disagreement over basic de&para;<br>scriptive questions of Illinois law, questions that were not&para;<br>passed upon below. Compare Brief for Petitioner 60–66&para;<br>with Brief for Respondents 41–44. And, of course, we have&para;<br>no way of knowing how the District Court would have&para;<br>applied the Court of Appeals’ remand order, which left it&para;<br>great discretion to “fashion appropriate procedural relief”&para;<br>“with the help of the parties.” Smith v. City of Chicago,&para;<br>524 F. 3d 834, 838 (CA7 2008). It has become clear that&para;<br>the Court was overhasty in deciding to review this case;&para;<br>the improvidence of our grant provides an additional&para;<br>reason why we should not vacate the work product of our&para;<br>colleagues on the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court’s opinion&para;<br>and from its judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
