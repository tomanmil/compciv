<span>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>JOSEPH E. CORCORAN v. MARK LEVENHAGEN, &para;<br>&para;<br>SUPERINTENDENT, INDIANA STATE PRISON &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–10495.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided October 20, 2009 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>An Indiana jury convicted Joseph Corcoran of four&para;<br>counts of murder. Corcoran was sentenced to death. After&para;<br>Corcoran’s challenges to his sentence in the Indiana courts&para;<br>failed, he sought federal habeas relief. Corcoran argued in&para;<br>his federal habeas petition that: (1) the Indiana trial court&para;<br>committed various errors at the sentencing phase; (2) his&para;<br>sentence violated the Sixth Amendment; (3) Indiana’s&para;<br>capital sentencing statute was unconstitutional; (4) the&para;<br>prosecution committed misconduct at sentencing; and (5)&para;<br>he should not be executed because he suffers from a men&para;<br>tal illness. See Corcoran v. Buss, 483 F. Supp. 2d 709,&para;<br>719, 726 (ND Ind. 2007). The District Court granted&para;<br>habeas relief on Corcoran’s claim of a Sixth Amendment&para;<br>violation, and ordered the state courts to resentence Cor&para;<br>coran to a penalty other than death. Id., at 725–726. The&para;<br>District Court did not address Corcoran’s other arguments&para;<br>relating to his sentence, noting that they were “rendered&para;<br>moot” by the order that Corcoran be resentenced because&para;<br>of the Sixth Amendment violation. Id., at 734.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court’s Sixth&para;<br>Amendment ruling. Corcoran v. Buss, 551 F. 3d 703, 712,&para;<br>714 (2008). Then, without mentioning Corcoran’s other&para;<br>sentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded “with&para;<br>instructions to deny the writ,” stating that “Indiana is at&para;<br>liberty to reinstate the death penalty.” Id., at 714. Cor&para;<br>coran sought rehearing, arguing that the Court of Appeals&para;<br>should have allowed the District Court to consider his&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CORCORAN v. LEVENHAGEN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>additional attacks on his sentence. But the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals denied rehearing, again without referring to Cor&para;<br>coran’s undecided claims.&para;<br>We now grant certiorari and hold that the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit erred in disposing of Corcoran’s other claims with&para;<br>out explanation of any sort. The Seventh Circuit should&para;<br>have permitted the District Court to consider Corcoran’s&para;<br>unresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or&para;<br>should have itself explained why such consideration was&para;<br>unnecessary.&para;<br>In its brief in opposition, the State argues that Cor&para;<br>coran’s claims were waived, and that they were in any&para;<br>event frivolous, so that a remand would be wasteful. Brief&para;<br>in Opposition 9–10. Nothing in the Seventh Circuit’s&para;<br>opinion, however, suggests that this was the basis for that&para;<br>court’s order that the writ be denied.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is vacated,&para;<br>and the case is remanded for further proceedings consis&para;<br>tent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
