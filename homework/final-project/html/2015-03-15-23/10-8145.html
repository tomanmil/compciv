CAIN, WARDEN&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE CRIMINAL DISTRICT COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>LOUISIANA, ORLEANS PARISH&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10–8145. Argued November 8, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012&para;<br>Petitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on&para;<br>the testimony of a single eyewitness. During state postconviction relief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by&para;<br>the eyewitness contradicting his testimony. Smith argued that the&para;<br>prosecution’s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v.&para;<br>Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady held that due process bars a State&para;<br>from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant’s guilt or punishment. See id., at 87. The state&para;<br>trial court rejected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of&para;<br>Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.&para;<br>Held: Brady requires that Smith’s conviction be reversed. The State&para;<br>does not dispute that the eyewitness’s statements were favorable to&para;<br>Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith. Under&para;<br>Brady, evidence is material if there is a “reasonable probability that,&para;<br>had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would&para;<br>have been different.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470. A “reasonable probability” means that the likelihood of a different result is&para;<br>great enough to “undermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.”&para;<br>Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434. Evidence impeaching an eyewitness’s testimony may not be material if the State’s other evidence&para;<br>is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. United States v.&para;<br>Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21. Here, however, the eyewitness’s testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime,&para;<br>and the eyewitness’s undisclosed statements contradicted his testimony. The eyewitness’s statements were plainly material, and the&para;<br>State’s failure to disclose those statements to the defense thus violated Brady.

BURL CAIN, WARDEN&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL&para;<br>DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA&para;<br>[January 10, 2012]&para;<br>&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the&para;<br>Court.&para;<br>The State of Louisiana charged petitioner Juan Smith&para;<br>with killing five people during an armed robbery. At&para;<br>Smith’s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith&para;<br>to the crime. Boatner testified that he was socializing at a&para;<br>friend’s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered&para;<br>the home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly thereafter began shooting, resulting in the death of five of&para;<br>Boatner’s friends. In court Boatner identified Smith as&para;<br>the first gunman to come through the door. He claimed&para;<br>that he had been face to face with Smith during the initial&para;<br>moments of the robbery. No other witnesses and no physical evidence implicated Smith in the crime.&para;<br>The jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree&para;<br>murder. The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith’s&para;<br>conviction. State v. Smith, 797 So. 2d 193 (2001). The&para;<br>Louisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this&para;<br>Court. 2001–2416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So. 2d 1189; 537 U. S.&para;<br>1201 (2003).&para;<br>Smith then sought postconviction relief in the state&para;<br>courts. As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>police investigation of his case, including those of the lead&para;<br>investigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ronquillo’s notes&para;<br>contain statements by Boatner that conflict with his testimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from&para;<br>the night of the murder state that Boatner “could not . . .&para;<br>supply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic]&para;<br>they were black males.” App. 252–253. Ronquillo also&para;<br>made a handwritten account of a conversation he had with&para;<br>Boatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said&para;<br>he “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t see faces”&para;<br>and “would not know them if [he] saw them.” Id., at 308.&para;<br>And Ronquillo’s typewritten report of that conversation&para;<br>states that Boatner told Ronquillo he “could not identify&para;<br>any of the perpetrators of the murder.” Id., at 259–260.&para;<br>Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing,&para;<br>inter alia, that the prosecution’s failure to disclose Ronquillo’s notes violated this Court’s decision in Brady v.&para;<br>Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The state trial court rejected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of&para;<br>Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We&para;<br>granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.&para;<br>Under Brady, the State violates a defendant’s right to&para;<br>due process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the&para;<br>defense and material to the defendant’s guilt or punishment. See 373 U. S., at 87. The State does not dispute&para;<br>that Boatner’s statements in Ronquillo’s notes were favorable to Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether&para;<br>Boatner’s statements were material to the determination&para;<br>of Smith’s guilt. We have explained that “evidence is&para;<br>‘material’ within the meaning of Brady when there is a&para;<br>reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470 (2009). A&para;<br>reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant&para;<br>“would more likely than not have received a different&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>verdict with the evidence,” only that the likelihood of a&para;<br>different result is great enough to “undermine[] confidence&para;<br>in the outcome of the trial.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.&para;<br>419, 434 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the State’s other evidence is&para;<br>strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See&para;<br>United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21&para;<br>(1976). That is not the case here. Boatner’s testimony&para;<br>was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And&para;<br>Boatner’s undisclosed statements directly contradict his&para;<br>testimony: Boatner told the jury that he had “[n]o doubt”&para;<br>that Smith was the gunman he stood “face to face” with on&para;<br>the night of the crime, but Ronquillo’s notes show Boatner&para;<br>saying that he “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t&para;<br>see faces” and “would not know them if [he] saw them.”&para;<br>App. 196, 200, 308. Boatner’s undisclosed statements&para;<br>were plainly material.&para;<br>The State and the dissent advance various reasons why&para;<br>the jury might have discounted Boatner’s undisclosed&para;<br>statements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made&para;<br>other remarks on the night of the murder indicating that&para;<br>he could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but&para;<br>not the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about&para;<br>which of Boatner’s contradictory declarations the jury&para;<br>would have believed. The State also contends that Boatner’s statements made five days after the crime can be&para;<br>explained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the&para;<br>record contains no evidence of any such fear. Again, the&para;<br>State’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have&para;<br>disbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us&para;<br>no confidence that it would have done so.&para;<br>The police files that Smith obtained in state postconviction proceedings contain other evidence that Smith contends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.&para;<br>Because we hold that Boatner’s undisclosed statements&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>alone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith’s conviction, we have no need to consider his arguments that the&para;<br>other undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under&para;<br>Brady.&para;<br>The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District&para;<br>Court of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded&para;<br>for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

S. 83 (1963), did not disclose that the&para;<br>eyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated shortly&para;<br>after the murders that he could not identify any of the&para;<br>perpetrators. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Smith&para;<br>has not shown a “reasonable probability” that the jury&para;<br>would have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.&para;<br>United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion&para;<br>of Blackmun, J.). That materiality determination must be&para;<br>made “in the context of the entire record,” United States v.&para;<br>Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112 (1976), and “turns on the cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government,” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995).&para;<br>Applying these principles, I would affirm the judgment&para;<br>of the Louisiana trial court.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The evidence presented at trial showed the following&para;<br>facts. On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several&para;<br>friends gathered at Rebe Espadron’s home in New Orleans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in&para;<br>the kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car&para;<br>without a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen’s&para;<br>outside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>their way through the door, demanding drugs and money.&para;<br>Tr. 153–154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door&para;<br>put a gun in Boatner’s face and pushed him backwards.&para;<br>Id., at 154–155. The men initially ordered Boatner and&para;<br>his friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand&para;<br>up. At that time, the man who had been the first one&para;<br>through the door placed his gun under Boatner’s chin. Id.,&para;<br>at 156–157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted&para;<br>him to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the&para;<br>head with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.&para;<br>Id., at 157–158.&para;<br>After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a&para;<br>back bedroom, where she had been when the men entered&para;<br>the house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to&para;<br>the kitchen, a man with a “covering” over his mouth pointed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at&para;<br>70–71. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back&para;<br>toward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened&para;<br>fire. Id., at 71–72, 159.&para;<br>When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A&para;<br>fifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally&para;<br>wounded and died later at the hospital. Of those originally gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,&para;<br>who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first&para;<br>man’s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who&para;<br>escaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had remained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police&para;<br>also found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.&para;<br>Young was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the&para;<br>head. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never&para;<br>seen Young before, the police surmised that Young had&para;<br>been one of the perpetrators.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was&para;<br>deemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>New Orleans police officer Joseph Narcisse was a first&para;<br>responder to the scene of the shooting. He testified at trial&para;<br>that he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espadron’s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the&para;<br>laceration to his head. According to Narcisse, “Mr. Boatner . . . had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.”&para;<br>Id., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that&para;<br>Boatner “had a description” of the person that he saw, the&para;<br>details of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at 32.&para;<br>Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the&para;<br>shootings, testified that Boatner had described the first&para;<br>man through the kitchen door as having a “short-type&para;<br>haircut,” “a lot of golds in his teeth,” and “brown-ski[n].”2&para;<br>Id., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that&para;<br>Boatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that&para;<br>Boatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the&para;<br>man initially came through the door and again when&para;<br>Boatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun&para;<br>to his chin. Id., at 117–118.&para;<br>Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months&para;<br>following the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person&para;<br>photograph arrays of potential suspects—only one of&para;<br>which contained a picture of Smith. Id., at 89–100. Three&para;<br>weeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with&para;<br>one of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.&para;<br>Ronquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the&para;<br>array had a “similar haircut” and “a similar expression on&para;<br>his face” as the “gentleman that came into the house&para;<br>initially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,” but that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>as a result of being shot. 1 Record 49.&para;<br>2 “Golds” are permanent or removable mouth jewelry, also referred to&para;<br>as “grills.” See Mouth Jewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South&para;<br>Florida Sun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p. 5, 2007 WLNR 2187080. See also&para;<br>A. Westbrook, Hip Hoptionary 59 (2002) (defining a “grill” as a “teeth&para;<br>cover, usually made of gold and diamonds”).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Boatner “was positive this wasn’t the individual.” Id., at&para;<br>97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months later, Ronquillo&para;<br>presented Boatner with the array that included a photograph of Smith. Tr. 99–101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo&para;<br>testified that Boatner identified Smith “immediately,”&para;<br>stating, “ ‘This is it. I’ll never forget that face.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith’s&para;<br>photograph was the only one that Boatner identified.&para;<br>Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to&para;<br>the stand during Smith’s trial. Boatner testified that&para;<br>Smith’s face was the “[s]ame face,” id., at 174, and that&para;<br>Smith’s mouth was the “[s]ame mouth” “full of gold,” ibid.,&para;<br>as that of the first man who came through the kitchen&para;<br>door on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that&para;<br>Smith’s hair at trial was “shaved on the sides” as it was&para;<br>during the crime, but that “the top was a little bit lower”&para;<br>at the time of the murders. Id., at 165. Boatner explained that, during the attack, he had focused on the first&para;<br>man through the door—who was unmasked—but that he&para;<br>“didn’t notice” the faces of any of the other assailants or&para;<br>whether they were masked. Id., at 154. On crossexamination, Boatner testified that he had described the&para;<br>first man’s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the&para;<br>police. Id., at 178.&para;<br>Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of firstdegree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review,&para;<br>Smith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.&para;<br>Smith argued that the State had failed to disclose various&para;<br>police notes revealing favorable evidence material to&para;<br>Smith’s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pretrial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita&para;<br>Russell and Espadron’s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial&para;<br>statement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; statements by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling’s&para;<br>fellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect&para;<br>Phillip Young. After holding a 4-day evidentiary hearing,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the postconviction judge—who had also presided over&para;<br>Smith’s 2-day trial—denied Smith’s Brady claims.&para;<br>Like the postconviction court below, I conclude that&para;<br>Smith is not entitled to a new trial under Brady. In my&para;<br>view, Smith has not established a reasonable probability&para;<br>that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have&para;<br>caused the jury to change its verdict.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by&para;<br>Boatner, which the Court concludes are “plainly material.”&para;<br>Ante, at 3. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a&para;<br>conversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that&para;<br>Boatner “could not . . . supply a description of the perpetrators other th[a]n they were black males.” 5 Record 809.&para;<br>Second, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a&para;<br>phone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five&para;<br>days after the murders, states that “Boatner . . . could not&para;<br>ID anyone because couldn’t see faces . . . glanced at 1st&para;<br>one—saw man—through door—can’t tell if had—faces&para;<br>covered didn’t see anyone . . . Could not ID—would not&para;<br>know them if—I saw them.” 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo’s&para;<br>typed summary of this note states that Boatner advised&para;<br>him that he “could not identify any perpetrators of the&para;<br>murder.” 5 id., at 817.&para;<br>Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could&para;<br>have been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during&para;<br>cross-examination. But the statements are not material&para;<br>for purposes of Brady because they cannot “reasonably be&para;<br>taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to&para;<br>undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles, 514 U. S., at&para;<br>435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that&para;<br>Boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,&para;<br>offered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occasions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>statements do not warrant a new trial.&para;<br>The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo’s&para;<br>on-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpetrator at the scene. Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner&para;<br>provided him with a description of the perpetrator that&para;<br>Boatner saw. Narcisse’s testimony thus corroborated&para;<br>Boatner’s trial testimony that he saw the first man and&para;<br>described him to police.3 Narcisse’s testimony also mitigated the impeachment value of Ronquillo’s on-scene note&para;<br>by indicating that, although Boatner may have provided&para;<br>no detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner&para;<br>had described the first man to another officer.4&para;<br>In any event, Ronquillo’s notes reflect that Boatner&para;<br>provided a description of the first perpetrator at the police&para;<br>station only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr.&para;<br>403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could “describe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.” 5&para;<br>Record 866. He responded: “I can tell you about one, the&para;<br>one who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male&para;<br>with a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complexion, brown skinned.” Ibid. When asked, “[Y]ou say you&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 In&para;<br>&para;<br>a pretrial hearing, Boatner testified that he “gave a description&para;<br>to the officer that came to the scene.” Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner&para;<br>responded negatively when asked whether this officer was Detective&para;<br>Ronquillo. Ibid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that&para;<br>the first man through the door was “heavy built with his hair with a&para;<br>fade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his mouth.” Ibid.&para;<br>That testimony was consistent with the testimony that Boatner and&para;<br>Officer Narcisse gave at trial.&para;<br>4 Moreover, Boatner’s reticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the&para;<br>crime was entirely understandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postconviction hearing, “there were dead bodies everywhere,” and Boatner was&para;<br>“a little shook up.” Id., at 402–403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse&para;<br>testified at trial that Boatner, while “not as frantic” as Espadron, was a&para;<br>“bit emotional” when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. Id., at 34&para;<br>(Dec. 4, 1995).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>can’t describe any of the other shooters besides the one&para;<br>who put the gun in your face after you opened the door,”&para;<br>Boatner replied, “No, I can’t.” Ibid. In his brief, Smith&para;<br>cites this station house statement as an example of favorable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually&para;<br>corroborates Boatner’s trial testimony that he saw and&para;<br>described the first perpetrator to police and that he did not&para;<br>get a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the&para;<br>description Boatner provided was consistent with Smith’s&para;<br>appearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner’s&para;<br>station house statement, but our cases instruct us to&para;<br>evaluate “the net effect of the evidence withheld by the&para;<br>State” in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at 421–&para;<br>422.&para;<br>The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the&para;<br>first perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the&para;<br>crime, but also that Boatner described him again three&para;<br>weeks later when he viewed a photograph array and eliminated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before&para;<br>the jury further indicated that, several months after the&para;<br>crime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array,&para;<br>after evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month&para;<br>investigative period. What is more, the reliability of&para;<br>Boatner’s out-of-court identification was extensively tested&para;<br>during cross-examination at Smith’s trial. In particular,&para;<br>Boatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith’s&para;<br>picture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect&para;<br>had tainted his identification. Boatner did not waiver,&para;<br>responding, “I picked out the person I seen come in that&para;<br>house that held a gun to my head and under my chin and&para;<br>the person that was there when all my friends died.” Tr.&para;<br>190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That Boatner credibly rejected defense&para;<br>counsel’s “suggestion” theory is supported by the fact that&para;<br>Boatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling—&para;<br>whose photograph was included in a separate array shown&para;<br>to Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Smith—even though Trackling’s picture was next to&para;<br>Smith’s in the same newspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.&para;<br>When weighed against Boatner’s repeated and consistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court&para;<br>identifications, Boatner’s March 6 statement is also immaterial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo’s note of his March&para;<br>6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contradiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although&para;<br>the note states that Boatner “didn’t see anyone,” it also&para;<br>states that Boatner “glanced at 1st one—saw man—&para;<br>through door.” 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is consistent with Boatner’s repeated statements that he only&para;<br>saw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury&para;<br>would have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner’s&para;<br>statement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five&para;<br>days after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators&para;<br>were still at large. The jury would have considered Boatner’s trial testimony that, following the murders of his&para;<br>friends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleeping, quit his job, and began drinking heavily—so much so&para;<br>that he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treatment and grief counseling. Tr. 162–163, 170–171, 182&para;<br>(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6&para;<br>note would have been further mitigated by the fact that,&para;<br>as Ronquillo explained, “on the night of the incident&para;<br>[Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he&para;<br>gave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith’s&para;<br>description.” Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following&para;<br>his March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed&para;<br>numerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetrator, and ultimately identified him as Smith.&para;<br>Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo’s&para;<br>notes of Boatner’s on-scene and March 6 statements, it&para;<br>might have believed that Boatner could not identify any of&para;<br>the perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is&para;<br>insufficient to establish a Brady violation.

S., at 109–110 (“The mere possibility that an item of&para;<br>undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or&para;<br>might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” Rather,&para;<br>a “petitioner’s burden is to establish a reasonable probability of a different result.” Strickler, supra, at 291.&para;<br>Instead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable probability that Boatner’s undisclosed statements would have&para;<br>caused the jury to acquit, the Court improperly requires&para;<br>the State to show that the jury would have given Boatner’s&para;<br>undisclosed statements no weight. See ante, at 3 (“[T]he&para;<br>State’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have&para;<br>disbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us&para;<br>no confidence that it would have done so”). But Smith&para;<br>is not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury&para;<br>could have accorded some weight to Boatner’s undisclosed&para;<br>statements.

One undated note, which&para;<br>contains several entries about various aspects of the investigation, states, “female—face down against cabinets—&para;<br>conscious.” On the next line, the note continues, “said—in&para;<br>kitchen saw people barge in—one—black cloth across&para;<br>face—first one through door—[no further statement].” 13&para;<br>Record 2556.

CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>statement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note&para;<br>was in his handwriting, but he testified that he never&para;<br>talked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was&para;<br>made, and that someone else could have relayed the information to him. Tr. 415–418 (Jan. 22, 2009).5 I will&para;<br>assume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it&para;<br>would have been admissible at Smith’s trial as a dying&para;<br>declaration of Russell.6 But the note would have had&para;<br>minimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith’s&para;<br>assertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which&para;<br>the statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that&para;<br>Russell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in&para;<br>“bad condition.” Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995). Similarly, Reginald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she&para;<br>was “whining” and he “didn’t catch nothing [t]hat she&para;<br>said.” Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith&para;<br>contends that the note says “exactly” that the “first person&para;<br>through the door had a black cloth across his face,” that&para;<br>is not how the note reads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11&para;<br>(emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)&para;<br>(hereinafter Reply Brief). The note first states that the&para;<br>declarant “saw people barge in,” then states “one—black&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Russell did not make this statement to Officer Narcisse. He testified that Russell “was not able to give us any information or any details&para;<br>of what had happened.” Id., at 20.&para;<br>6 Louisiana law provides that “[a] statement made by a declarant&para;<br>while believing that his death was imminent, concerning the cause or&para;<br>circumstances of what he believed to be his impending death[,]” is “not&para;<br>excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.” La. Code Evid. Ann., Art. 804(B)(2) (West Supp. 2012). Assuming this statement was actually Russell’s, it likely qualifies as a dying&para;<br>declaration. At trial, Boatner testified that, in the aftermath of the&para;<br>shooting, Russell told him, “Feel like I’m about to die.” Tr. 161 (Dec. 5,&para;<br>1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Espadron also testified that&para;<br>Russell told her, “I’m gonna die,” and, “Don’t let me die.” Id., at 73–74&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

It is at&para;<br>least as logical to read this statement as indicating only&para;<br>that “one” of the “people” had a “black cloth across [his]&para;<br>face.” Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing&para;<br>further after “first one through door,” and it is impossible&para;<br>to know whether the “first one” was also the “one” with a&para;<br>“black cloth across [his] face.”&para;<br>The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale&para;<br>Mims, who lived down the street from Espadron’s home&para;<br>and who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states&para;<br>that Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron’s home, “all&para;<br>wearing mask[s].” Id., at 2518. Like Russell’s purported&para;<br>statement, this statement has minimal impeachment&para;<br>value in light of the record. Mims’ undisclosed statement&para;<br>does not address whether some or all of the perpetrators&para;<br>were masked inside Espadron’s home.7 Moreover, had&para;<br>Mims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably&para;<br>would have testified, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that he was “positive” that he only saw three perpetrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were&para;<br>masked. Tr. 269, 271–273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).&para;<br>Both Russell’s purported statement and Mims’ testimony are consistent with Boatner’s testimony that he did not&para;<br>know whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,&para;<br>id., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Narcisse’s and&para;<br>Espadron’s testimony that the single perpetrator whom&para;<br>Espadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover——————&para;<br>7 Smith ridicules the “exceedingly peculiar” notion that the perpetrators would have remained unmasked inside Espadron’s home, only to&para;<br>mask themselves before leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12–13. But that&para;<br>notion is eminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre&para;<br>the witnesses who were inside the home—as they did—and were&para;<br>concerned only with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who&para;<br>might see or hear the burglary.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing, id., at 30–31 (Dec. 4, 1995); id., at 71 (Dec. 5, 1995).&para;<br>Thus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but&para;<br>not all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that&para;<br>in no way undermines Boatner’s consistent assertions that&para;<br>the only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Smith also contends that Ronquillo’s undisclosed note&para;<br>documenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner&para;<br>Kenneth Leary is material for purposes of Brady. The&para;<br>note states that “Leary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM&para;<br>ammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]&para;<br>was typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], ‘Mac[-]&para;<br>11’ model type, semi automatic weapon.” 5 Record 831.&para;<br>According to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary’s&para;<br>trial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found&para;<br>at the scene “was fired by one particular weapon, one 9millimeter handgun,” Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an&para;<br>Intratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a “handgun.” Smith further argues that Leary’s pretrial statement could have&para;<br>been used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution&para;<br>attempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that&para;<br>Shelita Russell’s wounds could have been inflicted by a&para;<br>9-millimeter “handgun,” id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by&para;<br>calling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under&para;<br>his chin was a 9-millimeter silver “hand gun,” id., at 157&para;<br>(Dec. 5, 1995).&para;<br>Contrary to Smith’s contentions, Leary’s pretrial statement does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.&para;<br>Leary’s pretrial statement is consistent with his and&para;<br>Boatner’s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11&para;<br>pistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that&para;<br>such a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 48. Moreover, a “handgun” is simply “[a] firearm that can be used with one hand,” American Heritage&para;<br>Dictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Intratec or Mac-11 pistol can be used with one hand.&para;<br>Smith nonetheless insists that, “as a colloquial matter,&para;<br>machine pistols of the Intratec or MAC-11 type would be&para;<br>considered automatic or semiautomatic weapons, rather&para;<br>than handguns.” Reply Brief 18. But even assuming that&para;<br>Smith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms&para;<br>expert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather&para;<br>than technical terminology.8&para;<br>The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used&para;<br>the term “handgun,” he did not understand it to exclude&para;<br>automatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the immediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial,&para;<br>Boatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a “Ma[c]&para;<br>10” or “Tech Nine” “Uzi” type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5,&para;<br>1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that&para;<br>weapon as a “handgun,” id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner’s&para;<br>pretrial description of the silver or chrome “handgun” that&para;<br>the first man held was consistent with Leary’s undisclosed&para;<br>statement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In&para;<br>his station house statement, Boatner described the first&para;<br>man’s weapon as a “big,” “automatic pistol.” Id., at 813,&para;<br>866. Because Leary’s pretrial statement is neither impeaching nor exculpatory, Leary’s undisclosed statement&para;<br>cannot form the basis of a Brady violation. See Strickler,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Smith&para;<br>&para;<br>argues that Leary himself considered an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]&para;<br>11’ ” model type to be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith&para;<br>relies on the fact that Leary’s pretrial statement indicated that the&para;<br>ammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun&para;<br>recovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders.&para;<br>Id., at 18. Leary’s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun&para;<br>recovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith’s representation. More importantly, Leary’s statement suggests only that&para;<br>Bannister’s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at&para;<br>the scene, not that Leary did not consider an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]11’ ”&para;<br>model type to be a handgun.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>527 U. S., at 281–282 (To make out a Brady violation, “[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the&para;<br>accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is&para;<br>impeaching”).&para;<br>D&para;<br>Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and material undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert&para;<br>Trackling, a member of the “Cut Throat Posse” street gang&para;<br>with which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric&para;<br>Rogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.&para;<br>5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an&para;<br>interview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which&para;<br>he described a conversation that he had with Trackling&para;<br>while in prison. During that conversation, Trackling&para;<br>described the murders at Espadron’s home and stated that&para;<br>he had committed the crime along with “Fat, Buckle, and&para;<br>a guy they call uh, Short Dog.” Id., at 841. According to&para;<br>Rogers, Fat’s real name was “Darnell [Donielle] Banister,”&para;<br>Buckle’s real name was “Contez [Kintad] Phillips,” and&para;<br>Short Dog’s real name was “Juan.” Id., at 843–844.&para;<br>Smith contends that Rogers’ interview was exculpatory&para;<br>in two respects. First, he points to the following comment&para;<br>by Rogers later during the interview: “They call Contez&para;<br>Philip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog&para;<br>that’s what they call him, they call Robert Home.” Id., at&para;<br>845. Smith suggests that Rogers’ prior identification of&para;<br>“Short Dog” as “Juan [Smith]” was equivocal in light of his&para;<br>later statement that “Short Dog” was a man named “Robert Home.” Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that&para;<br>disclosure of Rogers’ interview would have led the defense&para;<br>and the jury to learn of Rogers’ allegation—made for the&para;<br>first time 10 years after Smith’s trial—that the police had&para;<br>asked him to implicate Juan Smith as “Short Dog,” Tr.&para;<br>284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009).&para;<br>Neither argument is persuasive. If the jury had learned&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of Rogers’ statement, it would have heard information&para;<br>directly inculpating Smith as “Short Dog,” a perpetrator of&para;<br>the shootings. Rogers’ physical description of “Short&para;<br>Dog”—“he[’s] short[,] he[’s] got golds going across his&para;<br>mouth[,] and . . . he’s like built,” 5 Record 844–also corroborated Boatner’s description of the first man through the&para;<br>door as having a “mouth full of gold” and a “heavy” build.&para;<br>Furthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information&para;<br>documented in Ronquillo’s notes of Rogers’ statement.&para;<br>Those notes reflect Trackling’s own interview with police&para;<br>on June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips,&para;<br>Bannister, and “Juan Smith” as the perpetrators of the&para;<br>murders at Espadron’s home. Id., at 832; see also id., at&para;<br>854–855. Trackling’s statement only strengthens the&para;<br>inculpatory nature of Rogers’ interview.&para;<br>Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed&para;<br>Smith’s suggestion that Rogers identified “Short Dog” as a&para;<br>man named “Robert Home.” When this statement is taken&para;<br>in context, it appears that Rogers was describing the&para;<br>nickname—“Home”9—of Robert Trackling, the “Robert”&para;<br>whom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his&para;<br>interview. See id., at 839–850. Indeed, Rogers’ phraseology, “they call Robert Home,” was consistent with his previous comments that “[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,”&para;<br>and “they call Darnell Banister Fat.” Id., at 845 (emphasis&para;<br>added). Unsurprisingly, in the thousands of pages of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See 2 Dictionary of American Regional English 1064–1065, 1069 (F.&para;<br>Cassidy &amp; J. Hall eds. 1991) (defining “Home” as “a term of address&para;<br>used by two black people either from the same Southern state or simply&para;<br>from the South,” similar to “homey” or “home boy”); 2 Green’s Dictionary of Slang 828 (2010) (defining “home,” an abbreviation of homeboy,&para;<br>as “a friend, often used in direct address”); Concise New Partridge&para;<br>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (T.

CAIN&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>record material, I have not found, nor have the parties&para;<br>cited, a single reference to anyone named “Robert Home.”&para;<br>If the jury had heard Rogers’ postconviction testimony&para;<br>that police asked him to implicate Smith and that Trackling’s description of the murders did not include Smith, Tr.&para;<br>284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009), it would have weighed Rogers’&para;<br>allegation against Trackling’s own statement to the police&para;<br>that Smith had participated in the murders at Espadron’s&para;<br>home, 5 Record 832. The prosecution also would have&para;<br>called Smith’s sister, Trinieze Smith, to testify that she&para;<br>believed her brother was known as “Short Dog,” as she did&para;<br>at the postconviction hearing. Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009). On&para;<br>this record, the undisclosed statements by Rogers and&para;<br>Trackling actually strengthen rather than weaken confidence in the jury’s guilty verdict.10&para;<br>E&para;<br>Finally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten&para;<br>note by Ronquillo documenting a statement by Phillip&para;<br>Young—the man found injured at the scene and suspected&para;<br>of having participated in the crime—is also material evidence warranting a new trial. At trial, Ronquillo testified&para;<br>that he met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a&para;<br>result of permanent brain damage suffered in the shoot——————&para;<br>10 Detective Byron Adams, who took Rogers’ statement, did not testify&para;<br>at the postconviction hearing because he had died in the meantime. He&para;<br>thus had no opportunity to address Rogers’ recantation or his newly&para;<br>minted allegation that Detective Adams asked Rogers to implicate&para;<br>Smith. Smith argues that “there is no reason to believe that . . . Adams&para;<br>would have contradicted Rogers—much less that the jury would have&para;<br>believed [him] if [he] did.” Reply Brief 21. But Smith offers no support&para;<br>for his dubious assertion that Detective Adams would have admitted to&para;<br>framing Smith, or that, had the detective denied the allegation, the jury&para;<br>would have believed Rogers—a convicted murderer who never explained any motive Adams would have had to frame Smith—over the&para;<br>detective.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

He really couldn’t talk,&para;<br>[h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all.&para;<br>He couldn’t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube&para;<br>by the people there. He was in really bad shape.” Id., at&para;<br>102–103. When asked whether Young was able to communicate with him “at all,” Ronquillo responded, “No. I&para;<br>couldn’t understand anything that he was saying.” Id., at&para;<br>103.&para;<br>The undisclosed note from Ronquillo’s meeting with&para;<br>Young reads as follows: “Short Dog/Bucko/Fats—No—&para;<br>Didn’t shoot me—No—Not with me when went to house—&para;<br>Yes—one of people in house shot me—No—Not responsible—‘Posse’—Didn’t drive to house—‘Posse’—Yes—Knows&para;<br>names of perps—Yes—Drove in car—Yes—girlfriend’s&para;<br>car.” 13 Record 2568. Smith contends that this note is&para;<br>exculpatory in that it suggests that he was “not involved”&para;<br>in the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.&para;<br>Young’s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes&para;<br>(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, “Short Dog”&para;<br>and a member of the “Cut Throat Posse.” Such a concession would only have strengthened the inculpatory value&para;<br>of the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that&para;<br>Smith was the “Short Dog” who committed the murders at&para;<br>Espadron’s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of&para;<br>the note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is&para;<br>unclear whether Ronquillo’s note reflects a statement by&para;<br>Young that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting&para;<br>the victims or a statement that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that&para;<br>“Short Dog” and others were not with Young when he went&para;<br>to the house is certainly not a clear statement that “Short&para;<br>Dog” did not commit the murders, especially in light of&para;<br>evidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v.

Accordingly,&para;<br>Ronquillo explained, “I never had hide nor hair actually of&para;<br>what [Young] said.” Id., at 423.&para;<br>The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo’s note, of&para;<br>unclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop&para;<br>of doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communicated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence&para;<br>against the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner’s descriptions and identifications and Rogers’ and Trackling’s&para;<br>statements, which corroborated Boatner’s identification.&para;<br>When all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it&para;<br>must be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability&para;<br>that the jury would have reached a different verdict.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 In&para;<br>&para;<br>his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car&para;<br>that arrived at Espadron’s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers’&para;<br>interview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from&para;<br>Espadron’s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.&para;<br>12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undisclosed note to impeach Ronquillo’s trial testimony that Young was not&para;<br>able to communicate with him “at all.” That argument lacks merit.&para;<br>Ronquillo’s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that&para;<br>no communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he&para;<br>simply “couldn’t understand anything that [Young] was saying.” See Tr.&para;<br>103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with&para;<br>the garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,&para;<br>if any, impeachment value.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.
