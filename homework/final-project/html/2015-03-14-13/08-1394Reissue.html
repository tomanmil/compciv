UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1394. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010&para;<br>Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in&para;<br>Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company&para;<br>in America. Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was&para;<br>Enron’s chief executive officer from February until August 2001,&para;<br>when he resigned. Less than four months later, Enron crashed into&para;<br>bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value. After an investigation&para;<br>uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron’s stock prices by&para;<br>overstating the company’s financial well-being, the Government&para;<br>prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the&para;<br>scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of&para;<br>command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.&para;<br>These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme&para;<br>to deceive investors about Enron’s true financial performance by ma&para;<br>nipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false&para;<br>and misleading statements. Count 1 of the indictment charged Skill&para;<br>ing with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit “honest-services” wire&para;<br>fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its&para;<br>shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services. Skilling&para;<br>was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud,&para;<br>wire fraud, making false representations to Enron’s auditors, and in&para;<br>sider trading.&para;<br>In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contend&para;<br>ing that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pre&para;<br>trial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. He submitted hundreds&para;<br>of news reports detailing Enron’s downfall, as well as affidavits from&para;<br>experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in&para;<br>comparison to other potential venues. The District Court denied the&para;<br>motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presump&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.&para;<br>Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed,&para;<br>media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional,&para;<br>and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational. More&para;<br>over, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.&para;<br>In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for ques&para;<br>tions it might use to screen prospective jurors. Rejecting the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling’s more probing and&para;<br>specific questions, the court converted Skilling’s submission, with&para;<br>slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document. The&para;<br>questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news&para;<br>and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron&para;<br>and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and&para;<br>their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company&para;<br>and to anyone affected by its demise. The court then mailed the&para;<br>questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from&para;<br>nearly all of them. It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 indi&para;<br>viduals, and the parties, with the court’s approval, further winnowed&para;<br>the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical dis&para;<br>ability. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospec&para;<br>tive juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the de&para;<br>fendants would prevent her from being impartial.&para;<br>In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skill&para;<br>ing’s co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty. Skilling re&para;<br>newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror question&para;<br>naires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey’s&para;<br>guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. The court again declined to&para;<br>move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided&para;<br>safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. The court also de&para;<br>nied Skilling’s request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that&para;<br>potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with law&para;<br>yers. But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask&para;<br>follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined&para;<br>individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants&para;<br>jointly two extra peremptory challenges.&para;<br>Voir dire began in January 2006. After questioning the venire as a&para;<br>group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking&para;<br>each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any&para;<br>stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers&para;<br>that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permit&para;<br>ted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties’&para;<br>challenges for cause. Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective&para;<br>jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to&para;<br>empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates. After a 4-month trial, the jury&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud&para;<br>conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts.&para;<br>On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here. First, he&para;<br>contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented&para;<br>him from obtaining a fair trial. Second, he alleged that the jury im&para;<br>properly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire&para;<br>fraud. As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that&para;<br>the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron’s&para;<br>collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. Stating, however,&para;<br>that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire,&para;<br>found it “proper and thorough,” and held that the District Court had&para;<br>empaneled an impartial jury. The Court of Appeals also rejected&para;<br>Skilling’s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to&para;<br>commit honest-services fraud. It did not address Skilling’s argument&para;<br>that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his ac&para;<br>tions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skill&para;<br>ing from obtaining a fair trial. He did not establish that a presump&para;<br>tion of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that&para;<br>tried him. Pp. 11–34.&para;<br>(a) The District Court did not err in denying Skilling’s requests&para;<br>for a venue transfer. Pp. 11–19.&para;<br>(1) Although the Sixth Amendment and Art. III, §2, cl. 3, pro&para;<br>vide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was&para;<br>committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer&para;<br>of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice&para;<br>will prevent a fair trial. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(2) The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice&para;<br>from which the Fifth Circuit’s analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisi&para;<br>ana, 373 U. S. 723. Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kid&para;<br>naped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interro&para;<br>gated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his&para;<br>confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised&para;<br>three times to large local audiences shortly before trial. After the&para;<br>Louisiana trial court denied Rideau’s change-of-venue motion, he was&para;<br>convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal. This&para;<br>Court reversed. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and&para;<br>heard it,” the Court explained, the interrogation “in a very real sense&para;<br>was Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded guilty.”&para;<br>Id., at 726.&para;<br>“[W]ithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire,” the Court held that&para;<br>the “kangaroo court proceedings” trailing the televised confession vio&para;<br>lated due process. Id., at 726–727. The Court followed Rideau in two&para;<br>other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>prosecutions. However, it later explained that those decisions “can&para;<br>not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to . . .&para;<br>news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively deprives the de&para;<br>fendant of due process.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798–799.&para;<br>Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror&para;<br>impartiality does not require ignorance. See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366&para;<br>U. S. 717, 722. A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme&para;<br>case. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(3) Important differences separate Skilling’s prosecution from&para;<br>those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice. First, the&para;<br>Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community&para;<br>in which the crime occurred. In contrast to the small-town setting in&para;<br>Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nation’s&para;<br>fourth most populous city. Given the large, diverse pool of residents&para;<br>eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals&para;<br>could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain. Second, al&para;<br>though news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no&para;<br>blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideau’s dramatically&para;<br>staged admission of guilt. Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in&para;<br>which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years&para;<br>elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skilling’s trial. Although&para;<br>reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the&para;<br>decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years&para;<br>following Enron’s collapse. Finally, and of prime significance, Skill&para;<br>ing’s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly,&para;<br>earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelm&para;<br>ing victory for the Government. It would be odd for an appellate&para;<br>court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors’ actions run&para;<br>counter to that presumption. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>(4) The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily&para;<br>on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed&para;<br>at Enron. But “pretrial publicity—even pervasive, adverse public&para;<br>ity—does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press&para;<br>Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554. Here, news stories about Enron&para;<br>did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court&para;<br>has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Hous&para;<br>ton’s size and diversity diluted the media’s impact. Nor did Enron’s&para;<br>sheer number of victims trigger a presumption. Although the wide&para;<br>spread community impact necessitated careful identification and in&para;<br>spection of prospective jurors’ connections to Enron, the extensive&para;<br>screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose&para;<br>links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated. Finally, while&para;<br>Causey’s well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial&para;<br>created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropri&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ate steps to mitigate that risk. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>(b) No actual prejudice contaminated Skilling’s jury. The Court&para;<br>rejects Skilling’s assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect&para;<br>and defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.&para;<br>Pp. 20–34.&para;<br>(1) No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or&para;<br>breadth of voir dire. Jury selection is “particularly within the prov&para;<br>ince of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594–595.&para;<br>When pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, “primary reliance on&para;<br>the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense” be&para;<br>cause the judge “sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have&para;<br>had its effect” and may base her evaluation on her “own perception of&para;<br>the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.”&para;<br>Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427. The Court considers the ade&para;<br>quacy of jury selection in Skilling’s case attentive to the respect due&para;<br>to district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the&para;<br>measures necessary to ensure that impartiality. Pp. 20–21.&para;<br>(2) Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of consti&para;<br>tutional requirements. The jury-selection process was insufficient,&para;<br>Skilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of&para;<br>the District Court’s questions were conclusory and failed adequately&para;<br>to probe jurors’ true feelings, and the court consistently took prospec&para;<br>tive jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no mat&para;<br>ter any other indications of bias. This Court’s review of the record,&para;<br>however, yields a different appraisal. The District Court initially&para;<br>screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehen&para;<br>sive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey&para;<br>helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served&para;<br>as a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmi&para;<br>nation of a lengthy process. Moreover, inspection of the question&para;<br>naires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstand&para;<br>ing the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors&para;<br>largely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the&para;<br>corporation’s collapse. Whatever community prejudice existed in&para;<br>Houston generally, Skilling’s jurors were not under its sway. Relying&para;<br>on Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727–728, Skilling asserts the District&para;<br>Court should not have accepted jurors’ promises of fairness. But a&para;<br>number of factors show that the District Court had far less reason&para;<br>than the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors’ assurances of imparti&para;<br>ality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the&para;<br>horrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvin’s rampage of&para;<br>robberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the ru&para;<br>ral community in which Irvin’s trial proceeded; circulation figures for&para;<br>Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>recorded in Irvin; and Skilling’s seated jurors exhibited nothing like&para;<br>the display of bias shown in Irvin. In any event, the District Court&para;<br>did not simply take venire members at their word. It questioned&para;<br>each juror individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face&para;<br>opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with informa&para;<br>tion from the questionnaires regarding jurors’ backgrounds, opinions,&para;<br>and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fit&para;<br>ness for jury service. Pp. 22–30.&para;<br>(3) Skilling’s allegation that several jurors were openly biased&para;<br>also fails. In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district&para;<br>courts is at its pinnacle: “ ‘A trial court’s findings of juror impartiality&para;<br>may be overturned only for manifest error.’ ” Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at&para;<br>428. Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the&para;<br>seated jurors for cause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the&para;<br>[other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to&para;<br>his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557–558. A review of&para;<br>the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Ju&para;<br>rors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she&para;<br>would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove&para;<br>its case. Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded&para;<br>with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no&para;<br>signs of prejudice this Court can discern. Pp. 31–34.&para;<br>2. Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of “the&para;<br>intangible right of honest services,” is properly confined to cover only&para;<br>bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling’s alleged misconduct&para;<br>entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Court’s con&para;<br>finement of §1346’s proscription. Pp. 34–51.&para;<br>(a) To place Skilling’s claim that §1346 is unconstitutionally&para;<br>vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent appli&para;<br>cation of the honest-services doctrine. Pp. 34–38.&para;<br>(1) In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts&para;<br>of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statute’s&para;<br>prohibition of “any scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depriva&para;<br>tions not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.&para;<br>See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110, which stimulated&para;<br>the development of the “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike traditional&para;<br>fraud, in which the victim’s loss of money or property supplied the de&para;<br>fendant’s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest&para;<br>services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.&para;<br>While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no depriva&para;<br>tion of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been&para;<br>deceived, provided the enrichment. Even if the scheme occasioned a&para;<br>money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, ac&para;<br>tionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to the offender’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“honest services.” Most often these cases involved bribery of public&para;<br>officials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the&para;<br>doctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to&para;<br>his employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks. By 1982, all&para;<br>Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.&para;<br>Pp. 34–37.&para;<br>(2) In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangi&para;<br>ble-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360,&para;<br>which held that the mail-fraud statute was “limited in scope to the&para;<br>protection of property rights.” “If Congress desires to go further,” the&para;<br>Court stated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid. P. 37.&para;<br>(3) Congress responded the next year by enacting §1346, which&para;<br>provides: “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that&para;<br>prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, §1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the&para;<br>term ‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to&para;<br>deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” Pp 37–38.&para;<br>(b) Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconsti&para;<br>tutionally vague. Pp. 38–51.&para;<br>(1) To satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the&para;<br>criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people&para;<br>can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that&para;<br>does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”&para;<br>Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357. The void-for-vagueness doc&para;<br>trine embraces these requirements. Skilling contends that §1346&para;<br>meets neither of the two due-process essentials. But this Court must,&para;<br>if possible, construe, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571. Alert to&para;<br>§1346’s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how&para;<br>best to interpret the statute. Uniformly, however, they have declined&para;<br>to throw out the statute as irremediably vague. This Court agrees&para;<br>that §1346 should be construed rather than invalidated. P. 38–39.&para;<br>(2) The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally&para;<br>cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase “the in&para;<br>tangible right of honest services.” There is no doubt that Congress&para;<br>intended §1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doc&para;<br>trine recognized in Courts of Appeals’ decisions before McNally de&para;<br>railed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. Congress, it bears em&para;<br>phasis, enacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the&para;<br>statute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.&para;<br>Pp. 39–40.&para;<br>(3) To preserve what Congress certainly intended §1346 to&para;<br>cover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its&para;<br>core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes&para;<br>to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. In parsing the&para;<br>various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skill&para;<br>ing’s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions&para;<br>were not models of clarity or consistency. It has long been the&para;<br>Court’s practice, however, before striking a federal statute as imper&para;<br>missibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a&para;<br>limiting construction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,&para;<br>657. Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends&para;<br>that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core be&para;<br>cause the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.&para;<br>This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers,&para;<br>413 U. S., at 571–572. Although some applications of the preMcNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast&para;<br>majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary&para;<br>duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. Indeed, McNally&para;<br>itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U. S., at&para;<br>352–353, 360. In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress&para;<br>intended §1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks. Because read&para;<br>ing the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would&para;<br>raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that §1346 criminalizes&para;<br>only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.&para;<br>Pp. 41–45.&para;<br>(4) The Government urges the Court to go further by reading&para;<br>§1346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self&para;<br>dealing by a public official or private employee. Neither of the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s arguments in support of this position withstands close in&para;<br>spection. Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on non&para;<br>disclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a&para;<br>classic kickback scheme. See 483 U. S., at 352–353, 360. Reading&para;<br>§1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks—and nothing more—&para;<br>satisfies Congress’ undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.&para;<br>Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government’s argument that the&para;<br>pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of&para;<br>the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld&para;<br>honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they&para;<br>reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. Given the relative&para;<br>infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies&para;<br>they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting con&para;<br>struction of §1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.&para;<br>Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that “ambigu&para;<br>ity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in&para;<br>favor of lenity.” Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25. The&para;<br>Court therefore resists the Government’s less constrained construc&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion of §1346 absent Congress’ clear instruction otherwise. “If Con&para;<br>gress desires to go further,” the Court reiterates, “it must speak more&para;<br>clearly than it has.” McNally, 483 U. S., at 360. Pp. 45–47.&para;<br>(5) Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback&para;<br>schemes, §1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. A prohibition on&para;<br>fraudulently depriving another of one’s honest services by accepting&para;<br>bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary&para;<br>prosecution problem. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. As to fair no&para;<br>tice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute&para;<br>honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101,&para;<br>and the statute’s mens rea requirement further blunts any notice&para;<br>concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101–104. As&para;<br>to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that&para;<br>the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out&para;<br>of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not&para;<br>only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes&para;<br>proscribing and defining similar crimes. Pp. 48–49.&para;<br>(c) Skilling did not violate §1346, as the Court interprets the&para;<br>statute. The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to de&para;<br>fraud Enron’s shareholders by misrepresenting the company’s fiscal&para;<br>health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he&para;<br>solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for&para;<br>making these misrepresentations. Because the indictment alleged&para;<br>three objects of the conspiracy—honest-services wire fraud, money&para;<br>or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud—Skilling’s conviction is&para;<br>flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298. This determina&para;<br>tion, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy&para;<br>conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless&para;<br>error analysis.

SKILLING, PETITIONER v. UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 24, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest­&para;<br>revenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bank­&para;<br>ruptcy. We consider in this opinion two questions arising&para;<br>from the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron&para;<br>executive, for crimes committed before the corporation’s&para;<br>collapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community&para;<br>prejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial?&para;<br>Second, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of con­&para;<br>spiracy to commit “honest-services” wire fraud, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§371, 1343, 1346?&para;<br>Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit af­&para;<br>firmed Skilling’s convictions. We conclude, in common&para;<br>with the Court of Appeals, that Skilling’s fair-trial argu­&para;<br>ment fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a&para;<br>presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias&para;<br>infected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the&para;<br>Fifth Circuit’s honest-services ruling.&para;<br>In proscribing&para;<br>fraudulent deprivations of “the intangible right of honest&para;<br>services,” §1346, Congress intended at least to reach&para;<br>schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Con­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>struing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that&para;<br>core meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness&para;<br>shoal. We therefore hold that §1346 covers only bribery&para;<br>and kickback schemes. Because Skilling’s alleged miscon­&para;<br>duct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within&para;<br>§1346’s proscription. We therefore affirm in part and&para;<br>vacate in part.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its&para;<br>headquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world’s&para;<br>leading energy companies. Skilling launched his career&para;<br>there in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company’s founder,&para;<br>hired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily&para;<br>rose through the corporation’s ranks, serving as president&para;<br>and chief operating officer, and then, beginning in Febru­&para;<br>ary 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on&para;<br>August 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.&para;<br>Less than four months after Skilling’s departure, Enron&para;<br>spiraled into bankruptcy. The company’s stock, which had&para;<br>traded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to&para;<br>pennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend&para;<br>what caused the corporation’s collapse, the U. S. Depart­&para;<br>ment of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising&para;<br>prosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation. The&para;<br>Government’s investigation uncovered an elaborate con­&para;<br>spiracy to prop up Enron’s short-run stock prices by over­&para;<br>stating the company’s financial well-being. In the years&para;<br>following Enron’s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted&para;<br>dozens of Enron employees who participated in the&para;<br>scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the&para;<br>corporation’s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand&para;<br>jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron’s&para;<br>former chief accounting officer.&para;<br>These three defendants, the indictment alleged,&para;<br>“engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the in­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

To support this assertion, Skill­&para;<br>ing, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news&para;<br>reports detailing Enron’s downfall; he also presented&para;<br>affidavits from the experts he engaged portraying commu­&para;<br>nity attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential&para;<br>venues.&para;<br>The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The mail- and wire-fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or&para;<br>wires in furtherance of “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain­&para;<br>ing money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,&para;<br>representations, or promises.” 18 U. S. C. §1341 (mail fraud); §1343&para;<br>(wire fraud). The honest-services statute, §1346, defines “the term&para;<br>‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ ” in these provisions to include “a scheme&para;<br>or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Texas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted&para;<br>Enron-related prosecutions,2 denied the venue-transfer&para;<br>motion. Despite “isolated incidents of intemperate com­&para;<br>mentary,” the court observed, media coverage “ha[d]&para;<br>[mostly] been objective and unemotional,” and the facts of&para;<br>the case were “neither heinous nor sensational.” App. to&para;<br>Brief for United States 10a–11a.3 Moreover, “courts ha[d]&para;<br>commonly” favored “effective voir dire . . . to ferret out any&para;<br>[juror] bias.” Id., at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case,&para;<br>the court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that&para;<br>Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.&para;<br>Id., at 22a.&para;<br>In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court&para;<br>solicited from the parties questions the court might use to&para;<br>screen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a questionnaire’s format and content, Skilling and the Govern­&para;<br>ment submitted dueling documents. On venire members’&para;<br>sources of Enron-related news, for example, the Govern­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See United States v. Fastow, 292 F.

These rulings were made by two other&para;<br>judges of the same District. Three judges residing in the area thus&para;<br>independently found that defendants in Enron-related cases could&para;<br>obtain a fair trial in Houston.&para;<br>3 Painting a different picture of the media coverage surrounding En­&para;<br>ron’s collapse, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opinion relies heavily on affidavits&para;<br>of media experts and jury consultants submitted by Skilling in support&para;<br>of his venue-transfer motion. E.g., post, at 2, 3, 4, 5 (opinion concurring&para;<br>in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); post, at 5, n. 2, and&para;<br>23, n. 10; post, at 26, and 35, n. 22. These Skilling-employed experts&para;<br>selected and emphasized negative statements in various news stories.&para;<br>But the District Court Judge did not find the experts’ samples repre­&para;<br>sentative of the coverage at large; having “[m]eticulous[ly] review[ed]&para;<br>all of the evidence” Skilling presented, the court concluded that “inci­&para;<br>dents [of news reports using] less-than-objective language” were&para;<br>dwarfed by “the largely fact-based tone of most of the articles.” App. to&para;<br>Brief for United States 7a, 10a, 11a.

Skilling’s&para;<br>questions “[we]re more helpful,” the court said, “because&para;<br>[they] [we]re generally . . . open-ended and w[ould] allow&para;<br>the potential jurors to give us more meaningful informa­&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 9539. The court converted Skilling’s submis­&para;<br>sion, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page&para;<br>document that asked prospective jurors about, inter alia,&para;<br>their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related pub­&para;<br>licity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its col­&para;<br>lapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possi­&para;<br>ble guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company&para;<br>and to anyone affected by its demise.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Questions&para;<br>&para;<br>included the following: “What are your opinions about the&para;<br>compensation that executives of large corporations receive?”; “Have&para;<br>you, any family members, or friends ever worked for or applied for work&para;<br>with,” “done business with,” or “owned stock in Enron Corporation or&para;<br>any Enron subsidiaries and partnership?”; “Do you know anyone . . .&para;<br>who has been negatively affected or hurt in any way by what happened&para;<br>at Enron?”; “Do you have an opinion about the cause of the collapse of&para;<br>Enron?

The court granted hard­&para;<br>ship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, id., at&para;<br>11773–11774, and the parties, with the court’s approval,&para;<br>further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for&para;<br>cause, hardship, or physical disability, id., at 11891,&para;<br>13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, “each&para;<br>and every” prospective juror who said that a preexisting&para;<br>opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her&para;<br>from impartially considering the evidence at trial. Id., at&para;<br>13668.&para;<br>On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date&para;<br>scheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded&para;<br>guilty. Skilling’s attorneys immediately requested a con­&para;<br>tinuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the pro­&para;<br>ceedings until the end of January 2006. Id., at 14277. In&para;<br>the interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion,&para;<br>arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive&para;<br>bias and that news accounts of Causey’s guilty plea fur­&para;<br>ther tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial&para;<br>venue, Skilling urged that “jurors need to be questioned&para;<br>individually by both the Court and counsel” concerning&para;<br>their opinions of Enron and “publicity issues.” Id., at&para;<br>12074.&para;<br>The District Court again declined to move the trial.&para;<br>Skilling, the court concluded, still had not “establish[ed]&para;<br>that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d]&para;<br>a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id., at 14115.&para;<br>The questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed,&para;<br>provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>the defendants prevent you from impartially considering the evidence&para;<br>presented during the trial of . . .

The court also allotted the&para;<br>defendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than&para;<br>the standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Crimi­&para;<br>nal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673–13675.&para;<br>Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court&para;<br>first emphasized to the venire the importance of impartial­&para;<br>ity and explained the presumption of innocence and the&para;<br>Government’s burden of proof. The trial, the court next&para;<br>instructed, was not a forum “to seek vengeance against&para;<br>Enron’s former officers,” or to “provide remedies for” its&para;<br>victims. App. 823a. “The bottom line,” the court stressed,&para;<br>“is that we want . . . jurors who . . . will faithfully, consci­&para;<br>entiously and impartially serve if selected.” Id., at 823a–&para;<br>824a. In response to the court’s query whether any pro­&para;<br>spective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these&para;<br>instructions, two individuals indicated that they could not&para;<br>be fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a,&para;<br>819a–820a.&para;<br>After questioning the venire as a group,5 the District&para;<br>Court brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward&para;<br>the victims of Enron’s collapse or a desire to see justice done would&para;<br>overpower prospective jurors’ impartiality.

Although the questions var­&para;<br>ied, the process generally tracked the following format:&para;<br>The court asked about exposure to Enron-related news&para;<br>and the content of any stories that stood out in the pro­&para;<br>spective juror’s mind. Next, the court homed in on ques­&para;<br>tionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible&para;<br>bias. The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up&para;<br>questions.

Id., at 559–&para;<br>560.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals stated, however, that “the pre­&para;<br>sumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,” and it therefore&para;<br>examined the voir dire to determine whether “the District&para;<br>Court empanelled an impartial jury.” Id., at 561 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted).&para;<br>The voir dire was, in the Fifth Circuit’s view, “proper and&para;<br>thorough.” Id., at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skilling had challenged only one seated juror—Juror 11—for&para;<br>cause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments&para;<br>about corporate greed, the District Court “observed [his]&para;<br>demeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would&para;<br>make the government prove its case.” Id., at 564.

Black, post, p. ___; Weyhrauch, post, p. ___.&para;<br>10 Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of preju­&para;<br>dice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling’s petition for&para;<br>certiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when,&para;<br>if ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Al­&para;<br>though we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we&para;<br>consider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the&para;<br>question we agreed to decide.

The&para;<br>Constitution’s place-of-trial prescriptions, however, do not&para;<br>impede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at&para;<br>the defendant’s request if extraordinary local prejudice&para;<br>will prevent a fair trial—a “basic requirement of due&para;<br>process,” In re Murchison, 349 U.

We begin our discussion by addressing&para;<br>the presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Cir­&para;<br>cuit’s analysis in Skilling’s case proceeded. The founda­&para;<br>tion precedent is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723&para;<br>(1963).&para;<br>Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana&para;<br>town, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of&para;<br>them. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel&para;<br>present and obtained his confession. Without informing&para;<br>Rideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the&para;<br>interrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before&para;<br>the trial, a local television station broadcast the film to&para;<br>audiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals.&para;<br>Rideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could&para;<br>not receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime oc­&para;<br>curred, which had a population of approximately 150,000&para;<br>people. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury&para;<br>eventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Lou­&para;<br>isiana upheld the conviction.&para;<br>We reversed. “What the people [in the community] saw&para;<br>on their television sets,” we observed, “was Rideau, in jail,&para;<br>flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in&para;<br>detail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and&para;<br>murder.” Id., at 725. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people&para;<br>who saw and heard it,” we explained, the interrogation “in&para;<br>a very real sense was Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded&para;<br>guilty.” Id., at 726. We therefore “d[id] not hesitate to&para;<br>hold, without pausing to examine a particularized tran­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 538 (1965), extensive&para;<br>publicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure&para;<br>during preliminary court proceedings as reporters and&para;<br>television crews overran the courtroom and “bombard[ed]&para;<br>. . . the community with the sights and sounds of” the&para;<br>pretrial hearing. The media’s overzealous reporting ef­&para;<br>forts, we observed, “led to considerable disruption” and&para;<br>denied the “judicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol&para;<br>Estes] was entitled.” Id., at 536.&para;<br>Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),&para;<br>news reporters extensively covered the story of Sam&para;<br>Sheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant&para;<br>wife to death. “[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during&para;<br>the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire&para;<br>courtroom,” thrusting jurors “into the role of celebrities.”&para;<br>Id., at 353, 355. Pretrial media coverage, which we char­&para;<br>acterized as “months [of] virulent publicity about&para;<br>Sheppard and the murder,” did not alone deny due proc­&para;<br>ess, we noted. Id., at 354. But Sheppard’s case involved&para;<br>more than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder&para;<br>conviction because a “carnival atmosphere” pervaded the&para;<br>trial, id., at 358.&para;<br>In each of these cases, we overturned a “conviction&para;<br>obtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted&para;<br>by press coverage”; our decisions, however, “cannot be&para;<br>made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to&para;<br>. . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively&para;<br>deprives the defendant of due process.” Murphy v.

Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). During&para;<br>voir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an&para;<br>opinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates&para;<br>admitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt. 467 U.

A&para;<br>presumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends&para;<br>only the extreme case.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Relying on Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, Skilling as­&para;<br>serts that we need not pause to examine the screening&para;<br>questionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury’s&para;<br>verdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differ­&para;<br>ences separate Skilling’s prosecution from those in which&para;<br>we have presumed juror prejudice.14&para;<br>First, we have emphasized in prior decisions the size&para;<br>and characteristics of the community in which the crime&para;<br>occurred. In Rideau, for example, we noted that the mur­&para;<br>der was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents.&para;<br>Houston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in&para;<br>the Nation: At the time of Skilling’s trial, more than 4.5&para;<br>million individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the&para;<br>Houston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of&para;<br>potential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial indi­&para;<br>viduals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See&para;<br>Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 429 (1991) (potential&para;<br>for prejudice mitigated by the size of the “metropolitan&para;<br>Washington [D.

S. 1030, 1044 (1991) (plurality&para;<br>opinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was&para;<br>drawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).15&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 Skilling’s reliance on Estes and Sheppard is particularly misplaced;&para;<br>those cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings&para;<br>during trial. See supra, at 14. Skilling does not assert that news&para;<br>coverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.&para;<br>15 According to a survey commissioned by Skilling in conjunction with&para;<br>his first motion for a venue change, only 12.3% of Houstonians named&para;<br>him when asked to list Enron executives they believed guilty of crimes.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62,&para;<br>72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (“[T]he defendant’s own con­&para;<br>fession [is] probably the most probative and damaging&para;<br>evidence that can be admitted against him.” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skill­&para;<br>ing was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of&para;<br>the smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpa­&para;<br>bility. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F. 2d 241, 251–&para;<br>252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (“A jury may have difficulty in&para;<br>disbelieving or forgetting a defendant’s opinion of his own&para;<br>guilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of&para;<br>others because they may not be well-founded.”).&para;<br>Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a&para;<br>widely reported crime, e.g., Rideau, 373 U. S., at 724, over&para;<br>four years elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skill­&para;<br>ing’s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related&para;<br>news throughout this period, the decibel level of media&para;<br>attention diminished somewhat in the years following&para;<br>Enron’s collapse. See App. 700a; id., at 785a; Yount, 467&para;<br>U. S., at 1032, 1034.&para;<br>Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling’s jury acquit­&para;<br>ted him of nine insider-trading counts.

In response to the follow-up question “[w]hat words &para;<br>&para;<br>come to mind when you hear the name Jeff Skilling?”, two-thirds of&para;<br>&para;<br>respondents failed to say a single negative word, id., at 376a: 43%&para;<br>&para;<br>either had never heard of Skilling or stated that nothing came to mind&para;<br>&para;<br>when they heard his name, and another 23% knew Skilling’s name was&para;<br>&para;<br>associated with Enron but reported no opinion about him, Record 3210–&para;<br>&para;<br>3211; see App. 417a–492a. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>whelming victory for the Government.16 In Rideau, Estes,&para;<br>and Sheppard, in marked contrast, the jury’s verdict did&para;<br>not undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias. It&para;<br>would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice&para;<br>in a case in which jurors’ actions run counter to that pre­&para;<br>sumption. See, e.g., United States v. Arzola-Amaya, 867&para;<br>F. 2d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (“The jury’s ability to discern&para;<br>a failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes&para;<br>indicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and&para;<br>reinforces our belief and conclusion that the media cover­&para;<br>age did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an&para;<br>impartial trial.”).&para;<br>4&para;<br>Skilling’s trial, in short, shares little in common with&para;<br>those in which we approved a presumption of juror preju­&para;<br>dice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion&para;<br>based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of&para;<br>media attention directed at Enron. But “pretrial public­&para;<br>ity—even pervasive, adverse publicity—does not inevita­&para;<br>bly lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stu&para;<br>art, 427 U. S. 539, 554 (1976). In this case, as just noted,&para;<br>news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid,&para;<br>unforgettable information we have recognized as particu­&para;<br>larly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston’s size and&para;<br>diversity diluted the media’s impact.17&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 As&para;<br>&para;<br>the United States summarizes, “[i]n Hirko, the jury deliberated&para;<br>for several days and did not convict any Enron defendant; in Bayly,&para;<br>which was routinely described as ‘the first Enron criminal trial,’ the&para;<br>jury convicted five defendants, . . . but acquitted a former Enron execu­&para;<br>tive. At the sentencing phase of Bayly, the jury found a loss amount of&para;<br>slightly over $13 million, even though the government had argued that&para;<br>the true loss . . . was $40 million.” Brief for United States 9–10 (cita­&para;<br>tion omitted).&para;<br>17 The Fifth Circuit, moreover, did not separate media attention&para;<br>aimed at Skilling from that devoted to Enron’s downfall more generally.&para;<br>Data submitted by Skilling in support of his first motion for a venue&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Nor did Enron’s “sheer number of victims,” 554 F. 3d, at&para;<br>560, trigger a presumption of prejudice. Although the&para;<br>widespread community impact necessitated careful identi­&para;<br>fication and inspection of prospective jurors’ connections to&para;<br>Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow­&para;<br>up voir dire were well suited to that task. And hindsight&para;<br>shows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss infra,&para;<br>at 24, jurors’ links to Enron were either nonexistent or&para;<br>attenuated.&para;<br>Finally, although Causey’s “well-publicized decision to&para;<br>plead guilty” shortly before trial created a danger of juror&para;<br>prejudice, 554 F. 3d, at 559, the District Court took appro­&para;<br>priate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the&para;<br>proceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that&para;<br>development. And during voir dire, the court asked about&para;<br>prospective jurors’ exposure to recent publicity, including&para;<br>news regarding Causey. Only two venire members re­&para;<br>called the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and&para;<br>neither ultimately served on Skilling’s jury. App. 888a,&para;<br>993a. Although publicity about a codefendant’s guilty plea&para;<br>calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does&para;<br>not ordinarily—and, we are satisfied, it did not here—&para;<br>warrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.&para;<br>Persuaded that no presumption arose,18 we conclude&para;<br>that the District Court, in declining to order a venue&para;<br>change, did not exceed constitutional limitations.19&para;<br>——————&para;<br>transfer suggested that a slim percentage of Enron-related stories&para;<br>specifically named him.

We disagree with Skilling’s characterization of&para;<br>the voir dire and the jurors selected through it.&para;<br>1&para;<br>No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth&para;<br>or breadth of voir dire. See United States v. Wood, 299&para;<br>U. S. 123, 145–146 (1936) (“Impartiality is not a technical&para;<br>conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of&para;<br>this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Con­&para;<br>stitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is&para;<br>not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.”). Jury&para;<br>selection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is “particularly&para;<br>within the province of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross,&para;<br>424 U. S. 589, 594–595 (1976) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); see, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 424; Yount, 467&para;<br>U. S., at 1038; Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U. S.&para;<br>182, 188–189 (1981) (plurality opinion); Connors v. United&para;<br>States, 158 U. S. 408–413 (1895).&para;<br>When pretrial publicity is at issue, “primary reliance on&para;<br>the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good&para;<br>sense” because the judge “sits in the locale where the&para;<br>publicity is said to have had its effect” and may base her&para;<br>evaluation on her “own perception of the depth and extent&para;<br>of news stories that might influence a juror.” Mu’Min, 500&para;<br>U.

See Reynolds, 98 U. S., at 156–157. In contrast to&para;<br>the cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in­&para;<br>the-moment voir dire affords the trial court a more inti­&para;<br>mate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member’s&para;<br>fitness for jury service. We consider the adequacy of jury&para;<br>selection in Skilling’s case, therefore, attentive to the&para;<br>respect due to district-court determinations of juror im­&para;<br>partiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that&para;<br>impartiality.20&para;<br>——————&para;<br>20 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent recognizes “the ‘wide discretion’ owed to trial courts&para;<br>when it comes to jury-related issues,” post, at 22 (quoting Mu’Min v.&para;<br>Virginia, 500 U.

Cf. App. 822a (counsel for Skilling urged District Court to&para;<br>find a way to question venire members about Causey “without mention­&para;<br>ing anything”).

Our review of the record, however,&para;<br>yields a different appraisal.21&para;<br>As noted, supra, at 4–6, and n. 4, the District Court&para;<br>initially screened venire members by eliciting their re­&para;<br>sponses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large&para;<br>part by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospec­&para;<br>tive jurors excusable for cause and served as a spring­&para;<br>board for further questions put to remaining members of&para;<br>the array.

He was accused of being a&para;<br>parole violator. The headlines announced his police&para;<br>line-up identification, that he faced a lie detector test,&para;<br>had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the&para;<br>six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess.&para;<br>Finally, they announced [Irvin’s] confession to the six&para;<br>murders and the fact of his indictment for four of&para;<br>them in Indiana.

Juror 11 stated that “greed on Enron’s part” trig­&para;<br>gered the company’s bankruptcy and that corporate execu­&para;<br>tives, driven by avarice, “walk a line that stretches&para;<br>sometimes the legality of something.” App. 854a–855a.&para;<br>But, as the Fifth Circuit accurately summarized, Juror 11&para;<br>“had ‘no idea’ whether Skilling had ‘crossed that line,’&para;<br>and he ‘didn’t say that’ every CEO is probably a crook.&para;<br>He also asserted that he could be fair and require the&para;<br>government to prove its case, that he did not believe&para;<br>everything he read in the paper, that he did not ‘get&para;<br>into the details’ of the Enron coverage, that he did not&para;<br>watch television, and that Enron was ‘old news.’ ” 554&para;<br>F. 3d, at 563–564.&para;<br>Despite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that&para;<br>Skilling “earned [his] salar[y],” App. 857a, and said he&para;<br>would have “no problem” telling his co-worker, who had&para;<br>lost 401(k) funds due to Enron’s collapse, that the jury&para;<br>voted to acquit, if that scenario came to pass, id., at 854a.&para;<br>The District Court, noting that it had “looked [Juror 11] in&para;<br>the eye and . . . heard all his [answers],” found his asser­&para;<br>tions of impartiality credible. Id., at 858a; cf. supra, at 29,&para;<br>n. 30. We agree with the Court of Appeals that “[t]he&para;<br>express finding that Juror 11 was fair is not reversible&para;<br>error.” 554 F. 3d, at 564.32&para;<br>Skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six spe­&para;<br>cific jurors whom, he said, he would have excluded had he&para;<br>not already exhausted his peremptory challenges.

Juror 20, he observes, “said she was ‘angry’&para;<br>about Enron’s collapse and that she, too, had been ‘forced&para;<br>——————&para;<br>32 Skilling’s trial counsel and jury consultants apparently did not&para;<br>regard Juror 11 as so “obvious[ly] bias[ed],” Brief for Petitioner 35, as to&para;<br>warrant exercise of a peremptory challenge.&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

But Juror 20 made clear during voir dire that&para;<br>she did not “personally blame” Skilling for the loss of her&para;<br>retirement account. App. 875a. Having not “pa[id] much&para;<br>attention” to Enron-related news, she “quite honestly” did&para;<br>not “have enough information to know” whether Skilling&para;<br>was probably guilty, id., at 873a, and she “th[ought] [she]&para;<br>could be” fair and impartial, id., at 875a. In light of these&para;<br>answers, the District Court did not commit manifest error&para;<br>in finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.&para;<br>The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out,&para;<br>wrote on her questionnaire “that [Skilling] ‘probably knew&para;<br>[he] w[as] breaking the law.’ ” Reply Brief 13. During voir&para;<br>dire, however, Juror 63 insisted that she did not “really&para;<br>have an opinion [about Skilling’s guilt] either way,” App.&para;<br>936a; she did not “know what [she] was thinking” when&para;<br>she completed the questionnaire, but she “absolutely”&para;<br>presumed Skilling innocent and confirmed her under­&para;<br>standing that the Government would “have to prove” his&para;<br>guilt, id., at 937a. In response to follow-up questions from&para;<br>Skilling’s counsel, she again stated she would not presume&para;<br>that Skilling violated any laws and could “[a]bsolutely”&para;<br>give her word that she could be fair. Id., at 937a–938a.&para;<br>“Jurors,” we have recognized, “cannot be expected invaria­&para;<br>bly to express themselves carefully or even consistently.”&para;<br>Yount, 467 U. S., at 1039.

From where&para;<br>we sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.&para;<br>The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have&para;<br>excluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign&para;<br>of prejudice we can discern.

Skilling’s counsel&para;<br>declined to ask follow-up questions of any of these jurors&para;<br>and, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because&para;<br>she “gave all the right answers.” Id., at 972a. Whatever&para;<br>Skilling’s reasons for wanting to strike these four indi­&para;<br>viduals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they dis­&para;<br>played a disqualifying bias.33&para;<br>In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption&para;<br>of prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that&para;<br>tried him. Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended,&para;<br>need not enter the box with empty heads in order to de­&para;<br>termine the facts impartially. “It is sufficient if the ju­&para;<br>ror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and&para;<br>render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.”&para;<br>Irvin, 366 U. S., at 723. Taking account of the full record,&para;<br>rather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from&para;<br>it, we find no cause to upset the lower courts’ judgment&para;<br>that Skilling’s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm&para;<br>the Fifth Circuit’s ruling that Skilling received a fair&para;<br>trial.34&para;<br>——————&para;<br>33 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at&para;<br>trial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 14–15; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas,&para;<br>the voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that&para;<br>they were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a–853a (Juror 10) (did not&para;<br>prejudge Skilling’s guilt, indicated he could follow the court’s instruc­&para;<br>tions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair&para;<br>to Skilling, and said he would “judge on the facts”); id., at 974a (Juror&para;<br>87) (had “not formed an opinion” on whether Skilling was guilty and&para;<br>affirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).&para;<br>34 Our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>We next consider whether Skilling’s conspiracy convic­&para;<br>tion was premised on an improper theory of honest­&para;<br>services wire fraud. The honest-services statute, §1346,&para;<br>Skilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alterna­&para;<br>tively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within&para;<br>the statute’s compass.&para;<br>A&para;<br>To place Skilling’s constitutional challenge in context,&para;<br>we first review the origin and subsequent application of&para;<br>the honest-services doctrine.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the&para;<br>predecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws,&para;<br>proscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to&para;<br>advance “any scheme or artifice to defraud.” See McNally&para;<br>v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 356 (1987). In 1909, Con­&para;<br>gress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today,&para;<br>“any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money&para;<br>or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,&para;<br>representations, or promises.” §1341 (emphasis added); see&para;<br>id., at 357–358. Emphasizing Congress’ disjunctive phras­&para;<br>ing, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted&para;<br>the term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depri­&para;<br>vations not only of money or property, but also of intangi­&para;<br>ble rights.&para;<br>In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangi­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>prejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S. 415;&para;<br>Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S.&para;<br>794 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest&para;<br>conveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a&para;<br>premise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions&para;<br>when they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence&para;<br>presented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and&para;<br>the District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ble-rights theory, Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110&para;<br>(1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecu­&para;<br>tion of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from&para;<br>entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial&para;<br>to the bribe payers. “It is not true that because the [city]&para;<br>was to make and did make a saving by the operations&para;<br>there could not have been an intent to defraud,” the Court&para;<br>of Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. “A scheme to get a&para;<br>public contract on more favorable terms than would likely&para;<br>be got otherwise by bribing a public official,” the court&para;<br>observed, “would not only be a plan to commit the crime of&para;<br>bribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.”&para;<br>Id., at 115.&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Shushan stimulated the&para;<br>development of an “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike&para;<br>fraud in which the victim’s loss of money or property&para;<br>supplied the defendant’s gain, with one the mirror image&para;<br>of the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94,&para;<br>101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted cor­&para;<br>ruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender&para;<br>profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of&para;<br>money or property; instead, a third party, who had not&para;<br>been deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a&para;<br>city mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third&para;<br>party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,&para;<br>yet the contract terms were the same as any that could&para;<br>have been negotiated at arm’s length, the city (the be­&para;<br>trayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally,&para;<br>483 U. S., at 360. Even if the scheme occasioned a money&para;<br>or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned,&para;<br>actionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to&para;<br>the offender’s “honest services.” See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Dixon, 536 F. 2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).&para;<br>“Most often these cases . . . involved bribery of public&para;<br>officials,” United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167, 1171&para;<br>(CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>honest-services fraud. In perhaps the earliest application&para;<br>of the theory to private actors, a District Court, reviewing&para;<br>a bribery scheme, explained:&para;<br>“When one tampers with [the employer-employee] re­&para;<br>lationship for the purpose of causing the employee to&para;<br>breach his duty [to his employer,] he in effect is de­&para;<br>frauding the employer of a lawful right. The actual&para;<br>deception that is practised is in the continued repre­&para;<br>sentation of the employee to the employer that he is&para;<br>honest and loyal to the employer’s interests.” United&para;<br>States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 47 F. Supp. 676, 678&para;<br>(Mass. 1942).&para;<br>Over time, “[a]n increasing number of courts” recognized&para;<br>that “a recreant employee”—public or private—“c[ould] be&para;<br>prosecuted under [the mail-fraud statute] if he breache[d]&para;<br>his allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kick­&para;<br>backs in the course of his employment,” United States v.&para;<br>McNeive, 536 F. 2d 1245, 1249 (CA8 1976); by 1982, all&para;<br>Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services the­&para;<br>ory of fraud, Hurson, Limiting the Federal Mail Fraud&para;<br>Statute—A Legislative Approach, 20 Am. Crim. L. Rev.&para;<br>423, 456 (1983).35&para;<br>2&para;<br>In 1987, this Court, in McNally v. United States,&para;<br>stopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine&para;<br>in its tracks.

The prosecutor did not charge that, “in the absence of&para;<br>the alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid&para;<br>a lower premium or secured better insurance.” Ibid. In­&para;<br>stead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback&para;<br>scheme “defraud[ed] the citizens and government of Ken­&para;<br>tucky of their right to have the Commonwealth’s affairs&para;<br>conducted honestly.” Id., at 353.&para;<br>We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud.&para;<br>“Rather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that&para;<br>leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the&para;<br>Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and&para;<br>good government for local and state officials,” we read the&para;<br>statute “as limited in scope to the protection of property&para;<br>rights.” Id., at 360. “If Congress desires to go further,” we&para;<br>stated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Congress responded swiftly.

United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19–20 (2000). In&para;<br>full, the honest-services statute stated:&para;<br>“For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United&para;<br>States Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud,&para;<br>§1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the term ‘scheme or&para;<br>artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to&para;<br>deprive another of the intangible right of honest ser­&para;<br>vices.” §1346.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not&para;<br>clearly: He asserts that §1346 is unconstitutionally vague.&para;<br>To satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the&para;<br>criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordi­&para;<br>&para;<br>38&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

The void-for-vagueness doctrine&para;<br>embraces these requirements.&para;<br>According to Skilling, §1346 meets neither of the two&para;<br>due process essentials. First, the phrase “the intangible&para;<br>right of honest services,” he contends, does not adequately&para;<br>define what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38–39.&para;<br>Second, he alleges, §1346’s “standardless sweep allows&para;<br>policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal&para;<br>predilections,” thereby “facilitat[ing] opportunistic and&para;<br>arbitrary prosecutions.” Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461&para;<br>U.

See, e.g.,&para;<br>Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571&para;<br>(1973). See also United States v. National Dairy Products&para;<br>Corp., 372 U.

Alert to §1346’s&para;<br>potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on&para;<br>how best to interpret the statute.36 Uniformly, however,&para;<br>they have declined to throw out the statute as irremedia­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>36 Courts have disagreed about whether §1346 prosecutions must be&para;<br>based on a violation of state law, compare, e.g., United States v.

Although the Courts of Appeals upheld&para;<br>honest-services convictions for “some schemes of non­&para;<br>disclosure and concealment of material information,”&para;<br>Mandel, 591 F. 2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on&para;<br>which schemes qualified.

I also agree that the deci­&para;<br>sion upholding Skilling’s conviction for so-called “honest­&para;<br>services fraud” must be reversed, but for a different rea­&para;<br>son. In my view, the specification in 18 U. S.

The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility&para;<br>in proclaiming that our task is “not to destroy the Act . . .&para;<br>but to construe it,” ante, at 42 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). But in transforming the prohibition of “honest­&para;<br>services fraud” into a prohibition of “bribery and kick­&para;<br>backs” it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the&para;<br>power to define new federal crimes. See United States v.&para;<br>Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it&para;<br>proscribes, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,&para;<br>108 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague&para;<br>cannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see Lan&para;<br>zetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939), nor by&para;<br>judicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its&para;<br>text does not contain, see United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.&para;<br>214, 219–221 (1876). Our cases have described vague&para;<br>statutes as failing “to provide a person of ordinary intelli­&para;<br>gence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so&para;<br>standardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seri­&para;<br>ously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Wil&para;<br>liams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). Here, Skilling argues&para;<br>that §1346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages&para;<br>arbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of&para;<br>the right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 38–39, 42–44. In my view Skilling is&para;<br>correct.&para;<br>The Court maintains that “the intangible right of honest&para;<br>services ” means the right not to have one’s fiduciaries&para;<br>accept “bribes or kickbacks.” Its first step in reaching&para;<br>that conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to&para;<br>“the doctrine developed” in cases decided by lower federal&para;<br>courts prior to our decision in McNally v. United States,&para;<br>483 U. S. 350 (1987). Ante, at 39. I do not contest that. I&para;<br>agree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the&para;<br>lower-court case law that had been disapproved by&para;<br>McNally—what the Court calls “the pre-McNally honest­&para;<br>services doctrine,” ante, at 42. The problem is that that&para;<br>doctrine provides no “ascertainable standard of guilt,”&para;<br>United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89&para;<br>(1921), and certainly is not limited to “bribes or kick­&para;<br>backs.”&para;<br>Investigation into the meaning of “the pre-McNally&para;<br>honest-services doctrine” might logically begin with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>McNally itself, which rejected it. That case repudiated the&para;<br>many Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the&para;<br>meaning of “fraud” in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud stat­&para;<br>utes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483&para;<br>U. S., at 360. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibi­&para;<br>tion of “bribery and kickbacks,” one would have expected&para;<br>those words to appear in the opinion’s description of the&para;<br>cases. In fact, they do not. Not at all. Nor did McNally&para;<br>even provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing&para;<br>theory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right&para;<br>of citizens “to have the [State]’s affairs conducted hon­&para;<br>estly,” id., at 353, to “honest and impartial government,”&para;<br>id., at 355, to “good government,” id., at 356, and “to have&para;<br>public officials perform their duties honestly,” id., at 358.&para;<br>It described prior case law as holding that “a public official&para;<br>owes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office&para;<br>for private gain is a fraud,” id., at 355.&para;<br>But the pre-McNally Court of Appeals opinions were not&para;<br>limited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held&para;<br>that those fiduciaries subject to the “honest services”&para;<br>obligation included private individuals who merely par­&para;<br>ticipated in public decisions, see, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Gray, 790 F. 2d 1290, 1295–1296 (CA6 1986) (citing&para;<br>United States v. Margiotta, 688 F. 2d 108, 122 (CA2&para;<br>1982)), and even private employees who had no role in&para;<br>public decisions, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720&para;<br>F. 2d 1327, 1335–1336 (CADC 1983); United States v. Von&para;<br>Barta, 635 F. 2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, “to say&para;<br>that a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it&para;<br>gives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations&para;<br>does he owe as a fiduciary?” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318&para;<br>U. S. 80, 85–86 (1943). None of the “honest services”&para;<br>cases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those&para;<br>pertaining to private employees, defined the nature and&para;<br>content of the fiduciary duty central to the “fraud” offense.&para;<br>There was not even universal agreement concerning the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>source of the fiduciary obligation—whether it must be&para;<br>positive state or federal law, see, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely gen­&para;<br>eral principles, such as the “obligations of loyalty and&para;<br>fidelity” that inhere in the “employment relationship,”&para;<br>Lemire, supra, at 1336. The decision McNally reversed&para;<br>had grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific)&para;<br>trust law, see Gray, supra, at 1294, a corpus juris fes­&para;<br>tooned with various duties. See, e.g., Restatement (Sec­&para;<br>ond) of Trusts §§169–185 (1976). Another pre-McNally&para;<br>case referred to the general law of agency, United States v.&para;<br>Ballard, 663 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on&para;<br>other grounds by 680 F. 2d 352 (1982), which imposes&para;<br>duties quite different from those of a trustee.1 See Re­&para;<br>statement (Second) of Agency §§377–398 (1957).&para;<br>This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes&para;<br>that the pre-McNally cases developed a federal, common­&para;<br>law fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly unde­&para;<br>fined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad&para;<br>language. Blachly v. United States, 380 F. 2d 665 (CA5&para;<br>1967), loftily declared that “[l]aw puts its imprimatur on&para;<br>the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct&para;<br>which fails to match the ‘reflection of moral uprightness,&para;<br>of fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the&para;<br>general and business life of members of society.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>671 (quoting Gregory v. United States, 253 F. 2d 104, 109&para;<br>(CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any&para;<br>scheme “contrary to public policy” was also condemned by&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court is untroubled by these divisions because “these debates&para;<br>were rare in bribe and kickback cases,” in which “[t]he existence of a&para;<br>fiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually&para;<br>beyond dispute,” ante, at 43, n. 41. This misses the point. The Courts&para;<br>of Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a&para;<br>bribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not&para;<br>consistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a&para;<br>fiduciary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the statute, United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167,&para;<br>1171 (CA9 1980). See also United States v. Mandel, 591&para;<br>F. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is “contrary&para;<br>to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of&para;<br>moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and&para;<br>right dealing”). Even opinions that did not indulge in such&para;<br>grandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond&para;<br>loyalty or honesty, see, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1005–&para;<br>1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be&para;<br>greater for public officials than for private employees, see,&para;<br>e.g., Lemire, supra, at 1337, n. 13; Ballard, supra, at 541,&para;<br>n. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never&para;<br>made clear.&para;<br>The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many&para;<br>courts held that some je-ne-sais-quoi beyond a mere&para;<br>breach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest­&para;<br>services fraud. See, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1006 (col­&para;<br>lecting cases); United States v. George, 477 F. 2d 508, 512&para;<br>(CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute&para;<br>about that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing&para;<br>duties to the public. See United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d&para;<br>234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that&para;<br>did require something additional where a public official&para;<br>was involved, there was disagreement as to what the&para;<br>addition should be. For example, in United States v. Bush,&para;<br>522 F. 2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that mate­&para;<br>rial misrepresentations and active concealment were&para;<br>enough, id., at 647–648. But in Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014,&para;<br>the Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was&para;<br>needed, id., at 1026.&para;<br>Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private&para;<br>employees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must&para;<br>use his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare&para;<br>Lemire, supra, at 1335 (yes), with United States v. Bron&para;<br>ston, 658 F. 2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion&para;<br>upheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>defendant’s “failure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and&para;<br>consulting fees from [his employer’s] suppliers resulted in&para;<br>a breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of&para;<br>his loyal and honest services.” United States v. Bryza, 522&para;<br>F. 2d 414, 422 (CA7 1975). Another opinion, however,&para;<br>demanded more than an intentional failure to disclose:&para;<br>“There must be a failure to disclose something which in&para;<br>the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an&para;<br>independent business risk to the employer.” Lemire, 720&para;<br>F. 2d, at 1337. Other courts required that the victim&para;<br>suffer some loss, see, e.g., Ballard, supra, at 541–542—a&para;<br>proposition that, of course, other courts rejected, see, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Newman, 664 F. 2d 12, 20 (CA2 1981);&para;<br>United States v. O’Malley, 535 F. 2d 589, 592 (CA10 1976).&para;<br>The Court’s statement today that there was a deprivation&para;<br>of honest services even if “the scheme occasioned a money&para;<br>or property gain for the betrayed party,” ante, at 35, is&para;<br>therefore true, except to the extent it is not.&para;<br>In short, the first step in the Court’s analysis—holding&para;<br>that “the intangible right of honest services” refers to “the&para;<br>honest-services doctrine recognized in Court of Appeals’&para;<br>decisions before McNally,” ante, at 39—is a step out of the&para;<br>frying pan into the fire. The pre-McNally cases provide no&para;<br>clear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of&para;<br>honest services. The possibilities range from any action&para;<br>that is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to&para;<br>only the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his&para;<br>principal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator’s position&para;<br>of trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The&para;<br>duty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but&para;<br>maybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the&para;<br>case of public officials, but perhaps not. At the time §1346&para;<br>was enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing&para;<br>among these options, for conclusively settling what was in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

It knows that adopting&para;<br>by reference “the pre-McNally honest-services doctrine,”&para;<br>ante, at 42, is adopting by reference nothing more precise&para;<br>than the referring term itself (“the intangible right of&para;<br>honest services”). Hence the deus ex machina: “[W]e pare&para;<br>that body of precedent down to its core,” ante, at 39. Since&para;<br>the honest-services doctrine “had its genesis” in bribery&para;<br>prosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for&para;<br>Skilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as “core”&para;<br>or “paradigm” or “typical” examples, or “[t]he most obvious&para;<br>form,” of honest-services fraud, ante, at 43 (internal quota­&para;<br>tion marks omitted), and since two cases and counsel for&para;<br>the Government say that they formed the “vast majority,”&para;<br>or “most” or at least “[t]he bulk” of honest-services cases,&para;<br>ante, at 42–44 (internal quotation marks omitted),&para;<br>THEREFORE it must be the case that they are all&para;<br>Congress meant by its reference to the honest-services&para;<br>doctrine.&para;<br>Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it&para;<br>would not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the stat­&para;<br>ute. It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what&para;<br>acts constitute a breach of the “honest services” obligation&para;<br>under the pre-McNally law. But it would not solve the&para;<br>most fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the&para;<br>“fiduciary capacity” to which the bribery and kickback&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Courts since §1346’s enactment have fared no better, reproducing&para;<br>some of the same disputes that predated McNally. See, e.g., Sorich v.&para;<br>United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from&para;<br>denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3–4) (collecting cases). We have previ­&para;<br>ously found important to our vagueness analysis “the conflicting results&para;<br>which have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges&para;<br>in seeking to carry out [a] statute in cases brought before them.”&para;<br>United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89 (1921). I am at&para;<br>a loss to explain why the Court barely mentions those conflicts today.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>restriction applies. Does it apply only to public officials?&para;<br>Or in addition to private individuals who contract with the&para;<br>public? Or to everyone, including the corporate officer&para;<br>here? The pre-McNally case law does not provide an&para;<br>answer. Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limita­&para;<br>tion the statute does not answer the question “What is the&para;<br>criterion of guilt?”&para;<br>But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvi­&para;<br>ous that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was&para;<br>not the intent of the statute. To say that bribery and&para;<br>kickbacks represented “the core” of the doctrine, or that&para;<br>most cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses,&para;<br>is not to say that they are the doctrine. All it proves is&para;<br>that the multifarious versions of the doctrine overlap with&para;<br>regard to those offenses. But the doctrine itself is much&para;<br>more. Among all the pre-McNally smörgåsbord-offerings&para;<br>of varieties of honest-services fraud, not one is limited to&para;<br>bribery and kickbacks. That is a dish the Court has&para;<br>cooked up all on its own.&para;<br>Thus, the Court’s claim to “respec[t] the legislature,”&para;<br>ante, at 44, n. 43 (emphasis deleted), is false. It is entirely&para;<br>clear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to&para;<br>reinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law; and&para;<br>entirely clear that that prohibited much more (though&para;<br>precisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kick­&para;<br>backs. Perhaps it is true that “Congress intended §1346 to&para;<br>reach at least bribes and kickbacks,” ante, at 44. That&para;<br>simply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that “§1346&para;<br>criminalizes only” bribery and kickbacks, ibid.&para;<br>Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation&para;<br>but invention. The Court replaces a vague criminal stan­&para;<br>dard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (in­&para;<br>cluded within the vague one) that can pass constitutional&para;<br>muster. I know of no precedent for such “paring down,”3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>only alleged precedent the Court dares to describe is Civil Ser&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>and it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power. This is&para;<br>not, as the Court claims, ante, at 41, simply a matter of&para;<br>adopting a “limiting construction” in the face of potential&para;<br>unconstitutionality. To do that, our cases have been care­&para;<br>ful to note, the narrowing construction must be “fairly&para;<br>possible,” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988), “rea­&para;<br>sonable,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895),&para;<br>or not “plainly contrary to the intent of Congress,” Edward&para;<br>J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp;&para;<br>Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). As we&para;<br>have seen (and the Court does not contest), no court before&para;<br>McNally concluded that the “deprivation of honest ser­&para;<br>vices” meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If&para;<br>it were a “fairly possible” or “reasonable” construction, not&para;<br>“contrary to the intent of Congress,” one would think that&para;<br>some court would have adopted it. The Court does not&para;<br>even point to a post-McNally case that reads §1346 to&para;<br>cover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.&para;<br>The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the&para;<br>Court so heavily relies, see ante, at 41–42, states that&para;<br>“when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>vice Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). That case in­&para;<br>volved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of&para;<br>the Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a&para;<br>vagueness challenge—not, however, by “paring down” the adjudications&para;<br>to a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what&para;<br>they held was not vague. See id., at 571–574. The string of cases the&para;<br>Court lists, see ante, at 41, n. 40, (almost none of which addressed&para;<br>claims of vagueness), have nothing to do with “paring down.” The one&para;<br>that comes closest, United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S.&para;<br>363 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized&para;<br>by statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be&para;<br>commenced and completed. That is not much different from “reading&para;<br>in” a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in con­&para;<br>tracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or “paring down” of&para;<br>the statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that&para;<br>the proceedings would be prompt, id., at 370–371, and noted that&para;<br>(unlike here) it was not “decid[ing] issues of policy,” id., at 372.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

Attorney General v. Delaware &amp;&para;<br>Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909); see also United&para;<br>States v. Rumely, 345 U.

Here&para;<br>there is no choice to be made between two “fair alterna­&para;<br>tives.” Until today, no one has thought (and there is no&para;<br>basis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohib­&para;<br>ited only bribery and kickbacks.&para;<br>I certainly agree with the Court that we must, “if we&para;<br>can,” uphold, rather than “condemn,” Congress’s enact­&para;<br>ments, ante, at 38. But I do not believe we have the&para;<br>power, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.&para;<br>Congress enacted the entirety of the pre-McNally honest­&para;<br>services law, the content of which is (to put it mildly)&para;<br>unclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the&para;<br>temptation to make all things right with the stroke of our&para;<br>pen. See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974).&para;<br>I would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skill­&para;<br>ing’s conviction on the basis that §1346 provides no “ascer­&para;<br>tainable standard” for the conduct it condemns, L.

As I noted&para;<br>supra, at 2, Skilling has argued that §1346 cannot be&para;<br>constitutionally applied to him because it affords no defi­&para;<br>nition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though&para;<br>this reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling’s&para;<br>challenge a “facial” one, in the sense that it seeks invalida­&para;<br>tion of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to&para;<br>preventing its enforcement against him.

But Skilling only asks that his&para;<br>conviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57–58, so the&para;<br>remedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.&para;<br>I would therefore reverse Skilling’s conviction under&para;<br>§1346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it&para;<br>prohibits.

Of course, evidence of pretrial media&para;<br>attention and widespread community hostility may play a&para;<br>role in the bias inquiry. Such evidence may be important&para;<br>in assessing the adequacy of voir dire, see, e.g., Mu’Min v.&para;<br>Virginia, 500 U.

There are occasions in which such evidence&para;<br>weighs heavily in favor of a change of venue. In the end,&para;<br>however, if no biased jury is actually seated, there is no&para;<br>violation of the defendant’s right to an impartial jury. See&para;<br>id., at 1031–1035, 1041; Murphy v.

Where there is extraordinary pretrial&para;<br>publicity and community hostility, he contends, a court&para;<br>must presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of&para;<br>venue. Brief for Petitioner 25–34. I disagree. Careful voir&para;<br>dire can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even&para;<br>where pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile&para;<br>community sentiment. Moreover, once a jury has been&para;<br>selected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to&para;<br>insulate jurors from media coverage during the course of&para;<br>the trial. What the Sixth Amendment requires is “an&para;<br>impartial jury.” If the jury that sits and returns a verdict&para;<br>is impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment requires.&para;<br>The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text&para;<br>of the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply. It re&para;<br>quires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse&para;<br>pretrial media coverage and community hostility in a&para;<br>particular case has reached a certain level of severity, but&para;<br>there is no clear way of demarcating that level or of de&para;<br>termining whether it has been met.&para;<br>Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the 1960’s—&para;<br>Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966), Estes v. Texas,&para;<br>381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S.&para;<br>723 (1963).

I respect­&para;<br>fully dissent, however, from the Court’s conclusion that&para;<br>Jeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an impartial&para;<br>jury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the&para;<br>public’s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a&para;<br>court must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the&para;<br>jury. In this case, passions ran extremely high. The&para;<br>sudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of&para;<br>people in the Houston area and shocked the entire com­&para;<br>munity. The accompanying barrage of local media cover­&para;<br>age was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As&para;<br>Enron’s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the&para;<br>storm. Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not&para;<br>constitutionally compel a change of venue, they required&para;<br>the District Court to conduct a thorough voir dire in which&para;<br>prospective jurors’ attitudes about the case were closely&para;<br>scrutinized. The District Court’s inquiry lacked the neces­&para;<br>sary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether&para;<br>the jury empaneled to decide Skilling’s case was capable of&para;<br>rendering an impartial decision based solely on the evi­&para;<br>dence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.&para;<br>Virtually overnight, what had been the city’s “largest,&para;<br>most visible, and most prosperous company,” its “foremost&para;<br>social and charitable force,” and “a source of civic pride”&para;<br>was reduced to a “shattered shell.” App. ¶¶11, 13, pp.&para;<br>649a–650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company’s employ­&para;<br>ees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings van­&para;<br>ish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,&para;<br>thousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses&para;<br>shuttered, and community groups that once benefited from&para;<br>Enron’s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in con­&para;<br>tributions. See, e.g., 3 Supp. Record 1229, 1267; see also&para;<br>554 F. 3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (“Accounting firms that&para;<br>serviced Enron’s books had less work, hotels had more&para;<br>open rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on”).&para;<br>Enron’s community ties were so extensive that the entire&para;<br>local U. S. Attorney’s Office was forced to recuse itself&para;<br>from the Government’s investigation into the company’s&para;<br>fall. See 3 Supp. Record 608 (official press release).&para;<br>With Enron’s demise affecting the lives of so many&para;<br>Houstonians, local media coverage of the story saturated&para;<br>the community. According to a defense media expert, the&para;<br>Houston Chronicle—the area’s leading newspaper—&para;<br>assigned as many as 12 reporters to work on the Enron&para;<br>story full time.

Between May 2002 and October&para;<br>2004, local stations aired an estimated 19,000 news seg­&para;<br>ments involving Enron, more than 1600 of which men­&para;<br>tioned Skilling. 3 Supp. Record 2116.&para;<br>While many of the stories were straightforward news&para;<br>items, many others conveyed and amplified the commu­&para;<br>nity’s outrage at the top executives perceived to be respon­&para;<br>sible for the company’s bankruptcy. A Chronicle report on&para;<br>Skilling’s 2002 testimony before Congress is typical of the&para;<br>coverage. It began, “Across Houston, Enron employees&para;<br>watched former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling’s congres­&para;<br>sional testimony on television, turning incredulous, angry&para;<br>and then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew as savvy&para;<br>and detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance&para;<br>about critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed&para;<br>energy giant.” App. 1218a. “ ‘He is lying; he knew every­&para;<br>thing,’ said [an employee], who said she had seen Skilling&para;<br>frequently over her 18 years with the firm, where Skilling&para;<br>was known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at&para;<br>the company. ‘I am getting sicker by the minute.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>1219a.

Skilling’s media&para;<br>expert counted nearly a hundred victim-related stories in&para;<br>the Chronicle, including a “multi-page layout entitled ‘The&para;<br>Faces of Enron,’ ” which poignantly described the gut­&para;<br>wrenching experiences of former employees who lost vast&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

The conventional wisdom that blame for&para;<br>Enron’s devastating implosion and the ensuing human&para;<br>tragedy ultimately rested with Skilling and former Enron&para;<br>Chairman Kenneth Lay became so deeply ingrained in the&para;<br>popular imagination that references to their involvement&para;<br>even turned up on the sports pages: “If you believe the&para;<br>story about [Coach Bill Parcells] not having anything to do&para;<br>with the end of Emmitt Smith’s Cowboys career, then you&para;<br>probably believe in other far-fetched concepts.

S. attorney who de­&para;<br>scribed the plea as “a serious blow to the defense”). A&para;<br>Chronicle editorial opined that “Causey’s admission of&para;<br>securities fraud . . . . makes less plausible Lay’s claim that&para;<br>most of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial&para;<br>pressure rather than actual wrongdoing.” Id., at 12391.&para;<br>With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling re­&para;<br>newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the&para;<br>questionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea con­&para;<br>firmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In&para;<br>the alternative, Skilling asserted that “defendants are&para;<br>entitled to a more thorough jury selection process than&para;<br>currently envisioned by the [c]ourt.” Id., at 12067. The&para;<br>court had announced its intention to question individual&para;<br>jurors at the bench with one attorney for each side pre­&para;<br>sent, and to complete the voir dire in a single day. See,&para;<br>e.g., id., at 11804–11805, 11808. Skilling proposed, inter&para;<br>alia, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in&para;<br>questioning, id., at 12074; that jurors be questioned pri­&para;<br>vately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would&para;<br>be easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,&para;<br>clients, and jury consultants, id., at 12070–12072; and&para;<br>that the court “avoid leading questions,” which “tend to&para;<br>[e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that&para;<br>may not reflect their actual views,” id., at 12072. At a&para;<br>minimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a&para;<br>continuance of at least 30 days and send a revised ques­&para;<br>tionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. Id., at&para;<br>12074–12075.&para;<br>The District Court denied Skilling’s motion without a&para;<br>hearing, stating in a brief order that it was “not persuaded&para;<br>that the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . .&para;<br>establish that pretrial publicity and/or community preju­&para;<br>dice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id.,&para;<br>at 14115. According to the court, the “jury questionnaires&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>sent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the&para;<br>court’s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide&para;<br>adequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the&para;<br>selection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.” Id., at&para;<br>14115–14116. The court did agree to delay the trial by&para;<br>two weeks, until January 30, 2006.&para;<br>The coming trial featured prominently in local news&para;<br>outlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle&para;<br>described “the hurt and anger and resentment” that had&para;<br>been “churn[ing] inside” Houstonians since Enron’s col­&para;<br>lapse. Id., at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for&para;<br>offering a “doofus defense” (“a plea of not guilty by reason&para;<br>of empty-headedness”), the paper stated that “Lay and&para;<br>Skilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet&para;<br>now fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.”&para;<br>Ibid. The article allowed that the defendants’ guilt,&para;<br>“though perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an&para;<br>assertion. A jury now takes up the task of deciding&para;<br>whether that assertion is valid.” Id., at 39947. The next&para;<br>paragraph, however, assured readers that “it’s normal for&para;<br>your skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe­&para;<br>eyed innocence that they were unaware that something&para;<br>was amiss at Enron. The company’s utter failure belies&para;<br>the claim.” Ibid. (one paragraph break omitted); see also&para;<br>id., at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would “have&para;<br>to offer a convincing explanation for how executives once&para;<br>touted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark&para;<br>about the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their&para;<br>own company”).&para;<br>It is against this backdrop of widespread community&para;<br>impact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection&para;<br>in Skilling’s case unfolded. Approximately 160 prospective&para;<br>jurors appeared for voir dire at a federal courthouse lo­&para;<br>cated “about six blocks from Enron’s former headquar­&para;<br>ters.” 554 F. 3d, at 561. Addressing them as a group, the&para;<br>District Court began by briefly describing the case and&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>providing a standard admonition about the need to be fair&para;<br>and impartial and to decide the case based solely on the&para;<br>trial evidence and jury instructions. The court then asked&para;<br>whether anyone had “any reservations about your ability&para;<br>to conscientiously and fairly follow these very important&para;<br>rules.” App. 815a. Two individuals raised their hands&para;<br>and were called forward to the bench. One told the court&para;<br>that he thought Lay and Skilling “knew exactly what they&para;<br>were doing” and would have to prove their innocence. Id.,&para;<br>at 818a–819a. The second juror, who had stated on his&para;<br>written questionnaire that he held no opinion that would&para;<br>preclude him from being impartial, declared that he&para;<br>“would dearly love to sit on this jury. I would love to&para;<br>claim responsibility, at least 1⁄12 of the responsibility, for&para;<br>putting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their&para;<br>lives.” Id., at 819a–820a. The court excused both jurors&para;<br>for cause.&para;<br>The court proceeded to question individual jurors from&para;<br>the bench. As the majority recounts, ante, at 7–8, the&para;<br>court asked them a few general yes/no questions about&para;<br>their exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of,&para;<br>“Do you recall any particular articles that stand out that&para;<br>you’ve read about the case?” App. 850a. The court also&para;<br>asked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias,&para;<br>focusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly&para;<br>partial comments, the prospective jurors believed they&para;<br>“could be fair” and “put the government to its proof.” Id.,&para;<br>at 852a. Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues&para;<br>raised by the court. The court made clear, however, that&para;<br>its patience would be limited, see, e.g., id., at 879a, and&para;<br>questioning tended to be brief—generally less than five&para;<br>minutes per person. Even so, it exposed disqualifying&para;<br>biases among several prospective jurors who had earlier&para;<br>expressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 See&para;<br>&para;<br>App. 894a (Juror 43) (expressed the view that the defendants&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

This left 12 jurors&para;<br>and 4 alternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for&para;<br>the first time, “not [to] read anything dealing with the&para;<br>case or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or&para;<br>television or access any Internet sites that may deal with&para;<br>the case” and to “inform your friends and family members&para;<br>that they should not discuss with you anything they may&para;<br>have read or heard about this case.” Id., at 1026a. Start&para;<br>to finish, the selection process took about five hours.&para;<br>Skilling’s trial commenced the next day and lasted four&para;<br>months. After several days of deliberations, the jury&para;<br>found Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities&para;<br>fraud, 5 counts of making false representations to audi­&para;<br>tors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 in­&para;<br>sider trading counts. The jury found Lay guilty on all&para;<br>counts.&para;<br>On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his&para;<br>constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.&para;<br>Addressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by&para;<br>disavowing the District Court’s findings concerning “com­&para;<br>munity hostility.” There was, the court concluded, “suffi­&para;<br>cient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding&para;<br>of presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense&para;<br>volume of coverage.” 554 F. 3d, at 559. “[P]rejudice was&para;<br>[also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator’s well­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>“stole money” from their employees); id., at 922a (Juror 55) (admitted&para;<br>that she “lean[ed] towards prejudging” the defendants); id., at 946a&para;<br>(Juror 71) (stated that she would place the burden of proof on the&para;<br>defendants); id., at 954a–960a (Juror 75) (indicated that she could not&para;<br>set aside her view that there was fraud at Enron); id., at 1003a–1006a&para;<br>(Juror 104) (stated that she questioned the defendants’ innocence and&para;<br>that she “would be very upset with the government if they could not&para;<br>prove their case”); id., at 1008a (Juror 112) (expressed that the view&para;<br>that the defendants were guilty).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District&para;<br>Court for failing to “consider the wider context.” Id., at&para;<br>560. “[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess&para;<br>the tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the&para;<br>volume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the&para;<br>real inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an&para;<br>impartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrele­&para;<br>vant sources.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>According to the Court of Appeals, “[t]he district court&para;<br>seemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more&para;<br>than just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer&para;<br>number of victims.” Ibid.&para;<br>Having determined that “Skilling was entitled to a&para;<br>presumption of prejudice,” the Court of Appeals proceeded&para;<br>to explain that “the presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the&para;<br>government may demonstrate from the voir dire that an&para;<br>impartial jury was actually impanelled.” Id., at 561 (in­&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted). Describing the voir dire&para;<br>as “exemplary,” “searching,” and “proper and thorough,”&para;<br>id., at 562, the court concluded that “[t]he government&para;<br>[had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that&para;<br>convicted Skilling was impartial,” id., at 564–565. On this&para;<br>basis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling’s claim and&para;<br>affirmed his convictions.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and&para;<br>the due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guaran­&para;<br>tee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside&para;<br>preconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and&para;<br>decide guilt or innocence “based on the evidence presented&para;<br>in court.” Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see&para;<br>also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966).&para;<br>Community passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial&para;<br>publicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt. In&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Yount, 467 U. S.&para;<br>1025, 1031 (1984).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of pre­&para;<br>sumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework:&para;<br>Once the defendant musters sufficient evidence of com­&para;<br>munity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to&para;<br>prove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly&para;<br>envisions a fixed point at which public passions become so&para;<br>intense that prejudice to a defendant’s fair-trial rights&para;<br>must be presumed. The majority declines, however, to&para;<br>decide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the&para;<br>Court of Appeals held.&para;<br>This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive&para;<br>prejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely&para;<br>convey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of&para;<br>public enmity rises, so too does the danger that the preju­&para;<br>dices of the community will infiltrate the jury. The under­&para;<br>lying question has always been this: Do we have confi­&para;<br>dence that the jury’s verdict was “induced only by evidence&para;<br>and argument in open court, and not by any outside influ­&para;<br>ence, whether of private talk or public print”? Patterson v.&para;<br>Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U. S. 454,&para;<br>462 (1907).&para;<br>The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a&para;<br>jury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the&para;<br>intensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial&para;<br>publicity and community animus.&para;<br>Reviewing courts,&para;<br>meanwhile, must assess whether the trial court’s proce­&para;<br>dures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury&para;<br>free from disqualifying bias. Cf. Murphy v. Florida, 421&para;<br>U. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for “any&para;<br>indications in the totality of circumstances that peti­&para;<br>tioner’s trial was not fundamentally fair”). This Court’s&para;<br>precedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>situations to safeguard a defendant’s constitutional right&para;<br>to a fair trial before an impartial jury.&para;<br>At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on rare&para;<br>occasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circum­&para;<br>stances that it has reversed a defendant’s conviction&para;<br>“without pausing to examine . . . the voir dire examination&para;<br>of the members of the jury.” Rideau v. Louisiana, 373&para;<br>U. S. 723, 727 (1963). In Rideau, repeated television&para;<br>broadcasts of the defendant’s confession to murder, rob­&para;<br>bery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local senti­&para;<br>ment as to raise doubts that even the most careful voir&para;<br>dire could have secured an impartial jury. A change of&para;<br>venue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to&para;<br>assure a fair trial. Ibid.; see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,&para;<br>N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §23.2(a), p. 264&para;<br>(3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (“The best reading of&para;<br>Rideau is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial&para;<br>publicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that&para;<br>the voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the&para;<br>likely prejudice among prospective jurors”).&para;<br>As the majority describes, ante, at 14, this Court&para;<br>reached similar conclusions in Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S.&para;<br>532 (1965), and Sheppard, 384 U. S. 333. These cases&para;<br>involved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media&para;<br>disruption of the trial process itself. Rejecting the argu­&para;<br>ment that the defendants were not entitled to relief from&para;<br>their convictions because they “ha[d] established no isola­&para;<br>table prejudice,” the Court described the “untoward cir­&para;<br>cumstances” as “inherently suspect.” Estes, 381 U. S., at&para;<br>542, 544. It would have been difficult for the jurors not to&para;<br>have been swayed, at least subconsciously, by the “bed­&para;<br>lam” that surrounded them. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 355.&para;<br>Criticizing the trial courts’ failures “to protect the jury&para;<br>from outside influence,” id., at 358, the Court stressed&para;<br>that, “where there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudi­&para;<br>cial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>should continue the case until the threat abates, or trans­&para;<br>fer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.”&para;<br>Id., at 363. Estes and Sheppard thus applied Rideau’s&para;<br>insight that in particularly extreme circumstances even&para;<br>the most rigorous voir dire cannot suffice to dispel the&para;<br>reasonable likelihood of jury bias.&para;<br>Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has&para;<br>declined to discount voir dire entirely and has instead&para;<br>examined the particulars of the jury selection process to&para;<br>determine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted&para;<br>by pretrial publicity and community animus. The Court&para;<br>has recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant&para;<br>pervades the community there is a high risk that biased&para;<br>jurors will find their way onto the panel. The danger is&para;<br>not merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately&para;<br>hide their prejudices, but also that, as “part of a commu­&para;<br>nity deeply hostile to the accused,” “they may unwittingly&para;<br>[be] influenced” by the fervor that surrounds them. Mur&para;<br>phy, 421 U. S., at 803. To assure an impartial jury in such&para;<br>adverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully con­&para;<br>sider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors&para;<br>and then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assur­&para;<br>ances of fairness. Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719,&para;<br>729 (1992) (“[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant’s right&para;<br>to an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify&para;<br>unqualified jurors”).&para;<br>Irvin offers an example of a case in which the trial&para;<br>court’s voir dire did not suffice to counter the “wave of&para;<br>public passion” that had swept the community prior to the&para;<br>defendant’s trial. 366 U. S., at 728. The local news media&para;<br>had “extensively covered” the crimes (a murder spree),&para;<br>“arous[ing] great excitement and indignation.” Id., at 719&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin’s&para;<br>arrest, the press “blanketed” the community with “a bar­&para;<br>rage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons and pic­&para;<br>tures” communicating numerous unfavorable details about&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Irvin, including that he had purportedly confessed. Id., at&para;<br>725. Nearly 90 percent of the 430 prospective jurors ex­&para;<br>amined during the trial court’s voir dire “entertained some&para;<br>opinion as to guilt—ranging in intensity from mere suspi­&para;<br>cion to absolute certainty.” Id., at 727. Of the 12 jurors&para;<br>seated, 8 “thought petitioner was guilty,” although “each&para;<br>indicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could ren­&para;<br>der an impartial verdict.” Id., at 727, 724.&para;<br>Despite the seated jurors’ assurances of impartiality,&para;<br>this Court invalidated Irvin’s conviction for want of due&para;<br>process. “It is not required,” this Court declared, “that the&para;<br>jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.&para;<br>. . . It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression&para;<br>or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence&para;<br>presented in court.” Id., at 722–723. The Court empha­&para;<br>sized, however, that a juror’s word on this matter is not&para;<br>decisive, particularly when “the build-up of prejudice [in&para;<br>the community] is clear and convincing.” Id., at 725.&para;<br>Many of Irvin’s jurors, the Court noted, had been influ­&para;<br>enced by “the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown&para;<br>to be present throughout the community.” Id., at 727&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not&para;<br>“doubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he&para;<br>would be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but . . . [w]here so&para;<br>many, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a state­&para;<br>ment of impartiality can be given little weight.” Id., at&para;<br>728.&para;<br>The media coverage and community animosity in Irvin&para;<br>was particularly intense. In three subsequent cases, this&para;<br>Court recognized that high-profile cases may generate&para;<br>substantial publicity without stirring similar public pas­&para;<br>sions. The jury selection process in such cases, the Court&para;<br>clarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case&para;<br>such as Irvin. So long as the trial court conducts a rea­&para;<br>sonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the abil­&para;<br>ity of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>a verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would&para;<br>generally have no reason to doubt the jury’s impartiality.8&para;<br>The first of these cases, Murphy, 421 U. S. 794, involved&para;<br>a well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publi­&para;<br>cized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied&para;<br>his motion for a change of venue and during voir dire&para;<br>excused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distin­&para;<br>guishing Irvin, this Court saw no indication in the voir&para;<br>dire of “such hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who&para;<br>served in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not&para;<br>be laid aside.” 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors&para;<br>“had a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Mur­&para;<br>phy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his]&para;<br>past crimes,” “none betrayed any belief in the relevance of&para;<br>[Murphy’s] past to the present case.” Ibid.; see also ibid.,&para;<br>n. 4 (contrasting a juror’s “mere familiarity with [a defen­&para;<br>dant] or his past” with “an actual predisposition against&para;<br>him”). “[T]hese indicia of impartiality,” the Court sug­&para;<br>gested, “might be disregarded in a case where the general&para;<br>atmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently&para;<br>inflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Mur­&para;<br>phy’s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.” Id., at 802.&para;<br>In a second case, Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, the defendant&para;<br>was granted a new trial four years after being convicted of&para;<br>murder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial&para;<br>publicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had&para;<br>previously been convicted and had made confessions that&para;<br>would be inadmissible in court. The state trial court&para;<br>denied Yount’s motion and seated a jury following a 10­&para;<br>day voir dire of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Of course, even if the jury selection process is adequate, a trial court&para;<br>violates a defendant’s right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies&para;<br>a for-cause challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on&para;<br>the jury. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304,&para;<br>316 (2000) (“[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed&para;<br>for cause . . . would require reversal”).&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>prospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent&para;<br>“admitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.”&para;<br>Id., at 1029. Declining to grant relief on federal habeas&para;<br>review, this Court stressed the significant interval be­&para;<br>tween Yount’s first trial—when “adverse publicity and the&para;<br>community’s sense of outrage were at their height”—and&para;<br>his second trial, which “did not occur until four years later,&para;<br>at a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly dimin­&para;<br>ished and community sentiment had softened.” Id., at&para;<br>1032. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had&para;<br>“at some time . . . formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt,”&para;<br>the “particularly extensive” voir dire confirmed that “time&para;<br>had weakened or eliminated any” bias they once may have&para;<br>harbored. Id., at 1029–1030, 1034, n. 10, 1033. Accord­&para;<br>ingly, this Court concluded, “the trial court did not commit&para;<br>manifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was&para;<br>impartial.” Id., at 1032.&para;<br>This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of&para;<br>pretrial publicity in Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415&para;<br>(1991). Mu’Min stood accused of murdering a woman&para;<br>while out of prison on a work detail. Citing 47 newspaper&para;<br>articles about the crime, Mu’Min moved for a change of&para;<br>venue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and at­&para;<br>tempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of&para;<br>the 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard&para;<br>about the case from media or other sources. Dividing&para;<br>these prospective jurors into panels of four, the court&para;<br>asked further general questions about their ability to be&para;<br>fair given what they had heard or read. One juror an­&para;<br>swered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The&para;<br>court refused Mu’Min’s request to ask more specific ques­&para;<br>tions “relating to the content of news items that potential&para;<br>jurors might have read or seen.” Id., at 419.

S., at 429. Mu’Min’s&para;<br>offense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C.,&para;<br>area, “which has a population of over 3 million, and in&para;<br>which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed&para;<br>each year.” Ibid. While the crime garnered “substantial”&para;<br>pretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in&para;<br>Irvin and “did not contain the same sort of damaging&para;<br>information.” 500 U. S., at 429–430. Moreover, in con­&para;<br>trast to Irvin, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed&para;<br>having ever formed an opinion about the case. Given&para;<br>these circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu’Min’s asser­&para;<br>tion that the trial court committed constitutional error by&para;<br>declining to “make precise inquiries about the contents of&para;<br>any news reports that potential jurors have read.” 500&para;<br>U. S., at 424. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling&para;<br>was context-specific: “Had the trial court in this case been&para;<br>confronted with the ‘wave of public passion’ engendered by&para;<br>pretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin’s&para;<br>trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend­&para;<br>ment might well have required more extensive examina­&para;<br>tion of potential jurors than it undertook here.” Id., at&para;<br>429.&para;<br>III&para;<br>It is necessary to determine how this case compares to&para;<br>our existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances&para;<br>so inherently prejudicial that, as in Rideau, even the most&para;<br>scrupulous voir dire would have been “but a hollow formal­&para;<br>ity” incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury? 373&para;<br>U. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not of this charac­&para;<br>ter, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process&para;<br>sufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>community animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable&para;<br>of presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial&para;<br>influences?&para;<br>A&para;<br>Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that&para;<br>the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was&para;<br>not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District&para;<br>Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling’s mo­&para;<br>tion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this&para;<br>conclusion. First, as the Court observes, ante, at 16, the&para;<br>size and diversity of the Houston community make it&para;<br>probable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number&para;<br>of persons who were unaffected by Enron’s collapse, neu­&para;<br>tral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the&para;<br>public furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while&para;<br>ubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court&para;<br>points out, ante, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or&para;<br>similar “smoking-gun” evidence of specific criminal acts.&para;<br>For many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefen­&para;<br>dant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the&para;<br>pleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt&para;<br>suggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds&para;<br>exposed to such information would not necessarily have&para;<br>formed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was&para;<br>guilty as charged. Cf. Rideau, 373 U. S., at 726 (a major­&para;<br>ity of the county’s residents were “exposed repeatedly and&para;<br>in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing&para;<br>in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be&para;<br>charged”). Third, there is no suggestion that the court­&para;<br>room in this case became, as in Estes and Sheppard, a&para;<br>“carnival” in which the “calmness and solemnity” of the&para;<br>proceedings was compromised. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at&para;<br>358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is thus&para;<br>appropriate to examine the voir dire and determine&para;<br>whether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>jury actually selected.9&para;<br>B&para;<br>In concluding that the voir dire “adequately detect[ed]&para;<br>and defuse[d] juror bias,” ante, at 20, the Court downplays&para;<br>the extent of the community’s antipathy toward Skilling&para;<br>and exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process.&para;<br>The devastating impact of Enron’s collapse and the relent­&para;<br>less media coverage demanded exceptional care on the&para;<br>part of the District Court to ensure the seating of an im­&para;<br>partial jury. While the procedures employed by the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court might have been adequate in the typical high­&para;<br>profile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary&para;<br>circumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling’s constitu­&para;<br>tional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Whether&para;<br>&para;<br>the District Court abused its discretion in declining to&para;<br>change venue pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a&para;<br>different question. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 21(a) (“Upon the defen­&para;<br>dant’s motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that&para;<br>defendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a&para;<br>prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that&para;<br>the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there”). As this&para;<br>Court has indicated, its supervisory powers confer “more latitude” to set&para;<br>standards for the conduct of trials in federal courts than in state courts.&para;<br>Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 424 (1991). While the circumstances&para;<br>may not constitutionally compel a change of venue “without pausing to&para;<br>examine . . . the voir dire,” Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723, 727&para;<br>(1963), the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the&para;<br>community’s deep-seated animus toward Skilling certainly meant that&para;<br>the task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major chal­&para;<br>lenge, with no guarantee of success. It likely would have been far&para;<br>easier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the Enron story&para;<br>had less salience. I thus agree with the Court of Appeals that “[i]t&para;<br>would not have been imprudent for the [District] [C]ourt to have&para;<br>granted Skilling’s transfer motion.” 554 F. 3d 529, 558 (CA5 2009).&para;<br>Skilling, however, likely forfeited any Rule 21 or supervisory powers&para;<br>claim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit, see id., at 559, n. 39, or in his petition for certiorari, cf. ante, at&para;<br>12, n. 11.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the “wide&para;<br>discretion” owed to trial courts when it comes to jury­&para;<br>related issues. Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. ante, at 20–&para;<br>21. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public&para;<br>sentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Prox­&para;<br>imity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons&para;<br>in the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.&para;<br>“[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an&para;<br>independent evaluation of the circumstances.” Sheppard,&para;<br>384 U. S., at 362. In particular, reviewing courts are well&para;<br>qualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented&para;<br>procedures adequate to keep community prejudices from&para;<br>infecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not&para;<br>befit the circumstances of the case, the trial court’s rulings&para;<br>on impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See&para;<br>Morgan, 504 U. S., at 729–730 (“ ‘Without an adequate&para;<br>voir dire the trial judge’s responsibility to remove prospec­&para;<br>tive jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the&para;<br>court’s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be&para;<br>fulfilled’ ” (quoting Rosales-Lopez v.

For Houstonians, Enron’s collapse was an event&para;<br>of once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the&para;<br>volume of media coverage “immense” and frequently in­&para;<br>temperate, but “the sheer number of victims” created a&para;<br>climate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The pre­&para;<br>trial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news&para;<br>reports, most of which were “largely factual in nature.”&para;<br>Murphy, 421 U. S., at 802. There was no indication that&para;<br>the relevant communities had been captivated by the&para;<br>cases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In&para;<br>contrast, the number of media reports in this case reached&para;<br>the tens of thousands, and full-throated denunciations of&para;<br>Skilling were common. The much closer analogy is thus to&para;<br>Irvin, which similarly featured a “barrage” of media cover­&para;<br>age and a “huge . . . wave of public passion,” 366 U. S., at&para;<br>725, 728, although even that case did not, as here, involve&para;<br>direct harm to entire segments of the community.10&para;<br>Attempting to distinguish Irvin, the majority suggests&para;<br>that Skilling’s economic offenses were less incendiary than&para;<br>Irvin’s violent crime spree and that “news stories about&para;<br>Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor­&para;<br>mation rife in reports about Irvin’s rampage of robberies&para;<br>and murders.” Ante, at 28. Along similar lines, the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court described “the facts of this case [as] neither&para;<br>heinous nor sensational.” App. to Brief for United States&para;<br>10a. The majority also points to the four years that&para;<br>passed between Enron’s declaration of bankruptcy and the&para;<br>start of Skilling’s trial, asserting that “the decibel level of&para;<br>media attention diminished somewhat” over this time.&para;<br>Ante, at 17.

Indeed, the record in this case is&para;<br>replete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling&para;<br>and other Enron executives. See, e.g., Record 39946&para;<br>(front-page, eve-of-trial story describing “the hurt and&para;<br>anger and resentment . . . churn[ing] inside” the people of&para;<br>Houston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other&para;<br>things, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terror­&para;<br>ist.11 As one commentator observed, “[i]t’s a sign of how&para;<br>shocked Houstonians are about Enron’s ignominious&para;<br>demise that Sept. 11 can be invoked—and is frequently—&para;<br>to explain the shock of the company’s collapse.” 3 Supp.&para;<br>Record 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and&para;<br>other top executives hired private security to protect&para;<br>themselves from persons inclined to take the law into their&para;<br>own hands.

If anything, the time that elapsed between the&para;<br>bankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an&para;<br>unbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members&para;<br>of the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related&para;<br>guilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their&para;<br>certainty that Skilling too had engaged in—if not master­&para;<br>minded—criminal acts, particularly given that the media&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling testified before Congress,&para;<br>and other Enron executives invoked their Fifth Amendment rights;&para;<br>Enron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted, tried, convicted, and&para;<br>sentenced on charges of obstruction of justice; the Enron Task Force&para;<br>charged Enron CFO and Skilling-protégé Andrew Fastow with fraud,&para;<br>money laundering, and other crimes; and at least two Enron employees&para;<br>pleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task&para;<br>Force indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr.&para;<br>(the company’s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant&para;<br>treasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband&para;<br>Services; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received&para;<br>prison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.&para;<br>In 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and&para;<br>Causey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding&para;<br>Lay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered&para;<br>guilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers&para;<br>were defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal&para;<br>involving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a 3-month trial was held&para;<br>in Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various&para;<br>pretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of Skilling, Lay,&para;<br>and Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey&para;<br>pleaded guilty to securities fraud.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>coverage reinforced this view. See supra, at 7–8. The trial&para;<br>of Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had&para;<br>come before. See Record 40002 (noting that “prosecutors&para;<br>followed the classic pattern of working their way up&para;<br>through the ranks”). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,&para;<br>shortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services&para;<br>executives ended without convictions, “The real trial, the&para;<br>true measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in Janu­&para;<br>ary. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We’ve got&para;<br>bigger fish in need of frying.” App. 1460a (paragraph&para;<br>breaks omitted); see also ibid. (“From the beginning, the&para;<br>Enron prosecution has had one true measure of success:&para;<br>Lay and Skilling in a cold steel cage”).&para;<br>Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston&para;<br>community remained overwhelmingly negative was dis­&para;<br>pelled by prospective jurors’ responses to the written&para;<br>questionnaires. As previously indicated, supra, at 5–7,&para;<br>more than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew&para;<br>victims of Enron’s collapse or were victims themselves,&para;<br>and two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen­&para;<br>dant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling&para;<br>was palpable. See nn. 4, 6, supra. Only a small fraction of&para;<br>the prospective jurors raised no red flags in their re­&para;<br>sponses. And this was before Causey’s guilty plea and the&para;<br>flurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of&para;<br>trial. One of Skilling’s experts, a political scientist who&para;<br>had studied pretrial publicity “for over 35 years” and&para;<br>consulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he&para;<br>had recommended against venue changes more often than&para;<br>not), “c[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of&para;<br>bias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at&para;<br>least one of the very highest I have ever encountered.”&para;<br>App. ¶¶2, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>2&para;<br>Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S., at&para;<br>362. As this Court has recognized, “[i]n a community&para;<br>where most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying preju­&para;<br>dice, the reliability of the others’ protestations may be&para;<br>drawn into question.” Murphy, 421 U.

Perhaps be­&para;<br>cause it had underestimated the public’s antipathy toward&para;<br>Skilling, the District Court’s 5-hour voir dire was mani­&para;<br>festly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.13&para;<br>As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the&para;<br>three previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were simi­&para;<br>larly brief.

In particular, the defendants had not been person­&para;<br>ally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism&para;<br>that had been directed at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see, e.g.,&para;<br>supra, at 25–26, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely&para;<br>seen as the climactic event of the Enron saga. Accordingly, my conclu­&para;<br>sion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice&para;<br>to select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the&para;<br>processes used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.&para;<br>Moreover, in referencing the length of the voir dire in this case, I do&para;<br>not mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the&para;<br>adequacy of a jury selection process. Trial courts, including this one,&para;<br>should be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always&para;<br>take care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a&para;<br>defendant’s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect to court­&para;<br>led versus attorney-led voir dire. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure&para;<br>24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options,&para;<br>and I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial&para;<br>jury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the&para;<br>scope of the voir dire is tailored to the circumstances.&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v.

In fact, the court asked very&para;<br>few prospective jurors any questions directed to their&para;<br>knowledge of or feelings about that event.14 Considering&para;<br>how much news the plea generated, many more than two&para;<br>venire members were likely aware of it. The lack of ques­&para;<br>tioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea&para;<br>on those jurors impossible to assess.&para;<br>The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to de­&para;<br>scribe personal interactions they may have had about the&para;<br>case, or to consider whether they might have difficulty&para;<br>avoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or&para;<br>colleagues during the course of the lengthy trial. The&para;<br>tidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects&para;<br>provided cause for concern. In response to general media­&para;<br>related questions, several prospective jurors volunteered&para;<br>that they had spoken with others about the case. Juror&para;<br>74, for example, indicated that her husband was the “news&para;<br>person,” that they had “talked about it,” that she had also&para;<br>heard things “from work,” and that what she heard was&para;<br>“all negative, of course.” App. 948a.

It seemed suspicious, she intimated, “to&para;<br>have an insurance policy ahead of time.” Id., at 999a. The&para;<br>court advised her that “most corporations provide insur­&para;<br>ance for their officers and directors.” Ibid. The court,&para;<br>however, did not investigate the matter further, even&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 Portions of the voir dire transcript erroneously refer to this pro­&para;<br>spective juror as “Juror 110.” See, e.g., id., at 996a.&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>though it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to&para;<br>talk to each other about the case. Id., at 843a. It is thus&para;<br>not apparent whether other prospective jurors also over­&para;<br>heard the information and whether they too believed that&para;<br>it reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it appar­&para;<br>ent what other outside information may have been shared&para;<br>among the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101’s&para;<br>statements indicate that the court’s questions were failing&para;<br>to bring to light the extent of jurors’ exposure to poten­&para;<br>tially prejudicial facts and that some prospective jurors were having difficulty following the court’s&para;<br>directives.&para;<br>The topics that the District Court did cover were ad­&para;<br>dressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were&para;<br>asked just a few yes/no questions about their general&para;<br>exposure to media coverage and a handful of additional&para;<br>questions concerning any responses to the written ques­&para;<br>tionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their&para;<br>answers were unenlightening.16 Yet the court rarely&para;<br>sought to draw them out with open-ended questions about&para;<br>their impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited&para;<br>patience for counsel’s followup efforts. See, e.g., id., at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 The&para;<br>&para;<br>court’s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat on the jury) is typical:&para;<br>“Q.

See&para;<br>id., at 863a (“[H]e said he thought that he would find them&para;<br>guilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said&para;<br>that it would be worse than a German trying to say that&para;<br>they didn’t kill the Jews”).19 Other jurors may well have&para;<br>encountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary&para;<br>rhetoric.&para;<br>These deficiencies in the form and content of the voir&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority’s criticism of Skilling’s counsel for failing to ask ques­&para;<br>tions of many of the prospective jurors, cf. ante, at 23–24, is thus&para;<br>misplaced. Given the District Court’s express warning early in the voir&para;<br>dire that it would not allow counsel “to ask individual questions if&para;<br>[they] abuse[d]” that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be blamed for&para;<br>declining to test the court’s boundaries at every turn. Moreover, the&para;<br>court’s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave&para;<br>counsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.&para;<br>18 Although the District Court underestimated the extent of the com­&para;<br>munity hostility, it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial&para;<br>publicity, acknowledging that “all of us have been exposed to substan­&para;<br>tial media attention about this case.” Id., at 841a. The court even&para;<br>made an offhand remark about one of the prior Enron prosecutions,&para;<br>“the Nigerian barge case,” apparently expecting that the prospective&para;<br>jurors would understand the reference. Id., at 840a.&para;<br>19 Taking a more defendant-favorable line than most prospective ju­&para;<br>rors, Juror 17 stated that he “thought the guy [on the radio] was pretty&para;<br>narrow minded,” that “everyone should be considered innocent totally&para;<br>until they get a chance to come [to] court,” and that the Government&para;<br>might have been overzealous in some of its Enron-related prosecutions.&para;<br>Id., at 863a–864a. He added, however, that he “believe[d] there was&para;<br>probably some accounting fraud [at Enron].” Id., at 864a. The District&para;<br>Court denied the Government’s request to remove Juror 17 for cause,&para;<br>but he did not ultimately sit on the jury.&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>dire questions contributed to a deeper problem: The Dis­&para;<br>trict Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment&para;<br>of prospective jurors’ assurances of impartiality. Although&para;<br>the Court insists otherwise, ante, at 26, the voir dire tran­&para;<br>script indicates that the District Court essentially took&para;<br>jurors at their word when they promised to be fair. In­&para;<br>deed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospec­&para;<br>tive juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impar­&para;<br>tiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.&para;<br>Juror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that&para;<br>Skilling was “not an honest man.” App. 881a. During&para;<br>questioning, she acknowledged having previously thought&para;<br>the defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost&para;<br>$50,000–$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron’s col­&para;<br>lapse. Id., at 880a, 883a. But she ultimately agreed that&para;<br>she would be able to presume innocence. Id., at 881a,&para;<br>884a. Noting that she “blame[d] Enron for the loss of her&para;<br>money” and appeared to have “unshakeable bias,” Skill­&para;<br>ing’s counsel challenged her for cause. Id., at 885a. The&para;<br>court, however, declined to remove her, stating that “she&para;<br>answered candidly she’s going to have an open mind now”&para;<br>and “agree[ing]” with the Government’s assertion that “we&para;<br>have to take her at her word.” Id., at 885a–886a.20 As&para;<br>——————&para;<br>20 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by&para;<br>noting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a&para;<br>peremptory challenge to remove her. See ante, at 30, n. 31. The&para;<br>majority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members&para;<br>who were not ultimately seated. See ante, at 24, n. 24. The comments&para;<br>of these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impar­&para;<br>tiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly “part of a community&para;<br>deeply hostile to the accused” and who may have been “unwittingly&para;<br>influenced by it.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 803 (1975); see also&para;<br>Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the&para;<br>District Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror&para;<br>29 goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire. If Juror 29 made it&para;<br>through to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confi­&para;<br>dence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>this Court has made plain, jurors’ assurances of impartial­&para;<br>ity simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic signifi­&para;<br>cance. See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (“[T]he juror’s&para;<br>assurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be disposi­&para;<br>tive of the accused’s rights”); Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728&para;<br>(“Where so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, . . . a&para;<br>statement of impartiality can be given little weight”).&para;<br>Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions&para;<br>accepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal&para;<br>on their face. Prospective jurors who “hope[d]” they could&para;<br>presume innocence and did “not necessarily” think Skill­&para;<br>ing was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App.&para;<br>932a, 857a. Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her&para;<br>questionnaire, “Shame on him.” Id., at 931a. Asked by&para;<br>the court about this, she stated that, “innocent or guilty,&para;<br>he was at the helm” and “should have known what was&para;<br>going on at the company.” Ibid.; see also id., at 934a&para;<br>(Skilling is “probably” “in the same boat as” Lay). The&para;<br>court then asked, “can you presume, as you start this trial,&para;<br>that Mr. Lay is innocent?” Id., at 932a. She responded, “I&para;<br>hope so, but you know. I don’t know. I can’t honestly&para;<br>answer that one way or the other.” Ibid.; see also id., at&para;<br>933a (“I bring in my past history. I bring in my biases. I&para;<br>would like to think I could rise above those, but I’ve never&para;<br>been in this situation before. So I don’t know how I could&para;<br>honestly answer that question one way or the other. . . . I&para;<br>do have some concerns”). Eventually, however, Juror 61&para;<br>answered “Yes” when the court asked if she would be able&para;<br>to acquit if she had “a reasonable doubt that the defen­&para;<br>dants are guilty.” Id., at 933a–934a. Challenging her for&para;<br>cause, defense counsel insisted that they had not received&para;<br>“a clear and unequivocal answer” about her ability to be&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>little is known about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave §23.2(f), at 288 (“The&para;<br>&para;<br>responses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated&para;<br>&para;<br>jurors who were familiar with the same publicity”). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>fair. Ibid. The court denied the challenge, stating, “You&para;<br>know, she tried.” Ibid.&para;<br>3&para;<br>The majority takes solace in the fact that most of the&para;<br>persons actually seated as jurors and alternates “specifi­&para;<br>cally stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron­&para;<br>related news.” Ante, at 24–25, and n. 26.21 In context,&para;<br>however, these general declarations reveal little about the&para;<br>seated jurors’ actual knowledge or views or the possible&para;<br>pressure they might have felt to convict, and thus cannot&para;<br>instill confidence that the jurors “were not under [the]&para;<br>sway” of the prevailing community sentiment. Cf. ante, at&para;<br>25. Jurors who did not “get into details” of Enron’s com­&para;<br>plicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless&para;<br>knew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that&para;<br>Skilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains.&para;<br>Juror 63, for instance, told the court that she “may have&para;<br>heard a little bit” about Enron-related litigation but had&para;<br>not “really pa[id] attention.” Id., at 935a. Yet she was&para;<br>clearly aware of some specifics. On her questionnaire,&para;<br>despite stating that she had not followed Enron-related&para;<br>news, she wrote about “whistleblowers and Arthur Ander­&para;<br>sen lying about Enron’s accounting,” and she expressed&para;<br>the view that Skilling and Lay “probably knew they were&para;<br>breaking the law.” Supp. App. 105sa–106sa. During&para;<br>questioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District&para;<br>Court obtained no meaningful information about the&para;<br>actual extent of Juror 63’s familiarity with the case or the&para;<br>basis for her belief in Skilling’s guilt. Yet it nevertheless&para;<br>——————&para;<br>21 The majority also notes that about two-thirds of the seated jurors&para;<br>and alternates (11 of 16) had no personal Enron connection. Ante, at&para;<br>24, and n. 25. This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and&para;<br>alternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost&para;<br>jobs or money as a result of Enron’s collapse—a fact that does not strike&para;<br>me as particularly reassuring.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>accepted her assurance that she could “absolutely” pre­&para;<br>sume innocence. App. 937a.22&para;<br>Indeed, the District Court’s anemic questioning did little&para;<br>to dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numer­&para;<br>ous other seated jurors and alternates. In my estimation,&para;<br>more than half of those seated made written and oral&para;<br>comments suggesting active antipathy toward the defen­&para;<br>dants. The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts&para;<br>that “Skilling’s seated jurors . . . exhibited nothing like the&para;<br>display of bias shown in Irvin.” Ante, at 29. Juror 10, for&para;<br>instance, reported on his written questionnaire that he&para;<br>knew several co-workers who owned Enron stock; that he&para;<br>personally may have owned Enron stock through a mutual&para;<br>fund; that he heard and read about the Enron cases from&para;<br>the “Houston Chronicle, all three Houston news channels,&para;<br>Fox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and]&para;<br>Texas Lawyer Magazine”; that he believed Enron’s col­&para;<br>lapse “was due to greed and mismanagement”; that “[i]f&para;<br>[Lay] did not know what was going on in his company, he&para;<br>was really a poor manager/leader”; and that the defen­&para;<br>dants were “suspect.” Supp. App. 11sa–19sa. During&para;<br>questioning, he said he “th[ought]” he could presume&para;<br>innocence and “believe[d]” he could put the Government to&para;<br>its proof, but he also acknowledged that he might have&para;<br>“some hesitancy” “in telling people the government didn’t&para;<br>prove its case.” App. 851a–852a.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>22 As&para;<br>&para;<br>one of Skilling’s jury experts observed, there is a “tendency in&para;<br>voir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their&para;<br>exposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any&para;<br>biases they may have.” App. 763a; see also id., at 637a (“Those who&para;<br>perceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluc­&para;<br>tant to admit they cannot be fair”). For this reason, the fact that “none&para;<br>of the seated jurors and alternates checked the ‘yes’ box” on the written&para;<br>questionnaire when “asked whether they ‘ha[d] an opinion about&para;<br>[Skilling],’ ” ante, at 26, is of minimal significance, particularly given&para;<br>that the Causey plea and the impending trial received significant&para;<br>media coverage after the questionnaires were submitted.&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>SKILLING v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Juror 11 wrote that he “work[ed] with someone who&para;<br>worked at Enron”; that he got Enron-related news from&para;<br>the “Houston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13&para;<br>News, O’Reilly Factor, [and] talking with friends and co­&para;<br>workers”; that he regularly visited the Chronicle Web site;&para;<br>that “greed on Enron’s part” caused the company’s col­&para;<br>lapse; and that “a lot of people were hurt financially.”&para;<br>Supp. App. 26sa–30sa. During questioning, he stated that&para;<br>he would have “no problem” requiring the Government to&para;<br>prove its case, but he also told the court that he believed&para;<br>Lay was “greedy” and that corporate executives are often&para;<br>“stretching the legal limits . . . . I’m not going to say that&para;<br>they’re all crooks, but, you know.” App. 857a, 854a.&para;<br>Asked whether he would “star[t] the case with sort of an&para;<br>inkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must have done&para;<br>something illegal,” he offered an indeterminate “not neces­&para;<br>sarily.” Id., at 857.23&para;<br>——————&para;<br>23 Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly trou­&para;<br>bling sentiments.

Juror 13, for&para;<br>instance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard&para;<br>about the Enron cases from the “[n]ews.” Supp. App. 42sa.&para;<br>The court questioned him for two minutes, during which&para;<br>time he confirmed that he had “heard what’s on the news,&para;<br>basically,” including “that the trial had moved from the&para;<br>17th to the 31st.” He added that the story “was all over&para;<br>the news on every detail of Enron.” App. 858a–860a. No&para;<br>meaningful information about his knowledge or attitudes&para;<br>was obtained. Similarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not&para;<br>followed Enron-related news but was aware that “[m]any&para;<br>people lost their jobs.” Supp. App. 151sa. The court ques­&para;<br>tioned her for less than 90 seconds. During that time, she&para;<br>acknowledged that she had “caught glimpses” of the cov­&para;<br>erage and “kn[e]w generally, you know, that the company&para;<br>went bankrupt” and that there “were some employees that&para;<br>went off and did their own businesses.” App. 969a.

Id., at 815a–820a. The District Court’s individual&para;<br>questioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying&para;<br>prejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors&para;<br>who had earlier expressed no concerns about their impar­&para;<br>tiality. See n. 7, supra. It thus strikes me as highly likely&para;<br>that at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that&para;<br>they could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more&para;<br>probing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf. Yount,&para;<br>467 U.

The court did not press further.&para;<br>25 The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling “challenged only&para;<br>one of the seated jurors for cause” indicates that he did not believe the&para;<br>other jurors were biased. Ante, at 30. Our decisions, however, distin­&para;<br>guish claims involving “the partiality of an individual juror” from&para;<br>antecedent claims directed at “the partiality of the trial jury as a&para;<br>whole.” Patton v.
