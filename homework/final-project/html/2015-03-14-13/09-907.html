A., FKA MBNA &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICA BANK, N. A. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–907.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 4, 2010—Decided January 11, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code uses a statutory formula known as&para;<br>the “means test” to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do&para;<br>pay them. The means test instructs a debtor to determine his “dis&para;<br>posable income”—the amount he has available to reimburse credi&para;<br>tors—by deducting from his current monthly income “amounts rea&para;<br>sonably necessary to be expended” for, inter alia, “maintenance or&para;<br>support.” 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i). For a debtor whose income is&para;<br>above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which ex&para;<br>penses qualify as “amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.” As&para;<br>relevant here, the statute provides that “[t]he debtor’s monthly ex&para;<br>penses shall be the debtor’s applicable monthly expense amounts&para;<br>specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the&para;<br>debtor’s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other&para;<br>Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for&para;<br>the area in which the debtor resides.” §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).&para;<br>The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for&para;<br>basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers’&para;<br>ability to pay overdue taxes. The IRS also creates supplemental&para;<br>guidelines known as the “Collection Financial Standards,” which de&para;<br>scribe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them&para;<br>mean. The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation&para;<br>expenses, divided into vehicle “Ownership Costs” and vehicle “Oper&para;<br>ating Costs.” The Collection Financial Standards explain that “Own&para;<br>ership Costs” cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automo&para;<br>bile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car&para;<br>financing data. The Collection Financial Standards further state&para;<br>that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>for ownership costs.&para;<br>When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he&para;<br>listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor. Among his assets,&para;<br>Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt. In determining&para;<br>his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduc&para;<br>tion of $471, the full amount specified in the “Ownership Costs” table,&para;<br>as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs. Based&para;<br>on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan&para;<br>that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unse&para;<br>cured debt. FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct&para;<br>all of Ransom’s disposable income to unsecured creditors. FIA con&para;<br>tended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership al&para;<br>lowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.&para;<br>Agreeing, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the plan.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take&para;<br>the car-ownership deduction. Pp. 6–18.&para;<br>(a) This Court’s interpretation begins with the language of the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a debtor may claim only “ap&para;<br>plicable” expense amounts listed in the Standards. Because the Code&para;<br>does not define the key word “applicable,” the term carries its ordi&para;<br>nary meaning of appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit. What makes&para;<br>an expense amount “applicable” in this sense is most naturally un&para;<br>derstood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor’s financial&para;<br>circumstances. Congress established a filter, permitting a debtor to&para;<br>claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table only if&para;<br>that deduction is appropriate for him. And a deduction is so appro&para;<br>priate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the&para;<br>table during the life of the plan. Had Congress not wanted to sepa&para;<br>rate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it&para;<br>could have omitted the term “applicable” altogether. Without that&para;<br>word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each cate&para;<br>gory listed in the Standards. Interpreting the statute to require a&para;<br>threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that “applicable”&para;<br>carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.&para;<br>This reading draws support from the statute’s context and purpose.&para;<br>The Code initially defines a debtor’s disposable income as his “cur&para;<br>rent monthly income . . . less amounts reasonably necessary to be ex&para;<br>pended.” §1325(b)(2). It then instructs that such reasonably neces&para;<br>sary amounts “shall be determined in accordance with” the means&para;<br>test. §1325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to ap&para;<br>proximate the debtor’s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a&para;<br>debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incur&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ring an expense in the relevant category. Further, the statute’s pur&para;<br>pose—to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can af&para;<br>ford—is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with&para;<br>the statutory text, to reflect a debtor’s ability to afford repayment.&para;<br>Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car&para;<br>loan or lease. The expense amount listed ($471) is the average&para;<br>monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended&para;<br>to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a&para;<br>car. Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate “Operat&para;<br>ing Costs” deduction. A person who owns a car free and clear is enti&para;<br>tled to the “Operating Costs” deduction for all driving-related ex&para;<br>penses. But such a person may not claim the “Ownership Costs”&para;<br>deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car&para;<br>loan or lease. The IRS’ Collection Financial Standards reinforce this&para;<br>conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make&para;<br>no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduc&para;<br>tion. Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no ex&para;<br>pense in the “Ownership Costs” category, and that expense amount is&para;<br>therefore not “applicable” to him. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(c) Ransom’s arguments to the contrary—an alternative interpreta&para;<br>tion of the key word “applicable,” an objection to the Court’s view of&para;<br>the scope of the “Ownership Costs” category, and a criticism of the&para;<br>policy implications of the Court’s approach—are unpersuasive.&para;<br>Pp. 11–18.&para;<br>577 F. 3d 1026, affirmed.&para;<br>KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

See, e.g., ibid.&para;<br>(under BAPCPA, “debtors [will] repay creditors the maxi&para;<br>mum they can afford”).&para;<br>In Chapter 13 proceedings, the means test provides a&para;<br>formula to calculate a debtor’s disposable income, which&para;<br>the debtor must devote to reimbursing creditors under a&para;<br>court-approved plan generally lasting from three to five&para;<br>years. §§1325(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4).1 The statute defines&para;<br>“disposable income” as “current monthly income” less&para;<br>“amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” for “main&para;<br>tenance or support,” business expenditures, and certain&para;<br>charitable contributions. §§1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii). For a&para;<br>debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the&para;<br>means test identifies which expenses qualify as “amounts&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Chapter 13 borrows the means test from Chapter 7, where it is used&para;<br>as a screening mechanism to determine whether a Chapter 7 proceed&para;<br>ing is appropriate. Individuals who file for bankruptcy relief under&para;<br>Chapter 7 liquidate their nonexempt assets, rather than dedicate their&para;<br>future income, to repay creditors. See 11 U. S. C. §§704(a)(1), 726. If&para;<br>the debtor’s Chapter 7 petition discloses that his disposable income as&para;<br>calculated by the means test exceeds a certain threshold, the petition is&para;<br>presumptively abusive. §707(b)(2)(A)(i).

See, e.g., In re&para;<br>Slusher, 359 B. R. 290, 294 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Nev. 2007).&para;<br>Under the means test, a debtor calculating his “rea&para;<br>sonably necessary” expenses is directed to claim allow&para;<br>ances for defined living expenses, as well as for secured&para;<br>and priority debt. §§707(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(iv). As relevant&para;<br>here, the statute provides:&para;<br>“The debtor’s monthly expenses shall be the debtor’s&para;<br>applicable monthly expense amounts specified under&para;<br>the National Standards and Local Standards, and the&para;<br>debtor’s actual monthly expenses for the categories&para;<br>specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the&para;<br>Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which&para;<br>the debtor resides.” §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).&para;<br>These are the principal amounts that the debtor can claim&para;<br>as his reasonable living expenses and thereby shield from&para;<br>creditors.&para;<br>The National and Local Standards referenced in this&para;<br>provision are tables that the IRS prepares listing stan&para;<br>dardized expense amounts for basic necessities.2 The IRS&para;<br>uses the Standards to help calculate taxpayers’ ability to&para;<br>pay overdue taxes.

The ques&para;<br>tion has also divided bankruptcy courts. See, e.g., In re Canales, 377&para;<br>B. R. 658, 662 (Bkrtcy. Ct.

Whether Ransom may claim the&para;<br>$471 car-ownership deduction accordingly turns on&para;<br>whether that expense amount is “applicable” to him.&para;<br>Because the Code does not define “applicable,” we look&para;<br>to the ordinary meaning of the term. See, e.g., Hamilton&para;<br>v. Lanning, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6). “Ap&para;<br>plicable” means “capable of being applied: having rele&para;<br>vance” or “fit, suitable, or right to be applied: appropriate.”&para;<br>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 105 (2002).&para;<br>See also New Oxford American Dictionary 74 (2d ed. 2005)&para;<br>(“relevant or appropriate”); 1 Oxford English Dictionary&para;<br>575 (2d ed. 1989) (“[c]apable of being applied” or “[f]it or&para;<br>suitable for its purpose, appropriate”). So an expense&para;<br>amount is “applicable” within the plain meaning of the&para;<br>statute when it is appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit.&para;<br>What makes an expense amount “applicable” in this&para;<br>sense (appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit) is most natu&para;<br>rally understood to be its correspondence to an individual&para;<br>debtor’s financial circumstances. Rather than authorizing&para;<br>all debtors to take deductions in all listed categories,&para;<br>Congress established a filter: A debtor may claim a deduc&para;<br>tion from a National or Local Standard table (like “[Car]&para;<br>Ownership Costs”) if but only if that deduction is appro&para;<br>priate for him. And a deduction is so appropriate only if&para;<br>the debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered&para;<br>by the table—that is, only if the debtor will incur that kind&para;<br>of expense during the life of the plan. The statute under&para;<br>scores the necessity of making such an individualized&para;<br>determination by referring to “the debtor’s applicable&para;<br>monthly expense amounts,” §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis&para;<br>added)—in other words, the expense amounts applicable&para;<br>(appropriate, etc.) to each particular debtor. Identifying&para;<br>these amounts requires looking at the financial situation&para;<br>of the debtor and asking whether a National or Local&para;<br>Standard table is relevant to him.&para;<br>If Congress had not wanted to separate in this way&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do&para;<br>not, it could have omitted the term “applicable” altogether.&para;<br>Without that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a&para;<br>deduction for each category listed in the Standards. Con&para;<br>gress presumably included “applicable” to achieve a differ&para;<br>ent result. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004)&para;<br>(“[W]e must give effect to every word of a statute wherever&para;<br>possible”). Interpreting the statute to require a threshold&para;<br>determination of eligibility ensures that the term “appli&para;<br>cable” carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.&para;<br>This reading of “applicable” also draws support from the&para;<br>statutory context. The Code initially defines a debtor’s&para;<br>disposable income as his “current monthly income . . . less&para;<br>amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.” §1325(b)(2)&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>The statute then instructs that&para;<br>“[a]mounts reasonably necessary to be expended . . . shall&para;<br>be determined in accordance with” the means test.&para;<br>§1325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to&para;<br>approximate the debtor’s reasonable expenditures on&para;<br>essential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for&para;<br>a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the rele&para;<br>vant category. If a debtor will not have a particular kind&para;<br>of expense during his plan, an allowance to cover that cost&para;<br>is not “reasonably necessary” within the meaning of the&para;<br>statute.5&para;<br>Finally, consideration of BAPCPA’s purpose strengthens&para;<br>our reading of the term “applicable.” Congress designed&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 This interpretation also avoids the anomalous result of granting&para;<br>preferential treatment to individuals with above-median income.&para;<br>Because the means test does not apply to Chapter 13 debtors whose&para;<br>incomes are below the median, those debtors must prove on a case-by&para;<br>case basis that each claimed expense is reasonably necessary.

Under&para;<br>this approach, a debtor “consult[s] the table[s] alone” to&para;<br>determine his appropriate expense amounts. Reply Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 16. Because he has one car, Ransom argues&para;<br>that his “applicable” allowance is the sum listed in the&para;<br>first column of the “Ownership Costs” table ($471); if he&para;<br>had a second vehicle, the amount in the second column&para;<br>($332) would also be “applicable.” On this approach, the&para;<br>word “applicable” serves a function wholly internal to the&para;<br>tables; rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduc&para;<br>tion is not at all suitable, the term merely directs each&para;<br>——————&para;<br>does not “incorporat[e]” or otherwise “impor[t]” the IRS’s guidance.&para;<br>Post, at 1, 4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The dissent questions what possible&para;<br>basis except incorporation could justify our consulting the IRS’s view,&para;<br>post, at 4, n., but we think that basis obvious: The IRS creates the&para;<br>National and Local Standards referenced in the statute, revises them&para;<br>as it deems necessary, and uses them every day. The agency might,&para;<br>therefore, have something insightful and persuasive (albeit not control&para;<br>ling) to say about them.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N.

As intimated&para;<br>earlier, supra, at 7–8, Ransom’s interpretation would&para;<br>render the term “applicable” superfluous. Assume Con&para;<br>gress had omitted that word and simply authorized a&para;<br>deduction of “the debtor’s monthly expense amounts”&para;<br>specified in the Standards. That language, most naturally&para;<br>read, would direct each debtor to locate the box in every&para;<br>table corresponding to his location, income, family size, or&para;<br>number of cars and to deduct the amount stated. In other&para;<br>words, the language would instruct the debtor to use the&para;<br>exact approach Ransom urges. The word “applicable” is&para;<br>not necessary to accomplish that result; it is necessary&para;<br>only for the different purpose of dividing debtors eligible to&para;<br>make use of the tables from those who are not. Further,&para;<br>Ransom’s reading of “applicable” would sever the connec&para;<br>tion between the means test and the statutory provision it&para;<br>is meant to implement—the authorization of an allowance&para;<br>for (but only for) “reasonably necessary” expenses. Ex&para;<br>penses that are wholly fictional are not easily thought of&para;<br>as reasonably necessary. And finally, Ransom’s interpre&para;<br>tation would run counter to the statute’s overall purpose of&para;<br>ensuring that debtors repay creditors to the extent they&para;<br>can—here, by shielding some $28,000 that he does not in&para;<br>fact need for loan or lease payments.&para;<br>As against all this, Ransom argues that his reading&para;<br>is necessary to account for the means test’s distinction&para;<br>between “applicable” and “actual” expenses—more fully&para;<br>stated, between the phrase “applicable monthly expense&para;<br>amounts” specified in the Standards and the phrase “ac&para;<br>tual monthly expenses for . . . Other Necessary Expenses.”&para;<br>§707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added).

According to Ransom, “applicable”&para;<br>cannot mean the same thing as “actual.” Brief for Peti&para;<br>tioner 40. He thus concludes that “an ‘applicable’ expense&para;<br>can be claimed [under the means test] even if no ‘actual’&para;<br>expense was incurred.” Ibid.&para;<br>Our interpretation of the statute, however, equally&para;<br>avoids conflating “applicable” with “actual” costs. Al&para;<br>though the expense amounts in the Standards apply only&para;<br>if the debtor incurs the relevant expense, the debtor’s out&para;<br>of-pocket cost may well not control the amount of the&para;<br>deduction. If a debtor’s actual expenses exceed the&para;<br>amounts listed in the tables, for example, the debtor may&para;<br>claim an allowance only for the specified sum, rather than&para;<br>for his real expenditures.8 For the Other Necessary Ex&para;<br>pense categories, by contrast, the debtor may deduct his&para;<br>actual expenses, no matter how high they are.9 Our read&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The parties and the Solicitor General as amicus curiae dispute the&para;<br>proper deduction for a debtor who has expenses that are lower than the&para;<br>amounts listed in the Local Standards. Ransom argues that a debtor&para;<br>may claim the specified expense amount in full regardless of his out-of&para;<br>pocket costs. Brief for Petitioner 24–27. The Government concurs with&para;<br>this view, provided (as we require) that a debtor has some expense&para;<br>relating to the deduction. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>19–21. FIA, relying on the IRS’s practice, contends to the contrary that&para;<br>a debtor may claim only his actual expenditures in this circumstance.&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 12, 45–46 (arguing that the Local Standards&para;<br>function as caps). We decline to resolve this issue. Because Ransom&para;<br>incurs no ownership expense at all, the car-ownership allowance is not&para;<br>applicable to him in the first instance. Ransom is therefore not entitled&para;<br>to a deduction under either approach.&para;<br>9 For the same reason, the allowance for “applicable monthly expense&para;<br>amounts” at issue here differs from the additional allowances that the&para;<br>dissent cites for the deduction of actual expenditures. See post, at 3–4&para;<br>(noting allowances for “actual expenses” for care of an elderly or chroni&para;<br>cally ill household member, §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II), and for home energy&para;<br>costs, §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V)).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v.

This case pro&para;<br>vides a prime example. The “Ownership Costs” table&para;<br>features two columns labeled “First Car” and “Second&para;<br>Car.” See supra, at 4. Standing alone, the table does not&para;<br>specify whether it refers to the first and second cars owned&para;<br>(as Ransom avers), or the first and second cars for which&para;<br>the debtor incurs ownership costs (as FIA maintains)—and&para;<br>so the table does not resolve the issue in dispute.10 See&para;<br>In re Kimbro, 389 B.

Indeed, if we had to decide this question on the&para;<br>basis of the table alone, we might well decide that a debtor who does&para;<br>not make loan or lease payments cannot claim an allowance. The table,&para;<br>after all, is titled “Ownership Costs”—suggesting that it applies to&para;<br>those debtors who incur such costs. And as noted earlier, the dollar&para;<br>amounts in the table represent average automobile loan and lease&para;<br>payments nationwide (with all other car-related expenses approxi&para;<br>mated in the separate “Operating Costs” table).

Some amount of interpretation&para;<br>is necessary to decide what the deduction is for and&para;<br>whether it is applicable to Ransom; and so we are brought&para;<br>back full circle to our prior analysis.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Ransom next argues that viewing the car-ownership&para;<br>deduction as covering no more than loan and lease pay&para;<br>ments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the&para;<br>means test that provides: “Notwithstanding any other&para;<br>provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the&para;<br>debtor shall not include any payments for debts.”&para;<br>§707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The car-ownership deduction cannot&para;<br>comprise only loan and lease payments, Ransom contends,&para;<br>because those payments are always debts. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 28, 44–45.&para;<br>Ransom ignores that the “notwithstanding” sentence&para;<br>governs the full panoply of deductions under the National&para;<br>and Local Standards and the Other Necessary Expense&para;<br>categories. We hesitate to rely on that general provision&para;<br>to interpret the content of the car-ownership deduction&para;<br>because Congress did not draft the former with the latter&para;<br>specially in mind; any friction between the two likely&para;<br>reflects only a lack of attention to how an across-the-board&para;<br>exclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particu&para;<br>lar IRS allowance.11 Further, the “notwithstanding” sen&para;<br>tence by its terms functions only to exclude, and not to&para;<br>authorize, deductions. It cannot establish an allowance&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Because Ransom does not make payments on his car, we need not&para;<br>and do not resolve how the “notwithstanding” sentence affects the&para;<br>vehicle-ownership deduction when a debtor has a loan or lease expense.&para;<br>See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, n. 5 (offering alterna&para;<br>tive views on this question); Tr. of Oral Arg. 51–52.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for non-loan or -lease ownership costs that no National or&para;<br>Local Standard covers. Accordingly, the “notwithstand&para;<br>ing” sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the&para;<br>“Ownership Costs” table does not apply to a debtor whose&para;<br>car is not encumbered.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Ransom finally contends that his view of the means test&para;<br>is necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by&para;<br>Congress. At the outset, we note that the policy concerns&para;<br>Ransom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates:&para;<br>His interpretation, as we have explained, would frustrate&para;<br>BAPCPA’s core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote&para;<br>their full disposable income to repaying creditors. See&para;<br>supra, at 8–9. We nonetheless address each of Ransom’s&para;<br>policy arguments in turn.&para;<br>Ransom first points out a troubling anomaly: Under our&para;<br>interpretation, “[d]ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing&para;<br>to take place while they still have a few car payments left,&para;<br>thus retaining an ownership deduction which they would&para;<br>lose if they filed just after making their last payment.”&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 54. Indeed, a debtor with only a single&para;<br>car payment remaining, Ransom notes, is eligible to claim&para;<br>a monthly ownership deduction. Id., at 15, 52.&para;<br>But this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a stan&para;<br>dardized formula like the means test, even more under&para;<br>Ransom’s reading than under ours. Such formulas are by&para;<br>their nature over- and under-inclusive. In eliminating the&para;<br>pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median&para;<br>income debtors’ expenses, on the ground that it leant itself&para;<br>to abuse, Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculi&para;<br>arity that a brighter-line test produces. And Ransom’s&para;<br>alternative reading of the statute would spawn its own&para;<br>anomalies—even placing to one side the fundamental&para;<br>strangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or&para;<br>lease payments when he has not a penny of loan or lease&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>costs. On Ransom’s view, for example, a debtor entering&para;<br>bankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car—“an&para;<br>old, rusted pile of scrap metal [that would] si[t] on cinder&para;<br>blocks in his backyard,” In re Brown, 376 B. R. 601, 607&para;<br>(Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Tex. 2007)—in order to deduct the $471&para;<br>car-ownership expense and reduce his payment to credi&para;<br>tors by that amount. We do not see why Congress would&para;<br>have preferred that result to the one that worries Ransom.&para;<br>That is especially so because creditors may well be able to&para;<br>remedy Ransom’s “one payment left” problem. If car&para;<br>payments cease during the life of the plan, just as if other&para;<br>financial circumstances change, an unsecured creditor&para;<br>may move to modify the plan to increase the amount the&para;<br>debtor must repay. See 11 U. S. C. §1329(a)(1).&para;<br>Ransom next contends that denying the ownership&para;<br>allowance to debtors in his position “sends entirely the&para;<br>wrong message, namely, that it is advantageous to be&para;<br>deeply in debt on motor vehicle loans, rather than to pay&para;<br>them off.” Brief for Petitioner 55. But the choice here is&para;<br>not between thrifty savers and profligate borrowers, as&para;<br>Ransom would have it. Money is fungible: The $14,000&para;<br>that Ransom spent to purchase his Camry outright was&para;<br>money he did not devote to paying down his credit card&para;<br>debt, and Congress did not express a preference for one&para;<br>use of these funds over the other. Further, Ransom’s&para;<br>argument mistakes what the deductions in the means test&para;<br>are meant to accomplish. Rather than effecting any broad&para;<br>federal policy as to saving or borrowing, the deductions&para;<br>serve merely to ensure that debtors in bankruptcy can&para;<br>afford essential items. The car-ownership allowance thus&para;<br>safeguards a debtor’s ability to retain a car throughout the&para;<br>plan period. If the debtor already owns a car outright, he&para;<br>has no need for this protection.&para;<br>Ransom finally argues that a debtor who owns his car&para;<br>free and clear may need to replace it during the life of the&para;<br>plan; “[g]ranting the ownership cost deduction to a vehicle&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that is owned outright,” he states, “accords best with&para;<br>economic reality.” Id., at 52. In essence, Ransom seeks an&para;<br>emergency cushion for car owners. But nothing in the&para;<br>statute authorizes such a cushion, which all debtors pre&para;<br>sumably would like in the event some unexpected need&para;<br>arises. And a person who enters bankruptcy without any&para;<br>car at all may also have to buy one during the plan period;&para;<br>yet Ransom concedes that a person in this position cannot&para;<br>claim the ownership deduction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. The&para;<br>appropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses&para;<br>like a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a&para;<br>deduction, but to use the method that the Code provides&para;<br>for all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modifica&para;<br>tion of the plan in light of changed circumstances. See&para;<br>§1329(a)(1); see also supra, at 17.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Based on BAPCPA’s text, context, and purpose, we hold&para;<br>that the Local Standard expense amount for transporta&para;<br>tion “Ownership Costs” is not “applicable” to a debtor who&para;<br>will not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan.&para;<br>Because the “Ownership Costs” category covers only loan&para;<br>and lease payments and because Ransom owns his car free&para;<br>from any debt or obligation, he may not claim the allow&para;<br>ance.

To be sure,&para;<br>one can say “according to the attached table”; but it is&para;<br>acceptable (and indeed I think more common) to say “ac&para;<br>cording to the applicable provisions of the attached table.”&para;<br>That seems to me the fairest reading of “applicable&para;<br>monthly expense amounts specified under the National&para;<br>Standards and Local Standards.” That is especially so for&para;<br>the Ownership Costs portion of the Local Standards,&para;<br>which had no column titled “No Car.” Here the expense&para;<br>amount would be that shown for one car (which is all the&para;<br>debtor here owned) rather than that shown for two cars;&para;<br>and it would be no expense amount if the debtor owned no&para;<br>car, since there is no “applicable” provision for that on the&para;<br>table. For operating and public transportation costs, the&para;<br>“applicable” amount would similarly be the amount pro&para;<br>vided by the Local Standards for the geographic region in&para;<br>which the debtor resides. (The debtor would not first be&para;<br>required to prove that he actually operates the cars that&para;<br>he owns, or, if does not own a car, that he actually uses&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>public transportation.) The Court claims that the tables&para;<br>“are not self-defining,” and that “[s]ome amount of inter&para;<br>pretation” is necessary in choosing whether to claim a&para;<br>deduction at all, for one car, or for two. Ante, at 14–15.&para;<br>But this problem seems to me more metaphysical than&para;<br>practical. The point of the statutory language is to entitle&para;<br>debtors who own cars to an ownership deduction, and I&para;<br>have little doubt that debtors will be able to choose cor&para;<br>rectly whether to claim a deduction for one car or for two.&para;<br>If the meaning attributed to the word by the Court were&para;<br>intended, it would have been most precise to say “monthly&para;<br>expense amounts specified under the National Standards&para;<br>and Local Standards, if applicable for IRS collection pur&para;<br>poses.” And even if utter precision was too much to ex&para;<br>pect, it would at least have been more natural to say&para;<br>“monthly expense amounts specified under the National&para;<br>Standards and Local Standards, if applicable.” That&para;<br>would make it clear that amounts specified under those&para;<br>Standards may nonetheless not be applicable, justifying&para;<br>(perhaps) resort to some source other than the Standards&para;<br>themselves to give meaning to the condition. The very&para;<br>next paragraph of the Bankruptcy Code uses that formu&para;<br>lation (“if applicable”) to limit to actual expenses the&para;<br>deduction for care of an elderly or chronically ill household&para;<br>member: “[T]he debtor’s monthly expenses may include, if&para;<br>applicable, the continuation of actual expenses paid by the&para;<br>debtor that are reasonable and necessary” for that pur&para;<br>pose. 11 U. S. C. §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Elsewhere as well, the Code makes it very clear when&para;<br>prescribed deductions are limited to actual expenditures.&para;<br>Section 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) itself authorizes deductions for a&para;<br>host of expenses—health and disability insurance, for&para;<br>example—only to the extent that they are “actual . . .&para;<br>expenses” that are “reasonably necessary.” Additional&para;<br>deductions for energy are allowed, but again only if they&para;<br>are “actual expenses” that are “reasonable and necessary.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V). Given the clarity of those limitations&para;<br>to actual outlays, it seems strange for Congress to limit&para;<br>the car-ownership deduction to the somewhat peculiar&para;<br>category “cars subject to any amount whatever of out&para;<br>standing indebtedness” by the mere word “applicable,”&para;<br>meant as incorporation of a limitation that appears in&para;<br>instructions to IRS agents.*&para;<br>I do not find the normal meaning of the text undermined&para;<br>by the fact that it produces a situation in which a&para;<br>debtor who owes no payments on his car nonetheless gets&para;<br>the operating-expense allowance. For the Court’s more&para;<br>strained interpretation still produces a situation in which&para;<br>a debtor who owes only a single remaining payment on his&para;<br>car gets the full allowance. As for the Court’s imagined&para;<br>horrible in which “a debtor entering bankruptcy might&para;<br>purchase for a song a junkyard car,” ante, at 17: That is&para;<br>fairly matched by the imagined horrible that, under the&para;<br>Court’s scheme, a debtor entering bankruptcy might pur&para;<br>chase a junkyard car for a song plus a $10 promissory note&para;<br>payable over several years. He would get the full owner&para;<br>ship expense deduction.&para;<br>Thus, the Court’s interpretation does not, as promised,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The Court protests that I misunderstand its use of the Collection&para;<br>Financial Standards. Its opinion does not, it says, find them to be&para;<br>incorporated by the Bankruptcy Code; they simply “reinforc[e] our&para;<br>conclusion that . . . a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make&para;<br>some loan or lease payments.” Ante, at 10. True enough, the opinion&para;<br>says that the Bankruptcy Code “does not incorporate the IRS’s guide&para;<br>lines,” but it immediately continues that “courts may consult this&para;<br>material in interpreting the National and Local Standards” so long as it&para;<br>is not “at odds with the statutory language.” Ibid. In the present&para;<br>context, the real-world difference between finding the guidelines&para;<br>incorporated and finding it appropriate to consult them escapes me,&para;<br>since I can imagine no basis for consulting them unless Congress meant&para;<br>them to be consulted, which would mean they are incorporated. And&para;<br>without incorporation, they are at odds with the statutory language,&para;<br>which otherwise contains no hint that eligibility for a Car Ownership&para;<br>deduction requires anything other than ownership of a car.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>maintain “the connection between the means test and the&para;<br>statutory provision it is meant to implement—the authori&para;<br>zation of an allowance for (but only for) ‘reasonably neces&para;<br>sary’ expenses,” ante, at 12. Nor do I think this difficulty&para;<br>is eliminated by the deus ex machina of 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1329(a)(1), which according to the Court would allow an&para;<br>unsecured creditor to “move to modify the plan to increase&para;<br>the amount the debtor must repay,” ante, at 17. Apart&para;<br>from the fact that, as a practical matter, the sums in&para;<br>volved would hardly make this worth the legal costs,&para;<br>allowing such ongoing revisions of matters specifically&para;<br>covered by the rigid means test would return us to “the&para;<br>pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median&para;<br>income debtors’ expenses,” ante, at 16. If the BAPCPA&para;<br>had thought such adjustments necessary, surely it would&para;<br>have taken the much simpler and more logical step of&para;<br>providing going in that the ownership expense allowance&para;<br>would apply only so long as monthly payments were due.&para;<br>The reality is, to describe it in the Court’s own terms,&para;<br>that occasional overallowance (or, for that matter, under&para;<br>allowance) “is the inevitable result of a standardized&para;<br>formula like the means test . . . . Congress chose to toler&para;<br>ate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test&para;<br>produces.” Ibid. Our job, it seems to me, is not to elimi&para;<br>nate or reduce those “oddit[ies],” ibid., but to give the&para;<br>formula Congress adopted its fairest meaning. In my&para;<br>judgment the “applicable monthly expense amounts” for&para;<br>operating costs “specified under the . . . Local Standards,”&para;<br>are the amounts specified in those Standards for either&para;<br>one car or two cars, whichever of those is applicable.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
