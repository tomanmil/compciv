UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–7387. Argued November 30, 2011—Decided March 28, 2012&para;<br>When petitioner Setser was indicted in a Texas court on drug charges,&para;<br>the State also moved to revoke the probation term that he was then&para;<br>serving for another drug offense. At about the same time, Setser&para;<br>pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. The Federal District Court&para;<br>imposed a 151-month sentence to run consecutively to any state sentence imposed for the probation violation, but concurrently with any&para;<br>state sentence imposed on the new drug charge. While Setser’s federal appeal was pending, the state court sentenced him to 5 years for&para;<br>the probation violation and 10 years for the drug charge, but ordered&para;<br>the sentences to be served concurrently. The Fifth Circuit affirmed&para;<br>the federal sentence, holding that the District Court had authority to&para;<br>order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence, and&para;<br>that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if the state court’s decision made it unclear exactly how to administer it.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The District Court had discretion to order that Setser’s federal&para;<br>sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the&para;<br>probation violation. Pp. 2–12.&para;<br>(a) Judges have traditionally had broad discretion in selecting&para;<br>whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have&para;<br>been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings, see&para;<br>Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169. The statutory text and structure do not foreclose a district court’s exercise of this discretion with&para;<br>respect to anticipated state sentences. The Sentencing Reform Act of&para;<br>1984 addresses the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, but not the&para;<br>situation here, since the District Court did not impose “multiple&para;<br>terms of imprisonment . . . at the same time,” and Setser was not “al-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ready subject to” the state sentences at issue, 18 U. S. C. §3584(a).&para;<br>This does not mean, as Setser and the Government claim, that the&para;<br>District Court lacked authority to act as it did and that the Bureau of&para;<br>Prisons is to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision after the&para;<br>federal sentence has been imposed. Section 3621(b), from which the&para;<br>Bureau claims to derive this authority, says nothing about concurrent or consecutive sentences. And it is more natural to read&para;<br>§3584(a) as leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in situations not covered than it is to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau&para;<br>what amounts to sentencing authority. Setser’s arguments to the&para;<br>contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 2–8.&para;<br>(b) None of the other objections raised by Setser and the Government requires a different result. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>2. The state court’s subsequent decision to make the state sentences run concurrently does not establish that the Federal District Court&para;<br>imposed an unreasonable sentence. The difficulty here arises not&para;<br>from the federal-court sentence—which is to run concurrently with&para;<br>one state sentence and consecutively with another—but from the&para;<br>state court’s decision. Deciding which of the District Court’s dispositions should prevail under these circumstances is a problem, but it&para;<br>does not show the District Court’s sentence to be unlawful. The reasonableness standard for reviewing federal sentences asks whether&para;<br>the district court abused its discretion, see Gall v. United States, 552&para;<br>U. S. 38, 46, but Setser identifies no flaw in the District Court’s decisionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of sentencing&para;<br>that the court failed to consider. Where late-onset facts make it difficult, or even impossible, to implement the sentence, the Bureau of&para;<br>Prisons may determine, in the first instance, how long the District&para;<br>Court’s sentence authorizes it to continue Setser’s confinement, subject to the potential for judicial review.

As often happens in drug&para;<br>cases, the federal authorities also got involved.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>United States v. Brown, 920 F. 2d 1212 (1991) (per curiam),&para;<br>he indicated that the District Court had discretion to make&para;<br>Setser’s sentence either concurrent with or consecutive to&para;<br>any sentence anticipated in the separate state-court proceedings. Setser objected, arguing that the District Court&para;<br>lacked such authority. The court nevertheless made the&para;<br>sentence of 151 months that it imposed consecutive to any&para;<br>state sentence imposed for probation violation, but concurrent with any state sentence imposed on the new drug&para;<br>charge. Setser appealed.&para;<br>While Setser’s appeal was pending, the state court&para;<br>sentenced him to a prison term of 5 years for probation&para;<br>violation and 10 years on the new drug charge. It ordered&para;<br>that these sentences be served concurrently. Setser then&para;<br>made before the Court of Appeals, in addition to the argument that the District Court had no authority to order a&para;<br>consecutive sentence, the argument that his federal sentence was unreasonable because it was impossible to&para;<br>implement in light of the concurrent state sentences.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 607&para;<br>F. 3d 128 (2010). Following its earlier Brown decision, the&para;<br>court held that the District Court did have authority to&para;<br>order a consecutive sentence. 607 F. 3d, at 131–132. It&para;<br>also held that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if it&para;<br>was “ ‘partially foiled’ ” by the state court’s decision. Id., at&para;<br>132–133. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and&para;<br>appointed an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case in&para;<br>support of the judgment below, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Before proceeding further, it is important to be clear&para;<br>about what is at issue. Setser does not contend that his&para;<br>federal sentence must run concurrently with both state&para;<br>sentences imposed after his federal sentencing hearing.&para;<br>He acknowledges that someone must answer “the consecutive versus concurrent question,” Brief for Petitioner 27,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and decide how the state and federal sentences will fit&para;<br>together. The issue here is who will make that decision,&para;<br>which in turn determines when that decision is made.&para;<br>One possible answer, and the one the Fifth Circuit gave, is&para;<br>that the decision belongs to the Federal District Court at&para;<br>the federal sentencing hearing.&para;<br>The concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision has been addressed by §212(a) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §3584, reproduced in full as Appendix A, infra.&para;<br>The first subsection of that provision, which says when&para;<br>concurrent and consecutive sentences may be imposed,&para;<br>and specifies which of those dispositions will be assumed&para;<br>in absence of indication by the sentencing judge, does not&para;<br>cover the situation here. It addresses only “multiple terms&para;<br>of imprisonment . . . imposed . . . at the same time” and “a&para;<br>term of imprisonment . . . imposed on a defendant who is&para;<br>already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.”&para;<br>§3584(a). Here the state sentence is not imposed at the&para;<br>same time as the federal sentence, and the defendant was&para;<br>not already subject to that state sentence.&para;<br>Setser, supported by the Government, argues that, because §3584(a) does not cover this situation, the District&para;<br>Court lacked authority to act as it did; and that the&para;<br>concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision is therefore to be made&para;<br>by the Bureau of Prisons at any time after the federal sentence has been imposed. The Bureau of Prisons is said to&para;<br>derive this authority from 18 U. S. C. §3621(b) (2006 ed.&para;<br>and Supp. IV), reproduced in full as Appendix B, infra.&para;<br>On its face, this provision says nothing about concurrent&para;<br>or consecutive sentences, but the Government explains its&para;<br>position as follows: Section 3621(b) gives the Bureau the&para;<br>authority to order that a prisoner serve his federal sentence in any suitable prison facility “whether maintained&para;<br>by the Federal Government or otherwise.” The Bureau&para;<br>may therefore order that a prisoner serve his federal&para;<br>sentence in a state prison. Thus, when a person subject to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a federal sentence is serving a state sentence, the Bureau&para;<br>may designate the state prison as the place of imprisonment for the federal sentence—effectively making the&para;<br>two sentences concurrent—or decline to do so—effectively making them consecutive.1 Based on §§3584(a)&para;<br>and 3621(b), Setser and the Government argue that the&para;<br>concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, under the circumstances presented here, is committed exclusively to the&para;<br>Bureau of Prisons.&para;<br>It is fundamental that we construe statutes governing&para;<br>the jurisdiction of the federal courts in light of “the&para;<br>common-law background against which the statutes . . .&para;<br>were enacted,” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council&para;<br>of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989), and the&para;<br>same approach is appropriate here, where the issue concerns a matter of discretion traditionally committed to the&para;<br>Judiciary. Judges have long been understood to have&para;<br>discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will&para;<br>run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other&para;<br>sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in&para;<br>other proceedings, including state proceedings. See Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169 (2009). And a large&para;<br>majority of the federal appellate courts addressing the&para;<br>question have recognized a similar authority in the context here, where a federal judge anticipates a state sentence that has not yet been imposed. See Salley v. United&para;<br>States, 786 F. 2d 546, 547 (CA2 1986); Anderson v. United&para;<br>States, 405 F. 2d 492, 493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam); United&para;<br>States ex rel. Lester v. Parker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41–42 (CA3&para;<br>1968) (per curiam); United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178,&para;<br>179–180 (CA7 1966) (per curiam); but see United States v.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Bureau of Prisons sometimes makes this designation while the&para;<br>prisoner is in state custody and sometimes makes a nunc pro tunc&para;<br>designation once the prisoner enters federal custody.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985)2. We find&para;<br>nothing in the Sentencing Reform Act, or in any other&para;<br>provision of law, to show that Congress foreclosed the&para;<br>exercise of district courts’ sentencing discretion in these&para;<br>circumstances.&para;<br>Setser’s main contention is that §3584(a) has this effect.&para;<br>But that provision cannot sustain the weight that Setser&para;<br>asks it to bear. In essence, he reads the first sentence in&para;<br>§3584(a) to say that “terms [of imprisonment] may run&para;<br>concurrently or consecutively” only “[i]f multiple terms of&para;<br>imprisonment are imposed . . . at the same time, or if a&para;<br>term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent is incorrect to say, post, at 7–8 (opinion of BREYER, J.),&para;<br>that only the Second Circuit, in Salley held to that effect. So did the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit in Kanton and the Tenth Circuit in Anderson. The&para;<br>dissent says that Anderson addressed only the question “whether a&para;<br>federal sentence runs from the date of its imposition or from the date of&para;<br>entry into federal custody,” post, at 7–8. That is true enough (and it is&para;<br>true of Kanton as well); but answering that question in a manner that&para;<br>upheld the consecutive federal sentence (i.e., it runs from the date of&para;<br>entry into federal custody) necessarily upheld the sentencing court’s&para;<br>authority to impose the consecutive federal sentence. In fact, Anderson confronted and specifically rejected the defendant’s argument that&para;<br>“ ‘[n]o court has the authority to impose a sentence consecutive to&para;<br>something that does not exist,’ ” 405 F. 2d, at 493. And, finally, so did&para;<br>the Third Circuit in Lester. The dissent says that Lester addressed only&para;<br>the question “whether a sentence was insufficiently certain for purposes of due process,” post, at 8. But that was the defendant’s principal reason (as it appears also to be the dissent’s principal reason) for&para;<br>asserting that the sentencing court had no authority to impose a&para;<br>consecutive sentence. And the Third Circuit rejected not only that&para;<br>reason but “[o]ther arguments advanced by [the defendant] ” attacking&para;<br>the consecutive sentence, 404 F. 2d, at 42.&para;<br>The only contrary federal appellate decision rendered before the Sentencing Reform Act took effect relied upon 18 U. S. C. §4082 (1982 ed.)&para;<br>(the predecessor of §3621) and §3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed by 98 Stat.&para;<br>1987), which provided that a federal sentence “shall commence to run&para;<br>from the date on which such person is received” into federal custody.&para;<br>See United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.”&para;<br>Since the District Court was not imposing the state sentence and since it was not already imposed, the sentence&para;<br>could not be ordered to run consecutively. But if the text&para;<br>is exclusive—if the addition of only is correct—the provision forbids not only the imposition of consecutive sentences, but the imposition of concurrent ones as well. And&para;<br>yet, as Setser acknowledges, it must be one or the other;&para;<br>someone must decide the issue.&para;<br>Setser’s response is that, read in context, the sentence&para;<br>speaks only to district courts. Under the circumstances at&para;<br>issue here, he says, the federal and state sentences still&para;<br>might run either concurrently or consecutively, but just&para;<br>not at the discretion of the District Court. That is an odd&para;<br>parsing of the text, which makes no distinction between&para;<br>the district court and the Bureau of Prisons. The placement of §3584 does indeed suggest that it is directed at&para;<br>district courts—but that is likely because Congress contemplated that only district courts would have the authority to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, not&para;<br>because Congress meant to leave the Bureau unfettered.&para;<br>Indeed, the Bureau already follows the other directives in&para;<br>§3584(a). See Brief for United States 35. For example, if&para;<br>the district court imposes multiple terms of imprisonment&para;<br>at the same time, but fails to address the concurrent-vs.consecutive issue, the terms “run concurrently,” §3584(a),&para;<br>and the Bureau is not free to use its “place of imprisonment” authority to achieve a different result.3&para;<br>The Latin maxim on which Setser relies—expressio&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Government contends that the Bureau applies the default rules&para;<br>in §3584(a) “[a]s a matter of discretion” but is not “ ‘bound’ ” by that&para;<br>subsection. Reply Brief for United States 15, n. 5. We think it implausible that the effectiveness of those rules—of §3584(a)’s prescription, for&para;<br>example, that “[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different&para;<br>times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to&para;<br>run concurrently”—depends upon the “discretion” of the Bureau.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unius est exclusio alterius—might have application here if&para;<br>the provision in question were a conferral of authority on&para;<br>district courts. Giving sentencing authority in only specified circumstances could be said to imply that it is withheld in other circumstances. Section 3584, however, is&para;<br>framed not as a conferral of authority but as a limitation&para;<br>of authority that already exists (and a specification of&para;<br>what will be assumed when the exercise of that authority&para;<br>is ambiguous). It reads not “District courts shall have&para;<br>authority to impose multiple terms of imprisonment on a&para;<br>defendant at the same time, etc.” but rather “If multiple&para;<br>terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at&para;<br>the same time, [etc.]”—quite clearly assuming that such authority already exists. The mere acknowledgment of the&para;<br>existence of certain pre-existing authority (and regulation&para;<br>of that authority) in no way implies a repeal of other preexisting authority. And that is especially true when there&para;<br>is an obvious reason for selecting the instances of preexisting authority that are addressed—to wit, that they&para;<br>are the examples of sentencing discretion most frequently&para;<br>encountered.&para;<br>Moreover, expressio unius est exclusio alterius is a&para;<br>double-edged sword. Setser thinks it suggests that, because&para;<br>§3584(a) recognizes judicial discretion in scenario A and&para;<br>scenario B, there is no such discretion in scenario C. But&para;<br>the same maxim shows much more convincingly why&para;<br>§3621(b) cannot be read to give the Bureau of Prisons&para;<br>exclusive authority to make the sort of decision committed&para;<br>to the district court in §3584(a). When §3584(a) specifically addresses decisions about concurrent and consecutive&para;<br>sentences, and makes no mention of the Bureau’s role in&para;<br>the process, the implication is that no such role exists.&para;<br>And that conclusion is reinforced by application of the&para;<br>same maxim (properly, in this instance) to §3621(b)—&para;<br>which is a conferral of authority on the Bureau of Prisons,&para;<br>but does not confer authority to choose between concur-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rent and consecutive sentences. Put to the choice, we&para;<br>believe it is much more natural to read §3584(a) as not&para;<br>containing an implied “only,” leaving room for the exercise&para;<br>of judicial discretion in the situations not covered, than it&para;<br>is to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau of Prisons what&para;<br>amounts to sentencing authority.&para;<br>III&para;<br>None of the other objections to this approach raised by&para;<br>Setser and the Government require a different result.&para;<br>Our decision today follows the interpretive rule they&para;<br>invoke, that we must “give effect . . . to every clause and&para;<br>word” of the Act. United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S.&para;<br>528, 538–539 (1955) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The first sentence in §3584(a) addresses the most common&para;<br>situations in which the decision between concurrent and&para;<br>consecutive sentences must be made: where two sentences&para;<br>are imposed at the same time, and where a sentence is&para;<br>imposed subsequent to a prior sentence that has not yet&para;<br>been fully served. It says that the district court has discretion whether to make the sentences concurrent or&para;<br>consecutive, except that it may not make consecutive a&para;<br>sentence for “an attempt” and a sentence for an “offense&para;<br>that was the sole objective of the attempt.” And the last&para;<br>two sentences of §3584(a) say what will be assumed in&para;<br>those two common situations if the court does not specify&para;<br>that the sentence is concurrent or consecutive. Giving&para;<br>those dispositions full effect does not demand that we&para;<br>regard them as eliminating sentencing discretion in other&para;<br>situations.&para;<br>Setser and the Government both suggest that, because&para;<br>§3584(b) directs courts to consider the sentencing factors&para;<br>in §3553(a) in making these decisions, and because some&para;<br>of those factors will be difficult to apply with respect to&para;<br>anticipated sentences, the Act cannot be read to allow&para;<br>judicial discretion in these circumstances. One cannot be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sure that the sentence imposed is “sufficient, but not&para;<br>greater than necessary,” §3553(a), the argument goes, if&para;<br>one does not know how long it will actually be. But the&para;<br>district judge faces the same uncertainty if the concurrentvs.-consecutive decision is left for later resolution by the&para;<br>Bureau of Prisons; he does not know, for example, whether&para;<br>the 5-year sentence he imposes will be an actual five years&para;<br>or will be simply swallowed within another sentence. To&para;<br>be sure, the Bureau of Prisons, if it waits to decide the&para;<br>matter until after the state court has imposed its sentence,&para;<br>will know for sure what sentences it is dealing with. But&para;<br>the Bureau is not charged with applying §3553(a). The&para;<br>factors that guide the agency’s “place of imprisonment”&para;<br>decision do include “the nature and circumstances of the&para;<br>offense” and “the history and characteristics of the prisoner,” §3621(b)(2), (b)(3) (2006 ed.)—factors that are, to be&para;<br>sure, relevant to sentencing but also relevant to selection&para;<br>of the place of confinement; but they also include factors&para;<br>that make little, if any, sense in the sentencing context,&para;<br>such as “the resources of the facility contemplated” and&para;<br>whether the state facility “meets minimum standards of&para;<br>health and habitability,” §3621(b), (b)(1). (These factors&para;<br>confirm our view that §3621 is not a sentencing provision&para;<br>but a place-of-confinement provision.) It is much more&para;<br>natural for a judge to apply the §3553(a) factors in making&para;<br>all concurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, than it is for some&para;<br>such decisions to be made by a judge applying §3553(a)&para;<br>factors and others by the Bureau of Prisons applying&para;<br>§3621(b) factors.&para;<br>The final objection is that principles of federalism and&para;<br>good policy do not allow a district court to make the&para;<br>concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision when it does not have&para;<br>before it all of the information about the anticipated state&para;<br>sentence. As for principles of federalism, it seems to us&para;<br>they cut in precisely the opposite direction. In our American system of dual sovereignty, each sovereign—whether&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Federal Government or a State—is responsible for “the&para;<br>administration of [its own] criminal justice syste[m].” Ice,&para;<br>555 U. S., at 170. If a prisoner like Setser starts in state&para;<br>custody, serves his state sentence, and then moves to&para;<br>federal custody, it will always be the Federal Government—whether the district court or the Bureau of Prisons—that decides whether he will receive credit for the&para;<br>time served in state custody. And if he serves his federal&para;<br>sentence first, the State will decide whether to give him&para;<br>credit against his state sentences without being bound by&para;<br>what the district court or the Bureau said on the matter.&para;<br>Given this framework, it is always more respectful of the&para;<br>State’s sovereignty for the district court to make its decision up front rather than for the Bureau of Prisons to&para;<br>make the decision after the state court has acted. That&para;<br>way, the state court has all of the information before it&para;<br>when it acts.4 The Government’s position does not promote the States’ interest—just the interests of the Bureau&para;<br>of Prisons.&para;<br>As for good policy: The basic claim of Setser, the Government, and the dissent is that when it comes to sentencing, later is always better because the decisionmaker has&para;<br>more information. See, e.g., post, at 7 (“[A] sentencing&para;<br>judge typically needs detailed information when constructing a multiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline&para;<br>sentence”). That is undoubtedly true, but when that&para;<br>desideratum is applied to the statutory structure before us&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Setser notes that the text of §3584(a) does not distinguish between&para;<br>state and federal sentences. If a district court can enter a consecutive&para;<br>sentencing order in advance of an anticipated state sentence, he asks,&para;<br>what is to stop it from issuing such an order in advance of an anticipated federal sentence? It could be argued that §3584(a) impliedly&para;<br>prohibits such an order because it gives that decision to the federal&para;<br>court that sentences the defendant when the other sentence is “already”&para;<br>imposed—and does not speak (of course) to what a state court must do&para;<br>when a sentence has already been imposed. It suffices to say, however,&para;<br>that this question is not before us.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

That is a particularly curious power for&para;<br>the dissent to rely upon, inasmuch as most of the dissent discusses (in&para;<br>great detail) the Sentencing Reform Act, whose principal objective was&para;<br>to eliminate the Executive’s parole power. Curiouser still is the dissent’s&para;<br>invocation of the Guidelines system, which “tell[s] the sentencing judge&para;<br>how, through the use of partially concurrent and partially consecutive&para;<br>sentences, to build a total sentence that meets the Guidelines’ requirements.” Post, at 4. These “instructions,” ibid., do not cover yet-to-beimposed sentences, the dissent says, because “the sentencing judge&para;<br>normally does not yet know enough about the behavior that underlies&para;<br>(or will underlie)” such a sentence. Post, at 5. That explains, perhaps,&para;<br>why the Guidelines’ “instructions” to judges do not cover them. But&para;<br>why do not the Guidelines “instruct” the Bureau of Prisons how to&para;<br>conduct its concurrent/consecutive sentencing? If the reason is (as we&para;<br>suspect) that the Sentencing Commission does not have, or does not&para;<br>believe it has, authority to “instruct” the Bureau of Prisons, the dissent’s entire argument based upon what it calls “the purposes and the&para;<br>mechanics of the SRA’s sentencing system,” post, at 6, falls apart. Yetto-be-imposed sentences are not within the system at all, and we are&para;<br>simply left with the question whether judges or the Bureau of Prisons&para;<br>is responsible for them. For the reasons we have given, we think it is&para;<br>judges.&para;<br>6 Of course, a district court should exercise the power to impose anticipatory consecutive (or concurrent) sentences intelligently. In some&para;<br>situations, a district court may have inadequate information and may&para;<br>forbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v.

Booker, 543 U. S. 220,&para;<br>261–262 (2005),7 in light of the State’s decision to make&para;<br>his sentences concurrent. We think not. There is nothing&para;<br>unreasonable—let alone inherently impossible—about the&para;<br>sentence itself. Setser is ordered to serve a 151-month&para;<br>term in federal custody, and that sentence should run&para;<br>concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively&para;<br>with another.&para;<br>The difficulty arises not from the sentence, but from the&para;<br>state court’s decision to make both state sentences concurrent. Which of the District Court’s dispositions should&para;<br>prevail: that his federal sentence run consecutively to the&para;<br>state sentence on the parole revocation charge, or that his&para;<br>federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence&para;<br>on the new drug charge? If the federal sentence is added&para;<br>to the state sentence it will not be concurrent with the new&para;<br>drug charge, and if it is merged in the state sentence it&para;<br>will not be consecutive to the parole revocation charge.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We&para;<br>&para;<br>have never had occasion to decide whether reasonableness review under Booker applies to a court’s decision that a federal sentence&para;<br>should run concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence. The&para;<br>Courts of Appeals, however, generally seem to agree that such review&para;<br>applies. See, e.g., United States v. Padilla, 618 F. 3d 643, 647 (CA7&para;<br>2010) (per curiam); United States v. Matera, 489 F. 3d 115, 123–124&para;<br>(CA2 2007).

The provision of the Act&para;<br>here at issue concerns “multiple sentences.” See 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3584.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>state sentence that has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) has two overall objectives. See Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 7); see also United States Sentencing Commission,&para;<br>Guidelines Manual §1A3, p. 1.2 (Nov. 1987) (USSG) (addressing statutory objectives). First, it seeks greater&para;<br>honesty in sentencing. Instead of a parole commission and&para;<br>a judge trying to second-guess each other about the time&para;<br>an offender will actually serve in prison, the SRA tries to&para;<br>create a sentencing system that will require the offender&para;<br>actually to serve most of the sentence the judge imposes.&para;<br>See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989)&para;<br>(“[The SRA] makes all sentences basically determinate”).&para;<br>Second, the Act seeks greater fairness in sentencing&para;<br>through the creation of Guidelines that will increase the&para;<br>likelihood that two offenders who engage in roughly similar criminal behavior will receive roughly similar sentences. See Barber, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (noting&para;<br>that Congress sought to achieve, in part, “increased sentencing uniformity”).&para;<br>To implement these reforms, the SRA instructs the&para;<br>Commission to write Guidelines that inevitably move in&para;<br>the direction of increased “real offense” sentencing. See&para;<br>USSG §1A2, p. 1.1. (describing how statute, e.g., by insisting upon categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics, leads to this result). In principle, real offense&para;<br>sentencing would impose the same sentence upon different&para;<br>offenders who engage in the same real conduct irrespective&para;<br>of the statutes under which they are charged. Real offense&para;<br>sentencing, for example, would mean that two individuals,&para;<br>both of whom rob a bank and injure a teller, would receive&para;<br>the same sentence even if the Government charges one of&para;<br>them under a bank robbery statute and the other under an&para;<br>assault statute. See, e.g., USSG App. A (listing federal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>statutory offenses, while keying them to specific individual&para;<br>Guidelines that determine sentence based upon likely&para;<br>actual behavior). In the event, the Guidelines move the&para;<br>sentencing system in this direction while simultaneously&para;<br>recognizing that other factors require considerable modification of the real offense principle. See USSG §1A4(a)&para;<br>(“real offense vs. charge offense sentencing”).&para;<br>Nonetheless the “real offense” goal influenced the Act’s,&para;<br>and the Commission’s, objectives in respect to the sentencing of an offender with multiple convictions. Insofar as&para;<br>several convictions arise out of the same course of behavior, the sentencing judge should treat the crimes underlying the convictions as if they were all part of a single crime&para;<br>and sentence accordingly. But, insofar as the crimes underlying the convictions arise out of different courses of&para;<br>behavior, the sentencing judge should treat the crimes&para;<br>underlying the convictions as if they were not part of a&para;<br>single crime and should see that the ultimate sentence&para;<br>reflects that fact.&para;<br>To achieve these objectives is easier said than done. For&para;<br>one thing, it requires a definition of what counts as the&para;<br>same course of behavior. The Guidelines set forth that&para;<br>definition in §1B1.3, p. 1.17 (“Relevant Conduct”). For&para;<br>another thing, statutes and Guidelines that set forth&para;<br>related instructions must take into account the fact that&para;<br>sentencing-related circumstances can prove highly complex. To take a fairly simple example, suppose that a&para;<br>defendant is convicted of both robbery and impersonating&para;<br>a federal official, that he has engaged in a single course of&para;<br>behavior, but that neither the robbery nor the impersonation Guidelines take account of the other. Instructions&para;<br>about concurrent/consecutive sentences must give the&para;<br>judge an idea about what to do in such a case. They must&para;<br>also take account of the fact that a maximum penalty&para;<br>contained in a statute will trump a greater penalty contained in a Guideline. And they must tell the judge (faced&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>with multiple convictions) what to do where that is so.&para;<br>Reflecting these, and other, complexities, the Guidelines&para;<br>contain complex instructions about how to sentence where&para;<br>the offender is convicted of “Multiple Counts,” see USSG&para;<br>§3D, or has previously been convicted of a crime for which&para;<br>he is “subject to an Un-discharged Term of Imprisonment,”&para;<br>see §5G1.3. The Guidelines also tell the sentencing judge&para;<br>how, through the use of partially concurrent and partially&para;<br>consecutive sentences, to build a total sentence that meets&para;<br>the Guidelines’ requirements. See §§5G1.2(d), 5G1.3.&para;<br>With this background it becomes easier to understand&para;<br>the statutory provisions before us. They reflect the fact&para;<br>that Congress expected sentencing judges, when faced&para;<br>with a defendant convicted of multiple crimes, to construct&para;<br>a sentence that would, at least to a degree, reflect the&para;<br>defendant’s real underlying behavior. Where two convictions reflect in whole or in part the same behavior, the&para;<br>overall sentences should reflect that fact, say by running&para;<br>concurrently.&para;<br>Accordingly, the statute says that “[m]ultiple terms of&para;<br>imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently&para;<br>unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the&para;<br>terms are to run consecutively.” 18 U. S. C. §3584(a). And&para;<br>that statement reflects the fact that often (but not always)&para;<br>multiple convictions after a single trial will reflect a single course of behavior (different aspects of which violate&para;<br>different criminal statutes). The statute also says that&para;<br>“[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different&para;<br>times run consecutively unless the court orders that the&para;<br>terms are to run concurrently.” Ibid. This statement&para;<br>reflects the fact that several convictions imposed after&para;<br>different trials are more likely to reflect unrelated behaviors. In the first instance that the statute addresses,&para;<br>concurrent sentences are more likely to be appropriate;&para;<br>in the second, consecutive sentences are more likely to be&para;<br>appropriate. But that is not always so. Thus the statu-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tory provisions assure sentencing judges that they retain&para;<br>the power to reach a different conclusion.&para;<br>At this point, I would ask the question that this case&para;<br>poses. Why does the statute say nothing about a sentencing judge imposing a sentence that might run consecutively with a sentence that a (typically different) judge has&para;<br>not yet imposed? The answer is this: Because the sentencing judge normally does not yet know enough about the&para;<br>behavior that underlies (or will underlie) a sentence that&para;<br>has not yet been imposed. Normally the sentencing judge&para;<br>does not know, for example, (a) what that sentence will be,&para;<br>(b) whether the behavior underlying that later sentence&para;<br>constitutes part of the same course of behavior that underlies the present sentence or, instead, is totally separate&para;<br>from the behavior underlying the present sentence, or (c)&para;<br>is partly the same and partly different. Even if the judge&para;<br>has an idea about what will happen, he does not know&para;<br>precisely what will happen; and precision in this matter is&para;<br>important.&para;<br>In a word, the sentencing judge normally does not yet&para;<br>know enough about what will happen in the sentencingproceeding-yet-to-come to be able to construct a sentence&para;<br>that meets the Guidelines’ instructions and which, in&para;<br>doing so, helps to assure that different individuals who&para;<br>engage in the same criminal behavior will typically receive&para;<br>roughly comparable sentences.&para;<br>Of course, the Court is correct when it says that eventually the sentences will run (either wholly in or in part)&para;<br>concurrently or consecutively. And someone must decide&para;<br>how they will run. Ante, at 2–3. But the Court is not&para;<br>correct when it says that this someone should be the first&para;<br>federal sentencing judge. Rather, the Executive and&para;<br>Judicial Branches have devised a system that can draw&para;<br>upon the intentions of that first federal judge, while applying them in light of actual knowledge about what later&para;<br>happened. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in effect makes&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the consecutive/concurrent decision after considering,&para;<br>among other things, “any statement by the court that&para;<br>imposed the sentence,” including statements “concerning&para;<br>the purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was&para;<br>determined to be warranted.” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b)(4)(A).&para;<br>And its program statement provides that it will review&para;<br>the “intent of the federal sentencing court” when deciding&para;<br>whether in effect to make an earlier federal, and later&para;<br>state, sentence concurrent or consecutive. Dept. of Justice, BOP, Program Statement 5160.05: Designation of&para;<br>State Institution for Service of Federal Sentence 4 (Jan.&para;<br>16, 2003). The Bureau exercises this authority by designating (or refusing to designate) the state prison where an&para;<br>offender is or will be incarcerated pursuant to his state&para;<br>sentence as the place where he will serve his federal sentence. 18 U. S. C. §3621(b).&para;<br>This exercise of authority by the Executive Branch is&para;<br>not constitutionally surprising. After all, “federal sentencing” has “never . . . been thought to be assigned by the&para;<br>Constitution to the exclusive jurisdiction of any one of the&para;<br>three Branches of Government.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at&para;<br>364. And, until fairly recently the federal BOP decided&para;<br>(via parole) the far more global question of just how long&para;<br>(within broad limits) each imprisoned offender would&para;<br>serve. See id., at 367. Thus, the present Bureau involvement represents a further practical accommodation to a&para;<br>fact about the world, namely that the initial sentencing&para;<br>judge typically lacks important sentencing-related information about a second sentence that has not yet been&para;<br>imposed.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Given the purposes and the mechanics of the SRA’s&para;<br>sentencing system, just described, the better reading of&para;<br>the “multiple sentences” provision is a reading that denies&para;<br>a sentencing judge the authority to “order that the federal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence&para;<br>that has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1. For one thing,&para;<br>nothing in the statute explicitly grants the judge that&para;<br>authority. The text refers to other circumstances, those&para;<br>that involve earlier or contemporaneous (multiple-count)&para;<br>convictions, while it does not refer to later imposed&para;<br>sentences.&para;<br>For another, exercise of any such authority would more&para;<br>likely hinder than advance the basic objectives of the SRA.&para;<br>As I have explained, supra, at 2–5, a sentencing judge&para;<br>typically needs detailed information when constructing a&para;<br>multiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline sentence.&para;<br>The fact that the future sentence has not yet been imposed&para;<br>means that information will often be lacking, and that in&para;<br>turn means that the exercise of such authority would risk&para;<br>confusion and error. A sentencing judge who believes, for&para;<br>example, that the future conviction will be based upon&para;<br>different relevant conduct (and consequently orders a&para;<br>consecutive sentence) could discover that the second conviction rests upon the same relevant conduct (warranting&para;<br>a concurrent sentence). Mistakes of this kind increase the&para;<br>risk of sentencing disparity and, insofar as the first judge&para;<br>guesses wrong, they can mean a less honest sentencing&para;<br>process as well.&para;<br>Further, I can find no significant tradition (preGuideline or post-Guideline) of federal judges imposing a&para;<br>sentence that runs consecutively with a sentence not yet&para;<br>imposed. The Court refers to four Courts of Appeals cases&para;<br>for the proposition that “traditionally” a judge possessed&para;<br>this authority. Ante, at 4. The opinions in three of the&para;<br>cases are each about a page long and do not discuss the&para;<br>matter here at issue. (They assume, without significant&para;<br>discussion, the existence of the relevant sentencing authority.) See Anderson v. United States, 405 F. 2d 492,&para;<br>493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam) (addressing the question&para;<br>whether a federal sentence runs from the date of its impo-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sition or from the date of entry into federal custody);&para;<br>United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178, 179–180 (CA7&para;<br>1966) (per curiam) (same); United States ex rel. Lester v.&para;<br>Parker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41 (CA3 1968) (per curiam) (addressing the question whether a sentence was insufficiently certain for purposes of due process). The fourth case, Salley v.&para;<br>United States, 786 F. 2d 546, 548 (CA2 1986), discusses the&para;<br>issue directly and takes the Court’s position. But, like the&para;<br>other three cases, it was decided before the Guidelines took&para;<br>effect (i.e., when the reasons for denying the authority&para;<br>were less strong). And, one judge on the panel disagreed&para;<br>in a separate opinion, and in my view has the better of the&para;<br>argument. See id., at 548–550 (Newman, J., concurring in&para;<br>result); see also United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315,&para;<br>1317 (CA9 1985) (holding that a judge lacks the hererelevant sentencing power). In any event, these instances&para;<br>are too few to constitute a “tradition.”&para;<br>In fact the Senate Committee Report accompanying the&para;<br>SRA provides strong evidence that there was no such&para;<br>tradition. S. Rep. No. 98–225 (1983). That Report thoroughly surveyed prior law. It says that the SRA is a&para;<br>“comprehensive statement of the Federal law of sentencing,” that it “describes in detail the kinds of sentences that&para;<br>may be imposed,” and that §3584 “provides the rules for&para;<br>determining the length of a term of imprisonment for a&para;<br>person convicted of more than one offense.” Id., at 50,&para;<br>125–126. It further states that “[e]xisting law permits the&para;<br>imposition of either concurrent or consecutive sentences,”&para;<br>which practice it then describes as limited to two scenarios:&para;<br>“[t]erms of imprisonment imposed at the same time,” and&para;<br>those “imposed on a person already serving a prison term.”&para;<br>Id., at 126. It says the same when describing how §3584 is&para;<br>supposed to work. In neither place does it refer to a practice of, or any authority for, imposing a prison term that&para;<br>runs consecutively with a future term not yet imposed.&para;<br>In addition, a grant of such authority risks at least&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>occasional incoherence. For example, the statute, after&para;<br>setting forth the court’s authority to impose a sentence&para;<br>of imprisonment that runs either concurrently or consecutively with other terms imposed in the same or in earlier&para;<br>proceedings, creates an exception that says: “except that&para;<br>the terms may not run consecutively for an attempt and&para;<br>for another offense that was the sole objective of the attempt.” 18 U. S. C. §3584(a). Now suppose the Court&para;<br>were right, and a sentencing judge had the authority to&para;<br>run a present term consecutively with a not-yet-imposed&para;<br>future term. Would it not be important to apply this same&para;<br>“attempt” exception in such instances as well? Indeed,&para;<br>the exception is phrased in categorical terms, and the legislative history in no way indicates that the exception applies only occasionally. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, at 126&para;<br>(“[C]onsecutive terms of imprisonment may not, contrary&para;<br>to current law, be imposed for [attempt] and for an offense&para;<br>that was the sole objective of the attempt” (emphasis&para;<br>added)). Yet it is difficult, if not impossible, to read the&para;<br>statute’s language as broadening the exception beyond the&para;<br>statutorily listed scenarios.&para;<br>Or, consider, for example, an offender tried for arguably&para;<br>related crimes in two different federal courts at two different times. The Court’s reading would not only allow the&para;<br>second judge to order concurrent service with the first&para;<br>sentence if warranted, as the statute explicitly permits,&para;<br>but it would also allow the first judge to make an analogous but anticipatory order based upon the sentence he&para;<br>expected the second judge would impose. But where complex forms of criminal behavior are at issue, these different judges may reach different conclusions. The result&para;<br>may well be conflict and confusion.&para;<br>Finally, as I said above, supra, at 5–6, a more practical&para;<br>solution to potential problems presented by a future sentencing proceeding lies closer at hand. The BOP has the&para;<br>statutory authority to effect concurrent service of federal&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SETSER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and state sentences and is well situated to take into account both the intent of the first sentencing judge and&para;<br>the specific facts developed in the second sentencing. The&para;<br>relevant statute provides that “[t]he Bureau may designate any available penal or correctional facility . . . ,&para;<br>whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b). And in reliance on this&para;<br>authority, the Bureau has concluded that it has the power&para;<br>to “designat[e] . . . a state institution for concurrent service of a federal sentence.” Program Statement 5160.05,&para;<br>at 1. The Program Statement further provides that exercise of this power will be guided by, in part, “the intent of&para;<br>the federal sentencing court” in addition to “any other&para;<br>pertinent information regarding the inmate.” Id., at 4.&para;<br>The Court’s only criticism of this system is that it is&para;<br>less “natural” to read the statute “as giving the Bureau&para;<br>of Prisons what amounts to sentencing authority.” Ante,&para;<br>at 8. But what is unnatural about giving the Bureau that&para;<br>authority? The sentencing process has long involved&para;<br>cooperation among the three branches of Government.&para;<br>Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 364. And until the Guidelines&para;<br>the BOP itself decided, within broad limits, precisely how&para;<br>much prison time every typical offender would serve.&para;<br>Even today, it still decides that question within certain&para;<br>limits. 18 U. S. C. §3624 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) (delegating to the BOP authority to calculate “good time credit,”&para;<br>which in effect reduces a prisoner’s term of incarceration);&para;<br>see also Barber, 560 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 1). Although&para;<br>Congress limited the Bureau’s authority in this respect,&para;<br>there is nothing unnatural about leaving the Bureau with&para;<br>a small portion of that authority—particularly where&para;<br>doing so helps significantly to alleviate a small, but important, technical problem in the application of the SRA’s&para;<br>sentencing system.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.
