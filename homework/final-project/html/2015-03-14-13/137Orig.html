WYOMING ET AL.&para;<br>ON EXCEPTION TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER&para;<br>No. 137, Orig. Argued January 10, 2011—Decided May 2, 2011&para;<br>Article V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact ratified by Montana,&para;<br>Wyoming, and North Dakota provides: “Appropriative rights to the&para;<br>beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing&para;<br>in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be en&para;<br>joyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use&para;<br>of water under the doctrine of appropriation.” 65 Stat. 666. Montana&para;<br>filed a bill of complaint, alleging that Wyoming breached Article V(A)&para;<br>by allowing its upstream pre-1950 water users to switch from flood to&para;<br>sprinkler irrigation, which increases crop consumption of water and&para;<br>decreases the volume of runoff and seepage returning to the river&para;<br>system. Thus, even if Wyoming’s pre-1950 users divert the same&para;<br>quantity of water as before, less water reaches downstream users in&para;<br>Montana. Concluding that the Compact permits more efficient irri&para;<br>gation systems so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the&para;<br>same acreage watered in 1950, the Special Master found that Mon&para;<br>tana’s increased-efficiency allegation failed to state a claim. Montana&para;<br>has filed an exception.&para;<br>Held: Because Article V(A) of the Compact incorporates the ordinary&para;<br>doctrine of appropriation without significant qualification, and be&para;<br>cause in Wyoming and Montana that doctrine allows appropriators to&para;<br>improve their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down&para;<br>stream appropriators, Montana’s increased-efficiency allegation fails&para;<br>to state a claim for breach of the Compact under Article V(A). Pp. 4–&para;<br>19.&para;<br>(a) Background appropriation law principles do not support Mon&para;<br>tana’s position. The doctrine of appropriation provides that rights to&para;<br>water for irrigation are perfected and enforced in order of seniority,&para;<br>starting with the first person to divert water from a natural stream&para;<br>and apply it to a “beneficial use.” Once perfected, that water right is&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>senior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be fulfilled entirely&para;<br>before the junior appropriators get any water. However, junior ap&para;<br>propriators do acquire rights to the stream basically as it exists when&para;<br>they find it. Under this no-injury rule, junior users may, subject to&para;<br>the fulfillment of the senior users’ existing rights, prevent senior us&para;<br>ers from enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment. Here,&para;<br>the question is whether a switch to more efficient irrigation with less&para;<br>return flow is within Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriat&para;<br>ive rights or is an improper enlargement of that right. Although the&para;<br>law of return flows is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine, the&para;<br>Special Master correctly concluded that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users&para;<br>may switch to sprinkler irrigation. Pp. 4–16.&para;<br>(1) A change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of&para;<br>the no-injury rule in Montana and Wyoming, which generally con&para;<br>cerns changes in the location of the diversion and the place or pur&para;<br>pose of use. Thus, an appropriator may increase his consumption by&para;<br>changing to a more water-intensive crop so long as he makes no&para;<br>change in acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. Ordinary,&para;<br>day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not violate the rule.&para;<br>Consumption can even be increased by adding farm acreage, if that&para;<br>was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued through&para;<br>the years. Irrigation system improvements seem to be the same sort&para;<br>of changes. This view is consistent with the fact that by 1950 both&para;<br>States had statutes regulating certain changes to water rights, but&para;<br>neither required farmers to take official action before adjusting irri&para;<br>gation methods. Cases in both States frequently describe the no&para;<br>injury rule as applying to changes in point of diversion, purpose of&para;<br>use, and place of use. The abundance of litigation over such&para;<br>changes—and the absence of any litigation over the sort of change at&para;<br>issue here—strongly implies that irrigation efficiency improvements&para;<br>were considered within the scope of the original appropriative right.&para;<br>Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(2) The doctrine of recapture—which permits an appropriator&para;<br>who has diverted water for irrigation to recapture and reuse his own&para;<br>runoff and seepage before it escapes his control or his property—also&para;<br>supports treating irrigation efficiency improvements as within the&para;<br>original appropriative right. Montana and Wyoming cases appear to&para;<br>apply this basic doctrine without any qualification based on whether&para;<br>the return flow would re-enter the original stream or not. By using&para;<br>sprinklers instead of flood irrigation, Wyoming’s pre-1950 water us&para;<br>ers effectively recapture water. The sprinklers reduce loss from&para;<br>seepage and runoff and are simply different mechanisms for increas&para;<br>ing the volume of water available to crops without changing the&para;<br>amount of diversion. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(3) This conclusion is consistent with the view of water law&para;<br>scholars who have considered the question presented in this case.&para;<br>Pp. 15–16.&para;<br>(b) Also unpersuasive is Montana’s argument that, if background&para;<br>appropriation law principles do not support its position, Article V(A)’s&para;<br>“beneficial use” definition nonetheless restricts the scope of pre-1950&para;<br>appropriative rights to the net volume of water that was actually be&para;<br>ing consumed in 1950. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>(1) “Beneficial use” is “that use by which the water supply of a&para;<br>drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed by the activities&para;<br>of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana contends that the term means the&para;<br>amount of depletion, and thus any activity increasing Wyoming’s pre&para;<br>1950 depletions beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds Article V(A)’s scope.&para;<br>Pp. 16–17.&para;<br>(2) Nothing in the Compact’s definition suggests such an inter&para;<br>pretation. A plain reading indicates that “beneficial use” is a type of&para;<br>use that depletes the water supply. This view is supported by the&para;<br>circumstances in the signatory States when the Compact was&para;<br>drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory preference for irriga&para;<br>tion, a depletive use, over power generation, a nondepletive use. It&para;<br>thus it makes sense for the Compact to protect irrigation uses that&para;<br>were legislatively favored and represented the predominant use of&para;<br>the Yellowstone River system. Montana’s reading, by contrast, would&para;<br>drastically redefine the term. The amount of water put to “beneficial&para;<br>use” has never been defined by net water consumption. In irrigation,&para;<br>that amount has always included a measure of necessary loss, e.g.,&para;<br>runoff or evaporation. If the Compact’s definition were meant to&para;<br>drastically redefine “beneficial use,” this Court would expect far more&para;<br>clarity. Moreover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of&para;<br>ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A), which ex&para;<br>pressly states that “the laws governing the acquisition and use of wa&para;<br>ter under the doctrine of appropriation” control, would make little&para;<br>sense. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(3) If Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set&para;<br>quantity of water, it could have done so plainly, as done in other&para;<br>compacts, e.g., the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>Exception overruled.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

STATE OF&para;<br>&para;<br>WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA &para;<br>&para;<br>ON EXCEPTION TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER&para;<br>[May 2, 2011]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>This case arises out of a dispute between Montana and&para;<br>Wyoming over the Yellowstone River Compact. Montana&para;<br>alleges that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the&para;<br>Compact by allowing its pre-1950 water appropriators to&para;<br>increase their net water consumption by improving the&para;<br>efficiency of their irrigation systems. The new systems,&para;<br>Montana alleges, employ sprinklers that reduce the&para;<br>amount of wastewater returned to the river, thus depriv­&para;<br>ing Montana’s downstream pre-1950 appropriators of&para;<br>water to which they are entitled. The Special Master has&para;<br>filed a First Interim Report determining, as relevant here,&para;<br>that Montana’s allegation fails to state a claim because&para;<br>more efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the&para;<br>Compact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate&para;<br>the same acreage watered in 1950. We agree with the&para;<br>Special Master and overrule Montana’s exception to that&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>From its headwaters in Wyoming, the Yellowstone River&para;<br>flows nearly 700 miles northeast into Montana and then&para;<br>North Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River. Several&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of its tributaries, including the Clarks Fork, Tongue,&para;<br>Powder, and Bighorn Rivers, also begin in Wyoming and&para;<br>cross into Montana before joining the main stem of the&para;<br>Yellowstone River. This river system’s monthly and an­&para;<br>nual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary&para;<br>widely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and&para;<br>Powder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App.&para;<br>936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it&para;<br>became expedient to build water storage facilities for&para;<br>preserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of&para;<br>Special Master 6 (hereinafter Report).&para;<br>Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress&para;<br>sought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone&para;<br>River system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Da­&para;<br>kota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to&para;<br>negotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47&para;<br>Stat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942,&para;<br>and 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in&para;<br>1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the&para;<br>Yellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it.&para;<br>Act of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.&para;<br>The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three&para;<br>tiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: “Appropria­&para;<br>tive rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow­&para;<br>stone River System existing in each signatory State as of&para;<br>January 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accor­&para;<br>dance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of&para;<br>water under the doctrine of appropriation.” Id., at 666.&para;<br>Second, Article V(B) allocates to each State the “quantity&para;<br>of that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemen­&para;<br>tal water supplies” for the pre-1950 uses protected by&para;<br>Article V(A). Ibid. Third, “the remainder of the unused&para;<br>and unappropriated water” of each tributary is divided by&para;<br>percentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water&para;<br>in the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40%&para;<br>in the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rest goes to Montana. Id., at 666–667.&para;<br>In February 2008, we granted Montana leave to file a&para;<br>bill of complaint against Wyoming for breach of the Com­&para;<br>pact. 552 U. S. 1175. Montana alleged that Wyoming had&para;<br>breached the Compact by consuming more than its share&para;<br>of the Tongue and Powder Rivers. Bill of Complaint 3,&para;<br>¶8. Specifically, Montana claimed that Wyoming was ap­&para;<br>propriating water for a number of new, post-1950 uses:&para;<br>irrigating new acreage; building new storage facilities;&para;<br>conducting new groundwater pumping; and increasing con­&para;<br>sumption on existing agricultural acreage.1 Id., at 3–4,&para;<br>¶¶ 9–12. According to Montana’s complaint, the Compact&para;<br>did not permit Wyoming to use water for any of these&para;<br>practices as long as Montana’s pre-1950 users’ rights&para;<br>remained unfulfilled. Id., at 3, ¶8.&para;<br>In response, Wyoming filed a motion to dismiss the&para;<br>complaint. We appointed a Special Master and referred&para;<br>the motion to him. 555 U. S. __ (2008). After briefing and&para;<br>argument, the Special Master recommended that we deny&para;<br>Wyoming’s motion, because at least some of Montana’s&para;<br>allegations state a claim for relief. The Special Master&para;<br>found that “Article V of the Compact protects pre-1950&para;<br>appropriations in Montana from new surface and ground­&para;<br>water diversions in Wyoming, whether for direct use or for&para;<br>storage, that prevent adequate water from reaching Mon­&para;<br>tana to satisfy those pre-1950 appropriations.” Report 14–&para;<br>15. But the Special Master agreed with Wyoming that&para;<br>Montana’s allegations regarding “efficiency improvements&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Montana&para;<br>&para;<br>has since clarified that increased consumption on existing&para;<br>acreage refers to the use of more efficient irrigation systems. The&para;<br>“efficiency” of irrigation for our purposes refers to the amount of&para;<br>wastewater that is lost, for example, to evaporation, seepage, runoff, or&para;<br>deep percolation. Some of the lost water returns to the river and is&para;<br>later available for downstream users. A more efficient irrigation&para;<br>system loses less water; thus, though it may draw the same volume of&para;<br>water from the river, net water consumption is increased.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>by pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming” do not state a&para;<br>claim for relief. Id., at 15. The States did not object to&para;<br>most of the Special Master’s findings, and we have issued&para;<br>orders accordingly. See 562 U. S. __ (2010); 562 U. S. __&para;<br>(2010). Montana has filed an exception to the Special&para;<br>Master’s rejection of its increased-efficiency allegation. It&para;<br>is this exception that is before us.2&para;<br>II&para;<br>Article V(A) of the Compact states that “[a]ppropriative&para;<br>rights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each&para;<br>signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be&para;<br>enjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi­&para;<br>tion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”&para;<br>Montana claims that its pre-1950 appropriators’ rights are&para;<br>not “continu[ing] to be enjoyed” because upstream pre­&para;<br>1950 appropriators in Wyoming have increased their&para;<br>consumption by switching from flood to sprinkler irriga­&para;<br>tion. Montana alleges that sprinkler systems increase&para;<br>crop consumption of water and decrease the volume of&para;<br>runoff and seepage that returns to the Tongue and Powder&para;<br>rivers by 25% or more.3 See Montana’s Exception and&para;<br>Brief 3 (hereinafter Brief for Montana). As a result, even&para;<br>if Wyoming’s pre-1950 water users divert the same quan­&para;<br>tity of water as before, less water reaches Montana. Ac­&para;<br>cording to Montana, Article V(A) prohibits Wyoming from&para;<br>allowing this practice when it deprives Montana’s pre­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Montana also raised an exception to the Special Master’s finding&para;<br>that if Montana can remedy the shortage of water to its pre-1950 users&para;<br>by curtailing its post-1950 uses without “prejudic[ing] Montana’s other&para;<br>rights under the Compact,” then an intrastate remedy is “the appropri­&para;<br>ate solution.” Report 15. We recommitted this exception to the Special&para;<br>Master. 562 U. S. __ (2010).&para;<br>3 For purposes of resolving Wyoming’s motion to dismiss, we take as&para;<br>true Montana’s allegation that the new sprinkler systems actually&para;<br>reduce return flow to the rivers. Wyoming has not conceded that this is&para;<br>true. See Wyoming’s Reply to Montana’s Exception 35, n. 6.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1950 users of their full water rights.&para;<br>The question, therefore, is whether Article V(A) allows&para;<br>Wyoming’s pre-1950 water users—diverting the same&para;<br>quantity of water for the same irrigation purpose and&para;<br>acreage as before 1950—to increase their consumption of&para;<br>water by improving their irrigation systems even if it&para;<br>reduces the flow of water to Montana’s pre-1950 users.&para;<br>Montana makes two basic arguments: that background&para;<br>principles of appropriation law, to the extent they are&para;<br>incorporated into the Compact, do not allow such an in­&para;<br>crease in consumption; and that even if they do, the terms&para;<br>of the Compact amended those principles in Montana’s&para;<br>favor. The Special Master rejected these arguments, and&para;<br>so do we.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects&para;<br>“[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water]” as&para;<br>of 1950 “in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appro­&para;<br>priation,” we begin with an overview of appropriation&para;<br>doctrine.4 As the Special Master explained, if “[a]p­&para;<br>propriation law clearly proscribe[s] increases in consump­&para;<br>tion on existing acreage to the detriment of downstream&para;<br>appropriators, the Compact arguably would prohibit&para;<br>Wyoming from allowing its appropriators to make&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 As&para;<br>&para;<br>with all contracts, we interpret the Compact according to the&para;<br>intent of the parties, here the signatory States. We thus look primarily&para;<br>to the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana, but, like the&para;<br>States, we also look to Western water law more generally and authori­&para;<br>ties from before and after 1950. The States appear to have assumed&para;<br>that the doctrine has not changed in a way directly relevant here. We&para;<br>therefore do not decide whether Article V(A) intended to freeze appro­&para;<br>priation law as it stood in 1949, or whether it incorporates the evolution&para;<br>of the doctrine over time, allowing Compact-protected rights to grow or&para;<br>shrink accordingly. We resolve the matter of Montana’s exception&para;<br>without prejudice to that issue. See Report 39–40.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>such increases to the detriment of Montana’s pre-1950&para;<br>uses.” Report 65.&para;<br>As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of&para;<br>appropriation has governed water rights in Montana and&para;<br>Wyoming since the 1800’s. See, e.g., Basey v. Gallagher,&para;<br>20 Wall. 670, 683 (1875). As relevant here, the doctrine&para;<br>provides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected&para;<br>and enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first&para;<br>person to divert water from a natural stream and apply it&para;<br>to a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently&para;<br>completed). See Hinderlider v. La Plata River &amp; Cherry&para;<br>Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938); Arizona v. Cali&para;<br>fornia, 298 U. S. 558, 565–566 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8,&para;<br>§3 (“Priority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give&para;<br>the better right”). The scope of the right is limited by the&para;<br>concept of “beneficial use.” That concept restricts a farmer&para;<br>“to the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his&para;<br>land by making a reasonable use of the water.” 1 C.&para;<br>Kinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights §586, pp.&para;<br>1007–1008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted); see also Bailey v. Tintinger, 45&para;<br>Mont. 154, 176–178, 122 P. 575, 583 (1912); Quinn v. John&para;<br>Whitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 376–380, 92 P. 2d 568,&para;<br>570–571 (1939). Once such a water right is perfected, it is&para;<br>senior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be ful­&para;<br>filled entirely before those junior appropriators get any&para;<br>water at all.&para;<br>For our purposes, Montana’s pre-1950 water users are&para;<br>similar to junior appropriators. As between the States,&para;<br>the Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre­&para;<br>1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for&para;<br>Montana 23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.&para;<br>But as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal&para;<br>seniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop&para;<br>Wyoming’s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising&para;<br>their water rights. Thus, when the rivers are low, Mon­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tana’s downstream pre-1950 users might get no water at&para;<br>all because the equally senior users upstream in Wyoming&para;<br>may lawfully consume all of the water. Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>51.&para;<br>Junior appropriators are not completely without rights,&para;<br>however. As they come online, appropriators acquire&para;<br>rights to the stream basically as it exists when they find&para;<br>it. See 2 Kinney §803, at 1403–1404. Accordingly, subject&para;<br>to the fulfillment of all senior users’ existing rights, under&para;<br>the no-injury rule junior users can prevent senior users&para;<br>from enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment.&para;<br>1 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen West­&para;<br>ern States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).&para;<br>Montana’s pre-1950 users can therefore “insist that&para;<br>[Wyoming’s pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly&para;<br>within the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the&para;<br>amount of water within the extent of their appropriation&para;<br>which they actually apply to some beneficial use.” 2&para;<br>Kinney §784, at 1366. That general proposition is undis­&para;<br>puted; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to&para;<br>more efficient irrigation with less return flow within the&para;<br>extent of Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriative&para;<br>rights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to&para;<br>the detriment of Montana’s pre-1950 water users?&para;<br>As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows&para;<br>is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65&para;<br>(citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt.&para;<br>L. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us&para;<br>to any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, “[n]o west­&para;<br>ern state court appears to have conclusively answered the&para;<br>question.” Report 65.&para;<br>Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found&para;<br>several reasons to conclude that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users&para;<br>may switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the&para;<br>scope of the original appropriative right includes such a&para;<br>change so long as no additional water is diverted from the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stream and the conserved water is used on the same acre­&para;<br>age for the same agricultural purpose as before. We agree&para;<br>with the Special Master.5&para;<br>1&para;<br>First, although the no-injury rule prevents appropria­&para;<br>tors from making certain water-right changes that would&para;<br>harm other appropriators, a change in irrigation methods&para;<br>does not appear to run afoul of that rule in Montana and&para;<br>Wyoming. See id., at 69. Because each new appropriator&para;<br>is entitled to the stream as it exists when he finds it, the&para;<br>general rule is that “if a change in these conditions is&para;<br>made by [a senior] appropriator, which interferes with the&para;<br>flow of the water to the material injury of [the junior&para;<br>appropriator’s] rights, he may justly complain.” 2 Kinney&para;<br>§803, at 1404.&para;<br>But the no-injury rule is not absolute; it generally con­&para;<br>cerns changes in the location of the diversion and the&para;<br>place or purpose of use. Quigley v. McIntosh, 110 Mont.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The lack of clarity in this area of water law highlights the sensitive&para;<br>nature of our inquiry and counsels caution. Our original jurisdiction&para;<br>over cases between States brings us this dispute between Montana and&para;<br>Wyoming about the meaning of their congressionally approved Yellow­&para;<br>stone River Compact. See U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1251(a). Yet, because the Compact references and the parties direct&para;<br>us to principles of appropriation doctrine, we find ourselves immersed&para;<br>in state water law. See n. 4, supra.

We recognize that appropriation doctrine contin­&para;<br>ues to evolve, and there are reasonable policy arguments in favor of&para;<br>both States’ positions here.

For instance, an appropriator&para;<br>may increase his consumption by changing to a more&para;<br>water-intensive crop so long as he makes no change in&para;<br>acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted.

Ordinary,&para;<br>day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not&para;<br>violate the no-injury rule.

This is also consistent with the&para;<br>fact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating&para;<br>certain changes to water rights, but neither required&para;<br>farmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation&para;<br>methods.6 See Report 69–70, 87; id., at 69 (they “do not&para;<br>generally have procedures for overseeing changes in water&para;<br>efficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation im­&para;<br>provements where there are no formal changes in the&para;<br>underlying water rights”).

But it has not provided a single example from&para;<br>either State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typi­&para;<br>cally describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in&para;<br>point of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See,&para;<br>e.g., Maclay v. Missoula Irrig. Dist., 90 Mont. 344, 355–&para;<br>357, 3 P. 2d 286, 291 (1931); Thayer v. Rawlins, 594 P. 2d&para;<br>951, 955 (Wyo. 1979). The abundance of litigation over&para;<br>such changes—and the absence of any litigation over the&para;<br>sort of change at issue here—strongly implies that irriga­&para;<br>tion efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury&para;<br>rule and were considered within the scope of the original&para;<br>appropriative right.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The doctrine of recapture also supports treating im­&para;<br>provements in irrigation efficiency as within the original&para;<br>appropriative right.

Garringer, 1&para;<br>Mont. 535 (1872). And Montana cites no case from either&para;<br>State here in which a court has recognized, much less&para;<br>found controlling, the idea that a water user may not&para;<br>reuse his own wastewater while it is still on his property&para;<br>simply because it otherwise would return to the original&para;<br>stream.&para;<br>In fact, Montana and Wyoming appear to apply, without&para;<br>qualification, the basic doctrine that the original appro­&para;<br>priator may freely recapture his used water while it re­&para;<br>mains on his property and reuse it for the same purpose&para;<br>on the same land. For example, in Binning v. Miller, 55&para;<br>Wyo. 451, 102 P. 2d 54 (1940), a man was diverting water&para;<br>from a creek fed largely by irrigation runoff and seepage&para;<br>from Binning’s property.

In a later case, the&para;<br>court explained that the man could not “secure a perma­&para;<br>nent right to continue to receive the water” because&para;<br>Binning “might find better ways of utilizing the water on&para;<br>the same land so that less waste and seepage would oc­&para;<br>cur.” Bower v.

Franks, 610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980),&para;<br>water was seeping from Fuss’ property and into a pit in a&para;<br>public right of way. Franks was the first to appropriate&para;<br>the water from the pit. The court upheld Franks’ appro­&para;<br>priation right because the water had already escaped from&para;<br>Fuss’ property. The court said that the “owner of land&para;<br>upon which seepage or waste water rises has the right to&para;<br>use and reuse—capture and recapture—such waste wa­&para;<br>ters,” but only before the water escapes his land, and “for&para;<br>use only upon the land for which the water forming the&para;<br>seepage was originally appropriated.” Id., at 20 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Fuss thus had no superior&para;<br>right to the water that had left his property, and espe­&para;<br>cially not for reuse on other lands.&para;<br>The law in Montana is similar. The Montana Supreme&para;<br>Court has explained that “the general rule . . . is that the&para;<br>owner of the right to use the water—his private property&para;<br>while in his possession,—may collect it, recapture it, be­&para;<br>fore it leaves his possession.” Rock Creek Ditch &amp; Flume&para;<br>Co. v.

By using sprinklers rather&para;<br>than flood irrigation, those water users effectively recap­&para;<br>ture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seep­&para;<br>age and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than,&para;<br>cruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They&para;<br>are simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume&para;<br>of water available to the crops without changing the&para;<br>amount of diversion.

One scholar asserted: “[O]f course,&para;<br>increasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of&para;<br>water available to downstream users who may rely on&para;<br>return flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however,&para;<br>does not preclude more efficient uses merely because a&para;<br>downstream user may be injured.” Squillace, A Critical&para;<br>Look at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land &amp; Water L. Rev.&para;<br>307, 331 (1989); see id., at 331, n. 156 (“For example, a&para;<br>farmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water&para;<br>applied to his land is free to change his crop or method of&para;<br>applying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%”);&para;<br>see also Thompson, supra, at 76 (“[A] prior appropriator&para;<br>can at anytime . . . instal[l] a sprinkler system, thereby&para;<br>eliminating all waste of water”). And a national hornbook&para;<br>on water law has observed:&para;<br>“The rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged&para;<br>water on the original land can result in more water&para;<br>being consumed. For instance, if a water user is con­&para;<br>suming less than the permitted amount of water and&para;<br>plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more&para;<br>efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water&para;<br>that had previously been returned to the stream&para;<br>might be consumed. This can deprive other appro­&para;<br>priators of water on which they depend but it is al­&para;<br>lowed since it is technically within the terms of the&para;<br>original appropriation.” Getches 143–144.&para;<br>Montana has not identified any scholars who have reached&para;<br>the opposite conclusion.&para;<br>For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of&para;<br>appropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appro­&para;<br>priators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the&para;<br>detriment of downstream appropriators. We readily ac­&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>knowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See&para;<br>supra, at 7. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule&para;<br>in Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and&para;<br>its broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and&para;<br>the specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in&para;<br>the same direction, which also comports with the Special&para;<br>Master’s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly,&para;<br>if Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles&para;<br>of appropriation law, it allows Wyoming’s pre-1950 water&para;<br>users to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the&para;<br>detriment of Montana’s pre-1950 users.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that&para;<br>even if background principles of appropriation law do not&para;<br>support its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not&para;<br>protect the full scope of ordinary appropriative rights.&para;<br>Montana claims that the Compact’s definition of “benefi­&para;<br>cial use” restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appro­&para;<br>priative rights to the net volume of water that was actu­&para;<br>ally being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special&para;<br>Master that this argument also fails.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Article V(A) protects “[a]ppropriative rights to the bene­&para;<br>ficial uses of . . . water.” “Beneficial use,” in turn, is de­&para;<br>fined in Article II(H) as “that use by which the water&para;<br>supply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully em­&para;<br>ployed by the activities of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana&para;<br>contends that “beneficial use” is thus defined as the&para;<br>amount of depletion. According to Montana, any activity&para;<br>that increases pre-1950 water users’ depletions in Wyo­&para;<br>ming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the&para;<br>appropriative rights that Article V(A) protects. See Brief&para;<br>for Montana 25–28. On this basis, Montana asserts that&para;<br>the Compact requires (subject to river conditions) that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>same quantity of water that was reaching Montana as of&para;<br>January 1, 1950, continue to do so. Id., at 26.&para;<br>2&para;<br>We acknowledge that “beneficial use” refers to a type of&para;<br>use that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does.&para;<br>See Report 61. The part of the Compact’s definition of&para;<br>“beneficial use” that refers to depletion—“that use by&para;<br>which the water supply . . . is depleted”—is fairly clear. It&para;<br>begins with “that use,” and the words that follow merely&para;<br>explain that “that use” must be a use that “deplete[s]” the&para;<br>“water supply.” Nothing in the language suggests that&para;<br>“beneficial use” means a measure of the amount of water&para;<br>depleted. A “beneficial use” within the meaning of the&para;<br>Compact, therefore, is a type of use that depletes the water&para;<br>supply.&para;<br>This plain reading makes sense in light of the circum­&para;<br>stances existing in the signatory States when the Compact&para;<br>was drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory&para;<br>preference for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over&para;<br>power generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§71–402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would&para;<br>have been written to protect the irrigation uses that were&para;<br>legislatively favored and represented the predominant use&para;<br>of the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–&para;<br>47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the&para;<br>Compact recognizes “the great importance of water for&para;<br>irrigation in the signatory States”).&para;<br>Montana’s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not&para;<br>follow from the text and would drastically redefine the&para;<br>term “beneficial use” from its longstanding meaning. The&para;<br>amount of water put to “beneficial use” has never been&para;<br>defined by net water consumption. The quantity of water&para;<br>“beneficially used” in irrigation, for example, has always&para;<br>included some measure of necessary loss such as runoff,&para;<br>evaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (re­&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,&para;<br>water put to “[b]eneficial use is not what is actually con­&para;<br>sumed, but what is actually necessary in good faith.” 1&para;<br>Wiel §481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Rea­&para;<br>sonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12&para;<br>Wyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial&para;<br>use and noting that “the method of application, by flood­&para;<br>ing, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial”); J. Sax, B.&para;<br>Thompson, J. Leshy, &amp; R. Adams, Legal Control of Water&para;<br>Resources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation&para;<br>practices and observing that the amount of water put to&para;<br>beneficial use “is often considerably more than the quan­&para;<br>tum actually consumed”).&para;<br>If the Compact’s definition of “beneficial use” were&para;<br>meant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for&para;<br>net water consumption, we would expect far more clarity.&para;<br>For example, the Compact could have stated that it would&para;<br>protect “only ‘the amount of water consumed for a benefi­&para;<br>cial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.’ ”&para;<br>Report 60. Or it could have defined “beneficial use” as the&para;<br>“volume by which the water supply . . . is depleted.” More­&para;<br>over, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of&para;<br>ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A),&para;<br>which expressly states that “the laws governing the acqui­&para;<br>sition and use of water under the doctrine of appropria­&para;<br>tion” control, would make little sense.&para;<br>We agree with the Special Master that the definition of&para;<br>beneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Arti­&para;<br>cle V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appro­&para;<br>priative rights that it protects in both States.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee&para;<br>Montana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as&para;<br>plainly as other compacts that do just that.

The Court interprets the Yel&para;<br>lowstone River Compact (Compact), see Act of Oct. 30,&para;<br>1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663, to grant those Wyomans* the&para;<br>right to increase their consumption so long as they do not&para;<br>increase the volume of water they diverted beyond pre&para;<br>1950 levels. Thus, it holds, Montana cannot complain that&para;<br>the increased consumption interferes with its residents’&para;<br>pre-1950 appropriative water rights. I disagree because&para;<br>the Court’s analysis substitutes its none-too-confident&para;<br>reading of the common law, see ante, at 7–8, and n. 5, for&para;<br>the Compact’s definition of “beneficial use.”&para;<br>The doctrine of appropriation allocates perpetual water&para;<br>rights along a river, on a “first in time[,] . . . superior in&para;<br>right” basis, Wyoming v.

S. 92, 98 (1938). The&para;<br>“beneficial use” requirement does most of the legal work.&para;<br>It marks the types of uses that confer an appropriative&para;<br>right—irrigation being a paradigmatic example, see&para;<br>United States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U. S. 499,&para;<br>504, n. 2 (1945); and it “measure[s]” the extent of an ap&para;<br>propriator’s claim, see Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497,&para;<br>505 (1924); A. Tarlock, Law of Water Rights and Re&para;<br>sources §§5:66, 5:68–5:69, pp. 5–130.3, 5–130.9 to 5–&para;<br>130.10 (2010). At common law, an appropriator claims the&para;<br>volume of water diverted and “reasonably required” by his&para;<br>intended use. Id., §§5:65–5:66, at 5–127, 5–130.2; see&para;<br>Quinn v. John Whitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 377–378,&para;<br>92 P. 2d 568, 570–571 (1939).&para;<br>The Compact borrows the concept of appropriation to&para;<br>define the rights of pre-1950 water users along the Yel&para;<br>lowstone River and its tributaries. Article V(A) promises&para;<br>that “[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the&para;<br>water of the Yellowstone River System existing in each&para;<br>signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be&para;<br>enjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi&para;<br>tion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”&para;<br>65 Stat. 666. Article II(H) elaborates that a “Beneficial&para;<br>Use” is one “by which the water supply of a drainage basin&para;<br>is depleted when usefully employed by the activities of&para;<br>man.” Id., at 665 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Like the common law, this definition lays out the types&para;<br>of uses that qualify as beneficial and the volume of water&para;<br>an appropriator may claim through his beneficial use. But&para;<br>the Compact’s focus on whether a use depletes a river’s&para;<br>water supply—not whether it diverts the river’s flow—&para;<br>significantly limits the volume of water to which Wyoming&para;<br>is entitled. For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may&para;<br>lay claim only to its beneficial users’ net consumption of&para;<br>water, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river&para;<br>minus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>river’s channel.&para;<br>This interpretation, and only this interpretation, gives&para;<br>meaning to the definition’s use of the word “depleted.” I&para;<br>cannot write off as an accident the choice of this word&para;<br>rather than the word consistently used elsewhere in the&para;<br>Compact: “diverted.” See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542&para;<br>U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). The Compact’s authors knew&para;<br>how to use “diverted” and “diversion” when they wanted&para;<br>to. Those two words appear repeatedly in other provisions&para;<br>of the Compact, see Arts. II(G); V(B), (C); VII(A), (C), (D),&para;<br>65 Stat. 665–668; and the Compact defines them in the&para;<br>sentence immediately preceding the definition of “benefi&para;<br>cial use.” See Art. II(G), id., at 665. But the Compact’s&para;<br>authors chose to define beneficial use in terms of deple&para;<br>tion—the first and only time the Compact uses any deriva&para;<br>tive of the word “deplete.” It is in my view a clear indica&para;<br>tion that the Compact intends to break from the common&para;<br>law’s focus on diversion.&para;<br>The Court reduces the Compact’s deliberate use of “de&para;<br>pleted” to an inconsequential slip of the pen. According to&para;<br>today’s majority, Article II(H) speaks only to the types of&para;<br>uses that confer appropriative rights. “Nothing in the&para;<br>language,” it says, “suggests that ‘beneficial use’ means a&para;<br>measure of the amount of water depleted.” Ante, at 17.&para;<br>This is incomprehensible. On the Court’s own interpreta&para;<br>tion “beneficial use” not only defines the types of uses that&para;<br>confer appropriative rights, but also determines the vol&para;<br>ume of water to which the rights attach—viz., only that&para;<br>volume put to one of the specified types of uses. The only&para;<br>question before us is whether “beneficial use” measures&para;<br>the volume diverted or the volume depleted—and the&para;<br>language of the Compact makes that clear.&para;<br>The Court provides no plausible explanation for use of&para;<br>the word “depleted” instead of “diverted.” Its best effort&para;<br>is the suggestion that the word was used to ensure that&para;<br>hydroelectric power generation and other disfavored,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>nondepletive uses do not confer appropriative rights. See&para;<br>ibid. That is highly unlikely, for two reasons. First, rely&para;<br>ing on a subtle distinction between depletion and diversion&para;<br>would be one of the clumsiest ways imaginable to accom&para;<br>plish that simple goal, if it was not already accomplished&para;<br>by other provisions of the Compact. One would instead&para;<br>have expected the Compact simply to exclude the disfa&para;<br>vored uses from the “usefu[l] . . . activities of man,”&para;<br>Art. II(H), 65 Stat. 665, which confer appropriative rights.&para;<br>Cf. Mont. Code Ann. §85–2–102(4) (2009) (listing types of&para;<br>beneficial uses). Second, and even more conclusively,&para;<br>hydroelectric generation, water wheels, and mill races—&para;<br>the allegedly disfavored uses Wyoming and the United&para;<br>States offer up to explain the word “depleted”—are already&para;<br>excluded from appropriative rights (and probably from any&para;<br>need for appropriative rights) by the Compact’s definition&para;<br>of diversion: “the taking or removing of water from the&para;<br>Yellowstone River or any tributary thereof when the water&para;<br>so taken or removed is not returned directly into the&para;<br>channel of the Yellowstone River or of the tributary from&para;<br>which it is taken.” Art. II(G), 65 Stat. 665. The modifying&para;<br>clause seems specifically designed to exclude hydroelectric&para;<br>dams, water wheels and mill races, which, when they&para;<br>divert water from the Yellowstone or its tributaries, “re&para;<br>tur[n it] directly into the channel . . . from which it is&para;<br>taken.”&para;<br>The Court objects to my interpretation because the word&para;<br>“depleted” lacks the “clarity” necessary to “drastically&para;<br>redefine the term ‘beneficial use’ from its longstanding&para;<br>meaning,” ante, at 17. According to the Court, “[t]he&para;<br>amount of water put to ‘beneficial use’ has never been&para;<br>defined by net water consumption.” Ibid. Before making&para;<br>this statement, the Court has spent some 10 pages, ante,&para;<br>at 7–16, conducting a “sensitive . . . inquiry [that] counsels&para;<br>caution”; into a field (state water law) where the answer of&para;<br>this Court is not conclusive and hence not ipso facto cor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rect (“it is not this Court’s role to guide”); resulting in the&para;<br>Court’s best guess concerning “an unclear area of appro&para;<br>priation doctrine”; answering a question which “ ‘[n]o&para;<br>western state court [not even a lower court] appears to&para;<br>have conclusively answered.’ ” Ante, at 7–8, and n. 5. The&para;<br>Court calls that hitherto unanswered question “the law of&para;<br>return flows,” ante, at 7, but it can more accurately be&para;<br>described as the question whether the volume of water to&para;<br>which an appropriator acquires rights is the entire volume&para;<br>diverted for a beneficial use, or rather only the volume&para;<br>depleted by the beneficial use. Which is to say that “bene&para;<br>ficial use” has never had the “longstanding meaning” the&para;<br>Court posits. If it has in the past been assumed to refer to&para;<br>all water diverted from the stream rather than all water&para;<br>depleted from the stream, that is only because the issue of&para;<br>which of the two it means has never arisen. I find it quite&para;<br>extraordinary that the Court should expend such heroic&para;<br>efforts (imagine how many cases had to be read!) answer&para;<br>ing a state water-law question that no court of any West&para;<br>ern State has ever answered—a question that would cross&para;<br>a Rabbi’s eyes—when the text in front of us provides&para;<br>the clear answer insofar as this Compact is concerned:&para;<br>“depleted.”&para;<br>The Court suggests that if the Compact’s authors&para;<br>wanted to break from (what it considers) the common law,&para;<br>they should have defined beneficial use as the “volume by&para;<br>which the water supply . . . is depleted.” Ante, at 18 (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted). That objection seems to&para;<br>me to have little force when the Court cannot explain what&para;<br>work “depleted” is supposed to do other than indicate&para;<br>precisely the same concept more concisely. And the&para;<br>Court’s helpful drafting tip proves that speaking with&para;<br>greater clarity is not so easy. Following the Court’s advice&para;<br>would make nonsense of Article V(B) of the Compact.&para;<br>That provision allocates a fixed percentage “of the unused&para;<br>and unappropriated water” of various tributaries to each&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MONTANA v. WYOMING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>State for post-1950 “storage or direct diversions for benefi&para;<br>cial use on new lands or for other purposes.” 65 Stat. 666.&para;<br>But if “beneficial use” in this last phrase means “the vol&para;<br>ume of water by which . . . the water supply is depleted,”&para;<br>the provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed&para;<br>percentage of unused and unappropriated water for “a&para;<br>volume of water by which the water supply is depleted.” It&para;<br>makes perfect sense, of course, if “beneficial use” means all&para;<br>uses that deplete the stream.&para;<br>The Court also wonders why, “if Article V(A) were in&para;<br>tended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,” it&para;<br>did not “d[o] so as plainly as other” interstate water com&para;<br>pacts “that do just that.” Ante, at 18. This is a straw man.&para;<br>Montana does not demand a precise volume of water each&para;<br>year; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users al&para;<br>ways receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs.&para;<br>It merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the&para;<br>same position relative to Wyoming’s pre-1950 users in&para;<br>2011 as they did in 1950—that whatever would have&para;<br>flowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appro&para;<br>priators’ beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this&para;<br>year’s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Mon&para;<br>tanans will have to make do with less or go without.&para;<br>Because I think the Court’s disposition disregards the&para;<br>text of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
