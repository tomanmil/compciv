Argued December 1, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011&para;<br>The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to&para;<br>make Government records available to the public, subject to nine ex&para;<br>emptions. This case concerns Exemption 2, which protects from dis&para;<br>closure material “related solely to the internal personnel rules and&para;<br>practices of an agency.” 5 U. S. C.§552(b)(2). This provision replaced&para;<br>an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) exemption for “any matter&para;<br>relating solely to the internal management of an agency,” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1002 (1964 ed.). Congress believed that the “sweep” of the phrase&para;<br>“internal management” had led to excessive withholding, and drafted&para;<br>Exemption 2 “to have a narrower reach.” Department of Air Force v.&para;<br>Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362–363.&para;<br>In Rose, the Court found that Exemption 2 could not be invoked to&para;<br>withhold Air Force Academy honor and ethics hearing summaries.&para;<br>The exemption, the Court suggested, primarily targets material con&para;<br>cerning employee relations or human resources. But the Court stated&para;<br>a possible caveat: That understanding of the provision’s coverage&para;<br>governed “at least where the situation is not one where disclosure&para;<br>may risk circumvention of agency regulation.” Id., at 369. The D. C.&para;<br>Circuit subsequently converted this caveat into a new definition of&para;<br>Exemption 2’s scope, finding that the exemption also covered any&para;<br>“predominantly internal” materials whose disclosure would “signifi&para;<br>cantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulation or statutes.” Crooker&para;<br>v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, 670 F. 2d 1051, 1056–&para;<br>1057, 1074. Courts now use the term “Low 2” for human resources&para;<br>and employee relations records and “High 2” for records whose disclo&para;<br>sure would risk circumvention of the law.&para;<br>Petitioner Milner submitted FOIA requests for explosives data and&para;<br>maps used by respondent Department of the Navy (Navy or Govern&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ment) in storing munitions at a naval base in Washington State.&para;<br>Stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and&para;<br>surrounding community, the Navy invoked Exemption 2 and refused&para;<br>to release the data. The District Court granted the Navy summary&para;<br>judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 2&para;<br>interpretation.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Because Exemption 2 encompasses only records relating to em&para;<br>ployee relations and human resources issues, the explosives maps&para;<br>and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that&para;<br>exemption. Pp. 6–19.&para;<br>(a) Exemption 2 shields only those records relating to “personnel&para;<br>rules and practices.” When used as an adjective in this manner, the&para;<br>key statutory word “personnel” refers to human resources matters.&para;<br>For example, a “personnel department” deals with employee prob&para;<br>lems and interviews applicants for jobs. FOIA Exemption 6 provides&para;<br>another example, protecting certain “personnel . . . files” from disclo&para;<br>sure. §552(b)(6). “[T]he common and congressional meaning of . . .&para;<br>‘personnel file’ ” is a file maintained by a human resources office col&para;<br>lecting personal information about employees, such as examination&para;<br>results and work performance evaluations. Rose, supra, at 377. Ex&para;<br>emption 2 uses “personnel” in the exact same way. An agency’s “per&para;<br>sonnel rules and practices” all share a critical feature: They concern&para;<br>conditions of employment in federal agencies—such matters as hiring&para;<br>and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.&para;<br>These items currently fall within the so-called Low 2 exemption. And&para;<br>under this Court’s construction of the statutory language, Low 2 is all&para;<br>of 2.&para;<br>FOIA’s purpose reinforces this reading. The statute’s goal is&para;<br>“broad disclosure,” and the exemptions must be “given a narrow com&para;<br>pass.” Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151. A&para;<br>narrow construction stands on especially firm footing with respect to&para;<br>Exemption 2, which was intended to hem in the expansive withhold&para;<br>ing that occurred under the prior APA exemption for “internal man&para;<br>agement” records.&para;<br>Exemption 2, as interpreted here, does not reach the requested ex&para;<br>plosives information. The data and maps, which calculate and visu&para;<br>ally portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations, in no way re&para;<br>late to “personnel rules and practices,” as that term is most naturally&para;<br>understood. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(b) The Government’s two alternative readings of Exemption 2&para;<br>cannot be squared with the statute. Pp. 10–17.&para;<br>(c) While the Navy has a strong security interest in shielding the&para;<br>explosives data and maps from public disclosure, the Government&para;<br>has other tools at hand to protect such information: FOIA Exemption&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

The Navy’s argument that the explosives information is exempt under Exemption 7&para;<br>remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand. And if&para;<br>these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would&para;<br>threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the Government may of course&para;<br>seek relief from Congress.

This case concerns the&para;<br>scope of Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure&para;<br>material that is “related solely to the internal personnel&para;<br>rules and practices of an agency.” §552(b)(2). Respondent&para;<br>Department of the Navy (Navy or Government) invoked&para;<br>Exemption 2 to deny a FOIA request for data and maps&para;<br>used to help store explosives at a naval base in Washing&para;<br>ton State. We hold that Exemption 2 does not stretch so&para;<br>far.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Congress enacted FOIA to overhaul the public&para;<br>disclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act&para;<br>(APA), 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.). That section of the&para;<br>APA “was plagued with vague phrases” and gradually&para;<br>became more “a withholding statute than a disclosure&para;<br>statute.” EPA v. Mink, 410 U. S. 73, 79 (1973). Congress&para;<br>intended FOIA to “permit access to official information&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>long shielded unnecessarily from public view.” Id., at 80.&para;<br>FOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose records on&para;<br>request, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions.&para;<br>These exemptions are “explicitly made exclusive,” id., at&para;<br>79, and must be “narrowly construed,” FBI v. Abramson,&para;<br>456 U. S. 615, 630 (1982).&para;<br>At issue here is Exemption 2, which shields from com&para;<br>pelled disclosure documents “related solely to the internal&para;<br>personnel rules and practices of an agency.” §552(b)(2).&para;<br>Congress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA’s ex&para;<br>emption for “any matter relating solely to the internal&para;<br>management of an agency,” 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.).&para;<br>Believing that the “sweep” of the phrase “internal man&para;<br>agement” had led to excessive withholding, Congress&para;<br>drafted Exemption 2 “to have a narrower reach.” Depart&para;<br>ment of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362–363 (1976).&para;<br>We considered the extent of that reach in Department of&para;<br>Air Force v. Rose. There, we rejected the Government’s&para;<br>invocation of Exemption 2 to withhold case summaries of&para;<br>honor and ethics hearings at the United States Air Force&para;<br>Academy. The exemption, we suggested, primarily targets&para;<br>material concerning employee relations or human re&para;<br>sources: “use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch&para;<br>hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.”&para;<br>Id., at 363 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,&para;<br>8 (1965) (hereinafter S. Rep.)); see Rose, 425 U. S., at 367.&para;<br>“[T]he general thrust” of Exemption 2, we explained, “is&para;<br>simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and&para;<br>maintaining [such information] for public inspection.” Id.,&para;<br>at 369. We concluded that the case summaries did not fall&para;<br>within the exemption because they “d[id] not concern only&para;<br>routine matters” of “merely internal significance.” Id., at&para;<br>370. But we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation&para;<br>of Exemption 2: That understanding of the provision’s&para;<br>coverage governed, we wrote, “at least where the situation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of&para;<br>agency regulation.” Id., at 369.&para;<br>In Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms,&para;<br>670 F. 2d 1051 (1981), the D. C. Circuit converted this&para;<br>caveat into a new definition of Exemption 2’s scope.&para;<br>Crooker approved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a man&para;<br>ual designed to train Government agents in law enforce&para;<br>ment surveillance techniques. The D. C. Circuit noted&para;<br>that it previously had understood Exemption 2 to “refe[r]&para;<br>only to ‘pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch&para;<br>hours, parking, etc.’ ” Id., at 1056 (quoting Jordan v.&para;<br>Department of Justice, 591 F. 2d 753, 763 (1978)). But the&para;<br>court now thought Exemption 2 should also cover any&para;<br>“predominantly internal” materials,1 Crooker, 670 F. 2d,&para;<br>at 1056–1057, whose disclosure would “significantly ris[k]&para;<br>circumvention of agency regulations or statutes,” id., at&para;<br>1074. This construction of Exemption 2, the court rea&para;<br>soned, flowed from FOIA’s “overall design,” its legislative&para;<br>history, “and even common sense,” because Congress could&para;<br>not have meant to “enac[t] a statute whose provisions&para;<br>undermined . . . the effectiveness of law enforcement&para;<br>agencies.” Ibid.&para;<br>In the ensuing years, three Courts of Appeals adopted&para;<br>the D. C. Circuit’s interpretation of Exemption 2. See 575&para;<br>F. 3d 959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below); Massey v. FBI, 3&para;<br>F. 3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); Kaganove v. EPA, 856 F. 2d&para;<br>884, 889 (CA7 1988).2 And that interpretation spawned a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The court adopted the “predominantly internal” standard as a way&para;<br>of implementing the exemption’s requirement that materials “relat[e]&para;<br>solely to” an agency’s internal personnel rules and practices. The&para;<br>word “solely,” the court reasoned, “has to be given the construction,&para;<br>consonant with reasonableness, of ‘predominantly’ ” because otherwise&para;<br>“solely” would conflict with the expansive term “related.” 670 F. 2d, at&para;<br>1056 (some internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>2 Three other Courts of Appeals had previously taken a narrower view&para;<br>of Exemption 2’s scope, consistent with the interpretation adopted in&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>new terminology: Courts applying the Crooker approach&para;<br>now refer to the “Low 2” exemption when discussing mate&para;<br>rials concerning human resources and employee relations,&para;<br>and to the “High 2” exemption when assessing records&para;<br>whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.&para;<br>See, e.g., 575 F. 3d, at 963; Schiller v. NLRB, 964 F. 2d&para;<br>1205, 1208 (CADC 1992). Congress, as well, took notice of&para;<br>the D. C. Circuit’s decision, borrowing language from&para;<br>Crooker to amend Exemption 7(E) when next enacting&para;<br>revisions to FOIA. The amended version of Exemption&para;<br>7(E) shields certain “records or information compiled for&para;<br>law enforcement purposes” if their disclosure “could rea&para;<br>sonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”&para;<br>§552(b)(7)(E); see Freedom of Information Reform Act of&para;<br>1986, §1802(a), 100 Stat. 3207–49.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The FOIA request at issue here arises from the Navy’s&para;<br>operations at Naval Magazine Indian Island, a base in&para;<br>Puget Sound, Washington. The Navy keeps weapons,&para;<br>ammunition, and explosives on the island. To aid in the&para;<br>storage and transport of these munitions, the Navy uses&para;<br>data known as Explosive Safety Quantity Distance&para;<br>(ESQD) information. 575 F. 3d, at 962. ESQD informa&para;<br>tion prescribes “minimum separation distances” for explo&para;<br>sives and helps the Navy design and construct storage&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Rose. See Cox v. Department of Justice, 576 F. 2d 1302, 1309–1310&para;<br>(CA8 1978) (concluding that Exemption 2 covers only an agency’s&para;<br>internal “housekeeping matters” (internal quotation marks omitted));&para;<br>Stokes v. Brennan, 476 F. 2d 699, 703 (CA5 1973) (holding that Exemp&para;<br>tion 2 “must not be read so broadly as to exempt” an Occupational&para;<br>Safety and Health Administration manual for training compliance&para;<br>officers); Hawkes v. IRS, 467 F. 2d 787, 797 (CA6 1972) (“[T]he internal&para;<br>practices and policies referred to in [Exemption 2] relate only to . . .&para;<br>employee-employer type concerns”). These Circuits have never revised&para;<br>their understandings of the exemption. See infra, at 13, n. 7.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

The ESQD calculations are often incorporated into&para;<br>specialized maps depicting the effects of hypothetical&para;<br>explosions. See, e.g., App. 52.&para;<br>In 2003 and 2004, petitioner Glen Milner, a Puget&para;<br>Sound resident, submitted FOIA requests for all ESQD&para;<br>information relating to Indian Island. 575 F. 3d, at 962.&para;<br>The Navy refused to release the data, stating that disclo&para;<br>sure would threaten the security of the base and surround&para;<br>ing community. In support of its decision to withhold the&para;<br>records, the Navy invoked Exemption 2. Ibid.3&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment to the&para;<br>Navy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the&para;<br>High 2 interpretation developed in Crooker. 575 F. 3d, at&para;<br>963. The Court of Appeals explained that the ESQD&para;<br>information “is predominantly used for the internal pur&para;<br>pose of instructing agency personnel on how to do their&para;<br>jobs.” Id., at 968. And disclosure of the material, the&para;<br>court determined, “would risk circumvention of the law”&para;<br>by “point[ing] out the best targets for those bent on wreak&para;<br>ing havoc”—for example, “[a] terrorist who wished to hit&para;<br>the most damaging target.” Id., at 971. The ESQD infor&para;<br>mation, the court concluded, therefore qualified for a High&para;<br>2 exemption. 575 F. 3d, at 971.&para;<br>We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split re&para;<br>specting Exemption 2’s meaning, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and&para;<br>we now reverse.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Navy also invoked Exemption 7(F), which applies to “records or&para;<br>information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the&para;<br>extent that the production of such . . . records . . . could reasonably be&para;<br>expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.” 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(F). The courts below did not decide whether the&para;<br>Navy could withhold the ESQD data under that exemption. 575 F. 3d&para;<br>959, 971, n. 8 (CA9 2009); No. CV–06–01301 (WD Wash., Oct. 30, 2007),&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 4, 25, 2007 WL 3228049, *8.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>Our consideration of Exemption 2’s scope starts with its&para;<br>text. See, e.g., Park ’N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc.,&para;<br>469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985) (“Statutory construction must&para;<br>begin with the language employed by Congress and the&para;<br>assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language&para;<br>accurately expresses the legislative purpose”). Judicial&para;<br>decisions since FOIA’s enactment have analyzed and&para;<br>reanalyzed the meaning of the exemption. But compara&para;<br>tively little attention has focused on the provision’s 12&para;<br>simple words: “related solely to the internal personnel&para;<br>rules and practices of an agency.”&para;<br>The key word in that dozen—the one that most clearly&para;<br>marks the provision’s boundaries—is “personnel.” When&para;<br>used as an adjective, as it is here to modify “rules and&para;<br>practices,” that term refers to human resources matters.&para;<br>“Personnel,” in this common parlance, means “the selec&para;<br>tion, placement, and training of employees and . . . the&para;<br>formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or&para;<br>involving] employees or their representatives.” Webster’s&para;<br>Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinaf&para;<br>ter Webster’s). So, for example, a “personnel department”&para;<br>is “the department of a business firm that deals with&para;<br>problems affecting the employees of the firm and that&para;<br>usually interviews applicants for jobs.” Random House&para;<br>Dictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House).&para;<br>“Personnel management” is similarly “the phase of man&para;<br>agement concerned with the engagement and effective&para;<br>utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of&para;<br>human resources.” Webster’s 1687. And a “personnel&para;<br>agency” is “an agency for placing employable persons in&para;<br>jobs; employment agency.” Random House 1075.&para;<br>FOIA itself provides an additional example in Exemp&para;<br>tion 6. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143&para;<br>(1994) (“A term appearing in several places in a statutory&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>text is generally read the same way each time it appears”).&para;<br>That exemption, just a few short paragraphs down from&para;<br>Exemption 2, protects from disclosure “personnel and&para;<br>medical files and similar files the disclosure of which&para;<br>would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of per&para;<br>sonal privacy.” §552(b)(6). Here too, the statute uses the&para;<br>term “personnel” as a modifier meaning “human re&para;<br>sources.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32 (“[The Court:] It’s [an]&para;<br>H. R. file, right? [The Government:] That’s generally&para;<br>true”). As we recognized in Rose, “the common and con&para;<br>gressional meaning of . . . ‘personnel file’ ” is the file “show&para;<br>ing, for example, where [an employee] was born, the&para;<br>names of his parents, where he has lived from time to&para;<br>time, his . . . school records, results of examinations, [and]&para;<br>evaluations of his work performance.” 425 U. S., at 377.&para;<br>It is the file typically maintained in the human resources&para;<br>office—otherwise known (to recall an example offered&para;<br>above) as the “personnel department.” Ibid.&para;<br>Exemption 2 uses “personnel” in the exact same way.&para;<br>An agency’s “personnel rules and practices” are its rules&para;<br>and practices dealing with employee relations or human&para;<br>resources. The D. C. Circuit, in a pre-Crooker decision,&para;<br>gave as examples “matters relating to pay, pensions,&para;<br>vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc.”&para;<br>Jordan, 591 F. 2d, at 763; see supra, at 3. That “etc.” is&para;<br>important; we doubt any court could know enough about&para;<br>the Federal Government’s operations to formulate a com&para;<br>prehensive list. But all the rules and practices referenced&para;<br>in Exemption 2 share a critical feature: They concern the&para;<br>conditions of employment in federal agencies—such mat&para;<br>ters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, com&para;<br>pensation and benefits.4 Courts in practice have had little&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Government records also must satisfy the other requirements of&para;<br>Exemption 2 to be exempt from disclosure. Information must “relat[e]&para;<br>solely”—meaning, as usual, “exclusively or only,” Random House 1354&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>difficulty identifying the records that qualify for withhold&para;<br>ing under this reading: They are what now commonly fall&para;<br>within the Low 2 exemption. Our construction of the&para;<br>statutory language simply makes clear that Low 2 is all of&para;<br>2 (and that High 2 is not 2 at all, see infra, at 10–14).&para;<br>The statute’s purpose reinforces this understanding of&para;<br>the exemption. We have often noted “the Act’s goal of&para;<br>broad disclosure” and insisted that the exemptions be&para;<br>“given a narrow compass.” Department of Justice v. Tax&para;<br>Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151 (1989); see Department of&para;<br>Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Assn., 532 U. S.&para;<br>1, 7–8 (2001).5 This practice of “constru[ing] FOIA exemp&para;<br>tions narrowly,” Department of Justice v. Landano, 508&para;<br>U. S. 165, 181 (1993), stands on especially firm footing&para;<br>with respect to Exemption 2. As described earlier, Con&para;<br>gress worded that provision to hem in the prior APA ex&para;<br>emption for “any matter relating solely to the internal&para;<br>management of an agency,” which agencies had used to&para;<br>prevent access to masses of documents. See Rose, 425&para;<br>U. S., at 362. We would ill-serve Congress’s purpose by&para;<br>——————&para;<br>—to the agency’s “personnel rules and practices.” And the information&para;<br>must be “internal”; that is, the agency must typically keep the records&para;<br>to itself for its own use. See Webster’s 1180 (“internal” means “existing&para;<br>or situated within the limits . . . of something”). An agency’s human&para;<br>resources documents will often meet these conditions.&para;<br>5 The dissent would reject this longstanding rule of construction in&para;<br>favor of an approach asking courts “to turn Congress’ public informa&para;<br>tion objectives into workable agency practice.” Post, at 8–9 (opinion of&para;<br>BREYER, J.). But nothing in FOIA either explicitly or implicitly grants&para;<br>courts discretion to expand (or contract) an exemption on this basis. In&para;<br>enacting FOIA, Congress struck the balance it thought right—generally&para;<br>favoring disclosure, subject only to a handful of specified exemptions—&para;<br>and did so across the length and breadth of the Federal Government.&para;<br>See, e.g., John Doe Agency v.

But we think&para;<br>the Navy’s evidence insufficient: The scant history con&para;<br>cerning this word change as easily supports the inference&para;<br>that Congress merely swapped one synonym for another.&para;<br>Cf. Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 490 U.

These data and&para;<br>maps calculate and visually portray the magnitude of&para;<br>hypothetical detonations. By no stretch of imagination do&para;<br>they relate to “personnel rules and practices,” as that term&para;<br>is most naturally understood.

The Navy&para;<br>therefore may not use Exemption 2, interpreted in accord&para;<br>with its plain meaning to cover human resources matters,&para;<br>to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Government offers two alternative readings of&para;<br>Exemption 2 to support withholding the ESQD informa&para;<br>tion. We cannot square either with the statute.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Navy first encourages us to adopt the construction&para;<br>of Exemption 2 pioneered by Crooker, which shields mate&para;<br>rial not only if it meets the criteria set out above (Low 2),&para;<br>but also if it is “predominant[ly] interna[l]” and its “disclo&para;<br>sure would significantly risk[] circumvention of federal&para;<br>agency functions” (High 2). Brief for Respondent 41 (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted). The dissent, too, favors&para;<br>this reading of the statute. Post, at 1. But the Crooker&para;<br>interpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent&para;<br>flaw: It is disconnected from Exemption 2’s text. The High&para;<br>2 test (in addition to substituting the word “predomi&para;<br>nantly” for “solely,” see n. 1, supra) ignores the plain&para;<br>meaning of the adjective “personnel,” see supra, at 6–9,&para;<br>and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or&para;<br>referent in Exemption 2’s language. Indeed, the only way&para;<br>to arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute—&para;<br>“cutting out some” words and “pasting in others” until&para;<br>little of the actual provision remains. Elliott v. Depart&para;<br>ment of Agriculture, 596 F. 3d 842, 845 (CADC 2010).&para;<br>Because this is so, High 2 is better labeled “Non 2” (and&para;<br>Low 2 . . . just 2).&para;<br>In support of its text-light approach to the statute, the&para;<br>Government relies primarily on legislative history, placing&para;<br>particular emphasis on the House Report concerning&para;<br>FOIA. See Brief for Respondent 33–38. A statement in&para;<br>that Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exemption and, indeed, specifically rejects the Low 2&para;<br>construction. According to the Report: “Operating rules,&para;<br>guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government&para;<br>investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclo&para;<br>sure [under Exemption 2], but this exemption would not&para;<br>cover . . . employee relations and working conditions and&para;<br>routine administrative procedures.” H. R. Rep. No. 1497,&para;<br>89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966). But the Senate Report&para;<br>says exactly the opposite, explaining in support of a Low 2&para;<br>interpretation that the phrase “internal personnel rules&para;<br>and practices of an agency” means “rules as to personnel’s&para;<br>use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,&para;<br>statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.”&para;<br>S. Rep., at 8.6 In Rose, we gave reasons for thinking the&para;<br>Senate Report the more reliable of the two. See 425 U. S.,&para;<br>at 366. But the more fundamental point is what we said&para;<br>before: Legislative history, for those who take it into ac&para;<br>count, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it. See&para;<br>supra, at 9; Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 49&para;<br>(1950) (declining to consult legislative history when that&para;<br>“history is more conflicting than the text is ambiguous”).&para;<br>When presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory&para;<br>language and, on the other, with dueling committee re&para;<br>ports, we must choose the language.&para;<br>The Government also advances, in support of Crooker’s&para;<br>High 2 approach, an argument based on subsequent legis&para;<br>lative action. Congress, the Government notes, amended&para;<br>Exemption 7(E) in 1986 to cover law enforcement records&para;<br>whose production “would disclose techniques and proce&para;<br>dures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 We are perplexed that the dissent takes seriously Crooker’s notion&para;<br>that the reports are “reconcilable.” Post, at 4. To strip the matter to its&para;<br>essentials, the House Report says: “Exemption 2 means A, but not B.”&para;<br>The Senate Report says: “Exemption 2 means B.” That is the very&para;<br>definition of “irreconcilable.”&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v.

That amendment, the Government con&para;<br>tends, codified Crooker’s “circumvention of the law” stan&para;<br>dard and, in so doing, ratified Crooker’s holding. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 42–43. The dissent likewise counts as signifi&para;<br>cant that Congress “t[ook] note” of Crooker in revising&para;<br>FOIA. Post, at 9; see post, at 2.&para;<br>But the Government and the dissent neglect the key&para;<br>feature of the 1986 amendment: Congress modified not&para;<br>Exemption 2 (the subject of Crooker), but instead Exemp&para;<br>tion 7(E). And the Crooker construction of Exemption 2&para;<br>renders Exemption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that&para;<br>amendment of any effect. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v. Andrews,&para;<br>534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (noting canon that statutes should&para;<br>be read to avoid making any provision “superfluous, void,&para;<br>or insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We&para;<br>cannot think of any document eligible for withholding&para;<br>under Exemption 7(E) that the High 2 reading does not&para;<br>capture: The circumvention standard is the same, and the&para;<br>law enforcement records listed in Exemption 7(E) are&para;<br>“predominantly internal.” So if Congress had agreed with&para;<br>Crooker’s reading of Exemption 2, it would have had no&para;<br>reason to alter Exemption 7(E). In that event, Congress&para;<br>would either have left the statute alone (on the theory that&para;<br>Crooker would do the necessary work) or would have&para;<br>amended Exemption 2 specifically to ratify Crooker. The&para;<br>decision instead to amend Exemption 7(E) suggests that&para;<br>Congress approved the circumvention standard only as to&para;<br>law enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set of&para;<br>records High 2 covers. Perhaps this legislative action does&para;<br>not show that Congress affirmatively disagreed with&para;<br>Crooker; maybe Congress was agnostic about whether the&para;<br>circumvention standard should apply to other records.&para;<br>But one thing is clear: The 1986 amendment does not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

This argument&para;<br>therefore cannot save the High 2 construction.&para;<br>The dissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2,&para;<br>and indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.&para;<br>Crooker, the dissent asserts, “has been consistently relied&para;<br>upon and followed for 30 years” by other lower courts.&para;<br>Post, at 9; see post, at 1–2. But this claim, too, trips at the&para;<br>starting gate. It would be immaterial even if true, because&para;<br>we have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on&para;<br>the ground that other courts have done so. And in any&para;<br>event, it is not true. Prior to Crooker, three Circuits&para;<br>adopted the reading of Exemption 2 we think right, and&para;<br>they have not changed their minds. See n. 2, supra.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent’s view that “two of th[ese] Circuits [have] not adher[ed]&para;<br>to their early positions” is incorrect. Post, at 2. In Abraham &amp; Rose,&para;<br>P.L.C. v. United States, cited by the dissent, the Sixth Circuit rejected&para;<br>the Government’s claim that Exemption 2 shielded records of federal&para;<br>tax lien filings. 138 F. 3d 1075, 1082 (1998). The court nowhere&para;<br>discussed the High 2 versus Low 2 question at issue here. Its only&para;<br>reference to Crooker concerned the part of that decision interpreting&para;<br>“solely” to mean “predominantly.” See 138 F.3d, at 1080; see also n. 1,&para;<br>supra. Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, in Rugiero v.&para;<br>Department of Justice, that Exemption 2 applies to “routine matters of&para;<br>merely internal significance.” 257 F. 3d 534, 549 (2001). In Sladek v.&para;<br>Bensinger, which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted that&para;<br>the Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent’s&para;<br>manual because it “is not the type of trivial rule, such as allocation of&para;<br>parking facilities, that is covered by Exemption 2.” 605 F. 2d 899, 902&para;<br>(1979). In confirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court&para;<br>acknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.&para;<br>The court, however, declined to consider this alternative interpretation&para;<br>because it would not have changed the case’s outcome. See ibid.&para;<br>Finally, the Eighth Circuit’s last word on Exemption 2 is clear, and the&para;<br>dissent does not say otherwise. The exemption, according to that most&para;<br>recent Eighth Circuit decision, applies “only [to an agency’s] housekeep&para;<br>ing matters.” Cox, 576 F. 2d, at 1309–1310 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The dissent is surely right to say, post at 2, that Crooker “has&para;<br>guided nearly every FOIA case decided over the last 30 years” in&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Since Crooker, three other Circuits have accepted the High&para;<br>2 reading. See supra, at 3. One Circuit has reserved&para;<br>judgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate. See Audubon&para;<br>Society v. Forest Serv., 104 F. 3d 1201, 1203–1204 (CA10&para;<br>1997). And the rest have not considered the matter. (No&para;<br>one should think Crooker has been extensively discussed&para;<br>or debated in the Courts of Appeals. In the past three&para;<br>decades, Crooker’s analysis of Exemption 2 has been cited&para;<br>a sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions&para;<br>outside the D. C. Circuit—on average, once every six&para;<br>years.) The result is a 4 to 3 split among the Circuits.8&para;<br>We will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation&para;<br>to take the side of the bare majority.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Presumably because Crooker so departs from Exemption&para;<br>2’s language, the Government also offers another con&para;<br>struction, which it says we might adopt “on a clean slate,”&para;<br>“based on the plain text . . . alone.” Brief for Respondent&para;<br>15. On this reading, the exemption “encompasses records&para;<br>concerning an agency’s internal rules and practices for its&para;<br>personnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental&para;<br>functions.” Id., at 20; see also id., at 13–14 (Exemption 2&para;<br>“applies generally to matters concerning internal rules&para;<br>and practices to guide agency personnel in performing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Circuits applying Crooker; but that statement does not hold in the&para;<br>Circuits using the Low 2 approach.&para;<br>8 Notably, even those courts approving Crooker have disagreed about&para;<br>how to apply High 2. Fault lines include whether the risk of circum&para;<br>vention must be significant, see, e.g., Hidalgo v. FBI, 541 F. Supp. 2d&para;<br>250, 253 (DC 2008); Pet. for Cert. 15–16; whether courts should con&para;<br>sider the public interest in disclosure when calculating that risk, see,&para;<br>e.g., Department of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act,&para;<br>p. 185 (2009); and whether an agency must regulate the person or&para;<br>entity threatening circumvention; compare, e.g., 575 F. 3d, at 971, with,&para;<br>e.g., id., at 978 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting). The disagreement is not&para;<br>surprising. Because High 2 is nowhere evident in the statute, courts&para;<br>lack the normal guideposts for ascertaining its coverage.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>their duties”). According to the Government, this inter&para;<br>pretation makes sense because “the phrase ‘personnel&para;<br>rules and practices of an agency’ is logically understood to&para;<br>mean an agency’s rules and practices for its personnel.”&para;<br>Id., at 20 (emphasis added).&para;<br>But the purported logic in the Government’s definition&para;<br>eludes us. We would not say, in ordinary parlance, that a&para;<br>“personnel file” is any file an employee uses, or that a&para;<br>“personnel department” is any department in which an&para;<br>employee serves. No more would we say that a “personnel&para;<br>rule or practice” is any rule or practice that assists an&para;<br>employee in doing her job. The use of the term “personnel”&para;<br>in each of these phrases connotes not that the file or de&para;<br>partment or practice/rule is for personnel, but rather that&para;<br>the file or department or practice/rule is about personnel—&para;<br>i.e., that it relates to employee relations or human re&para;<br>sources. This case well illustrates the point. The records&para;<br>requested, as earlier noted, are explosives data and maps&para;<br>showing the distances that potential blasts travel. This&para;<br>information no doubt assists Navy personnel in storing&para;<br>munitions. But that is not to say that the data and maps&para;<br>relate to “personnel rules and practices.” No one staring&para;<br>at these charts of explosions and using ordinary language&para;<br>would describe them in this manner.&para;<br>Indeed, the Government’s “clean slate” construction&para;<br>reaches such documents only by stripping the word “per&para;<br>sonnel” of any real meaning. Under this interpretation,&para;<br>an agency’s “internal personnel rules and practices” ap&para;<br>pears to mean all its internal rules and practices. That is&para;<br>because agencies necessarily operate through personnel,&para;<br>and so all their internal rules and practices are for per&para;<br>sonnel. The modifier “personnel,” then, does no modifying&para;<br>work; it does not limit the class of internal rules and&para;<br>practices that Exemption 2 covers. What is most naturally&para;<br>viewed as the provision’s key word—the term that ought&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to define its scope—does nothing more than state the&para;<br>truism that in an agency it is “personnel” who follow&para;<br>internal rules and practices.&para;<br>And this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemp&para;<br>tion, posing the risk that FOIA would become less a dis&para;<br>closure than “a withholding statute.” Mink, 410 U. S., at&para;<br>79. Many documents an agency generates in some way&para;<br>aid employees in carrying out their responsibilities. If&para;<br>Exemption 2 were to reach all these records, it would tend&para;<br>to engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the&para;<br>limitations Congress placed on their application. Exemp&para;<br>tion 7, for example, shields records compiled for law en&para;<br>forcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria&para;<br>is met. §552(b)(7). Yet on the Government’s view, an&para;<br>agency could bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemp&para;<br>tion 2 whenever law enforcement records guide personnel&para;<br>in performing their duties. Indeed, an agency could use&para;<br>Exemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up provision to with&para;<br>hold sensitive records that do not fall within any of FOIA’s&para;<br>more targeted exemptions.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent asserts that “30 years of experience” with a more expan&para;<br>sive interpretation of the exemption suggests no “seriou[s] inter&para;<br>fere[nce] with . . . FOIA’s informational objectives.” Post, at 6. But&para;<br>those objectives suffer any time an agency denies a FOIA request based&para;<br>on an improper interpretation of the statute. To give just one example,&para;<br>the U. S. Forest Service has wrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple&para;<br>occasions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting&para;<br>sites. See Audubon Society v. Forest Serv., 104 F. 3d 1201, 1203 (CA10&para;<br>1997); Maricopa Audubon Soc. v. Forest Serv., 108 F. 3d 1082, 1084&para;<br>(CA9 1997). And recent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies&para;<br>may too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure. According to&para;<br>amicus Public Citizen, “while reliance on exemptions overall rose 83%&para;<br>from 1998 to 2006, reliance on Exemption 2 rose 344% during that&para;<br>same time period.” Brief for Public Citizen et al. as Amici Curiae 24.&para;<br>In 2009 alone, federal departments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000&para;<br>times to prevent access to records. See Brief for Allied Daily Newspa&para;<br>pers of Washington et al. as Amici Curiae 3. We do not doubt that&para;<br>many of these FOIA denials were appropriate. But we are unable to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Interpreted in this way, Exemption 2—call it “Super 2”&para;<br>now—would extend, rather than narrow, the APA’s former&para;<br>exemption for records relating to the “internal manage&para;<br>ment of an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.). We doubt&para;<br>that even the “internal management” provision, which&para;<br>Congress thought allowed too much withholding, see&para;<br>supra, at 2, would have protected all information that&para;<br>guides employees in the discharge of their duties, includ&para;<br>ing the explosives data and maps in this case. And per&para;<br>haps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates&para;<br>the rule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions.&para;<br>See, e.g., Abramson, 456 U. S., at 630; Rose, 425 U. S., at&para;<br>361. Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or&para;<br>purpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject it.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Gov&para;<br>ernment proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy’s&para;<br>interest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other&para;<br>similar information. The Government has informed us&para;<br>that “[p]ublicly disclosing the [ESQD] information would&para;<br>significantly risk undermining the Navy’s ability to safely&para;<br>and securely store military ordnance,” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representa&para;<br>tion. The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned that disclo&para;<br>sure of this information could be used to “wrea[k] havoc”&para;<br>and “make catastrophe more likely.” 575 F. 3d, at 971.&para;<br>Concerns of this kind—a sense that certain sensitive&para;<br>information should be exempt from disclosure—in part led&para;<br>the Crooker court to formulate the High 2 standard. See&para;<br>670 F. 2d, at 1074 (contending that “common sense” sup&para;<br>ported the High 2 interpretation because Congress would&para;<br>not have wanted FOIA to “undermin[e] . . . the effective&para;<br>——————&para;<br>accept the dissent’s unsupported declaration that a sweeping construc&para;<br>tion of Exemption 2 has not interfered with Congress’s goal of broad&para;<br>disclosure.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ness of law enforcement agencies”). And we acknowledge&para;<br>that our decision today upsets three decades of agency&para;<br>practice relying on Crooker, and therefore may force con&para;<br>siderable adjustments.&para;<br>We also note, however, that the Government has other&para;<br>tools at hand to shield national security information and&para;<br>other sensitive materials. Most notably, Exemption 1 of&para;<br>FOIA prevents access to classified documents. §552(b)(1);&para;<br>see 575 F. 3d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemp&para;<br>tion 1 is “specifically designed to allow government agen&para;<br>cies to withhold information that might jeopardize our&para;<br>national security”). The Government generally may clas&para;<br>sify material even after receiving a FOIA request, see&para;<br>Exec. Order No. 13526, §1.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009);&para;<br>an agency therefore may wait until that time to decide&para;<br>whether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of&para;<br>classification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30. Exemption 3&para;<br>also may mitigate the Government’s security concerns.&para;<br>That provision applies to records that any other statute&para;<br>exempts from disclosure, §552(b)(3), thus offering Con&para;<br>gress an established, streamlined method to authorize the&para;<br>withholding of specific records that FOIA would not oth&para;<br>erwise protect. And Exemption 7, as already noted, pro&para;<br>tects “information compiled for law enforcement purposes”&para;<br>that meets one of six criteria, including if its release “could&para;<br>reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical&para;<br>safety of any individual.” §552(b)(7)(F). The Navy argued&para;<br>below that the ESQD data and maps fall within Exemp&para;<br>tion 7(F), see n. 3, supra, and that claim remains open for&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.&para;<br>If these or other exemptions do not cover records whose&para;<br>release would threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the&para;<br>Government may of course seek relief from Congress. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. All we hold today is that Congress has&para;<br>not enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits with&para;<br>holding of “records or information compiled for law en&para;<br>forcement purposes” that, if disclosed, “could reasonably&para;<br>be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any&para;<br>individual.” §552(b)(7)(F). In most cases involving secu&para;<br>rity information, it is not difficult to show that disclosure&para;<br>may “endanger the life or physical safety of any individ&para;<br>ual.” A more difficult question, however, is whether the&para;<br>information is “compiled for law enforcement purposes.”&para;<br>See John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S. 146, 153&para;<br>(1989) (“Before it may invoke [Exemption 7], the Govern&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>ment has the burden of proving the existence of . . . a&para;<br>compilation for such a purpose”). In my view, this phrase&para;<br>reasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official&para;<br>security and crime prevention duties.&para;<br>“Law enforcement purposes.” The ordinary understand&para;<br>ing of law enforcement includes not just the investigation&para;<br>and prosecution of offenses that have already been com&para;<br>mitted, but also proactive steps designed to prevent crimi&para;<br>nal activity and to maintain security. A “law enforcement&para;<br>officer” is defined as one “whose duty it is to preserve the&para;<br>peace,” Black’s Law Dictionary 796 (5th ed. 1979), and&para;<br>fulfilling that duty involves a range of activities. Police on&para;<br>the beat aim to prevent crime from occurring, and they no&para;<br>less carry out “law enforcement purposes” than officers&para;<br>investigating a crime scene. Similarly, a “law-enforcement&para;<br>agency” is charged with “the apprehension of alleged&para;<br>offenders as well as crime detection and prevention.” R. De&para;<br>Sola, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Crime prevention and security measures are critical to&para;<br>effective law enforcement as we know it. There can be no&para;<br>doubt, for example, that the Secret Service acts with a&para;<br>law enforcement purpose when it protects federal officials&para;<br>from attack, even though no investigation may be ongoing.&para;<br>Likewise, steps by law enforcement officers to prevent&para;<br>terrorism surely fulfill “law enforcement purposes.” Par&para;<br>ticularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and na&para;<br>tional security measures have been recognized as vital to&para;<br>effective law enforcement efforts in our Nation. Indeed,&para;<br>“[a]fter the September 11th attacks on America,” the&para;<br>priorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation “shifted&para;<br>dramatically,” and the FBI’s “top priority became the&para;<br>prevention of another terrorist attack.” Hearings before&para;<br>the Subcommittee on Science, the Departments of State,&para;<br>Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies of the&para;<br>House Committee on Appropriations, 109th Cong., 2d&para;<br>Sess., pt. 10, 232 (2006) (testimony of FBI Director Robert&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>S. Mueller III). Today, “[t]he FBI’s number one priority&para;<br>continues to be the prevention of terrorist attacks against&para;<br>the United States.” Hearings before the Senate Commit&para;<br>tee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,&para;<br>111th Cong., 2d Sess, p. ___ (Sept. 22, 2010) (testimony of&para;<br>Mueller). If crime prevention and security measures do&para;<br>not serve “law enforcement purposes,” then those charged&para;<br>with law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of&para;<br>fulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.&para;<br>The context of Exemption 7 confirms that, read natu&para;<br>rally, “law enforcement purposes” involve more than just&para;<br>investigation and prosecution. As Exemption 7’s subpara&para;<br>graphs demonstrate, Congress knew how to refer to these&para;<br>narrower activities. See, e.g., §552(b)(7)(A) (information&para;<br>that “could reasonably be expected to interfere with en&para;<br>forcement proceedings”); §552(b)(7)(E) (information that&para;<br>“would disclose techniques and procedures for law en&para;<br>forcement investigations or prosecutions”).&para;<br>Congress’&para;<br>decision to use different language to trigger Exemption 7&para;<br>confirms that the concept of “law enforcement purposes”&para;<br>sweeps in activities beyond investigation and prosecution.&para;<br>See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9&para;<br>(2004) (applying the “usual rule” that “ when the legis&para;<br>lature uses certain language in one part of the statute&para;<br>and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)).&para;<br>“Compiled for law enforcement purposes.” This Court&para;<br>has given a fairly broad meaning to “compiled” under&para;<br>§552(b)(7). In John Doe Agency, we held that information&para;<br>need not have been originally “compiled for law enforce&para;<br>ment purposes” to satisfy Exemption 7’s threshold re&para;<br>quirement. Rather, “even though . . . documents were put&para;<br>together at an earlier time for a different purpose,” they&para;<br>may fall within Exemption 7 if they are later assembled&para;<br>for law enforcement purposes. 493 U. S., at 154–155. For&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>example, documents originally gathered for routine busi&para;<br>ness purposes may fall within Exemption 7 if they are&para;<br>later compiled for use in a criminal investigation. Simi&para;<br>larly, federal building plans and related information—&para;<br>which may have been compiled originally for architectural&para;<br>planning or internal purposes—may fall within Exemption&para;<br>7 if that information is later compiled and given to law&para;<br>enforcement officers for security purposes.&para;<br>Documents compiled for multiple purposes are not necessarily deprived of Exemption 7’s protection. The text&para;<br>of Exemption 7 does not require that the information&para;<br>be compiled solely for law enforcement purposes. Cf.&para;<br>§552(b)(2) (“related solely to the internal personnel rules&para;<br>and practices of an agency”). Therefore, it may be&para;<br>enough that law enforcement purposes are a significant&para;<br>reason for the compilation.&para;<br>In this case, the Navy has a fair argument that the&para;<br>Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information&para;<br>falls within Exemption 7(F). The ESQD information, the&para;<br>Navy argues, is used “for the purpose of identifying and&para;<br>addressing security issues” and for the “protection of&para;<br>people and property on the base, as well as in [the] nearby&para;<br>community, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that&para;<br>could occur from an accident or breach of security.” Brief&para;<br>for Appellee in No. 07–36056 (CA9), pp. 39–40. If, indeed,&para;<br>the ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to&para;<br>prevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security,&para;<br>there is a reasonable argument that the information has&para;<br>been “compiled for law enforcement purposes.” §552(b)(7).&para;<br>Assuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied, the&para;<br>ESQD information may fall comfortably within Exemption&para;<br>7(F).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

The&para;<br>Circuit Court examined the statute’s language, the legisla&para;<br>tive history, and the precedent. It recognized that the&para;<br>exemption’s words (“related solely to the internal person&para;<br>nel rules and practices of an agency”) could easily be read,&para;<br>as the Court reads them today, to refer only to human&para;<br>resources rules and practices. See 670 F. 2d, at 1056–&para;<br>1057. But it also thought that those words could be read&para;<br>more broadly as referring to internal rules or practices&para;<br>that set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to&para;<br>follow in respect to purely internal matters (as long as the&para;<br>information at issue was “not of legitimate public inter&para;<br>est”). Id., at 1056, 1057.&para;<br>The D. C. Circuit agreed with today’s Court that the&para;<br>Senate Report described the exemption as referring to&para;<br>“ ‘internal personnel’ ” matters, giving as examples “ ‘per&para;<br>sonnel’s use of parking facilities, . . . sick leave, and the&para;<br>like.’ ” Id., at 1058–1059 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8 (1965)). But it also noted that the&para;<br>House Report described the exemption as protecting from&para;<br>disclosure “ ‘[o]perating rules, guidelines, and manuals of&para;<br>procedure for Government investigators or examiners.’ ”&para;<br>670 F. 2d, at 1060 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th&para;<br>Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1966)). “[U]pon reflection,” it&para;<br>thought the views of the two Houses “reconcilable” if one&para;<br>understood both sets of examples as referring to internal&para;<br>staff information (both minor personnel matters and staff&para;<br>instruction matters) that the public had no legitimate&para;<br>interest in learning about. 670 F. 2d, at 1065. And it&para;<br>accepted this view in light of its hesitation to “apply indi&para;<br>vidual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to&para;<br>Congress’ intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforce&para;<br>ment efforts.” Id., at 1066. At the same time it found no&para;<br>other exemption that would protect internal documents in&para;<br>which there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure—&para;<br>a category that includes, say, building plans, safe combi&para;<br>nations, computer passwords, evacuation plans, and the&para;<br>like.&para;<br>After examining in depth the legislative history and&para;<br>relevant precedent, the court adopted an approach based&para;<br>on a prior opinion by Circuit Judge Leventhal, as well as&para;<br>language used by this Court in Department of Air Force v.&para;<br>Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 369 (1976). The D. C. Circuit held&para;<br>that a document fits within the literal language of Exemp&para;<br>tion 2 and is exempt from disclosure if (1) it “meets the&para;<br>test of ‘predominant internality,’ ” i.e., the document is&para;<br>“not of legitimate public interest,” and (2) “disclosure&para;<br>significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or&para;<br>statutes.” Crooker, supra, at 1056, 1074; see also Rose,&para;<br>supra, at 369 (suggesting that Exemption 2 might apply&para;<br>where “disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regu&para;<br>lation”). This test, based upon Congress’ broader FOIA&para;<br>objectives and a “common sense” view of what information&para;<br>Congress did and did not want to make available, Crooker,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>supra, at 1074, takes the “practical approach” that this&para;<br>Court has “consistently . . . taken” when interpreting the&para;<br>FOIA, John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S. 146,&para;<br>157 (1989).&para;<br>I would not underestimate the importance of this “prac&para;<br>tical approach.” It reflects this Court’s longstanding rec&para;<br>ognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Ad&para;<br>ministrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part)&para;<br>with the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the&para;<br>tax code. See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law&para;<br>Treatise §7.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (“Judicial interpreta&para;<br>tion of the malleable language of the APA has produced&para;<br>changes in the rulemaking procedure that could be charac&para;<br>terized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day&para;<br>or a year rather than gradually over a period of decades”);&para;<br>cf. Sunstein &amp; Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions,&para;<br>101 Mich. L. Rev. 885, 917–918, and n. 111 (2003) (observ&para;<br>ing that Congress “appears to rely on courts for long peri&para;<br>ods of time” to give meaning to the APA, which justifies&para;<br>interpreting it less formalistically than statutes like “the&para;<br>Internal Revenue Code”). That in large part is because&para;<br>the FOIA (like the APA but unlike the tax code) must&para;<br>govern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numer&para;<br>ous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, per&para;<br>forming numerous tasks of many different kinds. Too&para;<br>narrow an interpretation, while working well in the case&para;<br>of one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional&para;<br>objectives when applied to another. The D. C. Circuit’s&para;<br>answer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemp&para;<br>tion 2 in light of Congress’ basic effort to achieve a&para;<br>“workable balance between the interests of the public in&para;<br>greater access to information and the needs of the Gov&para;<br>ernment to protect certain kinds of information from&para;<br>disclosure.” John Doe Agency, supra, at 157.

See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat.&para;<br>2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, §§1.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3&para;<br>CFR 298, 299–300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.). Indeed, Con&para;<br>gress recently found:&para;<br>“The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that&para;<br>the over-classification of information interferes with&para;<br>accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing,&para;<br>increases the cost of information security, and need&para;<br>lessly limits stakeholder and public access to informa&para;<br>tion.&para;<br>“Over-classification of information causes consider&para;<br>able confusion regarding what information may be&para;<br>shared with whom, and negatively affects the dis&para;<br>semination of information within the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment and with State, local, and tribal entities, and&para;<br>with the private sector.” Reducing Over-Classification&para;<br>Act, §§2(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648.&para;<br>These legislative findings suggest that it is “over&para;<br>classification,” not Crooker, that poses the more serious&para;<br>threat to the FOIA’s public information objectives.&para;<br>That leaves congressional action. As the Court points&para;<br>out, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it&para;<br>finds in today’s narrowing of Exemption 2. But legislative&para;<br>action takes time; Congress has much to do; and other&para;<br>matters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may war&para;<br>rant higher legislative priority. In my view, it is for the&para;<br>courts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Con&para;<br>gress’ public information objectives into workable agency&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.
