Argued December 8, 2014—Decided March 9, 2015&para;<br>In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation&para;<br>(Amtrak). Congress has given Amtrak priority to use track systems&para;<br>owned by the freight railroads for passenger rail travel, at rates&para;<br>agreed to by the parties or, in case of a dispute, set by the Surface&para;<br>Transportation Board. And in 2008, Congress gave Amtrak and the&para;<br>Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue “metrics and standards” addressing the performance and scheduling of&para;<br>passenger railroad services, see §207(a), 122 Stat. 4907, including&para;<br>Amtrak’s on-time performance and train delays caused by host railroads. Respondent, the Association of American Railroads, sued petitioners—the Department of Transportation, the FRA, and two officials—claiming that the metrics and standards must be invalidated&para;<br>because it is unconstitutional for Congress to allow and direct a private entity like Amtrak to exercise joint authority in their issuance.&para;<br>Its argument rested on the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause&para;<br>and the constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers.&para;<br>The District Court rejected respondent’s claims, but the District of&para;<br>Columbia Circuit reversed as to the separation of powers claim, reasoning in central part that Amtrak is a private corporation and thus&para;<br>cannot constitutionally be granted regulatory power under §207.&para;<br>Held: For purposes of determining the validity of the metrics and&para;<br>standards, Amtrak is a governmental entity. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(a) In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals relied on the&para;<br>statutory command that Amtrak “is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government,” 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§24301(a)(3), and the pronouncement that Amtrak “shall be operated&para;<br>and managed as a for profit corporation,” §24301(a)(2). But congres-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>sional pronouncements are not dispositive of Amtrak’s status as a&para;<br>governmental entity for purposes of separation of powers analysis&para;<br>under the Constitution, and an independent inquiry reveals the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ premise that Amtrak is a private entity was flawed.&para;<br>As Amtrak’s ownership and corporate structure show, the political&para;<br>branches control most of Amtrak’s stock and its Board of Directors,&para;<br>most of whom are appointed by the President, §24302(a)(1), confirmed by the Senate, ibid., and understood by the Executive Branch&para;<br>to be removable by the President at will. The political branches also&para;<br>exercise substantial, statutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak’s&para;<br>priorities and operations. See, e.g., §24315. Also of significance,&para;<br>Amtrak is required by statute to pursue broad public objectives, see,&para;<br>e.g., §§24101(b), 24307(a); certain aspects of Amtrak’s day-to-day operations are mandated by Congress, see, e.g., §§24101(c)(6), 24902(b);&para;<br>and Amtrak has been dependent on federal financial support during&para;<br>every year of its existence. Given the combination of these unique&para;<br>features and Amtrak’s significant ties to the Government, Amtrak is&para;<br>not an autonomous private enterprise. Amtrak was created by the&para;<br>Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the&para;<br>Government’s benefit. Thus, in jointly issuing the metrics and&para;<br>standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a governmental entity for&para;<br>separation of powers purposes. And that exercise of governmental&para;<br>power must be consistent with the Constitution, including those provisions relating to the separation of powers. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(b) Respondent’s reliance on congressional statements about&para;<br>Amtrak’s status is misplaced. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger&para;<br>Corp., 513 U. S. 374, teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak’s status as&para;<br>a federal actor or instrumentality under the Constitution, the practical reality of federal control and supervision prevails over Congress’&para;<br>disclaimer of Amtrak’s governmental status. Treating Amtrak as&para;<br>governmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an unbridled grant&para;<br>of authority to an unaccountable actor, for the political branches created Amtrak, control its Board, define its mission, specify many of its&para;<br>day-to-day operations, have imposed substantial transparency and&para;<br>accountability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes, set and&para;<br>supervise its annual budget. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(c) The Court of Appeals may address in the first instance any&para;<br>properly preserved issues respecting the lawfulness of the metrics&para;<br>and standards that may remain in this case, including questions implicating the Constitution’s structural separation of powers and the&para;<br>Appointments Clause.

Later,&para;<br>Congress granted Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Ad­&para;<br>ministration (FRA) joint authority to issue “metrics and&para;<br>standards” that address the performance and scheduling&para;<br>of passenger railroad services. Alleging that the metrics&para;<br>and standards have substantial and adverse effects upon&para;<br>its members’ freight services, respondent—the Association&para;<br>of American Railroads—filed this suit to challenge their&para;<br>validity. The defendants below, petitioners here, are the&para;<br>Department of Transportation, the FRA, and two individ­&para;<br>uals sued in their official capacity.&para;<br>Respondent alleges the metrics and standards must be&para;<br>invalidated on the ground that Amtrak is a private entity&para;<br>and it was therefore unconstitutional for Congress to allow&para;<br>and direct it to exercise joint authority in their issuance.&para;<br>This argument rests on the Fifth Amendment Due Process&para;<br>Clause and the constitutional provisions regarding separa­&para;<br>tion of powers. The District Court rejected both of re­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>spondent’s claims. The Court of Appeals for the District of&para;<br>Columbia Circuit reversed, finding that, for purposes of&para;<br>this dispute, Amtrak is a private entity and that Congress&para;<br>violated nondelegation principles in its grant of joint&para;<br>authority to Amtrak and the FRA. On that premise the&para;<br>Court of Appeals invalidated the metrics and standards.&para;<br>Having granted the petition for writ of certiorari, 573&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2014), this Court now holds that, for purposes of&para;<br>determining the validity of the metrics and standards,&para;<br>Amtrak is a governmental entity. Although Amtrak’s&para;<br>actions here were governmental, substantial questions&para;<br>respecting the lawfulness of the metrics and standards—&para;<br>including questions implicating the Constitution’s struc­&para;<br>tural separation of powers and the Appointments Clause,&para;<br>U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2—may still remain in the case.&para;<br>As those matters have not yet been passed upon by the&para;<br>Court of Appeals, this case is remanded.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Amtrak is a corporation established and authorized by a&para;<br>detailed federal statute enacted by Congress for no less a&para;<br>purpose than to preserve passenger services and routes on&para;<br>our Nation’s railroads. See Lebron v. National Railroad&para;<br>Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 383–384 (1995);&para;<br>National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. &amp;&para;<br>S. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451, 453–457 (1985); see also Rail&para;<br>Passenger Service Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1328. Congress&para;<br>recognized that Amtrak, of necessity, must rely for most of&para;<br>its operations on track systems owned by the freight rail­&para;<br>roads. So, as a condition of relief from their commoncarrier duties, Congress required freight railroads to allow&para;<br>Amtrak to use their tracks and facilities at rates agreed to&para;<br>by the parties—or in the event of disagreement to be set&para;<br>by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). See 45&para;<br>U. S. C. §§561, 562 (1970 ed.). The Surface Transporta­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion Board (STB) now occupies the dispute-resolution role&para;<br>originally assigned to the ICC. See 49 U. S. C. §24308(a)&para;<br>(2012 ed.). Since 1973, Amtrak has received a statutory&para;<br>preference over freight transportation in using rail lines,&para;<br>junctions, and crossings. See §24308(c).&para;<br>The metrics and standards at issue here are the result&para;<br>of a further and more recent enactment. Concerned by&para;<br>poor service, unreliability, and delays resulting from&para;<br>freight traffic congestion, Congress passed the Passenger&para;<br>Rail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) in 2008.&para;<br>See 122 Stat. 4907. Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides&para;<br>for the creation of the metrics and standards:&para;<br>“Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this&para;<br>Act, the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak&para;<br>shall jointly, in consultation with the Surface Trans­&para;<br>portation Board, rail carriers over whose rail lines&para;<br>Amtrak trains operate, States, Amtrak employees,&para;<br>nonprofit employee organizations representing&para;<br>Amtrak employees, and groups representing Amtrak&para;<br>passengers, as appropriate, develop new or improve&para;<br>existing metrics and minimum standards for measur­&para;<br>ing the performance and service quality of intercity&para;<br>passenger train operations, including cost recovery,&para;<br>on-time performance and minutes of delay, ridership,&para;<br>on-board services, stations, facilities, equipment, and&para;<br>other services.” Id., at 4916.&para;<br>Section 207(d) of the PRIIA further provides:&para;<br>“If the development of the metrics and standards is&para;<br>not completed within the 180-day period required by&para;<br>subsection (a), any party involved in the development&para;<br>of those standards may petition the Surface Transpor­&para;<br>tation Board to appoint an arbitrator to assist the&para;<br>parties in resolving their disputes through binding&para;<br>arbitration.” Id., at 4917.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>The PRIIA specifies that the metrics and standards&para;<br>created under §207(a) are to be used for a variety of pur­&para;<br>poses. Section 207(b) requires the FRA to “publish a&para;<br>quarterly report on the performance and service quality of&para;<br>intercity passenger train operations” addressing the spe­&para;<br>cific elements to be measured by the metrics and stand­&para;<br>ards. Id., at 4916–4917. Section 207(c) provides that, “[t]o&para;<br>the extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carriers&para;<br>shall incorporate the metrics and standards developed&para;<br>under subsection (a) into their access and service agree­&para;<br>ments.” Id., at 4917. And §222(a) obliges Amtrak, within&para;<br>one year after the metrics and standards are established,&para;<br>to “develop and implement a plan to improve on-board&para;<br>service pursuant to the metrics and standards for such&para;<br>service developed under [§207(a)].” Id., at 4932.&para;<br>Under §213(a) of the PRIIA, the metrics and standards&para;<br>also may play a role in prompting investigations by the&para;<br>STB and in subsequent enforcement actions. For instance,&para;<br>“[i]f the on-time performance of any intercity passenger&para;<br>train averages less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive&para;<br>calendar quarters,” the STB may initiate an investigation&para;<br>“to determine whether and to what extent delays . . . are&para;<br>due to causes that could reasonably be addressed . . . by&para;<br>Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators.” Id.,&para;<br>at 4925–4926. While conducting an investigation under&para;<br>§213(a), the STB “has authority to review the accuracy of&para;<br>the train performance data and the extent to which sched­&para;<br>uling and congestion contribute to delays” and shall “ob­&para;<br>tain information from all parties involved and identify&para;<br>reasonable measures and make recommendations to im­&para;<br>prove the service, quality, and on-time performance of the&para;<br>train.” Id., at 4926. Following an investigation, the STB&para;<br>may award damages if it “determines that delays or fail­&para;<br>ures to achieve minimum standards . . . are attributable to&para;<br>a rail carrier’s failure to provide preference to Amtrak over&para;<br>freight transportation.” Ibid. The STB is further empow­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ered to “order the host rail carrier to remit” damages “to&para;<br>Amtrak or to an entity for which Amtrak operates inter­&para;<br>city passenger rail service.” Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In March 2009, Amtrak and the FRA published a notice&para;<br>in the Federal Register inviting comments on a draft&para;<br>version of the metrics and standards. App. 75–76. The&para;<br>final version of the metrics and standards was issued&para;<br>jointly by Amtrak and the FRA in May 2010. Id., at 129–&para;<br>144. The metrics and standards address, among other&para;<br>matters, Amtrak’s financial performance, its scores on&para;<br>consumer satisfaction surveys, and the percentage of&para;<br>passenger-trips to and from underserved communities.&para;<br>Of most importance for this case, the metrics and stand­&para;<br>ards also address Amtrak’s on-time performance and train&para;<br>delays caused by host railroads. The standards associated&para;<br>with the on-time performance metrics require on-time&para;<br>performance by Amtrak trains at least 80% to 95% of the&para;<br>time for each route, depending on the route and year. Id.,&para;<br>at 133–135. With respect to “host-responsible delays”—&para;<br>that is to say, delays attributed to the railroads along&para;<br>which Amtrak trains travel—the metrics and standards&para;<br>provide that “[d]elays must not be more than 900 minutes&para;<br>per 10,000 Train-Miles.” Id., at 138. Amtrak conductors&para;<br>determine responsibility for particular delays. Ibid., n. 23.&para;<br>In the District Court for the District of Columbia, re­&para;<br>spondent alleged injury to its members from being re­&para;<br>quired to modify their rail operations, which mostly in­&para;<br>volve freight traffic, to satisfy the metrics and standards.&para;<br>Respondent claimed that §207 “violates the nondelegation&para;<br>doctrine and the separation of powers principle by placing&para;<br>legislative and rulemaking authority in the hands of a&para;<br>private entity [Amtrak] that participates in the very in­&para;<br>dustry it is supposed to regulate.” Id., at 176–177, Com­&para;<br>plaint ¶51. Respondent also asserted that §207 violates&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause by “[v]esting&para;<br>the coercive power of the government” in Amtrak, an&para;<br>“interested private part[y].” Id., at 177, ¶¶53–54. In its&para;<br>prayer for relief respondent sought, among other reme­&para;<br>dies, a declaration of §207’s unconstitutionality and inval­&para;<br>idation of the metrics and standards. Id., at 177.&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment to peti­&para;<br>tioners on both claims. See 865 F. Supp. 2d 22 (DC 2012).&para;<br>Without deciding whether Amtrak must be deemed pri­&para;<br>vate or governmental, it rejected respondent’s nondelega­&para;<br>tion argument on the ground that the FRA, the STB, and&para;<br>the political branches exercised sufficient control over&para;<br>promulgation and enforcement of the metrics and stand­&para;<br>ards so that §207 is constitutional. See id., at 35.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir­&para;<br>cuit reversed the judgment of the District Court as to the&para;<br>nondelegation and separation of powers claim, reasoning&para;<br>in central part that because “Amtrak is a private corpora­&para;<br>tion with respect to Congress’s power to delegate . . . au­&para;<br>thority,” it cannot constitutionally be granted the “regula­&para;<br>tory power prescribed in §207.” 721 F. 3d 666, 677 (2013).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals did not reach respondent’s due&para;<br>process claim. See ibid.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In holding that Congress may not delegate to Amtrak&para;<br>the joint authority to issue the metrics and standards—&para;<br>authority it described as “regulatory power,” ibid.—the&para;<br>Court of Appeals concluded Amtrak is a private entity for&para;<br>purposes of determining its status when considering the&para;<br>constitutionality of its actions in the instant dispute. That&para;<br>court’s analysis treated as controlling Congress’ statutory&para;<br>command that Amtrak “ ‘is not a department, agency, or&para;<br>instrumentality of the United States Government.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 675 (quoting 49 U. S. C. §24301(a)(3)). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals also relied on Congress’ pronouncement that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Amtrak “ ‘shall be operated and managed as a for-profit&para;<br>corporation.’ ” 721 F. 3d, at 675 (quoting §24301(a)(2)); see&para;<br>also id., at 677 (“Though the federal government’s in­&para;<br>volvement in Amtrak is considerable, Congress has both&para;<br>designated it a private corporation and instructed that it&para;<br>be managed so as to maximize profit.&para;<br>In deciding&para;<br>Amtrak’s status for purposes of congressional delegations,&para;<br>these declarations are dispositive”). Proceeding from this&para;<br>premise, the Court of Appeals concluded it was impermis­&para;<br>sible for Congress to “delegate regulatory authority to a&para;<br>private entity.” Id., at 670; see also ibid. (holding Carter&para;<br>v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 (1936), prohibits any&para;<br>such delegation of authority).&para;<br>That premise, however, was erroneous. Congressional&para;<br>pronouncements, though instructive as to matters within&para;<br>Congress’ authority to address, see, e.g., United States&para;<br>ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F. 3d 488, 491–492&para;<br>(CADC 2004) (Roberts, J.), are not dispositive of Amtrak’s&para;<br>status as a governmental entity for purposes of separation&para;<br>of powers analysis under the Constitution. And an inde­&para;<br>pendent inquiry into Amtrak’s status under the Constitu­&para;<br>tion reveals the Court of Appeals’ premise was flawed.&para;<br>It is appropriate to begin the analysis with Amtrak’s&para;<br>ownership and corporate structure. The Secretary of&para;<br>Transportation holds all of Amtrak’s preferred stock and&para;<br>most of its common stock. Amtrak’s Board of Directors is&para;<br>composed of nine members, one of whom is the Secretary&para;<br>of Transportation.&para;<br>Seven other Board members are&para;<br>appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.&para;<br>49 U. S. C. §24302(a)(1). These eight Board members,&para;<br>in turn, select Amtrak’s president.&para;<br>§24302(a)(1)(B);&para;<br>§24303(a). Amtrak’s Board members are subject to salary&para;<br>limits set by Congress, §24303(b); and the Executive&para;<br>Branch has concluded that all appointed Board members&para;<br>are removable by the President without cause, see 27 Op.&para;<br>Atty. Gen. 163 (2003).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Under further statutory provisions, Amtrak’s Board&para;<br>members must possess certain qualifications. Congress&para;<br>has directed that the President make appointments based&para;<br>on an individual’s prior experience in the transportation&para;<br>industry, §24302(a)(1)(C), and has provided that not more&para;<br>than five of the seven appointed Board members be from&para;<br>the same political party, §24302(a)(3).&para;<br>In selecting&para;<br>Amtrak’s Board members, moreover, the President must&para;<br>consult with leaders of both parties in both Houses of&para;<br>Congress in order to “provide adequate and balanced&para;<br>representation of the major geographic regions of the&para;<br>United States served by Amtrak.” §24302(a)(2).&para;<br>In addition to controlling Amtrak’s stock and Board of&para;<br>Directors the political branches exercise substantial,&para;<br>statutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak’s priorities&para;<br>and operations. Amtrak must submit numerous annual&para;<br>reports to Congress and the President, detailing such&para;<br>information as route-specific ridership and on-time per­&para;<br>formance. §24315. The Freedom of Information Act ap­&para;<br>plies to Amtrak in any year in which it receives a federal&para;<br>subsidy, 5 U. S. C. §552, which thus far has been every&para;<br>year of its existence. Pursuant to its status under the&para;<br>Inspector General Act of 1978 as a “ ‘designated Federal&para;<br>entity,’ ” 5 U. S. C. App. §8G(a)(2), p. 521, Amtrak must&para;<br>maintain an inspector general, much like governmental&para;<br>agencies such as the Federal Communications Commis­&para;<br>sion and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fur­&para;<br>thermore, Congress conducts frequent oversight hearings&para;<br>into Amtrak’s budget, routes, and prices. See, e.g., Hear­&para;<br>ing on Reviewing Alternatives to Amtrak’s Annual Losses&para;<br>in Food and Beverage Service before the Subcommittee on&para;<br>Government Operations of the House Committee on Over­&para;<br>sight and Government Reform, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., 5&para;<br>(2013) (statement of Thomas J. Hall, chief of customer&para;<br>service, Amtrak); Hearing on Amtrak’s Fiscal Year 2014&para;<br>Budget: The Starting Point for Reauthorization before the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Boardman, president and chief execu­&para;<br>tive officer, Amtrak).&para;<br>It is significant that, rather than advancing its own&para;<br>private economic interests, Amtrak is required to pursue&para;<br>numerous, additional goals defined by statute. To take a&para;<br>few examples: Amtrak must “provide efficient and effec­&para;<br>tive intercity passenger rail mobility,” 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§24101(b); “minimize Government subsidies,” §24101(d);&para;<br>provide reduced fares to the disabled and elderly,&para;<br>§24307(a); and ensure mobility in times of national disas­&para;<br>ter, §24101(c)(9).&para;<br>In addition to directing Amtrak to serve these broad&para;<br>public objectives, Congress has mandated certain aspects&para;<br>of Amtrak’s day-to-day operations. Amtrak must main­&para;<br>tain a route between Louisiana and Florida. §24101(c)(6).&para;<br>When making improvements to the Northeast corridor,&para;<br>Amtrak must apply seven considerations in a specified&para;<br>order of priority. §24902(b). And when Amtrak purchases&para;<br>materials worth more than $1 million, these materials&para;<br>must be mined or produced in the United States, or manu­&para;<br>factured substantially from components that are mined,&para;<br>produced, or manufactured in the United States, unless&para;<br>the Secretary of Transportation grants an exemption.&para;<br>§24305(f).&para;<br>Finally, Amtrak is also dependent on federal financial&para;<br>support. In its first 43 years of operation, Amtrak has&para;<br>received more than $41 billion in federal subsidies. In&para;<br>recent years these subsidies have exceeded $1 billion&para;<br>annually. See Brief for Petitioners 5, and n. 2, 46.&para;<br>Given the combination of these unique features and its&para;<br>significant ties to the Government, Amtrak is not an&para;<br>autonomous private enterprise. Among other important&para;<br>considerations, its priorities, operations, and decisions are&para;<br>&para;<br>10 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>extensively supervised and substantially funded by the&para;<br>political branches. A majority of its Board is appointed by&para;<br>the President and confirmed by the Senate and is under­&para;<br>stood by the Executive to be removable by the President at&para;<br>will. Amtrak was created by the Government, is con­&para;<br>trolled by the Government, and operates for the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s benefit. Thus, in its joint issuance of the metrics&para;<br>and standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a govern­&para;<br>mental entity for purposes of the Constitution’s separation&para;<br>of powers provisions. And that exercise of governmental&para;<br>power must be consistent with the design and require­&para;<br>ments of the Constitution, including those provisions&para;<br>relating to the separation of powers.&para;<br>Respondent urges that Amtrak cannot be deemed a&para;<br>governmental entity in this respect. Like the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, it relies principally on the statutory directives&para;<br>that Amtrak “shall be operated and managed as a for&para;<br>profit corporation” and “is not a department, agency, or&para;<br>instrumentality of the United States Government.”&para;<br>§§24301(a)(2)–(3). In light of that statutory language,&para;<br>respondent asserts, Amtrak cannot exercise the joint&para;<br>authority entrusted to it and the FRA by §207(a).&para;<br>On that point this Court’s decision in Lebron v. National&para;<br>Railroad Passenger Corp., 513 U. S. 374 (1995), provides&para;<br>necessary instruction. In Lebron, Amtrak prohibited an&para;<br>artist from installing a politically controversial display in&para;<br>New York City’s Penn Station. The artist sued Amtrak,&para;<br>alleging a violation of his First Amendment rights. In&para;<br>response Amtrak asserted that it was not a governmental&para;<br>entity, explaining that “its charter’s disclaimer of agency&para;<br>status prevent[ed] it from being considered a Government&para;<br>entity.” Id., at 392. The Court rejected this contention,&para;<br>holding “it is not for Congress to make the final determi­&para;<br>nation of Amtrak’s status as a Government entity for&para;<br>purposes of determining the constitutional rights of citi­&para;<br>zens affected by its actions.” Ibid.

Noting that&para;<br>Amtrak “is established and organized under federal law&para;<br>for the very purpose of pursuing federal governmental&para;<br>objectives, under the direction and control of federal gov­&para;<br>ernmental appointees,” id., at 398, and that the Govern­&para;<br>ment exerts its control over Amtrak “not as a creditor but&para;<br>as a policymaker,” the Court held Amtrak “is an agency or&para;<br>instrumentality of the United States for the purpose of&para;<br>individual rights guaranteed against the Government by&para;<br>the Constitution.” Id., at 394, 399.&para;<br>Lebron teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak’s status as&para;<br>a federal actor or instrumentality under the Constitution,&para;<br>the practical reality of federal control and supervision&para;<br>prevails over Congress’ disclaimer of Amtrak’s governmen­&para;<br>tal status. Lebron involved a First Amendment question,&para;<br>while in this case the challenge is to Amtrak’s joint au­&para;<br>thority to issue the metrics and standards. But “[t]he&para;<br>structural principles secured by the separation of powers&para;<br>protect the individual as well.” Bond v. United States, 564&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). Treating Amtrak as&para;<br>governmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an&para;<br>unbridled grant of authority to an unaccountable actor.&para;<br>The political branches created Amtrak, control its Board,&para;<br>define its mission, specify many of its day-to-day opera­&para;<br>tions, have imposed substantial transparency and ac­&para;<br>countability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes,&para;<br>set and supervise its annual budget. Accordingly, the&para;<br>Court holds that Amtrak is a governmental entity, not a&para;<br>private one, for purposes of determining the constitutional&para;<br>issues presented in this case.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Because the Court of Appeals’ decision was based on the&para;<br>flawed premise that Amtrak should be treated as a private&para;<br>&para;<br>12 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

One way the Government can regulate&para;<br>without accountability is by passing off a Government&para;<br>operation as an independent private concern.

National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S.&para;<br>374, 390 (1995).&para;<br>Recognition that Amtrak is part of the Federal Government raises a host of constitutional questions.&para;<br>II&para;<br>I begin with something that may seem mundane on its&para;<br>face but that has a significant relationship to the principle&para;<br>of accountability. Under the Constitution, all officers of&para;<br>the United States must take an oath or affirmation to&para;<br>support the Constitution and must receive a commission.&para;<br>See Art. VI, cl. 3 (“[A]ll executive and judicial Officers . . .&para;<br>shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this&para;<br>Constitution”); Art. II, §3, cl. 6 (The President “shall&para;<br>Commission all the Officers of the United States”). There&para;<br>is good reason to think that those who have not sworn an&para;<br>oath cannot exercise significant authority of the United&para;<br>States. See 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 406, 408 (1874) (“[A] Representative . . . does not become a member of the House until&para;<br>he takes the oath of office”); 15 Op. Atty. Gen. 280, 281&para;<br>(1877) (similar).* And this Court certainly has never&para;<br>treated a commission from the President as a mere wall&para;<br>ornament. See, e.g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,&para;<br>156 (1803); see also id., at 179 (noting the importance of&para;<br>an oath).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* It is noteworthy that the first statute enacted by Congress was “An&para;<br>Act to regulate the Time and Manner of administering certain Oaths.”&para;<br>Act of June 1, 1789, ch. 1, §1, 1 Stat. 23.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>Both the Oath and Commission Clauses confirm an&para;<br>important point: Those who exercise the power of Government are set apart from ordinary citizens. Because&para;<br>they exercise greater power, they are subject to special&para;<br>restraints. There should never be a question whether&para;<br>someone is an officer of the United States because, to be&para;<br>an officer, the person should have sworn an oath and&para;<br>possess a commission.&para;<br>Here, respondent tells the Court that “Amtrak’s board&para;<br>members do not take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, as do Article II officers vested with rulemaking&para;<br>authority.” Brief for Respondent 47. The Government&para;<br>says not a word in response. Perhaps there is an answer.&para;<br>The rule, however, is clear. Because Amtrak is the Government, ante, at 11, those who run it need to satisfy basic&para;<br>constitutional requirements.&para;<br>III&para;<br>I turn next to the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008’s (PRIIA) arbitration provision.&para;<br>122 Stat. 4907. Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides that&para;<br>“the Federal Railroad Administration [(FRA)] and Amtrak&para;<br>shall jointly . . . develop new or improve existing metrics&para;<br>and minimum standards for measuring the performance&para;<br>and service quality of intercity passenger train operations.” Id., at 4916. In addition, §207(c) commands that&para;<br>“[t]o the extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carriers shall incorporate [those] metrics and standards . . .&para;<br>into their access and service agreements.” Under §213(a)&para;<br>of the PRIIA, moreover, “the metrics and standards also&para;<br>may play a role in prompting investigations by the [Surface Transportation Board (STB)] and in subsequent&para;<br>enforcement actions.” Ante, at 4.&para;<br>This scheme is obviously regulatory. Section 207 provides that Amtrak and the FRA “shall jointly” create new&para;<br>standards, cf. e.g., 12 U. S. C. §1831m(g)(4)(B) (“The ap-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>propriate Federal banking agencies shall jointly issue&para;<br>rules of practice to implement this paragraph”), and that&para;<br>Amtrak and private rail carriers “shall incorporate” those&para;<br>standards into their agreements whenever “practicable,”&para;<br>cf. e.g., BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U. S. 84,&para;<br>88 (2006) (characterizing a command to “ ‘audit and reconcile, to the extent practicable, all current and past lease&para;<br>accounts’ ” as creating “duties” for the Secretary of the&para;<br>Interior (quoting 30 U. S. C. §1711(c)(1))). The fact that&para;<br>private rail carriers sometimes may be required by federal&para;<br>law to include the metrics and standards in their contracts&para;<br>by itself makes this a regulatory scheme.&para;<br>“As is often the case in administrative law,” moreover,&para;<br>“the metrics and standards lend definite regulatory force&para;<br>to an otherwise broad statutory mandate.” 721 F. 3d 666,&para;<br>672 (CADC 2013). Here, though the nexus between regulation, statutory mandate, and penalty is not direct (for, as&para;<br>the Government explains, there is a pre-existing requirement that railroads give preference to Amtrak, see Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 31–32 (citing 49 U. S. C. §§24308(c), (f )),&para;<br>the metrics and standards inherently have a “coercive&para;<br>effect,” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 169 (1997), on&para;<br>private conduct. Even the United States concedes, with&para;<br>understatement, that there is “perhaps some incentivizing&para;<br>effect associated with the metrics and standards.” Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 30. Because obedience to the metrics and&para;<br>standards materially reduces the risk of liability, railroads&para;<br>face powerful incentives to obey. See Bennett, supra, at&para;<br>169–171. That is regulatory power.&para;<br>The language from §207 quoted thus far should raise&para;<br>red flags. In one statute, Congress says Amtrak is not an&para;<br>“agency.” 49 U. S. C. §24301(a)(3). But then Congress&para;<br>commands Amtrak to act like an agency, with effects on&para;<br>private rail carriers. No wonder the D. C. Circuit ruled as&para;<br>it did.&para;<br>The oddity continues, however. Section 207(d) of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>PRIIA also provides that if the FRA and Amtrak cannot&para;<br>agree about what the regulatory standards should say,&para;<br>then “any party involved in the development of those&para;<br>standards may petition the Surface Transportation Board&para;<br>to appoint an arbitrator to assist the parties in resolving&para;<br>their disputes through binding arbitration.” 122 Stat.&para;<br>4917. The statute says nothing more about this “binding&para;<br>arbitration,” including who the arbitrator should be.&para;<br>Looking to Congress’ use of the word “arbitrator,” respondent argues that because the arbitrator can be a&para;<br>private person, this provision by itself violates the private nondelegation doctrine. The United States, for its&para;<br>part, urges the Court to read the term “arbitrator” to&para;<br>mean “public arbitrator” in the interests of constitutional&para;<br>avoidance.&para;<br>No one disputes, however, that the arbitration provision&para;<br>is fair game for challenge, even though no arbitration&para;<br>occurred. The obvious purpose of the arbitration provision&para;<br>was to force Amtrak and the FRA to compromise, or else a&para;<br>third party would make the decision for them. The D. C.&para;<br>Circuit is correct that when Congress enacts a compromiseforcing mechanism, it is no good to say that the mechanism cannot be challenged because the parties compromised. See 721 F. 3d, at 674. “[S]tack[ing] the deck&para;<br>in favor of compromise” was the whole point. Ibid.&para;<br>Unsurprisingly, this Court has upheld standing to bring a&para;<br>separation-of-powers challenge in comparable circumstances. See Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority&para;<br>v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S.&para;<br>252, 264–265 (1991) (“[T]his ‘personal injury’ to respondents is ‘fairly traceable’ to the Board of Review’s veto&para;<br>power because knowledge that the master plan was subject&para;<br>to the veto power undoubtedly influenced MWAA’s Board of&para;<br>Directors” (emphasis added)); see also Free Enterprise&para;<br>Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561&para;<br>U. S. 477, 512, n. 12 (2010) (“We cannot assume . . . that&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the Chairman would have made the same appointments&para;<br>acting alone”).&para;<br>As to the merits of this arbitration provision, I agree&para;<br>with the parties: If the arbitrator can be a private person,&para;<br>this law is unconstitutional. Even the United States&para;<br>accepts that Congress “cannot delegate regulatory authority to a private entity.” 721 F. 3d, at 670. Indeed, Congress, vested with enumerated “legislative Powers,” Art. I,&para;<br>§1, cannot delegate its “exclusively legislative” authority&para;<br>at all. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42–43 (1825)&para;<br>(Marshall, C. J.). The Court has invalidated statutes for&para;<br>that very reason. See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.&para;<br>United States; 295 U. S. 495 (1935); Panama Refining Co.&para;<br>v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935); see also Mistretta v. United&para;<br>States, 488 U. S. 361, 373, n. 7 (1989) (citing, inter alia,&para;<br>Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum&para;<br>Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 646 (1980)).&para;<br>The principle that Congress cannot delegate away its&para;<br>vested powers exists to protect liberty. Our Constitution,&para;<br>by careful design, prescribes a process for making law, and&para;<br>within that process there are many accountability checkpoints. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 959 (1983). It&para;<br>would dash the whole scheme if Congress could give its&para;<br>power away to an entity that is not constrained by those&para;<br>checkpoints. The Constitution’s deliberative process was&para;<br>viewed by the Framers as a valuable feature, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Manning, Lawmaking Made Easy, 10 Green Bag 2d 202&para;<br>(2007) (“[B]icameralism and presentment make lawmaking difficult by design” (citing, inter alia, The Federalist&para;<br>No. 62, p. 378 (J. Madison), and No. 63, at 443–444 (A.&para;<br>Hamilton))), not something to be lamented and evaded.&para;<br>Of course, this Court has “ ‘almost never felt qualified to&para;<br>second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of&para;<br>policy judgment that can be left to those executing or&para;<br>applying the law.’ ”&para;<br>Whitman v. American Trucking&para;<br>Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 474–475 (2001) (quoting Mis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>tretta, supra, at 416 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)). But the&para;<br>inherent difficulty of line-drawing is no excuse for not&para;<br>enforcing the Constitution. Rather, the formal reason why&para;<br>the Court does not enforce the nondelegation doctrine with&para;<br>more vigilance is that the other branches of Government&para;<br>have vested powers of their own that can be used in ways&para;<br>that resemble lawmaking. See, e.g., Arlington v. FCC, 569&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___–___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 13–14, n. 4)&para;<br>(explaining that agency rulemakings “are exercises of—&para;<br>indeed, under our constitutional structure they must be&para;<br>exercises of—the ‘executive Power’ ” (quoting Art. II, §1,&para;<br>cl. 1)). Even so, “the citizen confronting thousands of&para;<br>pages of regulations—promulgated by an agency directed&para;<br>by Congress to regulate, say, ‘in the public interest’—can&para;<br>perhaps be excused for thinking that it is the agency really&para;<br>doing the legislating.” 569 U. S., at ___–___ (ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4–5).&para;<br>When it comes to private entities, however, there is not&para;<br>even a fig leaf of constitutional justification. Private&para;<br>entities are not vested with “legislative Powers.” Art. I,&para;<br>§1. Nor are they vested with the “executive Power,”&para;<br>Art. II, §1, cl. 1, which belongs to the President. Indeed, it&para;<br>raises “[d]ifficult and fundamental questions” about “the&para;<br>delegation of Executive power” when Congress authorizes&para;<br>citizen suits. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 197 (2000)&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring). A citizen suit to enforce existing law, however, is nothing compared to delegated power&para;<br>to create new law. By any measure, handing off regulatory power to a private entity is “legislative delegation&para;<br>in its most obnoxious form.” Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298&para;<br>U. S. 238, 311 (1936).&para;<br>For these reasons, it is hard to imagine how delegating&para;<br>“binding” tie-breaking authority to a private arbitrator to&para;<br>resolve a dispute between Amtrak and the FRA could be&para;<br>constitutional. No private arbitrator can promulgate&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>binding metrics and standards for the railroad industry.&para;<br>Thus, if the term “arbitrator” refers to a private arbitrator,&para;<br>or even the possibility of a private arbitrator, the Constitution is violated. See 721 F. 3d, at 674 (“[T]hat the recipients of illicitly delegated authority opted not to make use&para;<br>of it is no antidote. It is Congress’s decision to delegate&para;<br>that is unconstitutional” (citing Whitman, supra, at 473)).&para;<br>As I read the Government’s briefing, it does not dispute&para;<br>any of this (other than my characterization of the PRIIA&para;<br>as regulatory, which it surely is). Rather than trying to&para;<br>defend a private arbitrator, the Government argues that&para;<br>the Court, for reasons of constitutional avoidance, should&para;<br>read the word “arbitrator” to mean “public arbitrator.”&para;<br>The Government’s argument, however, lurches into a new&para;<br>problem: Constitutional avoidance works only if the statute is susceptible to an alternative reading and that such&para;<br>an alternative reading would itself be constitutional.&para;<br>Here, the Government’s argument that the word “arbitrator” does not mean “private arbitrator” is in some tension with the ordinary meaning of the word. Although&para;<br>Government arbitrators are not unheard of, we usually&para;<br>think of arbitration as a form of “private dispute resolution.” See, e.g., Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l&para;<br>Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 685 (2010).&para;<br>Likewise, the appointment of a public arbitrator here&para;<br>would raise serious questions under the Appointments&para;<br>Clause. Unless an “inferior Office[r]” is at issue, Article II&para;<br>of the Constitution demands that the President appoint all&para;<br>“Officers of the United States” with the Senate’s advice&para;<br>and consent. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. This provision ensures that&para;<br>those who exercise the power of the United States are&para;<br>accountable to the President, who himself is accountable&para;<br>to the people. See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at&para;<br>497–498 (citing The Federalist No. 72, p. 487 (J. Cooke ed.&para;<br>1961) (A. Hamilton)). The Court has held that someone&para;<br>“who exercis[es] significant authority pursuant to the laws&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>of the United States” is an “Officer,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424&para;<br>U. S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam), and further that an officer&para;<br>who acts without supervision must be a principal officer,&para;<br>see Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 663 (1997)&para;<br>(“[W]e think it evident that ‘inferior officers’ are officers&para;<br>whose work is directed and supervised at some level by&para;<br>others who were appointed by Presidential nomination&para;<br>with the advice and consent of the Senate”). While some&para;<br>officers may be principal even if they have a supervisor, it&para;<br>is common ground that an officer without a supervisor&para;<br>must be principal. See id., at 667 (Souter, J., concurring&para;<br>in part and concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Here, even under the Government’s public-arbitrator&para;<br>theory, it looks like the arbitrator would be making law&para;<br>without supervision—again, it is “binding arbitration.”&para;<br>Nothing suggests that those words mean anything other&para;<br>than what they say. This means that an arbitrator could&para;<br>set the metrics and standards that “shall” become part of a&para;<br>private railroad’s contracts with Amtrak whenever “practicable.” As to that “binding” decision, who is the supervisor? Inferior officers can do many things, but nothing&para;<br>final should appear in the Federal Register unless a Presidential appointee has at least signed off on it. See 75&para;<br>Fed. Reg. 26839 (2010) (placing the metrics and standards&para;<br>in the Federal Register); Edmond, supra, at 665.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Finally, the Board of Amtrak, and, in particular,&para;<br>Amtrak’s president, also poses difficult constitutional&para;<br>problems. As the Court observes, “Amtrak’s Board of&para;<br>Directors is composed of nine members, one of whom is the&para;<br>Secretary of Transportation. Seven other Board members&para;<br>are appointed by the President and confirmed by the&para;<br>Senate. These eight Board members, in turn, select&para;<br>Amtrak’s president.” Ante, at 7 (citation omitted).

Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 511. As&para;<br>explained above, however, in jointly creating metrics and&para;<br>standards, Amtrak may have to give way to an arbitrator&para;<br>appointed by the STB. Does that mean that Amtrak is&para;<br>“subordinate to” the STB? See also 49 U. S. C. §24308&para;<br>(explaining the STB’s role in disputes between Amtrak&para;<br>and rail carriers).

See,&para;<br>e.g., §§24302(a)(1), 24309(d)(2). The Secretary of Transportation also has authority to exempt Amtrak from certain statutory requirements. See §24305(f)(4).

(The STB, of course,&para;<br>also may be “subordinate to or contained within” the&para;<br>Department of Transportation.

ASSOCIATION OF &para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>follow that there is no overlap between the three categories of governmental power. Certain functions may be&para;<br>performed by two or more branches without either exceeding its enumerated powers under the Constitution. Resolution of claims against the Government is the classic&para;<br>example. At least when Congress waives its sovereign&para;<br>immunity, such claims may be heard by an Article III&para;<br>court, which adjudicates such claims by an exercise of&para;<br>judicial power. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438,&para;<br>452 (1929). But Congress may also provide for an executive agency to adjudicate such claims by an exercise of&para;<br>executive power. See ibid. Or Congress may resolve the&para;<br>claims itself, legislating by special Act. See ibid. The&para;<br>question is whether the particular function requires the&para;<br>exercise of a certain type of power; if it does, then only the&para;<br>branch in which that power is vested can perform it. For&para;<br>example, although this Court has long recognized that it&para;<br>does not necessarily violate the Constitution for Congress&para;<br>to authorize another branch to make a determination that&para;<br>it could make itself, there are certain core functions that&para;<br>require the exercise of legislative power and that only&para;<br>Congress can perform. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1,&para;<br>43 (1825) (distinguishing between those functions Congress must perform itself and those it may leave to another branch).&para;<br>The function at issue here is the formulation of generally applicable rules of private conduct. Under the original&para;<br>understanding of the Constitution, that function requires&para;<br>the exercise of legislative power. By corollary, the discretion inherent in executive power does not comprehend the&para;<br>discretion to formulate generally applicable rules of private conduct.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The idea that the Executive may not formulate generally&para;<br>applicable rules of private conduct emerged even before&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

M.&para;<br>Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 25&para;<br>(2d ed. 1998); 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus&para;<br>Angliae 33 (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne transl. 1968). The&para;<br>principle that a ruler must govern according to law “presupposes at least two distinct operations, the making of&para;<br>law, and putting it into effect.” Vile, supra, at 24. Although it was originally thought “that the rule of law was&para;<br>satisfied if a king made good laws and always acted according to them,” it became increasingly apparent over&para;<br>time that the rule of law demanded that the operations of&para;<br>“making” law and of “putting it into effect” be kept separate. W. Gwyn, The Meaning of the Separation of Powers&para;<br>35 (1965); see also id., at 8–9. But when the King’s power&para;<br>was at its height, it was still accepted that his “principal&para;<br>duty . . . [was], to govern his people according to law.” 1&para;<br>W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 226&para;<br>(1765) (Commentaries) (emphasis added).&para;<br>An early expression of this idea in England is seen in&para;<br>the “constitutional” law concerning crown proclamations.&para;<br>Even before a more formal separation of powers came&para;<br>about during the English Civil War, it was generally&para;<br>thought that the King could not use his proclamation&para;<br>power to alter the rights and duties of his subjects. P.&para;<br>Hamburger, Is Administrative Law Unlawful? 33–34&para;<br>(2014) (Hamburger). This power could be exercised by the&para;<br>King only in conjunction with Parliament and was exercised through statutes. Ibid.; see also M. Hale, The Prerogatives of the King 141, 171–172 (D.

Hamburger&para;<br>35–36. That Act declared that the King’s proclamations&para;<br>would have the force and effect of an Act of Parliament.&para;<br>Id., at 37. But the Act did not permit the King to deprive&para;<br>his subjects of their property, privileges and franchises, or&para;<br>their lives, except as provided by statutory or common law.&para;<br>Id., at 37–38. Nor did the Act permit him to invalidate&para;<br>“ ‘any acts, [or] common laws standing at [that] time in&para;<br>strength and force.’ ” Id., at 38 (quoting An Act that Proclamations Made by the King Shall be Obeyed, 31 Hen.&para;<br>VIII, ch. 8, in Eng. Stat. at Large 263 (1539)).&para;<br>Even this limited delegation of lawmaking power to the&para;<br>King was repudiated by Parliament less than a decade&para;<br>later. Hamburger 38. Reflecting on this period in history,&para;<br>David Hume would observe that, when Parliament “gave&para;<br>to the king’s proclamation the same force as to a statute&para;<br>enacted by parliament,” it “made by one act a total subversion of the English constitution.” 3 D. Hume, The&para;<br>History of England from the Invasion of Julius Ceasar to&para;<br>the Revolution in 1688, p. 266 (1983). By the 17th century,&para;<br>when English scholars and jurists began to articulate a&para;<br>more formal theory of the separation of powers, delegations of the type afforded to King Henry VIII were all but&para;<br>unheard of. Hale, supra, at 172–173.&para;<br>This is not to say that the Crown did not endeavor to&para;<br>exercise the power to make rules governing private conduct. King James I made a famous attempt, see Perez,&para;<br>post, at 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), prompting the influential jurist Chief Justice Edward Coke to write that the&para;<br>King could not “change any part of the common law, nor&para;<br>create any offence by his proclamation, which was not an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Rep. 1352, 1353 (K. B.&para;<br>1611). Coke associated this principle with Chapter 39 of&para;<br>the Magna Carta,1 which he understood to guarantee that&para;<br>no subject would be deprived of a private right—that is, a&para;<br>right of life, liberty, or property—except in accordance&para;<br>with “the law of the land,” which consisted only of statutory and common law. Chapman &amp; McConnell, Due Process&para;<br>as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1688 (2012).&para;<br>When the King attempted to fashion rules of private conduct unilaterally, as he did in the Case of Proclamations,&para;<br>the resulting enforcement action could not be said to&para;<br>accord with “the law of the land.”&para;<br>John Locke echoed this view. “[F]reedom of men under&para;<br>government,” he wrote, “is to have a standing rule to live&para;<br>by, common to every one of that society, and made by the&para;<br>legislative power erected in it . . . and not to be subject to&para;<br>the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of&para;<br>another man.” J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §22, p. 13 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke) (emphasis&para;<br>added). It followed that this freedom required that the&para;<br>power to make the standing rules and the power to enforce&para;<br>them not lie in the same hands. See id., §143, at 72. He&para;<br>further concluded that “[t]he legislative c[ould not] transfer the power of making laws to any other hands: for it&para;<br>being but a delegated power from the people, they who&para;<br>have it [could not] pass it over to others.” Id., §141, at 71.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Chapter 39 of the 1215 Magna Carta declared that “[n]o free man&para;<br>shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any&para;<br>way destroyed, nor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by&para;<br>the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.” A.

See 1 Commentaries 129,&para;<br>134, 137–138. He defined a “law” as a generally applicable&para;<br>“rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a&para;<br>state, commanding what is right and prohibiting what is&para;<br>wrong.” Id., at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>And he defined a tyrannical government as one in which&para;<br>“the right both of making and of enforcing the laws, is&para;<br>vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body&para;<br>of men,” for “wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.” Id., at 142. Thus,&para;<br>although Blackstone viewed Parliament as sovereign and&para;<br>capable of changing the constitution, id., at 156, he&para;<br>thought a delegation of lawmaking power to be “disgrace[ful],” 4 id., at 424; see also Hamburger 39, n. 17.&para;<br>B&para;<br>These principles about the relationship between private&para;<br>rights and governmental power profoundly influenced the&para;<br>men who crafted, debated, and ratified the Constitution.&para;<br>The document itself and the writings surrounding it reflect a conviction that the power to make the law and the&para;<br>power to enforce it must be kept separate, particularly&para;<br>with respect to the regulation of private conduct.&para;<br>The Framers’ dedication to the separation of powers has&para;<br>been well-documented, if only half-heartedly honored.&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>providing them an incentive to legislate in the common interest. &para;<br>&para;<br>During Parliament’s absence, the King might meet certain emergencies &para;<br>&para;<br>through the exercise of prerogative power, but in order to make new, &para;<br>&para;<br>permanent laws, he would be required to call Parliament into session.&para;<br>&para;<br>Locke §§143–144, at 72–73.

Implicitly&para;<br>recognizing that the power to fashion legally binding rules&para;<br>is legislative, we have nevertheless classified rulemaking&para;<br>as executive (or judicial) power when the authorizing&para;<br>statute sets out “an intelligible principle” to guide the&para;<br>rulemaker’s discretion. Ibid. Although the Court may&para;<br>never have intended the boundless standard the “intelligible principle” test has become, it is evident that it does not&para;<br>adequately reinforce the Constitution’s allocation of legislative power. I would return to the original understanding&para;<br>of the federal legislative power and require that the Federal Government create generally applicable rules of&para;<br>private conduct only through the constitutionally prescribed legislative process.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court first announced the intelligible principle test&para;<br>in J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U. S.&para;<br>394 (1928). That case involved a challenge to a tariff&para;<br>assessed on a shipment of barium dioxide. Id., at 400.&para;<br>The rate of the tariff had been set by proclamation of the&para;<br>President, pursuant to the so-called flexible tariff provision of the Tariff Act of 1922. Ibid. That provision authorized the President to increase or decrease a duty set by the&para;<br>statute if he determined that the duty did not “ ‘equalize&para;<br>. . . differences in costs of production [of the item to which&para;<br>the duty applied] in the United States and the principal&para;<br>competing country.’ ” Id., at 401 (quoting 19 U. S. C. §154&para;<br>(1925 ed.)). The importer of the barium dioxide challenged&para;<br>the provision as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the President. 276 U. S., at 404. Agreeing&para;<br>that Congress could not delegate legislative power, the&para;<br>Court nevertheless upheld the Act as constitutional, setting forth the now-famous formulation: “If Congress shall&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

At the time J. W. Hampton was decided, most&para;<br>“delegations” by Congress to the Executive, including the&para;<br>delegation at issue in that case, had taken the form of&para;<br>conditional legislation. See Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. Clark,&para;<br>143 U. S. 649, 683–689 (1892). That form of legislation&para;<br>“makes the suspension of certain provisions and the going&para;<br>into operation of other provisions of an Act of Congress&para;<br>depend upon the action of the President based upon the&para;<br>occurrence of subsequent events, or the ascertainment by&para;<br>him of certain facts, to be made known by his proclamation.” Id., at 683.&para;<br>The practice of conditional legislation dates back at&para;<br>least to the Third Congress in 1794. Id., at 683–689 (collecting statutes). It first came before the Court in Cargo of&para;<br>Brig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382 (1813). There,&para;<br>the Court considered whether a Presidential proclamation&para;<br>could, by declaring that France had ceased to violate the&para;<br>neutral commerce of the United States, reinstate a legislative Act embargoing British goods. Id., at 384, 388. The&para;<br>Court concluded that the proclamation was effective,&para;<br>seeing “no sufficient reaso[n] why the legislature should&para;<br>not exercise its discretion . . . either expressly or conditionally, as their judgment should direct.” Id., at 388.&para;<br>At least as defined by the Court in Field, the practice of&para;<br>conditional legislation does not seem to call on the President to exercise a core function that demands an exercise&para;<br>of legislative power. Congress creates the rule of private&para;<br>conduct, and the President makes the factual determination that causes that rule to go into effect. That type of&para;<br>factual determination seems similar to the type of factual&para;<br>determination on which an enforcement action is condi-&para;<br>&para;<br>14 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tioned: Neither involves an exercise of policy discretion,&para;<br>and both are subject to review by a court.

For example, a 1794 provision&para;<br>entitled “An Act to authorize the President of the United&para;<br>States to lay, regulate and revoke Embargoes,” ch. 41, 1&para;<br>Stat. 372, called on the President to impose an embargo on&para;<br>shipping “whenever, in his opinion, the public safety shall&para;<br>so require . . . .” Ibid. The statutes at issue in Field and&para;<br>J. W. Hampton could similarly be viewed as calling for&para;<br>built-in policy judgments. See Schoenbrod, The Delegation Doctrine: Could The Court Give It Substance? 83&para;<br>Mich. L.

S. exports. 143 U. S., at 692. At least insofar as the terms&para;<br>“unequal” and “unreasonable” did not have settled common-law definitions that could be applied mechanically to the facts, they could be said&para;<br>to call for the President to exercise policy judgment about which duties&para;<br>qualified. See id., at 699 (Lamar, J., dissenting but concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (The statute “does not, as was provided in the statutes of&para;<br>1809 and 1810, entrust the President with the ascertainment of a fact&para;<br>therein defined upon which the law is to go into operation.

He may&para;<br>do so expressly—by setting out regulations specifying&para;<br>what conduct jeopardizes “the public safety,” for example—or implicitly—by drawing distinctions on an ad hoc&para;<br>basis. In either event, he does so based on a policy judgment that is not reviewable by the courts, at least to the&para;<br>extent that the judgment falls within the range of discretion permitted him by the law. See id., at 1255–1260.&para;<br>The existence of these statutes should not be taken to&para;<br>suggest that the Constitution, as originally understood,&para;<br>would permit such delegations. The 1794 embargo statute&para;<br>involved the external relations of the United States, so the&para;<br>determination it authorized the President to make arguably did not involve an exercise of core legislative power.&para;<br>See id., at 1260–1263 (distinguishing the tariff statute at&para;<br>issue in Field and J. W. Hampton on these grounds).5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ble. . . ’ ”). Similarly, the statute at issue in J. W. Hampton called on&para;<br>the President, with the aid of a commission, to determine the “ ‘costs of&para;<br>production’ ” for various goods—a calculation that could entail an&para;<br>exercise of policy judgment about the appropriate wage and profit rates&para;<br>in the relevant industries. 276 U. S., at 401.&para;<br>5 The definition of “law” in England at the time of the ratification did&para;<br>not necessarily include rules—even rules of private conduct—dealing&para;<br>with external relations. For example, while “every Englishman [could]&para;<br>claim a right to abide in his own country so long as he pleases; and not&para;<br>to be driven from it unless by the sentence of the law,” the King “by his&para;<br>royal prerogative, [could] issue out his writ ne exeat regnum, and&para;<br>prohibit any of his subjects from going into foreign parts without&para;<br>licence.” 1 Commentaries 133. It is thus likely the Constitution grants&para;<br>the President a greater measure of discretion in the realm of foreign&para;<br>relations, and the conditional tariff Acts must be understood accordingly. See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 445 (1998) (distinguishing Field on the ground that the statute at issue in Field regulated&para;<br>foreign trade); see also United States v.

And when a statute of its kind—that is, a&para;<br>tariff statute calling for an exercise of policy judgment—&para;<br>finally came before this Court for consideration in Field,&para;<br>the Court appeared to understand the statute as calling&para;<br>for no more than a factual determination. 143 U.

When it came to&para;<br>specifying “the mode of obeying the mandate of a writ,”&para;<br>however, he lamented that “so much of that which may be&para;<br>done by the judiciary, under the authority of the legislature, seems to be blended with that for which the legislature must expressly and directly provide.” Id., at 46.&para;<br>This important passage reflects two premises that Chief&para;<br>Justice Marshall took for granted, but which are disregarded in later decisions relying on this precedent: First,&para;<br>reflected in his discussion of “blending” permissible with&para;<br>impermissible discretion, is the premise that it is not the&para;<br>quantity, but the quality, of the discretion that determines&para;<br>whether an authorization is constitutional. Second, reflected in the contrast Chief Justice Marshall draws between the two types of rules, is the premise that the rules&para;<br>“for which the legislature must expressly and directly&para;<br>provide” are those regulating private conduct rather than&para;<br>those regulating the conduct of court officers.&para;<br>Thus, when Chief Justice Marshall spoke about the&para;<br>“difficulty in discerning the exact limits within which the&para;<br>legislature may avail itself of the agency of its Courts,”&para;<br>ibid., he did not refer to the difficulty in discerning whether&para;<br>the Legislature’s policy guidance is “sufficiently defined,” see Panama Refining, supra, at 429, but instead&para;<br>the difficulty in discerning which rules affected substantive private rights and duties and which did not. We&para;<br>continue to wrestle with this same distinction today in our&para;<br>decisions distinguishing between substantive and procedural rules both in diversity cases and under the Rules&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

Under the guise of the intelligibleprinciple test, the Court has allowed the Executive to go&para;<br>beyond the safe realm of factual investigation to make&para;<br>political judgments about what is “unfair” or “unnecessary.” See, e.g., American Power &amp; Light Co. v.

I am comfortable joining his conclusion that&para;<br>“[t]he injury which may possibly be done by defeating a&para;<br>few good laws will be amply compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones.” Id., at 444.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Although the majority corrects an undoubted error in&para;<br>the framing of the delegation dispute below, it does so&para;<br>without placing that error in the context of the constitutional provisions that govern respondent’s challenge to&para;<br>§207 of the PRIIA.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Until the case arrived in this Court, the parties pro-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ceeded on the assumption that Amtrak is a private entity,&para;<br>albeit one subject to an unusual degree of governmental&para;<br>control.9 The Court of Appeals agreed. 721 F. 3d 666,&para;<br>674–677 (CADC 2013). Because it also concluded that&para;<br>Congress delegated regulatory power to Amtrak, id., at&para;<br>670–674, and because this Court has held that delegations&para;<br>of regulatory power to private parties are impermissible,&para;<br>Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 311 (1936), it held&para;<br>the delegation to be unconstitutional, 721 F. 3d, at 677.&para;<br>Although no provision of the Constitution expressly&para;<br>forbids the exercise of governmental power by a private&para;<br>entity, our so-called “private nondelegation doctrine” flows&para;<br>logically from the three Vesting Clauses. Because a private entity is neither Congress, nor the President or one of&para;<br>his agents, nor the Supreme Court or an inferior court&para;<br>established by Congress, the Vesting Clauses would categorically preclude it from exercising the legislative, executive, or judicial powers of the Federal Government. In&para;<br>short, the “private nondelegation doctrine” is merely one&para;<br>application of the provisions of the Constitution that&para;<br>forbid Congress to allocate power to an ineligible entity,&para;<br>whether governmental or private.&para;<br>For this reason, a conclusion that Amtrak is private—&para;<br>that is, not part of the Government at all—would necessarily mean that it cannot exercise these three categories&para;<br>of governmental power. But the converse is not true: A&para;<br>determination that Amtrak acts as a governmental entity&para;<br>in crafting the metrics and standards says nothing about&para;<br>whether it properly exercises governmental power when it&para;<br>does so. An entity that “was created by the Government,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See Brief for Appellees in No. 12–5204 (DC), pp. 23–29 (defending&para;<br>§207 under cases upholding statutes “assign[ing] an important role to a&para;<br>private party”); id., at 29 (“Amtrak . . . is not a private entity comparable to the [private parties in a relevant precedent].

To&para;<br>its credit, the majority does not hold otherwise. It merely&para;<br>refutes the Court of Appeals’ premise that Amtrak is&para;<br>private. But this answer could be read to suggest, wrongly,&para;<br>that our conclusion about Amtrak’s status has some constitutional significance for “delegation” purposes.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The first step in the Court of Appeals’ analysis on remand should be to classify the power that §207 purports to&para;<br>authorize Amtrak to exercise. The second step should be&para;<br>to determine whether the Constitution’s requirements for&para;<br>the exercise of that power have been satisfied.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Under the original understanding of the legislative and&para;<br>executive power, Amtrak’s role in the creation of metrics&para;<br>and standards requires an exercise of legislative power&para;<br>because it allows Amtrak to decide the applicability of&para;<br>standards that provide content to generally applicable&para;<br>rules of private conduct.&para;<br>Specifically, the metrics and standards alter the railroads’ common-carrier obligations under 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§11101. Host railroads may enter into contracts with&para;<br>Amtrak under §§10908 and 24308 to fulfill their commoncarrier obligations. The metrics and standards shape the&para;<br>types of contracts that satisfy the common-carrier obligations because §207 provides that “Amtrak and its host rail&para;<br>carriers shall” include the metrics and standards in their&para;<br>contracts “[t]o the extent practicable.” PRIIA §207(c), 49&para;<br>U.S.C. §24101 (note) (emphasis added). As JUSTICE ALITO&para;<br>explains, it matters little that the railroads may avoid&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U.

See ante, at 3–4&para;<br>(concurring opinion). And that duty is backed up by the&para;<br>Surface Transportation Board’s coercive power to impose&para;<br>“reasonable terms” on host railroads when they fail to&para;<br>come to an agreement with Amtrak. §24308(a)(2)(A)(ii).&para;<br>Presumably, when it is “practicable” to incorporate the&para;<br>metrics and standards, the Board is better positioned to&para;<br>deem such terms “reasonable” and to force them upon the&para;<br>railroads.&para;<br>Although the Government’s argument to the contrary&para;<br>will presumably change now that the Court has held that&para;<br>Amtrak is a governmental entity, it argued before this&para;<br>Court that Amtrak did not exercise meaningful power&para;<br>because other “governmental entities had sufficient control over the development and adoption of the metrics and&para;<br>standards.” Brief for Petitioners 19–26. For support, the&para;<br>Government relied on two questionable precedents in&para;<br>which this Court held that Congress may grant private&para;<br>actors the power to determine whether a government&para;<br>regulation will go into effect: Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S.&para;<br>1 (1939), and United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative,&para;<br>Inc., 307 U. S. 533 (1939). Those precedents reason that it&para;<br>does not require an exercise of legislative power to decide&para;<br>whether and when legally binding rules of private conduct&para;<br>will go into effect. Currin, supra, at 16–18; Rock Royal,&para;<br>supra, at 574–577. But as I have explained above, to the&para;<br>extent that this decision involves an exercise of policy&para;<br>discretion, it requires an exercise of legislative power.&para;<br>Supra, at 21–22. In any event, these precedents are directly contrary to our more recent holding that a discretionary “veto” necessarily involves an exercise of legislative power. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S., at 952–953; see&para;<br>also id., at 987 (White, J., dissenting) (noting that the&para;<br>&para;<br>26 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF&para;<br>AMERICAN RAILROADS&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>power Congress reserved to itself was virtually identical to&para;<br>the power it conferred on private parties in Currin and&para;<br>Rock Royal). As such, Currin and Rock Royal have been&para;<br>discredited and lack any force as precedents.&para;<br>Section 207 therefore violates the Constitution. Article&para;<br>I, §1, vests the legislative power in Congress, and Amtrak&para;<br>is not Congress. The procedures that §207 sets forth for&para;<br>enacting the metrics and standards also do not comply&para;<br>with bicameralism and presentment. Art. I, §7. For these&para;<br>reasons, the metrics and standards promulgated under&para;<br>this provision are invalid.&para;<br>2&para;<br>I recognize, of course, that the courts below will be&para;<br>bound to apply our “intelligible principle” test. I recognize, too, that that test means so little that the courts are&para;<br>likely to conclude that §207 calls for nothing more than&para;<br>the exercise of executive power. Having made that determination, the Court of Appeals must then determine&para;<br>whether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise&para;<br>executive power.&para;<br>As noted, Article II of the Constitution vests the executive power in a “President of the United States of America.” Art. II, §1. Amtrak, of course, is not the President of&para;<br>the United States, but this fact does not immediately&para;<br>disqualify it from the exercise of executive power. Congress may authorize subordinates of the President to&para;<br>exercise such power, so long as they remain subject to&para;<br>Presidential control.&para;<br>The critical question, then, is whether Amtrak is adequately subject to Presidential control. See Myers, 272&para;<br>U. S., at 117. Our precedents treat appointment and&para;<br>removal powers as the primary devices of executive control, Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 492, and that&para;<br>should be the starting point of the Court of Appeals’ analysis.&para;<br>As JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence demonstrates,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>however, there are other constitutional requirements that&para;<br>the Court of Appeals should also scrutinize in deciding&para;<br>whether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise the&para;<br>power §207 confers on it.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In this case, Congress has permitted a corporation&para;<br>subject only to limited control by the President to create&para;<br>legally binding rules. These rules give content to private&para;<br>railroads’ statutory duty to share their private infrastructure with Amtrak. This arrangement raises serious constitutional questions to which the majority’s holding that&para;<br>Amtrak is a governmental entity is all but a non sequitur.&para;<br>These concerns merit close consideration by the courts&para;<br>below and by this Court if the case reaches us again. We&para;<br>have too long abrogated our duty to enforce the separation&para;<br>of powers required by our Constitution. We have overseen&para;<br>and sanctioned the growth of an administrative system&para;<br>that concentrates the power to make laws and the power&para;<br>to enforce them in the hands of a vast and unaccountable&para;<br>administrative apparatus that finds no comfortable home&para;<br>in our constitutional structure. The end result may be&para;<br>trains that run on time (although I doubt it), but the&para;<br>cost is to our Constitution and the individual liberty it&para;<br>protects.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
