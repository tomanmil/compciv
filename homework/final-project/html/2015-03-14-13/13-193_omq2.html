DRIEHAUS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–193.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 22, 2014—Decided June 16, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Driehaus, a former Congressman, filed a complaint with&para;<br>the Ohio Elections Commission alleging that petitioner Susan B. Anthony List (SBA) violated an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false&para;<br>statements made during the course of a political campaign. Specifically, Driehaus alleged that SBA violated the law when it stated that&para;<br>his vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)&para;<br>was a vote in favor of “taxpayer funded abortion.” After Driehaus&para;<br>lost his re-election bid, the complaint was dismissed, but SBA continued to pursue a separate suit in Federal District Court challenging&para;<br>the law on First Amendment grounds. Petitioner Coalition Opposed&para;<br>to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) also filed a First&para;<br>Amendment challenge to the Ohio law, alleging that it had planned&para;<br>to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained&para;<br>due to the proceedings against SBA. The District Court consolidated&para;<br>the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable, concluding&para;<br>that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes&para;<br>of standing or ripeness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness&para;<br>grounds.&para;<br>Held: Petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article&para;<br>III purposes. Pp. 7–18.&para;<br>(a) To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show, inter&para;<br>alia, an “injury in fact,” which must be “concrete and particularized”&para;<br>and “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’ ” Lujan v.&para;<br>Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560. When challenging a law&para;<br>prior to its enforcement, a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges “an intention to engage in a course of&para;<br>conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>thereunder.” Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>(b) Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement of the&para;<br>Ohio law. Pp. 11–17.&para;<br>(1) Petitioners have alleged “an intention to engage in a course of&para;<br>conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest” by pleading&para;<br>specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.&para;<br>Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(2) Petitioners’ intended future conduct is also “arguably . . . proscribed by [the] statute.” The Ohio false statement statute sweeps&para;<br>broadly, and a panel of the Ohio Elections Commission already found&para;<br>probable cause to believe that SBA violated the law when it made&para;<br>statements similar to those petitioners plan to make in the future.&para;<br>Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, is distinguishable; the threat of&para;<br>prosecution under an electoral leafletting ban in that case was wholly&para;<br>conjectural because the plaintiff’s “sole concern” related to a former&para;<br>Congressman who was unlikely to run for office again. Here, by contrast, petitioners’ speech focuses on the broader issue of support for&para;<br>the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate. Nor does&para;<br>SBA’s insistence that its previous statements were true render its&para;<br>fears of enforcement misplaced. After all, that insistence did not prevent the Commission from finding probable cause for a violation the&para;<br>first time. Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>(3) Finally, the threat of future enforcement is substantial.&para;<br>There is a history of past enforcement against petitioners. Past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat&para;<br>of enforcement is not “ ‘chimerical.’ ” Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.&para;<br>452, 459. The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a&para;<br>complaint may be filed with the State Commission by “any person,”&para;<br>Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3517.153(A), not just a prosecutor or agency.&para;<br>The threatened Commission proceedings are of particular concern&para;<br>because of the burden they impose on electoral speech. Moreover, the&para;<br>target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the&para;<br>crucial days before an election. But this Court need not decide&para;<br>whether the threat of Commission proceedings standing alone is sufficient; here, those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of&para;<br>criminal prosecution. Pp. 14–17.&para;<br>(c) The Sixth Circuit separately considered two other “prudential&para;<br>factors”: “fitness” and “hardship.” This Court need not resolve the&para;<br>continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case because those factors are easily satisfied here.

Ohio Rev.&para;<br>Code Ann. §§3599.40 (Lexis 2013), 3517.992(V) (Lexis&para;<br>Supp. 2014). A second conviction under the false statement statute is a fourth-degree felony that carries a mandatory penalty of disfranchisement. §3599.39.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Petitioner Susan B. Anthony List (SBA) is a “pro-life&para;<br>advocacy organization.” 525 Fed. Appx. 415, 416 (CA6&para;<br>2013). During the 2010 election cycle, SBA publicly criticized various Members of Congress who voted for the&para;<br>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). In&para;<br>particular, it issued a press release announcing its plan to&para;<br>“educat[e] voters that their representative voted for a&para;<br>health care bill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.”&para;<br>App. 49–50. The press release listed then-Congressman&para;<br>Steve Driehaus, a respondent here, who voted for the&para;<br>ACA. SBA also sought to display a billboard in Driehaus’&para;<br>district condemning that vote. The planned billboard&para;<br>would have read: “Shame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus&para;<br>voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.” Id., at 37. The&para;<br>advertising company that owned the billboard space refused to display that message, however, after Driehaus’&para;<br>counsel threatened legal action.&para;<br>On October 4, 2010, Driehaus filed a complaint with the&para;<br>Ohio Elections Commission alleging, as relevant here, that&para;<br>SBA had violated §§3517.21(B)(9) and (10) by falsely&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stating that he had voted for “taxpayer-funded abortion.”2&para;<br>Because Driehaus filed his complaint 29 days before the&para;<br>general election, a Commission panel held an expedited&para;<br>hearing. On October 14, 2010, the panel voted 2 to 1 to&para;<br>find probable cause that a violation had been committed.&para;<br>The full Commission set a hearing date for 10 business&para;<br>days later, and the parties commenced discovery.&para;<br>Driehaus noticed depositions of three SBA employees as&para;<br>well as individuals affiliated with similar advocacy groups.&para;<br>He also issued discovery requests for all evidence that&para;<br>SBA would rely on at the Commission hearing, as well as&para;<br>SBA’s communications with allied organizations, political&para;<br>party committees, and Members of Congress and their&para;<br>staffs.&para;<br>On October 18, 2010—after the panel’s probable-cause&para;<br>determination, but before the scheduled Commission&para;<br>hearing—SBA filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that&para;<br>§§3517.21(B)(9) and (10) violate the First and Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendments of the United States Constitution. The&para;<br>District Court stayed the action under Younger v. Harris,&para;<br>401 U. S. 37 (1971), pending completion of the Commission&para;<br>proceedings. The Sixth Circuit denied SBA’s motion for an&para;<br>injunction pending appeal. Driehaus and SBA eventually&para;<br>agreed to postpone the full Commission hearing until after&para;<br>the election.&para;<br>When Driehaus lost the election in November 2010, he&para;<br>moved to withdraw his complaint against SBA. The&para;<br>Commission granted the motion with SBA’s consent. Once&para;<br>the Commission proceedings were terminated, the District&para;<br>Court lifted the stay and SBA amended its complaint. As&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The dispute about the falsity of SBA’s speech concerns two different&para;<br>provisions of the ACA: (1) the subsidy to assist lower income individuals in paying insurance premiums, and (2) the direct appropriation of&para;<br>federal money for certain health programs such as community health&para;<br>centers.

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant here, the amended complaint alleged that Ohio&para;<br>Rev. Code Ann. §§3517.21(B)(9) and (10) are unconstitutional both facially and as applied. Specifically, the complaint alleged that SBA’s speech about Driehaus had been&para;<br>chilled; that SBA “intends to engage in substantially&para;<br>similar activity in the future”; and that it “face[d] the&para;<br>prospect of its speech and associational rights again being&para;<br>chilled and burdened,” because “[a]ny complainant can&para;<br>hale [it] before the [Commission], forcing it to expend time&para;<br>and resources defending itself.” App. 121–122.&para;<br>The District Court consolidated SBA’s suit with a separate suit brought by petitioner Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST), an advocacy organization that also alleged that the same Ohio false&para;<br>statement provisions are unconstitutional both facially&para;<br>and as applied.3 According to its amended complaint,&para;<br>COAST intended to disseminate a mass e-mail and other&para;<br>materials criticizing Driehaus’ vote for the ACA as a vote&para;<br>“to fund abortions with tax dollars,” but refrained from&para;<br>doing so because of the Commission proceedings against&para;<br>SBA. Id., at 146, 148, 162. COAST further alleged that it&para;<br>“desires to make the same or similar statements about&para;<br>other federal candidates who voted for” the ACA, but that&para;<br>fear “of finding itself subject to the same fate” as SBA has&para;<br>deterred it from doing so. Id., at 149, 157.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Petitioners also challenged a related “disclaimer provision,” App.&para;<br>126–127, 156–157, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3517.20, and COAST&para;<br>raised pre-emption and due process claims. Reply Brief 21, n. 7.&para;<br>Petitioners do not pursue their “disclaimer,” pre-emption, or due&para;<br>process claims before us. Ibid. We also need not address SBA’s separate challenge to the Commission’s investigatory procedures; petitioners have conceded that the procedures claim stands or falls with the&para;<br>substantive prohibition on false statements. Ibid.; see Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>19. Finally, the parties agree that petitioners’ as-applied claims “are&para;<br>better read as facial objections to Ohio’s law.” Reply Brief 19.

ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court dismissed both suits as nonjusticiable, concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds. 525&para;<br>Fed. Appx. 415. The Court of Appeals analyzed three&para;<br>factors to assess whether the case was ripe for review: (1)&para;<br>the likelihood that the alleged harm would come to pass;&para;<br>(2) whether the factual record was sufficiently developed;&para;<br>and (3) the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were&para;<br>denied.&para;<br>Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit concluded&para;<br>that SBA’s prior injuries—the probable-cause determination and the billboard rejection—“do not help it show an&para;<br>imminent threat of future prosecution,” particularly where&para;<br>“the Commission never found that SBA . . . violated Ohio’s&para;<br>false-statement law.” Id., at 420. The court further reasoned that it was speculative whether any person would&para;<br>file a complaint with the Commission in the future, in part&para;<br>because Driehaus took a 2-year assignment with the Peace&para;<br>Corps in Africa after losing the election. Finally, the court&para;<br>noted that SBA has not alleged that “it plans to lie or&para;<br>recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech” in the&para;<br>future, but rather maintains that the statements it intends to make are factually true. Id., at 422.&para;<br>As for the remaining factors, the court concluded that&para;<br>the factual record was insufficiently developed with respect to the content of SBA’s future speech, and that withholding judicial relief would not result in undue hardship&para;<br>because, in the time period leading up to the 2010 election,&para;<br>SBA continued to communicate its message even after&para;<br>Commission proceedings were initiated.

S.&para;<br>Const., Art. III, §2. The doctrine of standing gives meaning to these constitutional limits by “identify[ing] those&para;<br>disputes which are appropriately resolved through the&para;<br>judicial process.”5 Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.&para;<br>555, 560 (1992). “The law of Article III standing, which is&para;<br>built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent&para;<br>the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of&para;<br>the political branches.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___, (2013) (slip op., at 9). To establish Article&para;<br>III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) an “injury in fact,”&para;<br>(2) a sufficient “causal connection between the injury&para;<br>and the conduct complained of,” and (3) a “likel[ihood]”&para;<br>that the injury “will be redressed by a favorable decision.”&para;<br>Lujan, supra, at 560–561 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>This case concerns the injury-in-fact requirement, which&para;<br>helps to ensure that the plaintiff has a “personal stake in&para;<br>the outcome of the controversy.” Warth v. Seldin, 422&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The doctrines of standing and ripeness “originate” from the same&para;<br>Article III limitation. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.

DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 490, 498 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>An injury sufficient to satisfy Article III must be “concrete&para;<br>and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’ ” Lujan, supra, at 560 (some internal question marks omitted). An allegation of future&para;<br>injury may suffice if the threatened injury is “certainly&para;<br>impending,” or there is a “ ‘substantial risk’ that the harm&para;<br>will occur.” Clapper, 568 U. S., at ___, ___, n. 5 (slip op., at&para;<br>10, 15, n. 5) (emphasis deleted and internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>“ ‘ The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the&para;<br>burden of establishing’ standing.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>12). “[E]ach element must be supported in the same way&para;<br>as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence&para;<br>required at the successive stages of the litigation.” Lujan,&para;<br>supra, at 561.&para;<br>B&para;<br>One recurring issue in our cases is determining when&para;<br>the threatened enforcement of a law creates an Article III&para;<br>injury. When an individual is subject to such a threat, an&para;<br>actual arrest, prosecution, or other enforcement action is&para;<br>not a prerequisite to challenging the law. See Steffel v.&para;<br>Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459 (1974) (“[I]t is not necessary&para;<br>that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or&para;<br>prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he&para;<br>claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights”); see&para;<br>also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118,&para;<br>128–129 (2007) (“[W]here threatened action by government&para;<br>is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis&para;<br>for the threat”).&para;<br>Instead, we have permitted preenforcement review under circumstances that render the&para;<br>threatened enforcement sufficiently imminent. Specifically,&para;<br>we have held that a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>requirement where he alleges “an intention to engage in a&para;<br>course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional&para;<br>interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a&para;<br>credible threat of prosecution thereunder.” Babbitt v.&para;<br>Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979). Several of our&para;<br>cases illustrate the circumstances under which plaintiffs&para;<br>may bring a preenforcement challenge consistent with&para;<br>Article III.&para;<br>In Steffel, for example, police officers threatened to&para;<br>arrest petitioner and his companion for distributing handbills protesting the Vietnam War. Petitioner left to avoid&para;<br>arrest; his companion remained and was arrested and&para;<br>charged with criminal trespass. Petitioner sought a declaratory judgment that the trespass statute was unconstitutional as applied to him.&para;<br>We determined that petitioner had alleged a credible&para;<br>threat of enforcement: He had been warned to stop handbilling and threatened with prosecution if he disobeyed; he&para;<br>stated his desire to continue handbilling (an activity he&para;<br>claimed was constitutionally protected); and his companion’s prosecution showed that his “concern with arrest”&para;<br>was not “ ‘ chimerical.’ ” 415 U. S., at 459. Under those&para;<br>circumstances, we said, “it is not necessary that petitioner&para;<br>first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be&para;<br>entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the&para;<br>exercise of his constitutional rights.” Ibid.&para;<br>In Babbitt, we considered a preenforcement challenge to&para;<br>a statute that made it an unfair labor practice to encourage consumers to boycott an “agricultural product . . . by&para;<br>the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.’ ”&para;<br>442 U. S., at 301. The plaintiffs contended that the law&para;<br>“unconstitutionally penalize[d] inaccuracies inadvertently&para;<br>uttered in the course of consumer appeals.” Ibid.&para;<br>Building on Steffel, we explained that a plaintiff could&para;<br>bring a preenforcement suit when he “has alleged an&para;<br>intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably af-&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a&para;<br>statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution&para;<br>thereunder.” Babbit, supra, at 298. We found those circumstances present in Babbitt. In that case, the law “on&para;<br>its face proscribe[d] dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive&para;<br>publicity.” 442 U. S., at 302. The plaintiffs had “actively&para;<br>engaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past” and&para;<br>alleged “an intention to continue” those campaigns in the&para;<br>future. Id., at 301. And although they did not “plan to&para;<br>propagate untruths,” they argued that “ ‘ erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate.’ ” Ibid. We concluded&para;<br>that the plaintiffs’ fear of prosecution was not “imaginary&para;<br>or wholly speculative,” and that their challenge to the&para;<br>consumer publicity provision presented an Article III case&para;<br>or controversy. Id., at 302.&para;<br>Two other cases bear mention. In Virginia v. American&para;<br>Booksellers Assn. Inc., 484 U. S. 383 (1988), we held that&para;<br>booksellers could seek preenforcement review of a law&para;<br>making it a crime to “ ‘knowingly display for commercial&para;<br>purpose’ ” material that is “ ‘harmful to juveniles’ ” as&para;<br>defined by the statute.&para;<br>Id., at 386.&para;<br>At trial, the&para;<br>booksellers introduced 16 books they believed were covered by the statute and testified that costly compliance&para;<br>measures would be necessary to avoid prosecution for&para;<br>displaying such books. Just as in Babbitt and Steffel, we&para;<br>determined that the “pre-enforcement nature” of the suit&para;<br>was not “troubl[ing]” because the plaintiffs had “alleged an&para;<br>actual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced&para;<br>against them.” 484 U. S., at 393.&para;<br>Finally, in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561&para;<br>U. S. 1 (2010), we considered a preenforcement challenge&para;<br>to a law that criminalized “ ‘ knowingly provid[ing] material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.’ ” Id., at 8. The plaintiffs claimed that they had&para;<br>provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations prior to the law’s enactment and would provide&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>similar support in the future. The Government had&para;<br>charged 150 persons with violating the law and declined to&para;<br>disavow prosecution if the plaintiffs resumed their support&para;<br>of the designated organizations. We held that the claims&para;<br>were justiciable: The plaintiffs faced a “ ‘credible threat’ ”&para;<br>of enforcement and “ ‘should not be required to await and&para;<br>undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.’ ” Id., at 15.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Here, SBA and COAST contend that the threat of enforcement of the false statement statute amounts to an&para;<br>Article III injury in fact. We agree: Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement. See Babbitt, 442&para;<br>U. S., at 298.&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, petitioners have alleged “an intention to engage in&para;<br>a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional&para;<br>interest.” Ibid. Both petitioners have pleaded specific&para;<br>statements they intend to make in future election cycles.&para;<br>SBA has already stated that representatives who voted for&para;<br>the ACA supported “taxpayer-funded abortion,” and it has&para;<br>alleged an “inten[t] to engage in substantially similar&para;<br>activity in the future.” App. 49–50, 122. See also Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 15–16 (observing that plaintiffs had previously provided support to groups designated&para;<br>as terrorist organizations and alleged they “would provide&para;<br>similar support [to the same terrorist organizations] again&para;<br>if the statute’s allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted”).&para;<br>COAST has alleged that it previously intended to disseminate materials criticizing a vote for the ACA as a vote “to&para;<br>fund abortions with tax dollars,” and that it “desires to&para;<br>make the same or similar statements about other federal&para;<br>candidates who voted for [the ACA].” App. 146, 149, 162.&para;<br>Because petitioners’ intended future conduct concerns&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>political speech, it is certainly “affected with a constitutional interest.” Babbitt, supra, at 298; see also Monitor&para;<br>Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971) (“[T]he constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political&para;<br>office”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Next, petitioners’ intended future conduct is “arguably. . . proscribed by [the] statute” they wish to challenge.&para;<br>Babbitt, supra, at 298. The Ohio false statement law&para;<br>sweeps broadly, see supra, at 1–2, and n. 1., and covers&para;<br>the subject matter of petitioners’ intended speech. Both&para;<br>SBA and COAST have alleged an intent to “[m]ake”&para;<br>statements “concerning the voting record of a candidate or&para;<br>public official,” §3517.21(B)(9), and to “disseminate”&para;<br>statements “concerning a candidate . . . to promote the&para;<br>election, nomination, or defeat of the candidate,”&para;<br>§3517.21(B)(10). And, a Commission panel here already&para;<br>found probable cause to believe that SBA violated the&para;<br>statute when it stated that Driehaus had supported&para;<br>“taxpayer-funded abortion”—the same sort of statement&para;<br>petitioners plan to disseminate in the future. Under these&para;<br>circumstances, we have no difficulty concluding that petitioners’ intended speech is “arguably proscribed” by the&para;<br>law.&para;<br>Respondents incorrectly rely on Golden v. Zwickler, 394&para;<br>U. S. 103 (1969). In that case, the plaintiff had previously&para;<br>distributed anonymous leaflets criticizing a particular&para;<br>Congressman who had since left office. Id., at 104–106,&para;<br>and n. 2. The Court dismissed the plaintiff ’s challenge to&para;<br>the electoral leafletting ban as nonjusticiable because his&para;<br>“sole concern was literature relating to the Congressman&para;<br>and his record,” and “it was most unlikely that the Congressman would again be a candidate.” Id., at 109 (emphasis added). Under those circumstances, any threat of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>future prosecution was “wholly conjectural.” Ibid.&para;<br>Here, by contrast, petitioners’ speech focuses on the&para;<br>broader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting&para;<br>record of a single candidate. See Reply Brief 4–5 (identifying other elected officials who plan to seek reelection as&para;<br>potential objects of SBA’s criticisms). Because petitioners’&para;<br>alleged future speech is not directed exclusively at&para;<br>Driehaus, it does not matter whether he “may run for&para;<br>office again.” Brief for Respondents 33 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). As long as petitioners continue to engage&para;<br>in comparable electoral speech regarding support for the&para;<br>ACA, that speech will remain arguably proscribed by&para;<br>Ohio’s false statement statute.&para;<br>Respondents, echoing the Sixth Circuit, contend that&para;<br>SBA’s fears of enforcement are misplaced because SBA&para;<br>has not said it “ ‘plans to lie or recklessly disregard the&para;<br>veracity of its speech.’ ” Id., at 15 (quoting 525 Fed. Appx.,&para;<br>at 422). The Sixth Circuit reasoned that because SBA&para;<br>“can only be liable for making a statement ‘knowing’ it is&para;<br>false,” SBA’s insistence that its speech is factually true&para;<br>“makes the possibility of prosecution for uttering such&para;<br>statements exceedingly slim.” Id., at 422.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit misses the point. SBA’s insistence&para;<br>that the allegations in its press release were true did not&para;<br>prevent the Commission panel from finding probable&para;<br>cause to believe that SBA had violated the law the first&para;<br>time around. And, there is every reason to think that&para;<br>similar speech in the future will result in similar proceedings, notwithstanding SBA’s belief in the truth of its allegations. Nothing in this Court’s decisions requires a&para;<br>plaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a&para;<br>law to confess that he will in fact violate that law. See,&para;<br>e.g., Babbitt, 442 U. S., at 301 (case was justiciable even&para;<br>though plaintiffs disavowed any intent to “propagate&para;<br>untruths”).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, the threat of future enforcement of the false&para;<br>statement statute is substantial. Most obviously, there is&para;<br>a history of past enforcement here: SBA was the subject of&para;<br>a complaint in a recent election cycle. We have observed&para;<br>that past enforcement against the same conduct is good&para;<br>evidence that the threat of enforcement is not “ ‘ chimerical.’ ” Steffel, 415 U. S., at 459; cf. Clapper, 568 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 12) (plaintiffs’ theory of standing was&para;<br>“substantially undermine[d]” by their “fail[ure] to offer&para;<br>any evidence that their communications ha[d] been monitored” under the challenged statute). Here, the threat is&para;<br>even more substantial given that the Commission panel&para;<br>actually found probable cause to believe that SBA’s speech&para;<br>violated the false statement statute. Indeed future complainants may well “invoke the prior probable-cause finding to prove that SBA knowingly lied.” Brief for Petitioners 32.&para;<br>The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that&para;<br>authority to file a complaint with the Commission is not&para;<br>limited to a prosecutor or an agency. Instead, the false&para;<br>statement statute allows “any person” with knowledge of&para;<br>the purported violation to file a complaint. §3517.153(A).&para;<br>Because the universe of potential complainants is not&para;<br>restricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit&para;<br>guidelines or ethical obligations, there is a real risk of&para;<br>complaints from, for example, political opponents. See&para;<br>Brief for Michael DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter DeWine Brief); see also id.,&para;<br>at 6 (noting that “the Commission has no system for weeding out frivolous complaints”). And petitioners, who intend to criticize candidates for political office, are easy&para;<br>targets.&para;<br>Finally, Commission proceedings are not a rare occurrence. Petitioners inform us that the Commission “ ‘handles about 20 to 80 false statement complaints per year,’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 46, and respondents do not deny that&para;<br>the Commission frequently fields complaints alleging&para;<br>violations of the false statement statute. Cf. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S., at 16 (noting that there had&para;<br>been numerous prior prosecutions under the challenged&para;<br>statute).&para;<br>Moreover, respondents have not disavowed&para;<br>enforcement if petitioners make similar statements in the&para;<br>future. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30; see also Humanitarian&para;<br>Law Project, supra, at 16 (“The Government has not argued to this Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if&para;<br>they do what they say they wish to do”). In fact, the specter of enforcement is so substantial that the owner of the&para;<br>billboard refused to display SBA’s message after receiving&para;<br>a letter threatening Commission proceedings. On these&para;<br>facts, the prospect of future enforcement is far from “imaginary or speculative.” Babbitt, supra, at 298.&para;<br>We take the threatened Commission proceedings into&para;<br>account because administrative action, like arrest or&para;<br>prosecution, may give rise to harm sufficient to justify preenforcement review. See Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n v.&para;<br>Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S. 619, 625–626,&para;<br>n. 1 (1986) (“If a reasonable threat of prosecution creates a&para;<br>ripe controversy, we fail to see how the actual filing of the&para;<br>administrative action threatening sanctions in this case&para;<br>does not”). The burdens that Commission proceedings can&para;<br>impose on electoral speech are of particular concern here.&para;<br>As the Ohio Attorney General himself notes, the “practical&para;<br>effect” of the Ohio false statement scheme is “to permit a&para;<br>private complainant . . . to gain a campaign advantage&para;<br>without ever having to prove the falsity of a statement.”&para;<br>DeWine Brief 7. “[C]omplainants may time their submissions to achieve maximum disruption of their political&para;<br>opponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on&para;<br>the merits will be deferred until after the relevant election.” Id., at 14–15. Moreover, the target of a false statement complaint may be forced to divert significant time&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days leading up to an election.&para;<br>And where, as here, a Commission panel issues a preelection probable-cause finding, “such a determination itself&para;<br>may be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by the&para;<br>State.” Id., at 13.&para;<br>Although the threat of Commission proceedings is a&para;<br>substantial one, we need not decide whether that threat&para;<br>standing alone gives rise to an Article III injury. The&para;<br>burdensome Commission proceedings here are backed by&para;<br>the additional threat of criminal prosecution. We conclude&para;<br>that the combination of those two threats suffices to create&para;<br>an Article III injury under the circumstances of this case.&para;<br>See Babbitt, supra, at 302, n. 13 (In addition to the threat&para;<br>of criminal sanctions, “the prospect of issuance of an administrative cease-and-desist order or a court-ordered&para;<br>injunction against such prohibited conduct provides substantial additional support for the conclusion that appellees’ challenge . . . is justiciable” (citations omitted)).&para;<br>That conclusion holds true as to both SBA and COAST.&para;<br>Respondents, relying on Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37&para;<br>(1971), appear to suggest that COAST lacks standing&para;<br>because it refrained from actually disseminating its&para;<br>planned speech in order to avoid Commission proceedings&para;<br>of its own. See Brief for Respondents 26–27, 34. In&para;<br>Younger, the plaintiff had been indicted for distributing&para;<br>leaflets in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism&para;<br>Act. When he challenged the constitutionality of the law&para;<br>in federal court, several other plaintiffs intervened, arguing that their own speech was inhibited by Harris’ prosecution. The Court concluded that only the plaintiff had&para;<br>standing because the intervenors “d[id] not claim that&para;<br>they ha[d] ever been threatened with prosecution, that a&para;<br>prosecution [wa]s likely, or even that a prosecution [wa]s&para;<br>remotely possible.” 401 U. S., at 42.&para;<br>That is not this case. Unlike the intervenors in Younger,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>COAST has alleged an intent to engage in the same&para;<br>speech that was the subject of a prior enforcement proceeding. Also unlike the intervenors in Younger, who had&para;<br>never been threatened with prosecution, COAST has been&para;<br>the subject of Commission proceedings in the past. See,&para;<br>e.g., COAST Candidates PAC v. Ohio Elections Comm’n,&para;<br>543 Fed. Appx. 490 (CA6 2013). COAST is far more akin&para;<br>to the plaintiff in Steffel, who was not arrested alongside&para;<br>his handbilling companion but was nevertheless threatened with prosecution for similar speech. 415 U. S., at&para;<br>459.&para;<br>In sum, we find that both SBA and COAST have alleged&para;<br>a credible threat of enforcement.&para;<br>V&para;<br>In concluding that petitioners’ claims were not justiciable, the Sixth Circuit separately considered two other&para;<br>factors: whether the factual record was sufficiently developed, and whether hardship to the parties would result if&para;<br>judicial relief is denied at this stage in the proceedings.&para;<br>525 Fed. Appx., at 419. Respondents contend that these&para;<br>“prudential ripeness” factors confirm that the claims at&para;<br>issue are nonjusticiable. Brief for Respondents 17. But&para;<br>we have already concluded that petitioners have alleged a&para;<br>sufficient Article III injury. To the extent respondents&para;<br>would have us deem petitioners’ claims nonjusticiable “on&para;<br>grounds that are ‘prudential,’ rather than constitutional,”&para;<br>“[t]hat request is in some tension with our recent reaffirmation of the principle that ‘a federal court’s obligation to&para;<br>hear and decide’ cases within its jurisdiction ‘is virtually&para;<br>unflagging.’ ” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2013) (slip op., at 6); some internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>In any event, we need not resolve the continuing vitality&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SUSAN B.

S. 568,&para;<br>581 (1985). And denying prompt judicial review would&para;<br>impose a substantial hardship on petitioners, forcing them&para;<br>to choose between refraining from core political speech on&para;<br>the one hand, or engaging in that speech and risking&para;<br>costly Commission proceedings and criminal prosecution&para;<br>on the other.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Petitioners in this case have demonstrated an injury in&para;<br>fact sufficient for Article III standing.
