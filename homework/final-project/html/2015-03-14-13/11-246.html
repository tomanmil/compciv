S. C. §465. Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish&para;<br>Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recognized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its behalf a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band&para;<br>intended to use “for gaming purposes.” The Secretary took title to&para;<br>the Bradley Property in 2009. Respondent David Patchak, who lives&para;<br>near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserting that §465 did not authorize the Secretary&para;<br>to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. Patchak alleged a variety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of&para;<br>the Band’s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and requested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary’s&para;<br>decision to take title to the land. The Band intervened to defend the&para;<br>Secretary’s decision. The District Court did not reach the merits of&para;<br>Patchak’s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to challenge the Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The D.

PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Patchak’s action. The APA’s general waiver of the Federal Government’s immunity from suit does not apply “if any other statute that&para;<br>grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which&para;<br>is sought” by the plaintiff. 5 U. S. C. §702. The Government and&para;<br>Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute. The&para;<br>QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government’s sovereign immunity from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a “right, title, or interest” in&para;<br>real property that conflicts with a “right, title, or interest” the United&para;<br>States claims. 28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). But it contains an exception for&para;<br>“trust or restricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a).&para;<br>To determine whether the “Indian lands” exception bars Patchak’s&para;<br>suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of&para;<br>grievance Patchak advances. It does not, because Patchak’s action is&para;<br>not a quiet title action. The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional&para;<br>grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of&para;<br>“quiet title” actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in&para;<br>which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else’s claim, but also&para;<br>asserts his own right to disputed property. Although Patchak’s suit&para;<br>contests the Secretary’s title, it does not claim any competing interest&para;<br>in the Bradley Property.&para;<br>Contrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA&para;<br>does not more broadly encompass any “civil action . . . to adjudicate a&para;<br>disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an&para;<br>interest.” §2409(a). Rather, §2409a includes a host of indications&para;<br>that the “civil action” at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit. The&para;<br>Band and Government also contend that the QTA’s specific authorization of adverse claimants’ suits creates the negative implication&para;<br>that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government ownership of land under any statute. That argument is faulty for the&para;<br>reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking&para;<br>different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses. Finally, the Band&para;<br>and Government argue that Patchak’s suit should be treated the&para;<br>same as an adverse claimant’s because both equally implicate the&para;<br>“Indian lands” exception’s policies. That argument must be addressed to Congress. The “Indian lands” exception reflects Congress’s&para;<br>judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits—not all suits challenging the Government’s ownership of property. Pp. 4−14.&para;<br>2. Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the Secretary’s acquisition. A person suing under the APA must assert an interest&para;<br>that is “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute” that he says was violated. Association of Data&para;<br>Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153.&para;<br>The Government and Band claim that Patchak’s economic, environmental, and aesthetic injuries are not within §465’s zone of interests&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchak’s injuries relate to the land’s use as a casino. However, §465 has far more&para;<br>to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.&para;<br>Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA’s land provisions, and functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’ economic development. The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye toward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.&para;<br>The Department’s regulations make this statutory concern with land&para;<br>use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual&para;<br>use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.&para;<br>And because §465 encompasses land’s use, neighbors to the use (like&para;<br>Patchak) are reasonable―indeed, predictable―challengers of the Secretary’s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,&para;<br>or aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit.

The first is whether the United States has sovereign&para;<br>immunity from the suit by virtue of the Quiet Title Act&para;<br>(QTA), 86 Stat. 1176. We think it does not. The second is&para;<br>whether Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the&para;<br>Secretary’s acquisition. We think he does. We therefore&para;<br>hold that Patchak’s suit may proceed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi&para;<br>Indians (Band) is an Indian tribe residing in rural Michigan. Although the Band has a long history, the Department of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in&para;<br>1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998). Two years later,&para;<br>the Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority&para;<br>under §465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland&para;<br>Township, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property. The&para;<br>Band’s application explained that the Band would use the&para;<br>property “for gaming purposes,” with the goal of generating the “revenue necessary to promote tribal economic&para;<br>development, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal government capable of providing its members with sorely needed&para;<br>social and educational programs.” App. 52, 41.1&para;<br>In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the&para;<br>Secretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley&para;<br>Property in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.&para;<br>In accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary&para;<br>committed to wait 30 days before taking action, so that&para;<br>interested parties could seek judicial review. See ibid.; 25&para;<br>CFR §151.12(b) (2011). Within that window, an organization called Michigan Gambling Opposition (or MichGO)&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. §§2701–2721,&para;<br>an Indian tribe may conduct gaming operations on “Indian lands,”&para;<br>§2710, which include lands “held in trust by the United States for the&para;<br>benefit of any Indian tribe,” §2703(4)(B). The application thus requested the Secretary to take the action necessary for the Band to&para;<br>open a casino.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>filed suit alleging that the Secretary’s decision violated&para;<br>environmental and gaming statutes. The Secretary held&para;<br>off taking title to the property while that litigation proceeded. Within the next few years, a District Court and&para;<br>the D. C. Circuit rejected MichGO’s claims. See Michigan&para;<br>Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23, 27–28&para;<br>(CADC 2008); Michigan Gambling Opposition v. Norton,&para;<br>477 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 2007).&para;<br>Shortly after the D. C. Circuit ruled against MichGO&para;<br>(but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak filed this&para;<br>suit under the APA advancing a different legal theory. He&para;<br>asserted that §465 did not authorize the Secretary to&para;<br>acquire property for the Band because it was not a federally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.&para;<br>See App. 37. To establish his standing to bring suit,&para;<br>Patchak contended that he lived “in close proximity to” the&para;<br>Bradley Property and that a casino there would “destroy&para;<br>the lifestyle he has enjoyed” by causing “increased traffic,”&para;<br>“increased crime,” “decreased property values,” “an irreversible change in the rural character of the area,” and&para;<br>“other aesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental problems.” Id., at 30–31. Notably, Patchak did not assert any&para;<br>claim of his own to the Bradley Property. He requested&para;<br>only a declaration that the decision to acquire the land&para;<br>violated the IRA and an injunction to stop the Secretary&para;<br>from accepting title. See id., at 38–39. The Band intervened in the suit to defend the Secretary’s decision.&para;<br>In January 2009, about five months after Patchak filed&para;<br>suit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO’s case, 555&para;<br>U. S. 1137, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property&para;<br>into trust. That action mooted Patchak’s request for an&para;<br>injunction to prevent the acquisition, and all parties agree&para;<br>that the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal&para;<br>Government of title to the land. See Brief for Match-E-BeNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17 (hereinafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11;&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 24–25. The month after the Government took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar,&para;<br>555 U. S. 379, 382 (2009), that §465 authorizes the Secretary to take land into trust only for tribes that were “under federal jurisdiction” in 1934.2&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the suit without considering the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling&para;<br>that Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the&para;<br>Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The court&para;<br>reasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside&para;<br>§465’s “zone of interests.” 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 76 (DC&para;<br>2009). The D. C. Circuit reversed that determination. See&para;<br>632 F. 3d 702, 704–707 (2011). The court also rejected the&para;<br>Secretary’s and the Band’s alternative argument that&para;<br>by virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.&para;<br>See id., at 707–712. The latter ruling conflicted with&para;<br>decisions of three Circuits holding that the United States&para;<br>has immunity from suits like Patchak’s. See Neighbors for&para;<br>Rational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F. 3d 956, 961–&para;<br>962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139, 143–144 (CA9&para;<br>1987) (per curiam); Florida Dept. of Bus. Regulation v.&para;<br>Department of Interior, 768 F. 2d 1248, 1253–1255 (CA11&para;<br>1985). We granted certiorari to review both of the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit’s holdings, 565 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now&para;<br>affirm.&para;<br>II&para;<br>We begin by considering whether the United States’&para;<br>sovereign immunity bars Patchak’s suit under the APA.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The merits of Patchak’s case are not before this Court. We therefore&para;<br>express no view on whether the Band was “under federal jurisdiction”&para;<br>in 1934, as Carcieri requires. Nor do we consider how that question&para;<br>relates to Patchak’s allegation that the Band was not “federally recognized” at the time. Cf. Carcieri, 555 U. S., at 397–399 (BREYER, J.,&para;<br>concurring) (discussing this issue).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>That requires us first to look to the APA itself and then,&para;<br>for reasons we will describe, to the QTA. We conclude that&para;<br>the United States has waived its sovereign immunity from&para;<br>Patchak’s action.&para;<br>The APA generally waives the Federal Government’s&para;<br>immunity from a suit “seeking relief other than money&para;<br>damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer&para;<br>or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official&para;<br>capacity or under color of legal authority.” 5 U. S. C. §702.&para;<br>That waiver would appear to cover Patchak’s suit, which&para;<br>objects to official action of the Secretary and seeks only&para;<br>non-monetary relief. But the APA’s waiver of immunity&para;<br>comes with an important carve-out: The waiver does not&para;<br>apply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit&para;<br>expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought”&para;<br>by the plaintiff. Ibid. That provision prevents plaintiffs&para;<br>from exploiting the APA’s waiver to evade limitations on&para;<br>suit contained in other statutes. The question thus becomes whether another statute bars Patchak’s demand for&para;<br>relief.&para;<br>The Government and Band contend that the QTA does&para;<br>so. The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government’s&para;<br>sovereign immunity from) a particular type of action,&para;<br>known as a quiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting&para;<br>a “right, title, or interest” in real property that conflicts&para;<br>with a “right, title, or interest” the United States claims.&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). The statute, however, contains an&para;<br>exception: The QTA’s authorization of suit “does not apply&para;<br>to trust or restricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a). According&para;<br>to the Government and Band, that limitation on quiet title&para;<br>suits satisfies the APA’s carve-out and so forbids Patchak’s&para;<br>suit. In the Band’s words, the QTA exception retains “the&para;<br>United States’ full immunity from suits seeking to challenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust&para;<br>lands.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.&para;<br>Two hypothetical examples might help to frame consid-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>eration of this argument. First, suppose Patchak had sued&para;<br>under the APA claiming that he owned the Bradley Property and that the Secretary therefore could not take it into&para;<br>trust. The QTA would bar that suit, for reasons just suggested. True, it fits within the APA’s general waiver, but&para;<br>the QTA specifically authorizes quiet title actions (which&para;<br>this hypothetical suit is) except when they involve Indian&para;<br>lands (which this hypothetical suit does). In such a circumstance, a plaintiff cannot use the APA to end-run&para;<br>the QTA’s limitations. “[W]hen Congress has dealt in particularity with a claim and [has] intended a specified&para;<br>remedy”—including its exceptions—to be exclusive, that is the&para;<br>end of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.&para;<br>Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School&para;<br>Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983) (quoting H. R. Rep.&para;<br>No. 94–1656, p. 13 (1976)).&para;<br>But now suppose that Patchak had sued under the APA&para;<br>claiming only that use of the Bradley Property was causing environmental harm, and raising no objection at all to&para;<br>the Secretary’s title. The QTA could not bar that suit&para;<br>because even though involving Indian lands, it asserts&para;<br>a grievance altogether different from the kind the statute&para;<br>concerns. JUSTICE SCALIA, in a former life as Assistant&para;<br>Attorney General, made this precise point in a letter to&para;<br>Congress about the APA’s waiver of immunity (which we&para;<br>hasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative&para;<br>history, but only for its persuasive force). When a statute&para;<br>“is not addressed to the type of grievance which the plaintiff seeks to assert,” then the statute cannot prevent an&para;<br>APA suit. Id., at 28 (May 10, 1976, letter of Assistant&para;<br>Atty. Gen. A. Scalia).3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 According to the dissent, we should look only to the kind of relief a&para;<br>plaintiff seeks, rather than the type of grievance he asserts, in deciding&para;<br>whether another statute bars an APA action. See post, at 6 (opinion of&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J.). But the dissent’s test is inconsistent with the one we&para;<br>adopted in Block, which asked whether Congress had particularly dealt&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We think that principle controls Patchak’s case: The&para;<br>QTA’s “Indian lands” clause does not render the Government immune because the QTA addresses a kind of grievance different from the one Patchak advances. As we will&para;<br>explain, the QTA—whose full name, recall, is the Quiet&para;<br>Title Act—concerns (no great surprise) quiet title actions.&para;<br>And Patchak’s suit is not a quiet title action, because&para;<br>although it contests the Secretary’s title, it does not claim&para;<br>any competing interest in the Bradley Property. That fact&para;<br>makes the QTA’s “Indian lands” limitation simply inapposite to this litigation.&para;<br>In reaching this conclusion, we need look no further&para;<br>than the QTA’s text. From its title to its jurisdictional&para;<br>grant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and&para;<br>repeatedly of “quiet title” actions. See 86 Stat. 1176 (“An&para;<br>Act [t]o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property&para;<br>quiet title actions”); 28 U. S. C. §1346(f) (giving district&para;<br>courts jurisdiction over “civil actions . . . to quiet title” to&para;<br>property in which the United States claims an interest);&para;<br>§1402(d) (setting forth venue for “[a]ny civil action . . . to&para;<br>quiet title” to property in which the United States claims&para;<br>an interest). That term is universally understood to refer&para;<br>to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone&para;<br>else’s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed&para;<br>property. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed.&para;<br>2009) (defining an “action to quiet title” as “[a] proceeding&para;<br>——————&para;<br>with a “claim.” See Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and&para;<br>School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983). And the dissent’s&para;<br>approach has no obvious limits. Suppose, for example, that Congress&para;<br>passed a statute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a&para;<br>procurement contract suit except when the suit involved a “discretionary function” of a federal employee. Cf. 28 U. S. C. §2680(a). Under&para;<br>the dissent’s method, that exception would preclude any APA suit&para;<br>seeking that kind of injunctive relief if it involved a discretionary&para;<br>function, no matter what the nature of the claim. That implausible&para;<br>result demonstrates that limitations on relief cannot sensibly be understood apart from the claims to which they attach.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI &para;<br>&para;<br>INDIANS v.

The QTA directs that the complaint in&para;<br>such an action “shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff&para;<br>claims in the real property.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). If the&para;<br>plaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does&para;<br>not), the statute cannot come into play.4 Further, the QTA&para;<br>provides an option for the United States, if it loses the&para;<br>suit, to pay “just compensation,” rather than return the&para;<br>property, to the “person determined to be entitled” to it.&para;<br>§2409a(b). That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet&para;<br>title action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property,&para;<br>the Government can satisfy his claim through an award of&para;<br>money (while still retaining the land for its operations).&para;<br>But the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The dissent contends that the QTA omits two other historical requirements for quiet title suits.

If&para;<br>the United States loses the suit, an award of just compensation to the rightful owner (whoever and wherever he&para;<br>might be) could do nothing to satisfy Patchak’s claim.5&para;<br>In two prior cases, we likewise described the QTA as&para;<br>addressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an ownership interest in Government-held property. In Block v.&para;<br>North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461&para;<br>U. S. 273 (1982), we considered North Dakota’s claim to&para;<br>land that the United States viewed as its own. We held&para;<br>that the State could not circumvent the QTA’s statute of&para;<br>limitations by invoking other causes of action, among&para;<br>them the APA. See id., at 277–278, 286, n. 22. The crux&para;<br>of our reasoning was that Congress had enacted the QTA&para;<br>to address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had&para;<br>brought. Prior to the QTA, we explained, “citizens asserting title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by&para;<br>the United States” had no recourse; by passing the statute, “Congress sought to rectify this state of affairs.” Id.,&para;<br>at 282. Our decision reflected that legislative purpose:&para;<br>Congress, we held, “intended the QTA to provide the&para;<br>exclusive means by which adverse claimants could challenge the United States’ title to real property.” Id., at 286.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>legislative history, for those who think it useful, further shows&para;<br>that the QTA addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived. The&para;<br>Senate Report states that the QTA aimed to alleviate the “[g]rave&para;<br>inequity” to private parties “excluded, without benefit of a recourse to&para;<br>the courts, from lands they have reason to believe are rightfully theirs.”&para;<br>S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 1. Similarly, the House Report notes that the&para;<br>history of quiet title actions “goes back to the Courts of England,” and&para;<br>provided as examples “a plaintiff whose title to land was continually&para;<br>being subjected to litigation in the law courts,” and “one who feared&para;<br>that an outstanding deed or other interest might cause a claim to be&para;<br>presented in the future.” H. R. Rep. No. 92–1559, p. 6 (1972). From top&para;<br>to bottom, these reports show that Congress thought itself to be authorizing bread-and-butter quiet title actions, in which a plaintiff asserts a&para;<br>right, title, or interest of his own in disputed land.&para;<br>&para;<br>10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We repeat: “adverse claimants,” meaning plaintiffs who&para;<br>themselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the&para;<br>Federal Government’s.&para;<br>Our decision in United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834&para;<br>(1986), is of a piece. There, we considered whether the&para;<br>QTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act,&para;<br>governed the plaintiff’s suit respecting certain allotments&para;<br>of land held by the United States. We thought the QTA&para;<br>the relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted&para;<br>title to the property. Our opinion quoted the plaintiff’s&para;<br>own description of her suit: “At no time in this proceeding&para;<br>did [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title. To the contrary,&para;<br>the claim for title is the essence and bottom line of [the&para;<br>plaintiff’s] case.” Id., at 842 (quoting Brief for Respondent&para;<br>in Mottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p. 3). That fact, we held,&para;<br>brought the suit “within the [QTA’s] scope”: “What [the&para;<br>plaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses&para;<br>valid title.” 476 U. S., at 842. So once again, we construed&para;<br>the QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.&para;<br>But Patchak is not an adverse claimant—and so the&para;<br>QTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign immunity from actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot&para;<br>bar his suit. Patchak does not contend that he owns the&para;<br>Bradley Property, nor does he seek any relief corresponding to such a claim. He wants a court to strip the United&para;<br>States of title to the land, but not on the ground that it is&para;<br>his and not so that he can possess it. Patchak’s lawsuit&para;<br>therefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA action. He is&para;<br>not trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to&para;<br>circumvent the QTA’s “Indian lands” exception. Rather,&para;<br>he is not bringing a QTA suit at all. He asserts merely&para;<br>that the Secretary’s decision to take land into trust violates a federal statute—a garden-variety APA claim. See&para;<br>5 U. S. C. §§706(2)(A), (C) (“The reviewing court shall . . .&para;<br>hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . not in accordance with law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>[or] authority”). Because that is true—because in thenAssistant Attorney General Scalia’s words, the QTA is&para;<br>“not addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak]&para;<br>seeks to assert,” H. R. Rep. 94–1656, at 28—the QTA’s&para;<br>limitation of remedies has no bearing. The APA’s general&para;<br>waiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.&para;<br>The Band and Government, along with the dissent,&para;<br>object to this conclusion on three basic grounds. First,&para;<br>they contend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we&para;<br>have indicated, waiving immunity from suits “to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United&para;<br>States claims an interest.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(a). That&para;<br>language, the argument goes, encompasses all actions&para;<br>contesting the Government’s legal interest in land, regardless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself. See&para;<br>Brief for Federal Petitioners 19–20; Reply Brief for Tribal&para;<br>Petitioner 4–6; post, at 8–9 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).&para;<br>The QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute&para;<br>after all—as to both its waiver and its “corresponding”&para;<br>reservation of immunity from suits involving Indian lands.&para;<br>Reply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 6.&para;<br>But the Band and Government can reach that result&para;<br>only by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.&para;<br>That sentence, more fully quoted, reads: “The United&para;<br>States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action&para;<br>under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real&para;<br>property in which the United States claims an interest.”&para;<br>§2409a(a) (emphasis added). And as we have already&para;<br>noted, “this section”—§2409a—includes a host of indications that the “civil action” at issue is an ordinary quiet&para;<br>title suit: Just recall the section’s title (“Real property&para;<br>quiet title actions”), and its pleading requirements (the&para;<br>plaintiff “shall set forth with particularity the nature of&para;<br>the right, title, or interest which [he] claims”), and its&para;<br>permission to the Government to remedy an infraction by&para;<br>paying “just compensation.” Read with reference to all&para;<br>&para;<br>12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>these provisions (as well as to the QTA’s contemporane&para;<br>ously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver&para;<br>clause rebuts, rather than supports, the Band’s and the&para;<br>Government’s argument: That clause speaks not to any&para;<br>suit in which a plaintiff challenges the Government’s title,&para;<br>but only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an&para;<br>interest in the property.&para;<br>The Band and Government next invoke cases holding&para;<br>that “when a statute provides a detailed mechanism for&para;<br>judicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of&para;<br>particular persons,” the statute may “impliedly preclude[ ]”&para;<br>judicial review “of those issues at the behest of other&para;<br>persons.” Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467&para;<br>U. S. 340, 349 (1984); see United States v. Fausto, 484&para;<br>U. S. 439, 455 (1988). Here, the Band and Government&para;<br>contend, the QTA’s specific authorization of adverse&para;<br>claimants’ suits creates a negative implication: nonadverse claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government ownership of land under any other statute. See&para;<br>Reply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7–10; Reply Brief for&para;<br>Federal Petitioners 7–9; see also post, at 3–4. The QTA,&para;<br>says the Band, thus “preempts [Patchak’s] more general&para;<br>remedies.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>But we think that argument faulty, and the cited cases&para;<br>inapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking different relief, from the&para;<br>kind the QTA addresses. See supra, at 7–10. To see the&para;<br>point, consider a contrasting example. Suppose the QTA&para;<br>authorized suit only by adverse claimants who could&para;<br>assert a property interest of at least a decade’s duration.&para;<br>Then suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that&para;<br>requirement (because, say, his claim to title went back&para;<br>only five years) brought suit under a general statute like&para;<br>the APA. We would surely bar that suit, citing the cases&para;<br>the Government and Band rely on; in our imaginary stat-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ute, Congress delineated the class of persons who could&para;<br>bring a quiet title suit, and that judgment would preclude&para;<br>others from doing so. But here, once again, Patchak is not&para;<br>bringing a quiet title action at all. He is not claiming to&para;<br>own the property, and he is not demanding that the court&para;<br>transfer the property to him. So to succeed in their argument, the Government and Band must go much further&para;<br>than the cited cases: They must say that in authorizing&para;<br>one person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of&para;<br>relief, Congress barred another person from bringing&para;<br>another kind of suit seeking another form of relief. Presumably, that contention would extend only to suits involving similar subject matter—i.e., the Government’s&para;<br>ownership of property. But that commonality is not itself&para;<br>sufficient. We have never held, and see no cause to hold&para;<br>here, that some general similarity of subject matter can&para;<br>alone trigger a remedial statute’s preclusive effect.&para;<br>Last, the Band and Government argue that we should&para;<br>treat Patchak’s suit as we would an adverse claimant’s&para;<br>because they equally implicate the “Indian lands” exception’s policies. According to the Government, allowing&para;<br>challenges to the Secretary’s trust acquisitions would&para;<br>“pose significant barriers to tribes[’] . . . ability to promote&para;<br>investment and economic development on the lands.”&para;<br>Brief for Federal Petitioners 24. That harm is the same&para;<br>whether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.&para;<br>Indeed, the Band argues that the sole difference in this&para;<br>suit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants&para;<br>like Patchak have “the most remote injuries and indirect&para;<br>interests in the land.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see&para;<br>Reply Brief for Federal Petitioners 11–12; see also post, at&para;<br>2, 7, 10.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 In a related vein, the dissent argues that our holding will undermine the QTA’s “Indian lands” exception by allowing adverse claimants&para;<br>to file APA complaints concealing their ownership interests or to recruit&para;<br>&para;<br>14 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>That argument is not without force, but it must be&para;<br>addressed to Congress. In the QTA, Congress made a&para;<br>judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits—to a&para;<br>point, but no further. (The “no further” includes not only&para;<br>the “Indian lands” exception, but one for security interests&para;<br>and water rights, as well as a statute of limitations, a bar&para;<br>on jury trials, jurisdictional and venue constraints, and&para;<br>the just compensation option discussed earlier.) Perhaps&para;<br>Congress would—perhaps Congress should—make the&para;<br>identical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining&para;<br>to the Government’s ownership of land. But that is not&para;<br>our call. The Band assumes that plaintiffs like Patchak&para;<br>have a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title actions, and so should be precluded a fortiori. But all we can&para;<br>say is that Patchak has a different interest. Whether it is&para;<br>lesser, as the Band argues, because not based on property&para;<br>rights; whether it is greater because implicating public&para;<br>interests; or whether it is in the end exactly the same—&para;<br>that is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell Congress.&para;<br>As the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to&para;<br>quiet title actions all other suits challenging the Government’s ownership of property. And so when a plaintiff like&para;<br>Patchak brings a suit like this one, it falls within the&para;<br>APA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We finally consider the Band’s and the Government’s&para;<br>alternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this action because he lacks prudential standing. This Court&para;<br>has long held that a person suing under the APA must&para;<br>satisfy not only Article III’s standing requirements, but an&para;<br>——————&para;<br>third parties to bring suit on their behalf. See post, at 9–11. But we&para;<br>think that concern more imaginary than real. We have trouble conceiving of a plausible APA suit that omits mention of an adverse claimant’s&para;<br>interest in property yet somehow leads to relief recognizing that very&para;<br>interest.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Association of Data&para;<br>Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S.&para;<br>150, 153 (1970). Here, Patchak asserts that in taking&para;<br>title to the Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her&para;<br>authority under §465, which authorizes the acquisition of&para;<br>property “for the purpose of providing land for Indians.”&para;<br>And he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him&para;<br>economic, environmental, and aesthetic harm as a nearby&para;<br>property owner. See supra, at 3. The Government and&para;<br>Band argue that the relationship between §465 and&para;<br>Patchak’s asserted interests is insufficient. That is so,&para;<br>they contend, because the statute focuses on land acquisition, whereas Patchak’s interests relate to the land’s use&para;<br>as a casino. See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (“The Secretary’s decision to put land into trust does not turn on any&para;<br>particular use of the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . . [and]&para;<br>thus has no impact on [Patchak] or his asserted interests”); Brief for Federal Petitioners 34 (“[L]and may be&para;<br>taken into trust for a host of purposes that have nothing at all to do with gaming”). We find this argument&para;<br>unpersuasive.&para;<br>The prudential standing test Patchak must meet “is not&para;<br>meant to be especially demanding.” Clarke v. Securities&para;<br>Industry Assn., 479 U. S. 388, 399 (1987). We apply the&para;<br>test in keeping with Congress’s “evident intent” when&para;<br>enacting the APA “to make agency action presumptively&para;<br>reviewable.” Ibid. We do not require any “indication of&para;<br>congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.”&para;<br>Id., at 399–400.7 And we have always conspicuously&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 For this reason, the Band’s statement that Patchak is “not an Indian&para;<br>or tribal official seeking land” and does not “claim an interest in advancing tribal development,” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 42, is beside the&para;<br>point. The question is not whether §465 seeks to benefit Patchak;&para;<br>everyone can agree it does not. The question is instead, as the Band’s&para;<br>&para;<br>16 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>included the word “arguably” in the test to indicate that&para;<br>the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff. The test&para;<br>forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s “interests are so&para;<br>marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes&para;<br>implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.” Id.,&para;<br>at 399.&para;<br>Patchak’s suit satisfies that standard, because §465 has&para;<br>far more to do with land use than the Government and&para;<br>Band acknowledge. Start with what we and others have&para;<br>said about §465’s context and purpose. As the leading&para;<br>treatise on federal Indian law notes, §465 is “the capstone”&para;<br>of the IRA’s land provisions. F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law §15.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen). And those provisions play a key role in the&para;<br>IRA’s overall effort “to rehabilitate the Indian’s economic&para;<br>life,” Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 152&para;<br>(1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Land forms&para;<br>the basis” of that “economic life,” providing the foundation&para;<br>for “tourism, manufacturing, mining, logging, . . . and&para;<br>gaming.” Cohen §15.01, at 965. Section 465 thus functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’&para;<br>economic development. As the D. C. Circuit explained in&para;<br>the MichGO litigation, the section “provid[es] lands sufficient to enable Indians to achieve self-support.” Michigan&para;<br>Gambling, 525 F. 3d, at 31 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974)&para;<br>(noting the IRA’s economic aspect). So when the Secretary&para;<br>obtains land for Indians under §465, she does not do so in&para;<br>a vacuum. Rather, she takes title to properties with at&para;<br>least one eye directed toward how tribes will use those&para;<br>——————&para;<br>and the Government’s main argument acknowledges, whether issues of&para;<br>land use (arguably) fall within §465’s scope—because if they do, a&para;<br>neighbor complaining about such use may sue to enforce the statute’s&para;<br>limits. See infra this page and 16–17.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lands to support economic development.&para;<br>The Department’s regulations make this statutory&para;<br>concern with land use crystal clear. Those regulations&para;<br>permit the Secretary to acquire land in trust under §465&para;<br>if the “land is necessary to facilitate tribal selfdetermination, economic development, or Indian housing.”&para;<br>25 CFR §151.3(a)(3). And they require the Secretary to&para;<br>consider, in evaluating any acquisition, both “[t]he purposes for which the land will be used” and the “potential conflicts of land use which may arise.” §§151.10(c),&para;<br>151.10(f); see §151.11(a). For “off-reservation acquisitions”&para;<br>made “for business purposes”—like the Bradley Property—&para;<br>the regulations further provide that the tribe must&para;<br>“provide a plan which specifies the anticipated economic&para;<br>benefits associated with the proposed use.” §151.11(c).&para;<br>DOI’s regulations thus show that the statute’s implementation centrally depends on the projected use of a given&para;<br>property.&para;<br>The Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property is&para;<br>a case in point. The Band’s application to the Secretary&para;<br>highlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.&para;<br>See App. 41 (“[T]rust status for this Property is requested&para;<br>in order for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans&para;<br>to conduct gaming”); id., at 61–62 (“The Tribe intends to&para;<br>. . . renovate the existing . . . building into a gaming facility . . . . to offer Class II and/or Class III gaming”). Similarly, DOI’s notice of intent to take the land into trust&para;<br>announced that the land would “be used for the purpose of&para;<br>construction and operation of a gaming facility,” which the&para;<br>Department had already determined would meet the&para;<br>Indian Gaming Regulatory Act’s requirements. 70 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 25596; 25 U. S. C. §§2701–2721. So from start to&para;<br>finish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Property under §465 involved questions of land use.&para;<br>And because §465’s implementation encompasses these&para;<br>issues, the interests Patchak raises—at least arguably—&para;<br>&para;<br>18 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v.

The difference here, as the Government and Band&para;<br>point out, is that §465 specifically addresses only land acquisition. But for the reasons already given, decisions&para;<br>under the statute are closely enough and often enough&para;<br>entwined with considerations of land use to make that&para;<br>difference immaterial.

S.,&para;<br>at 283 (internal quotation marks omitted). By exempting&para;<br>Indian lands, Congress ensured that the Government’s&para;<br>“solemn obligations” to tribes would not be “abridg[ed] . . .&para;<br>without the consent of the Indians.” S. Rep. No. 92–575,&para;<br>at 4.&para;<br>Second, the Act preserves the United States’ power to&para;<br>retain possession or control of any disputed property, even&para;<br>if a court determines that the Government’s property&para;<br>claim is invalid. To that end, §2409a(b) “allow[s] the&para;<br>United States the option of paying money damages instead of surrendering the property if it lost a case on the&para;<br>merits.” Block, 461 U. S., at 283. This provision was&para;<br>considered essential to addressing the Government’s&para;<br>“main objection in the past to waiving sovereign immunity” where federal land was concerned: that an adverse&para;<br>judgment “would make possible decrees ousting the United&para;<br>States from possession and thus interfer[e] with operations of the Government.” S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 5–6.&para;<br>Section 2409a(b) “eliminate[d] cause for such apprehension,” by ensuring that—even under the QTA—the United&para;<br>States could not be stripped of its possession or control of&para;<br>property without its consent. Id., at 6.&para;<br>Finally, the Act limits the class of individuals permitted&para;<br>to sue the Government to those claiming a “right, title, or&para;<br>interest” in disputed property. §2409a(d). As we have&para;<br>explained, Congress’ decision to restrict the class entitled&para;<br>to relief indicates that Congress precluded relief for the&para;<br>remainder. See, e.g., Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349 (1984) (“[W]hen a statute provides&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>a detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of particular persons, judicial&para;<br>review of those issues at the behest of other persons may&para;<br>be found to be impliedly precluded”). That inference is&para;<br>especially strong here, because the QTA was “enacted&para;<br>against the backdrop of sovereign immunity.” S. Rep. No.&para;<br>94–996, p. 27 (1976). Section 2409a(d) thus indicates&para;<br>that Congress concluded that those without any “right, title,&para;<br>or interest” in a given property did not have an interest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government’s&para;<br>sovereign immunity.&para;<br>Congress considered these conditions indispensible to its&para;<br>immunity waiver.1 “[W]hen Congress attaches conditions&para;<br>to legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United&para;<br>States, those conditions must be strictly observed, and&para;<br>exceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.” Block,&para;<br>461 U. S., at 287. Congress and the Executive Branch&para;<br>intended the scheme to be the exclusive procedure for&para;<br>resolving property title disputes involving the United&para;<br>States. See id., at 285 (describing Act as a “careful and&para;<br>thorough remedial scheme”); S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 4&para;<br>(§2409a “provides a complete, thoughtful approach to the&para;<br>problem of disputed titles to federally claimed land” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>For that reason, we held that Congress did not intend to&para;<br>create a “new supplemental remedy” when it enacted the&para;<br>APA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity. Block, 461&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 As we explained in Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and&para;<br>School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 282–283 (1983), Congress’ initial proposal&para;<br>lacked such provisions. The Executive Branch, however, strongly&para;<br>opposed the original bill, explaining that it was “too broad and sweeping in scope and lacking adequate safeguards to protect the public&para;<br>interest.” Dispute of Titles on Public Lands: Hearings on S. 216 et al.&para;<br>before the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Senate Committee on&para;<br>Interior and Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., 21 (1971). Congress&para;<br>ultimately agreed, largely adopting the Executive’s substitute bill. See&para;<br>Block, 461 U. S., at 283–284.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 833 (1976)). If a plaintiff&para;<br>could oust the Government of title to land by means of an&para;<br>APA action, “all of the carefully crafted provisions of the&para;<br>QTA deemed necessary for the protection of the national&para;<br>public interest could be averted,” and the “Indian lands&para;<br>exception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.” Block,&para;<br>461 U. S., at 284–285. We therefore had little difficulty&para;<br>concluding that Congress did not intend to render the&para;<br>QTA’s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the&para;<br>right to dispute the Government’s title to any lands by&para;<br>way of an APA action—and to empower any such plaintiff&para;<br>to “disposses[s] [the United States] of the disputed property without being afforded the option of paying damages.”&para;<br>Id., at 285.&para;<br>It is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the conditions to sue under the QTA. He seeks to challenge the&para;<br>Government’s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he&para;<br>seeks to force the Government to relinquish possession&para;<br>and title outright, leaving it no alternative to pay compensation (strike two); and he does not claim any personal&para;<br>right, title, or interest in the property (strike three). Thus,&para;<br>by its express terms, the QTA forbids the relief Patchak&para;<br>seeks. Compare ante, at 3 (“[A]ll parties agree that the&para;<br>suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Government of title to the [Indian trust] land”), with United&para;<br>States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834, 842 (1986) (Section&para;<br>2409a(a)’s Indian lands exclusion “operates solely to retain&para;<br>the United States’ immunity from suit by third parties&para;<br>challenging the United States’ title to land held in trust&para;<br>for Indians”). Consequently, Patchak may not avoid the&para;<br>QTA’s constraints by suing under the APA, a statute&para;<br>enacted only four years later. See 5 U. S. C. §702 (render-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v.

It primarily argues that the careful limitations Congress imposed upon the QTA’s waiver of sovereign immunity are “simply inapposite” to actions in which the&para;<br>plaintiff advances a different “grievance” to that underlying a QTA suit, i.e., cases in which a plaintiff seeks to&para;<br>“strip the United States of title to the land . . . not on the&para;<br>ground that it is his,” but rather because “the Secretary’s&para;<br>decision to take land into trust violates a federal statute.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7, 10. This analysis is unmoored from the text of&para;<br>the APA.&para;<br>Section 702 focuses not on a plaintiff ’s motivation for&para;<br>suit, nor the arguments on which he grounds his case, but&para;<br>only on whether another statute expressly or impliedly&para;<br>forbids the relief he seeks. The relief Patchak admittedly&para;<br>seeks—to oust the Government of title to Indian trust&para;<br>land—is identical to that forbidden by the QTA. Conversely, the Court’s hypothetical suit, alleging that the&para;<br>Bradley Property was causing environmental harm, would&para;<br>not be barred by the QTA. See ante, at 6. That is not&para;<br>because such an action asserts a different “grievance,” but&para;<br>because it seeks different relief—abatement of a nuisance&para;<br>rather than the extinguishment of title.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The majority claims, ante, at 7, n. 3, that this test has “no obvious&para;<br>limits,” but it merely applies the text of §702 (which speaks of “relief,”&para;<br>not “grievances”). In any event, the majority’s hypothetical, ibid.,&para;<br>compares apples to oranges. I do not contend that the APA bars all&para;<br>injunctive relief involving Indian lands, simply other suits—like this&para;<br>one—that seek “to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which&para;<br>the United States claims an interest.” 28 U.

S., at 281. Cf. ante, at 10 (“[Patchak] asserts merely that the Secretary’s decision to take land into&para;<br>trust violates a federal statute”). The relief requested was&para;<br>also identical to that sought here: injunctive relief directing the United States to “ ‘cease and desist from . . . exercising privileges of ownership’ ” over the land in question.&para;<br>461 U.

As&para;<br>the majority itself acknowledges, the harm to the United&para;<br>States and tribes when a plaintiff sues to extinguish the&para;<br>Government’s title to Indian trust land is identical&para;<br>“whether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.”&para;<br>Ante, at 12.

C.&para;<br>§706(2)(C) (“The reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside&para;<br>agency action . . . found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction,&para;<br>authority, or limitations”).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v.

This is highly implausible. Unsurprisingly, the&para;<br>majority does not even attempt to explain why Congress&para;<br>would have intended this counterintuitive result.&para;<br>It is no answer to say that the QTA reaches no further&para;<br>than an “ordinary quiet title suit.” Ante, at 11. The action&para;<br>permitted by §2409a is not an ordinary quiet title suit. At&para;<br>common law, equity courts “permit[ted] a bill to quiet title&para;<br>to be filed only by a party in possession [of land] against a&para;<br>defendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to establish a legal title by repeated actions of ejectment.” Wehrman v. Conklin, 155 U. S. 314, 321–322 (1894) (emphasis&para;<br>added). Section 2409a is broader, requiring neither prerequisite. Moreover, as the majority tells us, see ante,&para;<br>at 7, an act to quiet title is “universally understood” as a&para;<br>proceeding “to establish a plaintiff ’s title to land.” Black’s&para;<br>Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). But&para;<br>§2409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither&para;<br>the Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land&para;<br>at issue.

See S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 5. Notwithstanding its colloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly&para;<br>allows suit in circumstances well beyond “bread-andbutter quiet title actions,” ante, at 3, n. 3.5&para;<br>The majority attempts to bolster its reading by emphasizing an unexpected source within §2409a: the clause&para;<br>specifying that the United States may be sued “ ‘in a civil&para;<br>action under this section.’ ” Ante, at 11. The majority&para;<br>understands this clause to narrow the QTA’s scope (and&para;<br>its limitations on the Government’s immunity waiver) to&para;<br>quiet title claims only. But “this section” speaks broadly&para;<br>to civil actions “to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest.”&para;<br>§2409a. Moreover, this clause is read most straightforwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose: simply to&para;<br>state that a claimant can file “a civil action under this&para;<br>section”—§2409a—to adjudicate a disputed title in which&para;<br>the United States claims an interest. Regardless of how&para;<br>one reads the clause, however, it does not alter the APA’s&para;<br>clear command that suits seeking relief forbidden by other&para;<br>statutes are not authorized by the APA. And the QTA&para;<br>forbids the relief sought here: injunctive relief forcing the&para;<br>Government to relinquish title to Indian lands.&para;<br>Even if the majority were correct that the QTA itself&para;<br>reached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>time of the Act. Ante, at 8, n. 4. But that substantial variation only&para;<br>illustrates the artificiality of the majority’s claim that the Act only&para;<br>“addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived.” Ante, at 9, n. 5.&para;<br>5 I recognize, of course, that the QTA is titled “[a]n Act to permit suits&para;<br>to adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions.” 86 Stat. 1176.&para;<br>But “the title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of [its]&para;<br>text.” Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528–529&para;<br>(1947). As explained above, the substance of Congress’ enactment&para;<br>plainly extends more broadly than quiet title actions, mirroring the&para;<br>scope of the title proposed by the Government. See supra, at 2.&para;<br>&para;<br>10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI&para;<br>INDIANS v. PATCHAK&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would establish only that the QTA does not expressly&para;<br>forbid the relief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does&para;<br>not waive the Government’s sovereign immunity where&para;<br>any other statute “expressly or impliedly forbids the relief&para;<br>which is sought.” 5 U. S. C. §702 (emphasis added). The&para;<br>text and history of the QTA, as well as this Court’s precedent, make clear that the United States intended to retain&para;<br>its sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Government of Indian trust land. Patchak’s suit to oust the&para;<br>Government of such land is therefore, at minimum, impliedly forbidden.6&para;<br>II&para;<br>Three consequences illustrate the difficulties today’s&para;<br>holding will present for courts and the Government. First,&para;<br>it will render the QTA’s limitations easily circumvented.&para;<br>Although those with property claims will remain formally&para;<br>prohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block,&para;<br>savvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family&para;<br>member or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an “aesthetic” interest in the land but seeking an identical practical objective—to divest the Government of title and&para;<br>possession. §§2409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from&para;<br>obtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.&para;<br>Second, the majority’s holding will frustrate the Government’s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust&para;<br>decisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak&para;<br>asserts an “aesthetic” or “environmental” concern with a&para;<br>planned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct&para;<br>suit under statutes like the National Environmental&para;<br>Policy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.&para;<br>Those challenges generally may be brought within the&para;<br>APA’s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations.

Ante, at 16.7 Today’s result&para;<br>will promote the opposite, retarding tribes’ ability to develop land until the APA’s 6-year statute of limitations&para;<br>has lapsed.8&para;<br>Finally, the majority’s rule creates substantial uncertainty regarding who exactly is barred from bringing APA&para;<br>claims. The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether&para;<br>its rule bars from suit only those who “claim any competing interest” in the disputed land in their complaint, ante,&para;<br>at 7, or those who could claim a competing interest, but&para;<br>plead only that the Government’s title claim violates a&para;<br>federal statute. If the former, the majority’s holding&para;<br>would allow Patchak’s challenge to go forward even if he&para;<br>had some personal interest in the Bradley Property, so&para;<br>long as his complaint did not assert it.
