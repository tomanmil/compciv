FLORIDA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA&para;<br>No. 12–10882.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 3, 2014 —Decided May 27, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>After this Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments&para;<br>forbid the execution of persons with intellectual disability, see Atkins&para;<br>v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 321, Hall asked a Florida state court to vacate his sentence, presenting evidence that included an IQ test score&para;<br>of 71. The court denied his motion, determining that a Florida statute mandated that he show an IQ score of 70 or below before being&para;<br>permitted to present any additional intellectual disability evidence.&para;<br>The State Supreme Court rejected Hall’s appeal, finding the State’s&para;<br>70-point threshold constitutional.&para;<br>Held: The State’s threshold requirement, as interpreted by the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court, is unconstitutional. Pp. 5–22.&para;<br>(a) The Eighth Amendment, which “reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,” Roper v. Simmons, 543&para;<br>U. S. 551, 560, prohibits the execution of persons with intellectual&para;<br>disability. No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing&para;<br>the intellectually disabled. Atkins, 563 U. S., at 317, 320. Prohibiting such executions also protects the integrity of the trial process for&para;<br>individuals who face “a special risk of wrongful execution” because&para;<br>they are more likely to give false confessions, are often poor witnesses, and are less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.&para;<br>Id., at 320–321. In determining whether Florida’s intellectual disability definition implements these principles and Atkins’ holding, it is&para;<br>proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the purpose and meaning of IQ scores and how the scores relate to Atkins, and to consider how the several States have implemented Atkins. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) Florida’s rule disregards established medical practice. On its&para;<br>face, Florida’s statute could be consistent with the views of the medical community discussed in Atkins and with the conclusions reached&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>here. It defines intellectual disability as the existence of concurrent&para;<br>deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning, long the defining&para;<br>characteristic of intellectual disability. See Atkins, supra, at 308.&para;<br>And nothing in the statute precludes Florida from considering an IQ&para;<br>test’s standard error of measurement (SEM), a statistical fact reflecting the test’s inherent imprecision and acknowledging that an individual score is best understood as a range, e.g., five points on either&para;<br>side of the recorded score. As interpreted by the Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court, however, Florida’s rule disregards established medical practice in two interrelated ways: It takes an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant’s intellectual capacity, when experts&para;<br>would consider other evidence; and it relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of a defendant’s abilities, while refusing to recognize that measurement’s inherent imprecision. While professionals&para;<br>have long agreed that IQ test scores should be read as a range, Florida uses the test score as a fixed number, thus barring further consideration of other relevant evidence, e.g., deficits in adaptive functioning, including evidence of past performance, environment, and&para;<br>upbringing. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(c) The rejection of a strict 70-point cutoff in the vast majority of&para;<br>States and a “consistency in the trend,” Roper, supra, at 567, toward&para;<br>recognizing the SEM provide strong evidence of consensus that society does not regard this strict cutoff as proper or humane. At most,&para;<br>nine States mandate a strict IQ score cutoff at 70. Thus, in 41&para;<br>States, an individual in Hall’s position would not be deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty. The direction of change has been&para;<br>consistent. Since Atkins, many States have passed legislation to&para;<br>comply with the constitutional requirement that persons with intellectual disability not be executed. Two of those States appear to set a&para;<br>strict cutoff at 70, but at least 11 others have either abolished the&para;<br>death penalty or passed legislation allowing defendants to present&para;<br>additional intellectual disability evidence when their IQ score is&para;<br>above 70. Every state legislature, save one, to have considered the&para;<br>issue after Atkins and whose law has been interpreted by its courts&para;<br>has taken a position contrary to Florida’s. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(d) Atkins acknowledges the inherent error in IQ testing and provides substantial guidance on the definition of intellectual disability.&para;<br>The States play a critical role in advancing the protections of Atkins&para;<br>and providing this Court with an understanding of how intellectual&para;<br>disability should be measured and assessed, but Atkins did not give&para;<br>them unfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitutional protection. Clinical definitions for intellectual disability which, by&para;<br>their express terms, rejected a strict IQ test score cutoff at 70, and&para;<br>which have long included the SEM, were a fundamental premise of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Atkins. See 536 U. S., at 309, nn. 3, 5. A fleeting mention of Florida&para;<br>in a citation listing States that had outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled, id., at 315, did not signal the Atkins Court’s approval of the State’s current understanding of its law, which had not&para;<br>yet been interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court to require a strict&para;<br>70-point cutoff. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>(e) When a defendant’s IQ test score falls within the test’s&para;<br>acknowledged and inherent margin of error, the defendant must be&para;<br>able to present additional evidence of intellectual disability, including&para;<br>testimony regarding adaptive deficits. This legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis but is informed by the medical community’s diagnostic framework, which is of&para;<br>particular help here, where no alternative intellectual disability definition is presented, and where this Court and the States have placed&para;<br>substantial reliance on the medical profession’s expertise.

Atkins v. Virginia,&para;<br>536 U. S. 304, 321 (2002). Florida law defines intellectual&para;<br>disability to require an IQ test score of 70 or less. If, from&para;<br>test scores, a prisoner is deemed to have an IQ above 70,&para;<br>all further exploration of intellectual disability is fore­&para;<br>closed. This rigid rule, the Court now holds, creates an&para;<br>unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability&para;<br>will be executed, and thus is unconstitutional.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On February 21, 1978, Freddie Lee Hall, petitioner here,&para;<br>and his accomplice, Mark Ruffin, kidnaped, beat, raped,&para;<br>and murdered Karol Hurst, a pregnant, 21-year-old new­&para;<br>lywed. Afterward, Hall and Ruffin drove to a convenience&para;<br>store they planned to rob. In the parking lot of the store,&para;<br>they killed Lonnie Coburn, a sheriff’s deputy who at­&para;<br>tempted to apprehend them. Hall received the death&para;<br>penalty for both murders, although his sentence for the&para;<br>Coburn murder was later reduced on account of insuffi­&para;<br>cient evidence of premeditation. Hall v. Florida, 403&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>So. 2d 1319, 1321 (Fla. 1981) (per curiam).&para;<br>Hall argues that he cannot be executed because of his&para;<br>intellectual disability. Previous opinions of this Court&para;<br>have employed the term “mental retardation.” This opin­&para;<br>ion uses the term “intellectual disability” to describe the&para;<br>identical phenomenon. See Rosa’s Law, 124 Stat. 2643&para;<br>(changing entries in the U. S. Code from “mental retarda­&para;<br>tion” to “intellectual disability”); Schalock et. al, The Re­&para;<br>naming of Mental Retardation: Understanding the Change&para;<br>to the Term Intellectual Disability, 45 Intellectual &amp; De­&para;<br>velopmental Disabilities 116 (2007). This change in ter­&para;<br>minology is approved and used in the latest edition of the&para;<br>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&para;<br>one of the basic texts used by psychiatrists and other&para;<br>experts; the manual is often referred to by its initials&para;<br>“DSM,” followed by its edition number, e.g., “DSM–5.” See&para;<br>American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statisti­&para;<br>cal Manual of Mental Disorders 33 (5th ed. 2013).&para;<br>When Hall was first sentenced, this Court had not yet&para;<br>ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States from&para;<br>imposing the death penalty on persons with intellectual&para;<br>disability. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 340&para;<br>(1989). And at the time, Florida law did not consider&para;<br>intellectual disability as a statutory mitigating factor.&para;<br>After this Court held that capital defendants must be&para;<br>permitted to present nonstatutory mitigating evidence in&para;<br>death penalty proceedings, Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S.&para;<br>393, 398–399 (1987), Hall was resentenced. Hall then&para;<br>presented substantial and unchallenged evidence of intel­&para;<br>lectual disability. School records indicated that his teach­&para;<br>ers identified him on numerous occasions as “[m]entally&para;<br>retarded.” App. 482–483. Hall had been prosecuted for a&para;<br>different, earlier crime. His lawyer in that matter later&para;<br>testified that the lawyer “[c]ouldn’t really understand&para;<br>anything [Hall] said.” Id., at 480. And, with respect to the&para;<br>murder trial given him in this case, Hall’s counsel recalled&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that Hall could not assist in his own defense because he&para;<br>had “ ‘a mental . . . level much lower than his age,’ ” at best&para;<br>comparable to the lawyer’s 4-year-old daughter. Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 11. A number of medical clinicians testified&para;<br>that, in their professional opinion, Hall was “significantly&para;<br>retarded,” App. 507; was “mentally retarded,” id., at 517;&para;<br>and had levels of understanding “typically [seen] with&para;<br>toddlers,” id., at 523.&para;<br>As explained below in more detail, an individual’s abil­&para;<br>ity or lack of ability to adapt or adjust to the requirements&para;<br>of daily life, and success or lack of success in doing so, is&para;<br>central to the framework followed by psychiatrists and&para;<br>other professionals in diagnosing intellectual disability.&para;<br>See DSM–5, at 37. Hall’s siblings testified that there was&para;<br>something “very wrong” with him as a child. App. 466.&para;<br>Hall was “slow with speech and . . . slow to learn.” Id., at&para;<br>490. He “walked and talked long after his other brothers&para;<br>and sisters,” id., at 461, and had “great difficulty forming&para;<br>his words,” id., at 467.&para;<br>Hall’s upbringing appeared to make his deficits in adap­&para;<br>tive functioning all the more severe. Hall was raised—in&para;<br>the words of the sentencing judge—“under the most horri­&para;<br>ble family circumstances imaginable.” Id., at 53. Al­&para;<br>though “[t]eachers and siblings alike immediately recog­&para;<br>nized [Hall] to be significantly mentally retarded . . . [t]his&para;<br>retardation did not garner any sympathy from his mother,&para;<br>but rather caused much scorn to befall him.” Id., at 20.&para;<br>Hall was “[c]onstantly beaten because he was ‘slow’ or&para;<br>because he made simple mistakes.” Ibid. His mother&para;<br>“would strap [Hall] to his bed at night, with a rope thrown&para;<br>over a rafter. In the morning, she would awaken Hall by&para;<br>hoisting him up and whipping him with a belt, rope, or&para;<br>cord.” Ibid. Hall was beaten “ten or fifteen times a week&para;<br>sometimes.” Id., at 477. His mother tied him “in a ‘croaker’&para;<br>sack, swung it over a fire, and beat him,” “buried him&para;<br>in the sand up to his neck to ‘strengthen his legs,’ ” and&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“held a gun on Hall . . . while she poked [him] with sticks.”&para;<br>Hall v. Florida, 614 So. 2d 473, 480 (Fla. 1993) (Barkett,&para;<br>C. J., dissenting).&para;<br>The jury, notwithstanding this testimony, voted to&para;<br>sentence Hall to death, and the sentencing court adopted&para;<br>the jury’s recommendation. The court found that there&para;<br>was “substantial evidence in the record” to support the&para;<br>finding that “Freddie Lee Hall has been mentally retarded&para;<br>his entire life.” App. 46. Yet the court also “suspect[ed]&para;<br>that the defense experts [were] guilty of some professional&para;<br>overkill,” because “[n]othing of which the experts testified&para;<br>could explain how a psychotic, mentally-retarded, brain­&para;<br>damaged, learning-disabled, speech-impaired person could&para;<br>formulate a plan whereby a car was stolen and a conven­&para;<br>ience store was robbed.” Id., at 42. The sentencing court&para;<br>went on to state that, even assuming the expert testimony&para;<br>to be accurate, “the learning disabilities, mental retarda­&para;<br>tion, and other mental difficulties . . . cannot be used to&para;<br>justify, excuse or extenuate the moral culpability of the&para;<br>defendant in this cause.” Id., at 56. Hall was again sen­&para;<br>tenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed,&para;<br>concluding that “Hall’s argument that his mental retarda­&para;<br>tion provided a pretense of moral or legal justification”&para;<br>had “no merit.” Hall, 614 So. 2d, at 478. Chief Justice&para;<br>Barkett dissented, arguing that executing a person with&para;<br>intellectual disability violated the State Constitution’s&para;<br>prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Id., at 481–&para;<br>482.&para;<br>In 2002, this Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment&para;<br>prohibited the execution of persons with intellectual disa­&para;<br>bility. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S., at 321. On November&para;<br>30, 2004, Hall filed a motion claiming that he had intellec­&para;<br>tual disability and could not be executed. More than five&para;<br>years later, Florida held a hearing to consider Hall’s mo­&para;<br>tion. Hall again presented evidence of intellectual disabil­&para;<br>ity, including an IQ test score of 71. (Hall had received&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nine IQ evaluations in 40 years, with scores ranging from&para;<br>60 to 80, Brief for Respondent 8, but the sentencing court&para;<br>excluded the two scores below 70 for evidentiary reasons,&para;<br>leaving only scores between 71 and 80. See App. 107; 109&para;<br>So. 3d 704, 707 (Fla. 2012)). In response, Florida argued&para;<br>that Hall could not be found intellectually disabled be­&para;<br>cause Florida law requires that, as a threshold matter,&para;<br>Hall show an IQ test score of 70 or below before presenting&para;<br>any additional evidence of his intellectual disability. App.&para;<br>278–279 (“[U]nder the law, if an I. Q. is above 70, a person&para;<br>is not mentally retarded”). The Florida Supreme Court&para;<br>rejected Hall’s appeal and held that Florida’s 70-point&para;<br>threshold was constitutional. 109 So. 3d, at 707–708.&para;<br>This Court granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Eighth Amendment provides that “[e]xcessive bail&para;<br>shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor&para;<br>cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” The Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendment applies those restrictions to the&para;<br>States. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560 (2005);&para;<br>Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 239–240 (1972) (per&para;<br>curiam). “By protecting even those convicted of heinous&para;<br>crimes, the Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the&para;<br>government to respect the dignity of all persons.” Roper,&para;<br>supra, at 560; see also Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100&para;<br>(1958) (plurality opinion) (“The basic concept underlying&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of&para;<br>man”).&para;<br>The Eighth Amendment “is not fastened to the obsolete&para;<br>but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes en­&para;<br>lightened by a humane justice.” Weems v. United States,&para;<br>217 U. S. 349, 378 (1910). To enforce the Constitution’s&para;<br>protection of human dignity, this Court looks to the “evolv­&para;<br>ing standards of decency that mark the progress of a&para;<br>maturing society.” Trop, supra, at 101. The Eighth&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Amendment’s protection of dignity reflects the Nation we&para;<br>have been, the Nation we are, and the Nation we aspire to&para;<br>be. This is to affirm that the Nation’s constant, unyielding&para;<br>purpose must be to transmit the Constitution so that its&para;<br>precepts and guarantees retain their meaning and force.&para;<br>The Eighth Amendment prohibits certain punishments&para;<br>as a categorical matter. No natural-born citizen may be&para;<br>denaturalized. Ibid. No person may be sentenced to death&para;<br>for a crime committed as a juvenile. Roper, supra, at 578.&para;<br>And, as relevant for this case, persons with intellectual&para;<br>disability may not be executed. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 321.&para;<br>No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing&para;<br>a person with intellectual disability. Id., at 317, 320. To&para;<br>do so contravenes the Eighth Amendment, for to impose&para;<br>the harshest of punishments on an intellectually disabled&para;<br>person violates his or her inherent dignity as a human&para;<br>being. “[P]unishment is justified under one or more of&para;<br>three principal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and&para;<br>retribution.” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 420&para;<br>(2008). Rehabilitation, it is evident, is not an applicable&para;<br>rationale for the death penalty. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428&para;<br>U. S. 153, 183 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and&para;<br>Stevens, JJ.). As for deterrence, those with intellectual&para;<br>disability are, by reason of their condition, likely unable to&para;<br>make the calculated judgments that are the premise for&para;<br>the deterrence rationale. They have a “diminished ability”&para;<br>to “process information, to learn from experience, to en­&para;<br>gage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses . . .&para;<br>[which] make[s] it less likely that they can process the&para;<br>information of the possibility of execution as a penalty&para;<br>and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that&para;<br>information.” Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320. Retributive val­&para;<br>ues are also ill-served by executing those with intellectual&para;<br>disability. The diminished capacity of the intellectually&para;<br>disabled lessens moral culpability and hence the retribu­&para;<br>tive value of the punishment. See id., at 319 (“If the cul­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify&para;<br>the most extreme sanction available to the State, the&para;<br>lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely&para;<br>does not merit that form of retribution”).&para;<br>A further reason for not imposing the death penalty on a&para;<br>person who is intellectually disabled is to protect the&para;<br>integrity of the trial process. These persons face “a special&para;<br>risk of wrongful execution” because they are more likely to&para;<br>give false confessions, are often poor witnesses, and are&para;<br>less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.&para;<br>Id., at 320–321. This is not to say that under current law&para;<br>persons with intellectual disability who “meet the law’s&para;<br>requirements for criminal responsibility” may not be tried&para;<br>and punished. Id., at 306. They may not, however, re­&para;<br>ceive the law’s most severe sentence. Id., at 318.&para;<br>The question this case presents is how intellectual&para;<br>disability must be defined in order to implement these&para;<br>principles and the holding of Atkins. To determine if&para;<br>Florida’s cutoff rule is valid, it is proper to consider the&para;<br>psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the&para;<br>purpose and meaning of IQ scores to determine how the&para;<br>scores relate to the holding of Atkins. This in turn leads to&para;<br>a better understanding of how the legislative policies of&para;<br>various States, and the holdings of state courts, imple­&para;<br>ment the Atkins rule. That understanding informs our&para;<br>determination whether there is a consensus that instructs&para;<br>how to decide the specific issue presented here. And, in&para;<br>conclusion, this Court must express its own independent&para;<br>determination reached in light of the instruction found in&para;<br>those sources and authorities.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>That this Court, state courts, and state legislatures&para;<br>consult and are informed by the work of medical experts in&para;<br>determining intellectual disability is unsurprising. Those&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>professionals use their learning and skills to study and&para;<br>consider the consequences of the classification schemes&para;<br>they devise in the diagnosis of persons with mental or&para;<br>psychiatric disorders or disabilities. Society relies upon&para;<br>medical and professional expertise to define and explain&para;<br>how to diagnose the mental condition at issue. And the&para;<br>definition of intellectual disability by skilled professionals&para;<br>has implications far beyond the confines of the death&para;<br>penalty: for it is relevant to education, access to social&para;<br>programs, and medical treatment plans. In determining&para;<br>who qualifies as intellectually disabled, it is proper to&para;<br>consult the medical community’s opinions.&para;<br>As the Court noted in Atkins, the medical community&para;<br>defines intellectual disability according to three criteria:&para;<br>significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, deficits&para;<br>in adaptive functioning (the inability to learn basic skills&para;<br>and adjust behavior to changing circumstances), and onset&para;<br>of these deficits during the developmental period. See id.,&para;<br>at 308, n. 3; DSM–5, at 33; Brief for American Psychologi­&para;<br>cal Association et al. as Amici Curiae 12–13 (hereinafter&para;<br>APA Brief). This last factor, referred to as “age of onset,”&para;<br>is not at issue.&para;<br>The first and second criteria—deficits in intellectual&para;<br>functioning and deficits in adaptive functioning—are&para;<br>central here. In the context of a formal assessment, “[t]he&para;<br>existence of concurrent deficits in intellectual and adap­&para;<br>tive functioning has long been the defining characteristic&para;<br>of intellectual disability.” Id., at 11.&para;<br>On its face, the Florida statute could be consistent with&para;<br>the views of the medical community noted and discussed&para;<br>in Atkins. Florida’s statute defines intellectual disability&para;<br>for purposes of an Atkins proceeding as “significantly&para;<br>subaverage general intellectual functioning existing con­&para;<br>currently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested&para;<br>during the period from conception to age 18.” Fla. Stat.&para;<br>§921.137(1) (2013). The statute further defines “signifi­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cantly subaverage general intellectual functioning” as&para;<br>“performance that is two or more standard deviations from&para;<br>the mean score on a standardized intelligence test.” Ibid.&para;<br>The mean IQ test score is 100. The concept of standard&para;<br>deviation describes how scores are dispersed in a popula­&para;<br>tion. Standard deviation is distinct from standard error of&para;<br>measurement, a concept which describes the reliability of&para;<br>a test and is discussed further below. The standard devia­&para;<br>tion on an IQ test is approximately 15 points, and so two&para;<br>standard deviations is approximately 30 points. Thus a&para;<br>test taker who performs “two or more standard deviations&para;<br>from the mean” will score approximately 30 points below&para;<br>the mean on an IQ test, i.e., a score of approximately 70&para;<br>points.&para;<br>On its face this statute could be interpreted consistently&para;<br>with Atkins and with the conclusions this Court reaches in&para;<br>the instant case. Nothing in the statute precludes Florida&para;<br>from taking into account the IQ test’s standard error of&para;<br>measurement, and as discussed below there is evidence&para;<br>that Florida’s Legislature intended to include the meas­&para;<br>urement error in the calculation. But the Florida Su­&para;<br>preme Court has interpreted the provisions more nar­&para;<br>rowly.

See Cherry v. State, 959 So. 2d 702, 712–&para;<br>713 (Fla. 2007) (per curiam). That strict IQ test score&para;<br>cutoff of 70 is the issue in this case.&para;<br>Pursuant to this mandatory cutoff, sentencing courts&para;<br>cannot consider even substantial and weighty evidence of&para;<br>intellectual disability as measured and made manifest by&para;<br>the defendant’s failure or inability to adapt to his social&para;<br>and cultural environment, including medical histories,&para;<br>behavioral records, school tests and reports, and testimony&para;<br>regarding past behavior and family circumstances. This is&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>so even though the medical community accepts that all of&para;<br>this evidence can be probative of intellectual disability,&para;<br>including for individuals who have an IQ test score above&para;<br>70. See APA Brief 15–16 (“[T]he relevant clinical authori­&para;<br>ties all agree that an individual with an IQ score above 70&para;<br>may properly be diagnosed with intellectual disability if&para;<br>significant limitations in adaptive functioning also exist”);&para;<br>DSM–5, at 37 (“[A] person with an IQ score above 70 may&para;<br>have such severe adaptive behavior problems . . . that the&para;<br>person’s actual functioning is comparable to that of indi­&para;<br>viduals with a lower IQ score”).&para;<br>Florida’s rule disregards established medical practice in&para;<br>two interrelated ways. It takes an IQ score as final and&para;<br>conclusive evidence of a defendant’s intellectual capacity,&para;<br>when experts in the field would consider other evidence.&para;<br>It also relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of&para;<br>the defendant’s abilities, his IQ score, while refusing to&para;<br>recognize that the score is, on its own terms, imprecise.&para;<br>The professionals who design, administer, and interpret&para;<br>IQ tests have agreed, for years now, that IQ test scores&para;<br>should be read not as a single fixed number but as a&para;<br>range. See D. Wechsler, The Measurement of Adult Intel­&para;<br>ligence 133 (3d ed. 1944) (reporting the range of error on&para;<br>an early IQ test). Each IQ test has a “standard error of&para;<br>measurement,” ibid., often referred to by the abbreviation&para;<br>“SEM.” A test’s SEM is a statistical fact, a reflection of&para;<br>the inherent imprecision of the test itself. See R. Furr &amp;&para;<br>V. Bacharach, Psychometrics 118 (2d ed. 2014) (identify­&para;<br>ing the SEM as “one of the most important concepts in&para;<br>measurement theory”). An individual’s IQ test score on&para;<br>any given exam may fluctuate for a variety of reasons.&para;<br>These include the test-taker’s health; practice from earlier&para;<br>tests; the environment or location of the test; the examin­&para;<br>er’s demeanor; the subjective judgment involved in scoring&para;<br>certain questions on the exam; and simple lucky guessing.&para;<br>See American Association on Intellectual and Develop­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

For purposes of most IQ tests, the SEM means&para;<br>that an individual’s score is best understood as a range of&para;<br>scores on either side of the recorded score. The SEM&para;<br>allows clinicians to calculate a range within which one&para;<br>may say an individual’s true IQ score lies. See APA Brief&para;<br>23 (“SEM is a unit of measurement: 1 SEM equates to a&para;<br>confidence of 68% that the measured score falls within a&para;<br>given score range, while 2 SEM provides a 95% confidence&para;<br>level that the measured score is within a broader range”).&para;<br>A score of 71, for instance, is generally considered to re­&para;<br>flect a range between 66 and 76 with 95% confidence and a&para;<br>range of 68.5 and 73.5 with a 68% confidence. See DSM–&para;<br>5, at 37 (“Individuals with intellectual disability have&para;<br>scores of approximately two standard deviations or more&para;<br>below the population mean, including a margin for meas­&para;<br>urement error (generally +5 points). . . .

Even when a person has taken mul­&para;<br>tiple tests, each separate score must be assessed using the&para;<br>SEM, and the analysis of multiple IQ scores jointly is a&para;<br>complicated endeavor.

For professionals to diagnose—and&para;<br>for the law then to determine—whether an intellectual&para;<br>disability exists once the SEM applies and the individual’s&para;<br>IQ score is 75 or below the inquiry would consider factors&para;<br>indicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive&para;<br>functioning. These include evidence of past performance,&para;<br>environment, and upbringing.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A significant majority of States implement the protec­&para;<br>tions of Atkins by taking the SEM into account, thus&para;<br>acknowledging the error inherent in using a test score&para;<br>without necessary adjustment. This calculation provides&para;<br>“objective indicia of society’s standards” in the context of&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment. Roper, 543 U. S., at 563.

See&para;<br>Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–753(F) (West 2013); Del. Code&para;<br>Ann. Tit. 11, §4209(d)(3) (2012 Supp.); Kan. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§76–12b01 (2013 Supp.); N. C. Gen. Stat.

See, e.g., State v. Vela, 279 Neb. 94, 126,&para;<br>137, 777 N. W. 2d 266, 292, 299 (2010) (Although Nebras­&para;<br>ka’s statute specifies “[a]n intelligence quotient of seventy&para;<br>or below on a reliably administered intelligence quotient&para;<br>test,” “[t]he district court found that [the defendant’s]&para;<br>score of 75 on the [IQ test], considered in light of the&para;<br>standard error of measurement, could be considered as&para;<br>subaverage general intellectual functioning for purposes of&para;<br>diagnosing mental retardation”).&para;<br>Arizona’s statute appears to set a broad statutory cutoff&para;<br>at 70, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–753(F) (West 2013), but&para;<br>another provision instructs courts to “take into account&para;<br>the margin of error for a test administered.” Id. at §14­&para;<br>753(K)(5). How courts are meant to interpret the statute&para;<br>in a situation like Hall’s is not altogether clear. The prin­&para;<br>cipal Arizona case on the matter, State v. Roque, 141 P. 3d&para;<br>368, (Ariz 2006), states that “the statute accounts for&para;<br>margin of error by requiring multiple tests,” and that “if&para;<br>the defendant achieves a full-scale score of 70 or below on&para;<br>any one of the tests, then the court proceeds to a hearing.”&para;<br>Id. at 403. But that case also notes that the defendant&para;<br>had an IQ score of 80, well outside the margin of error,&para;<br>and that all but one of the sub-parts of the IQ test were&para;<br>“above 75.” Id.&para;<br>Kansas has not had an execution in almost five decades,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and so its laws and jurisprudence on this issue are unlikely&para;<br>to receive attention on this specific question. See Atkins,&para;<br>536 U. S., at 316 (“[E]ven in those States that allow the&para;<br>execution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice&para;<br>is uncommon. Some States . . . continue to authorize&para;<br>executions, but none have been carried out in decades.&para;<br>Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the&para;<br>execution of the mentally retarded in those States”).&para;<br>Delaware has executed three individuals in the past dec­&para;<br>ade, while Washington has executed one person, and has&para;<br>recently suspended its death penalty. None of the four&para;<br>individuals executed recently in those States appears to&para;<br>have brought a claim similar to that advanced here.&para;<br>Thus, at most nine States mandate a strict IQ score&para;<br>cutoff at 70. Of these, four States (Delaware, Kansas,&para;<br>North Carolina, and Washington) appear not to have&para;<br>considered the issue in their courts. On the other side of&para;<br>the ledger stand the 18 States that have abolished the&para;<br>death penalty, either in full or for new offenses, and Ore­&para;<br>gon, which has suspended the death penalty and executed&para;<br>only two individuals in the past 40 years. See Roper, 543&para;<br>U. S., at 574 (“[The] Court should have considered those&para;<br>States that had abandoned the death penalty altogether as&para;<br>part of the consensus against the juvenile death penalty”).&para;<br>In those States, of course, a person in Hall’s position&para;<br>could not be executed even without a finding of intellectual&para;<br>disability. Thus in 41 States an individual in Hall’s&para;<br>position—an individual with an IQ score of 71—would not&para;<br>be deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.&para;<br>These aggregate numbers are not the only considera­&para;<br>tions bearing on a determination of consensus. Consistency&para;<br>of the direction of change is also relevant. See id., at&para;<br>565–566 (quoting Atkins, supra, at 315). Since Atkins,&para;<br>many States have passed legislation to comply with the&para;<br>constitutional requirement that persons with intellectual&para;<br>disability not be executed. Two of these States, Virginia&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and Delaware, appear to set a strict cutoff at 70, although&para;<br>as discussed, Delaware’s courts have yet to interpret the&para;<br>law. In contrast, at least 11 States have either abolished&para;<br>the death penalty or passed legislation allowing defend­&para;<br>ants to present additional evidence of intellectual disabil­&para;<br>ity when their IQ test score is above 70.&para;<br>Since Atkins, five States have abolished the death pen­&para;<br>alty through legislation. See 2012 Conn. Pub. Acts no. 12–&para;<br>5; Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 725, §119–1 (West 2012); Md. Cor­&para;<br>rec. Servs. Code Ann. §3–901 et seq. (Lexis 2008); N. J.&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §2C:11–3(b)(1) (West Supp. 2013); 2009 N. M.&para;<br>Laws ch. 11, §§5–7. In addition, the New York Court of&para;<br>Appeals invalidated New York’s death penalty under the&para;<br>State Constitution in 2004, see People v. LeValle, 3 N. Y.&para;<br>3d 88, 817 N. E. 2d 341 (2004), and legislation has not&para;<br>been passed to reinstate it. And when it did impose the&para;<br>death penalty, New York did not employ an IQ cutoff in&para;<br>determining intellectual disability. N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law&para;<br>Ann. §400.27(12)(e) (West 2005).&para;<br>In addition to these States, at least five others have&para;<br>passed legislation allowing a defendant to present addi­&para;<br>tional evidence of intellectual disability even when an IQ&para;<br>test score is above 70. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1376&para;<br>(West Supp. 2014) (no IQ cutoff); Idaho Code §19–2515A&para;<br>(Lexis Supp. 2013) (“seventy (70) or below”); Pizzutto v.&para;<br>State, 146 Idaho 720, 729, 202 P. 3d 642, 651 (2008) (“The&para;<br>alleged error in IQ testing is plus or minus five points.&para;<br>The district court was entitled to draw reasonable infer­&para;<br>ences from the undisputed facts”); La. Code Crim. Proc.&para;<br>Ann., Art. 905.5.1 (West Supp. 2014) (no IQ cutoff); Nev.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. §174.098.7 (2013) (no IQ cutoff); Utah Code Ann&para;<br>§77–15a–102 (Lexis 2012) (no IQ cutoff). The U. S. Code&para;<br>likewise does not set a strict IQ cutoff. See 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3596(c). And no State that previously allowed defendants&para;<br>with an IQ score over 70 to present additional evidence of&para;<br>intellectual disability has modified its law to create a&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>strict cutoff at 70. Cf. Roper, supra, at 566 (“Since Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989), no State that previ­&para;<br>ously prohibited capital punishment for juveniles has&para;<br>reinstated it”).&para;<br>In summary, every state legislature to have considered&para;<br>the issue after Atkins—save Virginia’s—and whose law&para;<br>has been interpreted by its courts has taken a position&para;<br>contrary to that of Florida. Indeed, the Florida Legisla­&para;<br>ture, which passed the relevant legislation prior to Atkins,&para;<br>might well have believed that its law would not create&para;<br>a fixed cutoff at 70. The staff analysis accompanying&para;<br>the 2001 bill states that it “does not contain a set IQ&para;<br>level . . . . Two standard deviations from these tests is ap­&para;<br>proximately a 70 IQ, although it can be extended up to&para;<br>75.” Fla. Senate Staff Analysis and Economic Impact&para;<br>Statement, CS/SB 238, p. 11 (Feb. 14, 2001). But the&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court interpreted the law to require a&para;<br>bright-line cutoff at 70, see Cherry, 959 So. 2d, at 712–713,&para;<br>and the Court is bound by that interpretation.&para;<br>The rejection of the strict 70 cutoff in the vast majority&para;<br>of States and the “consistency in the trend,” Roper, supra,&para;<br>at 567, toward recognizing the SEM provide strong evi­&para;<br>dence of consensus that our society does not regard this&para;<br>strict cutoff as proper or humane.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Atkins itself acknowledges the inherent error in IQ&para;<br>testing. It is true that Atkins “did not provide definitive&para;<br>procedural or substantive guides for determining when a&para;<br>person who claims mental retardation” falls within the&para;<br>protection of the Eighth Amendment. Bobby v. Bies, 556&para;<br>U. S. 825, 831 (2009). 	In Atkins, the Court stated:&para;<br>“Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will&para;<br>be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally&para;<br>retarded offenders about whom there is a national&para;<br>consensus. As was our approach in Ford v. Wain-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>wright with regard to insanity, ‘we leave to the&para;<br>State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to en­&para;<br>force the constitutional restriction upon [their] execu­&para;<br>tion of sentences.’ ” 536 U. S., at 317 (quoting Ford v.&para;<br>Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 416–417 (1986); citation&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>As discussed above, the States play a critical role in ad­&para;<br>vancing protections and providing the Court with infor­&para;<br>mation that contributes to an understanding of how intel­&para;<br>lectual disability should be measured and assessed. But&para;<br>Atkins did not give the States unfettered discretion to&para;<br>define the full scope of the constitutional protection.&para;<br>The Atkins Court twice cited definitions of intellectual&para;<br>disability which, by their express terms, rejected a strict&para;<br>IQ test score cutoff at 70. Atkins first cited the definition&para;<br>provided in the DSM–IV: “ ‘Mild’ mental retardation is&para;<br>typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50–55&para;<br>to approximately 70.” 536 U. S., at 308, n. 3 (citing Diag­&para;<br>nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th&para;<br>ed. 2000)). The Court later noted that “ ‘an IQ between 70&para;<br>and 75 or lower . . . is typically considered the cutoff IQ&para;<br>score for the intellectual function prong of the mental&para;<br>retardation definition.’ ” 536 U. S., at 309, n. 5. Further­&para;<br>more, immediately after the Court declared that it left “ ‘to&para;<br>the States the task of developing appropriate ways to&para;<br>enforce the constitutional restriction,’ ” id., at 317, the&para;<br>Court stated in an accompanying footnote that “[t]he&para;<br>[state] statutory definitions of mental retardation are not&para;<br>identical, but generally conform to the clinical definitions,”&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>Thus Atkins itself not only cited clinical definitions for&para;<br>intellectual disability but also noted that the States’&para;<br>standards, on which the Court based its own conclusion,&para;<br>conformed to those definitions. In the words of Atkins,&para;<br>those persons who meet the “clinical definitions” of intel­&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lectual disability “by definition . . . have diminished capac­&para;<br>ities to understand and process information, to communi­&para;<br>cate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience,&para;<br>to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to&para;<br>understand the reactions of others.” Id., at 318. Thus,&para;<br>they bear “diminish[ed] . . . personal culpability.” Ibid.&para;<br>The clinical definitions of intellectual disability, which&para;<br>take into account that IQ scores represent a range, not a&para;<br>fixed number, were a fundamental premise of Atkins. And&para;<br>those clinical definitions have long included the SEM. See&para;<br>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 28&para;<br>(rev. 3d ed. 1987) (“Since any measurement is fallible, an&para;<br>IQ score is generally thought to involve an error of meas­&para;<br>urement of approximately five points; hence, an IQ of 70 is&para;<br>considered to represent a band or zone of 65 to 75. Treat­&para;<br>ing the IQ with some flexibility permits inclusion in the&para;<br>Mental Retardation category of people with IQs somewhat&para;<br>higher than 70 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive&para;<br>behavior”).&para;<br>Respondent argues that the current Florida law was&para;<br>favorably cited by the Atkins Court. See Brief for Re­&para;<br>spondent 18 (“As evidence of the national consensus, the&para;<br>Court specifically cited Florida’s statute at issue here,&para;<br>which has not substantively changed”). While Atkins did&para;<br>refer to Florida’s law in a citation listing States which had&para;<br>outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled, 536&para;<br>U. S., at 315, that fleeting mention did not signal the&para;<br>Court’s approval of Florida’s current understanding of the&para;<br>law. As discussed above, when Atkins was decided the&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court had not yet interpreted the law to&para;<br>require a strict IQ cutoff at 70. That new interpretation&para;<br>runs counter to the clinical definition cited throughout&para;<br>Atkins and to Florida’s own legislative report indicating&para;<br>this kind of cutoff need not be used.&para;<br>Respondent’s argument also conflicts with the logic of&para;<br>Atkins and the Eighth Amendment. If the States were to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as&para;<br>they wished, the Court’s decision in Atkins could become a&para;<br>nullity, and the Eighth Amendment’s protection of human&para;<br>dignity would not become a reality. This Court thus reads&para;<br>Atkins to provide substantial guidance on the definition of&para;<br>intellectual disability.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The actions of the States and the precedents of this&para;<br>Court “give us essential instruction,” Roper, 543 U. S., at&para;<br>564, but the inquiry must go further. “[T]he Constitution&para;<br>contemplates that in the end our own judgment will be&para;<br>brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the&para;<br>death penalty under the Eighth Amendment.” Coker v.&para;<br>Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 597 (1977) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>That exercise of independent judgment is the Court’s&para;<br>judicial duty. See Roper, supra, at 574 (“[T]o the extent&para;<br>Stanford was based on a rejection of the idea that this&para;<br>Court is required to bring its independent judgment to&para;<br>bear on the proportionality of the death penalty for a&para;<br>particular class of crimes or offenders, it suffices to note&para;<br>that this rejection was inconsistent with prior Eighth&para;<br>Amendment decisions” (citation omitted).&para;<br>In this Court’s independent judgment, the Florida stat­&para;<br>ute, as interpreted by its courts, is unconstitutional.&para;<br>In addition to the views of the States and the Court’s&para;<br>precedent, this determination is informed by the views of&para;<br>medical experts. These views do not dictate the Court’s&para;<br>decision, yet the Court does not disregard these informed&para;<br>assessments. See Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407, 413&para;<br>(2002) (“[T]he science of psychiatry . . . informs but does&para;<br>not control ultimate legal determinations . . .”). It is the&para;<br>Court’s duty to interpret the Constitution, but it need not&para;<br>do so in isolation. The legal determination of intellectual&para;<br>disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis, but it is&para;<br>informed by the medical community’s diagnostic frame­&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>work. Atkins itself points to the diagnostic criteria em­&para;<br>ployed by psychiatric professionals. And the professional&para;<br>community’s teachings are of particular help in this case,&para;<br>where no alternative definition of intellectual disability is&para;<br>presented and where this Court and the States have&para;<br>placed substantial reliance on the expertise of the medical&para;<br>profession.&para;<br>By failing to take into account the SEM and setting a&para;<br>strict cutoff at 70, Florida “goes against the unanimous&para;<br>professional consensus.” APA Brief 15. Neither Florida&para;<br>nor its amici point to a single medical professional who&para;<br>supports this cutoff. The DSM–5 repudiates it: “IQ test&para;<br>scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but&para;<br>may be insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situa­&para;<br>tions and mastery of practical tasks.” DSM–5, at 37. This&para;<br>statement well captures the Court’s independent assess­&para;<br>ment that an individual with an IQ test score “between 70&para;<br>and 75 or lower,” Atkins, supra, at 309, n. 5, may show&para;<br>intellectual disability by presenting additional evidence&para;<br>regarding difficulties in adaptive functioning.&para;<br>The flaws in Florida’s law are the result of the inherent&para;<br>error in IQ tests themselves. An IQ score is an approxi­&para;<br>mation, not a final and infallible assessment of intellectual&para;<br>functioning. See APA Brief 24 (“[I]t is standard pyscho­&para;<br>metric practice to report the ‘estimates of relevant reliabil­&para;<br>ities and standard errors of measurement’ when reporting&para;<br>a test score”); ibid.

Virginia, 536 U.

Today, the Court overrules the latter&para;<br>holding based largely on the positions adopted by private&para;<br>professional associations. In taking this step, the Court&para;<br>sharply departs from the framework prescribed in prior&para;<br>Eighth Amendment cases and adopts a uniform national&para;<br>rule that is both conceptually unsound and likely to result&para;<br>in confusion. I therefore respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Court’s approach in this case marks a new and most&para;<br>unwise turn in our Eighth Amendment case law. In Atkins and other cases, the Court held that the prohibition of&para;<br>cruel and unusual punishment embodies the “evolving&para;<br>standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing&para;<br>society,” and the Court explained that “those evolving&para;<br>standards should be informed by objective factors to the&para;<br>maximum possible extent.” Id., at 312 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). In addition, the Court “pinpointed that&para;<br>the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of con­&para;<br>temporary values is the legislation enacted by the coun­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>try’s legislatures.” Ibid.&para;<br>In these prior cases, when the Court referred to the&para;<br>evolving standards of a maturing “society,” the Court&para;<br>meant the standards of American society as a whole. Now,&para;<br>however, the Court strikes down a state law based on the&para;<br>evolving standards of professional societies, most notably&para;<br>the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The Court&para;<br>begins its analysis with the views of those associations,&para;<br>see ante, at 7–12, and then, after briefly discussing the&para;<br>enactments of state legislatures, see ante, at 12–16, re­&para;<br>turns to the associations’ views in interpreting Atkins and&para;<br>in exercising the Court’s “independent judgment” on the&para;<br>constitutionality of Florida’s law, see ante, at 16–22. This&para;<br>approach cannot be reconciled with the framework pre­&para;<br>scribed by our Eighth Amendment cases.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Under this Court’s modern Eighth Amendment prece­&para;<br>dents, whether a punishment is “cruel and unusual” de­&para;<br>pends on currently prevailing societal norms, and the&para;<br>Court has long held that laws enacted by state legislatures&para;<br>provide the “clearest and most reliable objective evidence&para;<br>of contemporary values,” Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,&para;<br>331 (1989). This is so because “in a democratic society[,]&para;<br>legislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the&para;<br>will and consequently the moral values of the people,”&para;<br>Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 175–176 (1976) (joint&para;<br>opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Under this approach, as origi­&para;<br>nally conceived, the Court first asked whether a chal­&para;<br>lenged practice contravened a clear national consensus&para;<br>evidenced by state legislation, and only if such a consen­&para;<br>sus was found would the Court go on and ask “whether&para;<br>there is reason to disagree with [the States’] judgment.”&para;<br>Atkins, 536 U.

See id., at 315–316.&para;<br>Critical to the Court’s analysis was the conclusion that&para;<br>“today our society views mentally retarded offenders as&para;<br>categorically less culpable than the average criminal.” Id.,&para;<br>at 316. “This consensus,” the Court continued, “unques­&para;<br>tionably reflects widespread judgment about . . . the rela­&para;<br>tionship between mental retardation and the penological&para;<br>purposes served by the death penalty.” Id., at 317.&para;<br>While Atkins identified a consensus against the execu­&para;<br>tion of the intellectually disabled, the Court observed that&para;<br>there was “serious disagreement” among the States with&para;<br>respect to the best method for “determining which offend­&para;<br>ers are in fact retarded.” Ibid. The Court therefore “le[ft]&para;<br>to the States the task of developing appropriate ways” to&para;<br>identify these defendants. Ibid. (internal quotation marks&para;<br>and alteration omitted). As we noted just five years ago,&para;<br>Atkins “did not provide definitive procedural or substan­&para;<br>tive guides for determining when a person” is intellectually&para;<br>disabled. Bobby v. Bies, 556 U. S. 825, 831 (2009).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Consistent with the role that Atkins left for the States,&para;<br>Florida follows the procedure now at issue. As we ex­&para;<br>plained in Atkins, in order for a defendant to qualify as&para;<br>intellectually disabled, three separate requirements must&para;<br>be met: It must be shown that a defendant has both&para;<br>(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and&para;<br>(2) deficits in adaptive behavior, and that (3) the onset of&para;<br>both factors occurred before the age of 18. See 536 U. S.,&para;<br>at 318; ante, at 8. In implementing this framework, Flor­&para;<br>ida has determined that the first requirement cannot be&para;<br>satisfied if the defendant scores higher than 70 on IQ&para;<br>tests, the long-accepted method of measuring intellectual&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>functioning.1 The Court today holds that this scheme&para;<br>offends the Eighth Amendment. The Court objects that&para;<br>Florida’s approach treats IQ test scores as conclusive and&para;<br>ignores the fact that an IQ score might not reflect “true”&para;<br>IQ because of errors in measurement. The Court then&para;<br>concludes that a State must view a defendant’s IQ as a&para;<br>range of potential scores calculated using a statistical&para;<br>concept known as the “standard error of measurement” or&para;<br>SEM. See Part II–B–1, infra. The Court holds that if this&para;<br>range includes an IQ of 70 or below (the accepted level for&para;<br>intellectual disability), the defendant must be permitted to&para;<br>produce other evidence of intellectual disability in addition&para;<br>to IQ scores.&para;<br>I see no support for this holding in our traditional ap­&para;<br>proach for identifying our society’s evolving standards of&para;<br>decency. Under any fair analysis of current state laws,&para;<br>the same absence of a consensus that this Court found in&para;<br>Atkins persists today. It is telling that Hall himself does&para;<br>not rely on a consensus among States. He candidly argues&para;<br>instead that “the precise number of States that share&para;<br>Florida’s approach is immaterial.” Reply Brief 2.&para;<br>The Court’s analysis is more aggressive. According to&para;<br>the Court, a “significant majority of States” reject Florida’s&para;<br>“strict 70 cutoff ” and instead take “the SEM into account”&para;<br>when deciding whether a defendant meets the first re­&para;<br>quirement of the intellectual-disability test.

See also Brief for Petitioner 50; App.&para;<br>107–108.&para;<br>3 As I discuss below, the Florida Supreme Court did not base its deci­&para;<br>sion on a finding that Hall’s IQ was 71.

Two States have not defined “significantly subaverage” intel­&para;<br>lectual functioning. See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. §18–1.3–1101(2) (2013);&para;<br>S. C. Code Ann. §16–3–20 (2003 and 2013 Cum.

Two States have statutes that impose rebuttable presump­&para;<br>tions of intellectual disability if a defendant’s IQ is below 65 or 70 but&para;<br>have not said whether a defendant would be allowed to provide further&para;<br>evidence if his IQ were over 70. See Ark. Code Ann. §5–4–618 (2013);&para;<br>Neb. Rev. Stat. §28–105.01 (2013 Supp.).

It is&para;<br>true that the Court has counted non-death-penalty States&para;<br>in some prior Eighth Amendment cases, but those cases&para;<br>concerned the substantive question whether a class of&para;<br>individuals should be categorically ineligible for the death&para;<br>penalty. In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), for&para;<br>example, the Court counted non-death-penalty States as&para;<br>part of the consensus against the imposition of a capital&para;<br>sentence for a crime committed by a minor. Id., at 574.&para;<br>The Court reasoned that a State’s decision to abolish the&para;<br>death penalty necessarily “demonstrates a judgment that&para;<br>the death penalty is inappropriate for all offenders, includ­&para;<br>ing juveniles.” Ibid.&para;<br>No similar reasoning is possible here. The fact that a&para;<br>State has abolished the death penalty says nothing about&para;<br>how that State would resolve the evidentiary problem of&para;<br>identifying defendants who are intellectually disabled. As&para;<br>I explain below, a State may reasonably conclude that&para;<br>Florida’s approach is fairer than and just as accurate as&para;<br>the approach that the Court now requires, and therefore it&para;<br>cannot be inferred that a non-death-penalty State, if&para;<br>forced to choose between the two approaches, would neces­&para;<br>sarily select the Court’s. For all these reasons, it is quite&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>must prove deficits in adaptive behavior despite having an IQ below 70.&para;<br>&para;<br>See Stripling v.

Ante, at 16.&para;<br>Not only are the States divided on the question whether&para;<br>the SEM should play a role in determining whether a&para;<br>capital defendant is intellectually disabled, but the States&para;<br>that require consideration of the SEM do not agree on the&para;<br>role that the SEM should play. Those States differ, for&para;<br>example, on the sort of evidence that can be introduced&para;<br>when IQ testing reveals an IQ over 70. Some require&para;<br>further evidence of intellectual deficits, while others per­&para;<br>mit the defendant to move on to the second prong of the&para;<br>test and submit evidence of deficits in adaptive behavior.6&para;<br>The fairest assessment of the current situation is that the&para;<br>States have adopted a multitude of approaches to a very&para;<br>difficult question.&para;<br>In light of all this, the resolution of this case should be&para;<br>straightforward: Just as there was no methodological&para;<br>consensus among the States at the time of Atkins, there is&para;<br>no such consensus today.

See ante, at 16–19. On the contrary, Atkins expressly left “to the States” the task of&para;<br>defining intellectual disability. And although the Atkins&para;<br>Court perceived a “professional consensus” about the best&para;<br>procedure to be used in identifying the intellectually dis­&para;<br>abled, the Atkins Court declined to import that view into&para;<br>the law. 536 U.

In this new publication,&para;<br>the APA discards “significantly subaverage intellectual&para;<br>functioning” as an element of the intellectual-disability&para;<br>test.8 Elevating the APA’s current views to constitutional&para;<br>significance therefore throws into question the basic ap­&para;<br>proach that Atkins approved and that most of the States&para;<br>have followed.&para;<br>It is also noteworthy that changes adopted by profes­&para;<br>sional associations are sometimes rescinded. For example,&para;<br>in 1992 the AAIDD extended the baseline “intellectual&para;<br>functioning cutoff ” from an “IQ of 70 or below” to a “score&para;<br>of approximately 70 to 75 or below.” AAIDD 11th ed. 10&para;<br>(Table 1.3) (boldface deleted); see 2 Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s&para;<br>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 3449 (B. Sadock,&para;<br>V. Sadock, &amp; P. Ruiz eds., 9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter&para;<br>Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s). That change “generated much con­&para;<br>troversy”; by 2000, “only 4 states used the 1992 AAIDD&para;<br>definition, with 44 states continuing to use the 1983 defi­&para;<br>nition.” Ibid. And in the 2002 AAIDD, the baseline “IQ&para;<br>cut-off was changed” back to approximately “70 or less.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Second, the Court’s approach implicitly calls upon the&para;<br>Judiciary either to follow every new change in the think­&para;<br>ing of these professional organizations or to judge the&para;<br>validity of each new change. Here, for example, the Court&para;<br>tacitly makes the judgment that the diagnostic criteria for&para;<br>intellectual disability that prevailed at the time when&para;<br>Atkins was decided are no longer legitimate.

And what if professional organizations&para;<br>disagree? The Court provides no guidance for deciding&para;<br>which organizations’ views should govern.&para;<br>Fourth, the Court binds Eighth Amendment law to&para;<br>definitions of intellectual disability that are promulgated&para;<br>for use in making a variety of decisions that are quite&para;<br>different from the decision whether the imposition of a&para;<br>death sentence in a particular case would serve a valid&para;<br>penological end. In a death-penalty case, intellectual&para;<br>functioning is important because of its correlation with the&para;<br>ability to understand the gravity of the crime and the&para;<br>purpose of the penalty, as well as the ability to resist a&para;<br>momentary impulse or the influence of others. See id., at&para;<br>318, 320. By contrast, in determining eligibility for social&para;<br>services, adaptive functioning may be much more im­&para;<br>portant. Cf. DSM–IV–TR, at xxxvii (clinical “considera­&para;<br>tions” may not be “relevant to legal judgments” that turn&para;<br>on “individual responsibility”); DSM–5, at 20 (similar).&para;<br>Practical problems like these call for legislative judg­&para;<br>ments, not judicial resolution.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Because I find no consensus among the States, I would&para;<br>not independently assess the method that Florida has&para;<br>adopted for determining intellectual disability. But even&para;<br>if it were appropriate for us to look beyond the evidence of&para;<br>societal standards, I could not conclude that Florida’s&para;<br>method is unconstitutional. The Court faults Florida for&para;<br>“tak[ing] an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a&para;<br>defendant’s intellectual capacity” and for failing to recog­&para;<br>nize that an IQ score may be imprecise. Ante, at 10. In&para;<br>my view, however, Florida has adopted a sensible stand­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

And&para;<br>although the Court entirely ignores this part of the Florida&para;<br>scheme, the State takes into account the inevitable risk of&para;<br>testing error by permitting defendants to introduce multi­&para;<br>ple scores.&para;<br>In contrast, the Court establishes a standard that&para;<br>conflates what have long been understood to be two independent requirements for proving intellectual disability:&para;<br>(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and&para;<br>(2) deficits in adaptive behavior. The Court also mandates&para;<br>use of an alternative method of dealing with the risk of&para;<br>testing error without any hint that it is more accurate&para;<br>than Florida’s approach.&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>The first supposed error that the Court identifies is that&para;<br>Florida “takes an IQ score” as “conclusive evidence” of&para;<br>intellectual functioning. Ante, at 10. As an initial matter,&para;<br>one would get the impression from reading the Court’s&para;<br>opinion that Hall introduced only one test score (of 71).&para;<br>See ante, at 14. In truth, the Florida courts considered&para;<br>multiple scores, all above 70, on the particular IQ test that&para;<br>Hall has dubbed the “gold standard.” See Brief for Peti­&para;<br>tioner 50; App. 107–108.9 Florida’s statute imposes no&para;<br>limit on the number of IQ scores that a defendant may&para;<br>introduce, so the Court is simply wrong to analyze the&para;<br>Florida system as one that views a single IQ score above&para;<br>70 as “final and conclusive evidence” that a defendant does&para;<br>not suffer from subaverage intellectual functioning. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See Brief for Petitioner 50 (listing his valid IQ scores of 71, 72, 73,&para;<br>and 80). Hall alleges that he also scored a 69 on a Wechsler test, but&para;<br>that score was not admitted into evidence because of doubts about its&para;<br>validity. App. 107. Hall does not allege that any potential “practice&para;<br>effect” skewed his scores.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 44 (“Florida’s Rule allows for multi­&para;<br>ple evaluations, and if Hall believed a statistical error rate&para;<br>prevented any of his tests from reflecting his true score, he&para;<br>could have sought still more testing”).&para;<br>The proper question to ask, therefore, is whether Flor­&para;<br>ida’s actual approach falls outside the range of discretion&para;<br>allowed by Atkins. The Court offers no persuasive reason&para;<br>for concluding that it does. Indeed, the Court’s opinion&para;<br>never identifies what other evidence of intellectual func­&para;<br>tioning it would require Florida to admit. As we recog­&para;<br>nized in Atkins, the longstanding practices of the States,&para;<br>and at least the previous views of professional organiza­&para;<br>tions, seem to reflect the understanding that IQ scores are&para;<br>the best way to measure intellectual functioning. See 536&para;<br>U. S., at 316.10 Until its most recent publication, the APA,&para;<br>for example, ranked the severity of intellectual disability&para;<br>exclusively by IQ scores, necessarily pinpointing the onset&para;<br>of the disability according to IQ. See DSM–IV–TR, at 42.&para;<br>We have been presented with no solid evidence that the&para;<br>longstanding reliance on multiple IQ test scores as a&para;<br>measure of intellectual functioning is so unreasonable or&para;<br>outside the ordinary as to be unconstitutional.

See ante, at 9–10, 12, 20. That is a re­&para;<br>markable change in what we took to be a universal under­&para;<br>standing of intellectual disability just 12 years ago.&para;<br>In Atkins, we instructed that “clinical definitions of&para;<br>mental retardation require not only [(1)] subaverage intel­&para;<br>lectual functioning, but also [(2)] significant limitations in&para;<br>adaptive skills.” 536 U. S., at 318 (emphasis and altera­&para;<br>tions added). That is the approach taken by the vast&para;<br>majority of States.11 As the Court correctly recognizes,&para;<br>most States require “concurrent deficits” in intellectual&para;<br>functioning and adaptive behavior, requiring defendants&para;<br>to prove both. Ante, at 8 (emphasis added).12&para;<br>Yet the Court now holds that when a defendant’s IQ&para;<br>score is as high as 75, a court must “consider factors indi­&para;<br>cating whether the person has deficits in adaptive func­&para;<br>tioning.” Ante, at 12; see ante, at 9–10, 20. In other&para;<br>words, even when a defendant has failed to show that he&para;<br>meets the first prong of the well-accepted standard for&para;<br>intellectual disability (significantly subaverage intellec­&para;<br>tual functioning), evidence of the second prong (deficits in&para;<br>adaptive behavior) can establish intellectual disability.&para;<br>The Court offers little explanation for this sea change.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §4209 (2007); Idaho Code §19–&para;<br>2515A; Nev. Rev. Stat. §174.098 (2013); Va. Code Ann. §19.2–264.3:1.1&para;<br>(Lexis Cum. Supp. 2013).&para;<br>12 The longstanding views of professional organizations have also&para;<br>been that intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior are independ­&para;<br>ent factors. See, e.g., DSM–IV–TR, at 39. These organizations might&para;<br>recommend examining evidence of adaptive behavior even when an IQ&para;<br>is above 70, but that sheds no light on what the legal rule should be&para;<br>given that most States appear to require defendants to prove each&para;<br>prong separately by a preponderance of the evidence.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>It asserts vaguely that “[i]t is not sound to view a single&para;<br>factor as dispositive of a conjunctive and interrelated&para;<br>assessment.” Ante, at 21. But the Court ignores the fact&para;<br>that deficits in adaptive behavior cannot be used to estab­&para;<br>lish deficits in mental functioning because the two prongs&para;<br>are meant to show distinct components of intellectual&para;<br>disability. “[I]ntellectual functions” include “reasoning,&para;<br>problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment,&para;<br>academic learning, and learning from experience,” while&para;<br>adaptive functioning refers to the ability “to meet devel­&para;<br>opmental and sociocultural standards for personal inde­&para;<br>pendence and social responsibility.”&para;<br>DSM–5, at 33.&para;<br>Strong evidence of a deficit in adaptive behavior does not&para;<br>necessarily demonstrate a deficit in intellectual function­&para;<br>ing. And without the latter, a person simply cannot be&para;<br>classified as intellectually disabled.&para;<br>It is particularly troubling to relax the proof require­&para;<br>ments for the intellectual-functioning prong because that&para;<br>is the prong that most directly relates to the concerns that&para;<br>led to our primary holding in Atkins. There, we explained&para;<br>that “the diminished ability to understand and process&para;<br>information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical&para;<br>reasoning, or to control impulses”—i.e., diminished intellectual functioning—“make it less likely that [a defendant]&para;<br>can process the information of the possibility of execution&para;<br>as a penalty” and therefore be deterred from committing&para;<br>murders. 536 U. S., at 320; see also id., at 318 (“[T]hey&para;<br>often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premedi­&para;<br>tated plan . . .”); see also ante, at 6. A defendant who does&para;<br>not display significantly subaverage intellectual function­&para;<br>ing is therefore not among the class of defendants we&para;<br>identified in Atkins.&para;<br>Finally, relying primarily on proof of adaptive deficits&para;<br>will produce inequities in the administration of capital&para;<br>punishment. As far as I can tell, adaptive behavior is a&para;<br>malleable factor without “firm theoretical and empirical&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>roots.” See 2 Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s 3448. No consensus&para;<br>exists among States or medical practitioners about what&para;<br>facts are most critical in analyzing that factor, and its&para;<br>measurement relies largely on subjective judgments.&para;<br>Florida’s approach avoids the disparities that reliance on&para;<br>such a factor tends to produce. It thus promotes con­&para;<br>sistency in the application of the death penalty and confi­&para;<br>dence that it is not being administered haphazardly.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court’s second “interrelated” objection to Florida’s&para;<br>rule is that it fails to account for the risk of error inherent&para;<br>in IQ testing. In order to diminish this risk, the Court&para;<br>establishes a rule that if IQ testing reveals an IQ between&para;<br>71 and 75, a claim of intellectual disability cannot be&para;<br>rejected on the basis of test scores alone. Ante, at 20. The&para;<br>Court both misunderstands how the SEM works and fails&para;<br>to explain why Florida’s method of accounting for the risk&para;<br>of error (allowing a defendant to take and rely on multiple&para;<br>tests) is not as effective as the approach that the Court&para;<br>compels.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Court begins with the simple and uncontroversial&para;<br>proposition that every testing situation is susceptible to&para;<br>error and thus may result in an imperfect measurement of&para;<br>“true” IQ. The Court then wades into technical matters&para;<br>that must be understood in order to see where the Court&para;<br>goes wrong.&para;<br>There are various ways to account for error in IQ test­&para;<br>ing. One way is Florida’s approach (evaluate multiple test&para;<br>results). Another is to use a mathematical measurement&para;<br>called the “standard error of measurement” or SEM. See&para;<br>AAMR 10th ed. 67–71 (App. 4.1). Of critical importance,&para;<br>there is not a single, uniform SEM across IQ tests or even&para;<br>across test-takers. Rather, “the [SEM] varies by test,&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>subgroup, and age group.” User’s Guide To Accompany&para;<br>AAIDD 11th ed.: Definition, Classification, and Systems of&para;<br>Supports 22 (2012).&para;<br>Once we know the SEM for a particular test and a par­&para;<br>ticular test-taker, adding one SEM to and subtracting one&para;<br>SEM from the obtained score establishes an interval of&para;<br>scores known as the 66% confidence interval. See AAMR&para;<br>10th ed. 57. That interval represents the range of scores&para;<br>within which “we are [66%] sure” that the “true” IQ falls.&para;<br>See Oxford Handbook of Child Psychological Assessment&para;<br>291 (D. Saklofske, C. Reynolds, &amp; V. Schwean eds. 2013).&para;<br>The interval is centered on the obtained score, and it&para;<br>includes scores that are above and below that score by the&para;<br>amount of the SEM. Since there is about a 66% chance&para;<br>that the test-taker’s “true” IQ falls within this range, there&para;<br>is about a 34% chance that the “true” IQ falls outside the&para;<br>interval, with approximately equal odds that it falls above&para;<br>the interval (17%) or below the interval (17%).&para;<br>An example: If a test-taker scores a 72 on an IQ test&para;<br>with a SEM of 2, the 66% confidence interval is the range&para;<br>of 70 to 74 (72 ± 2). In this situation, there is approxi­&para;<br>mately a 66% chance that the test-taker’s “true” IQ is&para;<br>between 70 and 74; roughly a 17% chance that it is above&para;<br>74; and roughly a 17% chance that it is 70 or below. Thus,&para;<br>there is about an 83% chance that the score is above 70.&para;<br>Similarly, using two SEMs, we can build a 95% confi­&para;<br>dence interval. The process is the same except that we&para;<br>add two SEMs to and subtract two SEMS from the ob­&para;<br>tained score. To illustrate the use of two SEMs, let us&para;<br>hypothesize a case in which the defendant’s obtained score&para;<br>is 74. With the same SEM of 2 as in the prior example,&para;<br>there would be a 95% chance that the true score is be­&para;<br>tween 70 and 78 (74 ± 4); roughly a 2.5% chance that the&para;<br>score is above 78; and about a 2.5% chance that the score&para;<br>is 70 or below. The probability of a true score above 70&para;<br>would be roughly 97.5%. As these two examples show, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>greater the degree of confidence demanded, the greater&para;<br>the range of scores that will fall within the confidence&para;<br>interval and, therefore, the further away from 70 an ob­&para;<br>tained score could be and yet still have 70 fall within its&para;<br>confidence interval.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Court misunderstands these principles and makes&para;<br>factual mistakes that will surely confuse States attempt­&para;<br>ing to comply with its opinion.&para;<br>First, the Court unjustifiably assumes a blanket (or very&para;<br>common) error measurement of 5. See ante, at 20. That&para;<br>assumption gives rise to the Court’s holding that a de­&para;<br>fendant must be permitted to introduce additional evi­&para;<br>dence when IQ tests reveal an IQ as high as 75. See ibid.&para;<br>SEMs, however, vary by IQ test and test-taker, and there&para;<br>is no reason to assume a SEM of 5 points; indeed, it ap­&para;<br>pears that the SEM is generally “estimated to be three to&para;<br>five points” for well-standardized IQ tests. AAMR 10th ed.&para;<br>57. And we know that the SEM for Hall’s most recent IQ&para;<br>test was 2.16—less than half of the Court’s estimate of 5.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 40, n. 17.&para;<br>Relatedly, the Court misreads the authorities on which&para;<br>it relies to establish this cutoff IQ score of 75. It is true&para;<br>that certain professional organizations have advocated a&para;<br>cutoff of 75 and that Atkins cited those organizations’&para;<br>cutoff. See ante, at 12, 20. But the Court overlooks a&para;<br>critical fact: Those organizations endorsed a 75 IQ cutoff&para;<br>based on their express understanding that “one standard&para;<br>error of measurement [SEM]” is “three to five points for&para;<br>well-standardized” IQ tests. AAMR, Mental Retardation&para;<br>37 (9th ed. 1992) (hereinafter AAMR 9th ed.); Atkins, 536&para;<br>U. S., 309, n. 5 (citing AAMR 9th ed.; 2 Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s&para;<br>2592 (B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock eds., 7th ed. 2000)); see also&para;<br>AAMR 10th ed. 57; AAIDD 11th ed. 36. In other words,&para;<br>the number 75 was relevant only to the extent that a&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HALL v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>single SEM was “estimated” to be as high as 5 points.&para;<br>AAMR 9th ed. 37. Here, by contrast, we know that the&para;<br>SEM for Hall’s latest IQ test was less than half of that&para;<br>estimate; there is no relevance to the number 75 in this&para;<br>case. To blindly import a five-point margin of error when&para;<br>we know as a matter of fact that the relevant SEM is 2.16&para;<br>amounts to requiring consideration of more than two&para;<br>SEMs—an approach that finds no support in Atkins or&para;<br>anywhere else.&para;<br>Because of these factual errors and ambiguities, it is&para;<br>unclear to me whether the Court concludes that a defend­&para;<br>ant is constitutionally entitled to introduce non-test evi­&para;<br>dence of intellectual disability (1) whenever his score is 75&para;<br>or lower, on the mistaken understanding that the SEM for&para;<br>most tests is 5; (2) when the 66% confidence interval&para;<br>(using one SEM) includes a score of 70; or (3) when the&para;<br>95% confidence interval (using two SEMs) includes a score&para;<br>of 70. In my view, none of these approaches is defensible.&para;<br>An approach tied to a fixed score of 75 can be dismissed&para;<br>out of hand because, as discussed, every test has a differ­&para;<br>ent SEM.&para;<br>The other two approaches would require that a defend­&para;<br>ant be permitted to submit additional evidence when his&para;<br>IQ is above 70 so long as the 66% or 95% confidence inter­&para;<br>val (using one SEM or two SEMs, respectively) includes a&para;<br>score of 70, but there is no foundation for this in our&para;<br>Eighth Amendment case law. As Hall concedes, the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment permits States to assign to a defend­&para;<br>ant the burden of establishing intellectual disability by at&para;<br>least a preponderance of the evidence. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>12. In other words, a defendant can be required to prove&para;<br>that the probability of a 70 or sub-70 IQ is greater than&para;<br>50%. Under the Court’s approach, by contrast, a defend­&para;<br>ant could prove significantly subaverage intellectual func­&para;<br>tioning by showing simply that the probability of a “true”&para;<br>IQ of 70 or below is as little as 17% (under a one-SEM&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rule) or 2.5% (under a two-SEM rule). This totally trans­&para;<br>forms the allocation and nature of the burden of proof.&para;<br>I have referred to the 66% and 95% confidence intervals&para;<br>only because they result from the most straightforward&para;<br>application of the SEM in this context: One SEM estab­&para;<br>lishes the 66% confidence interval; two SEMs establish the&para;<br>95% confidence interval. See AAIDD 11th ed. 36. But it&para;<br>would be simple enough to devise a 51% confidence inter­&para;<br>val—or a 99% confidence interval for that matter. There&para;<br>is therefore no excuse for mechanically imposing stand­&para;<br>ards that are unhinged from legal logic and that override valid state laws establishing burdens of proof. The&para;<br>appropriate confidence level is ultimately a judgment best&para;<br>left to legislatures, and their judgment has been that a&para;<br>defendant must establish that it is more likely than not&para;<br>that he is intellectually disabled. I would defer to that&para;<br>determination.&para;<br>3&para;<br>The Court also fails to grasp that Florida’s system al­&para;<br>ready accounts for the risk of testing error by allowing the&para;<br>introduction of multiple test scores. The Court never&para;<br>explains why its criticisms of the uncertainty resulting&para;<br>from the use of a single IQ score apply when a defendant&para;<br>consistently scores above 70 on multiple tests. Contrary to&para;<br>the Court’s evident assumption, the well-accepted view is&para;<br>that multiple consistent scores establish a much higher&para;<br>degree of confidence.13&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 See Oxford Handbook of Child Psychological Assessment 291&para;<br>(D.
