RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1001. Argued October 4, 2011—Decided March 20, 2012&para;<br>Arizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel only in state collateral proceedings, not on direct review. In&para;<br>petitioner Martinez’s first state collateral proceeding, his counsel did&para;<br>not raise such a claim. On federal habeas review with new counsel,&para;<br>Martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial&para;<br>and in his first state collateral proceeding. He also claimed that he&para;<br>had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral&para;<br>proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffective assistance at trial. The District Court denied the petition, finding that Arizona’s preclusion rule was an adequate and independent&para;<br>state-law ground barring federal review, and that under Coleman v.&para;<br>Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, the attorney’s errors in the postconviction&para;<br>proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a&para;<br>procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing&para;<br>those claims if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was&para;<br>no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective. Pp. 5–14.&para;<br>(a) Given that the precise question here is whether ineffective&para;<br>assistance in an initial-review collateral proceeding on an ineffectiveassistance-at-trial claim may provide cause for a procedural default&para;<br>in a federal habeas proceeding, this is not the case to resolve the&para;<br>question left open in Coleman: whether a prisoner has a constitutional right to effective counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings.&para;<br>However, to protect prisoners with potentially legitimate ineffective-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>assistance claims, it is necessary to recognize a narrow exception to&para;<br>Coleman’s unqualified statement that an attorney’s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to&para;<br>excuse a procedural default, namely, that inadequate assistance of&para;<br>counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause.&para;<br>Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) A federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance&para;<br>claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default&para;<br>and prejudice from a violation of federal law. Coleman held that a&para;<br>postconviction attorney’s negligence “does not qualify as ‘cause,’ ” because “the attorney is the prisoner’s agent,” and “the principal bears&para;<br>the risk of ” his agent’s negligent conduct, Maples v. Thomas, ante, at&para;<br>12. However, in Coleman, counsel’s alleged error was on appeal from&para;<br>an initial-review collateral proceeding. Thus, his claims had been&para;<br>addressed by the state habeas trial court. This marks a key difference between initial-review collateral proceedings and other collateral proceedings. Here, where the initial-review collateral proceeding&para;<br>is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the ineffective-assistance claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a&para;<br>prisoner’s direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas&para;<br>court decides the claim’s merits, no other court has addressed the&para;<br>claim, and defendants “are generally ill equipped to represent themselves” where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion&para;<br>addressing their claim. Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617. An&para;<br>attorney’s errors during an appeal on direct review may provide&para;<br>cause to excuse a procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by&para;<br>the State is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and&para;<br>the opportunity to comply with the State’s procedures and obtain an&para;<br>adjudication on the merits of his claim. Without adequate representation in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a prisoner will have&para;<br>similar difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-attrial claim. The same would be true if the State did not appoint an&para;<br>attorney for the initial-review collateral proceeding. A prisoner’s inability to present an ineffective-assistance claim is of particular concern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle&para;<br>in this Nation’s justice system.&para;<br>Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance at trial when an attorney’s errors (or an attorney’s absence)&para;<br>caused a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding&para;<br>acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that a collateral proceeding, if&para;<br>undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel, may not have been&para;<br>sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim. It thus follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to&para;<br>raise a i claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceed-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ing, a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such&para;<br>claim in two circumstances: where the state courts did not appoint&para;<br>counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for an ineffectiveassistance-at-trial claim; and where appointed counsel in the initialreview collateral proceeding, where that claim should have been&para;<br>raised, was ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.&para;<br>668. To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that&para;<br>the underlying ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial.&para;<br>Most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for&para;<br>substantial ineffective-assistance claims. It is likely that such attorneys are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing&para;<br>professional norms. And where that is so, States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(c) This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate stare&para;<br>decisis concerns. Coleman’s holding remains true except as to initialreview collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at&para;<br>trial. The holding in this case should not put a significant strain on&para;<br>state resources. A State facing the question of cause for an apparent&para;<br>default may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claim is insubstantial. The limited circumstances recognized here also reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial.&para;<br>Other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adversary system. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 does not speak to the question presented here, and thus does&para;<br>not bar Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a procedural default. Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>2. Whether Martinez’s attorney in his first collateral proceeding&para;<br>was ineffective and whether his ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim&para;<br>is substantial, as well as the question of prejudice, are questions that&para;<br>remain open for a decision on remand.

Instead, the prisoner must bring&para;<br>the claim in state collateral proceedings. In the instant&para;<br>case, however, petitioner’s postconviction counsel did not&para;<br>raise the ineffective-assistance claim in the first collateral&para;<br>proceeding, and, indeed, filed a statement that, after&para;<br>reviewing the case, she found no meritorious claims help­&para;<br>ful to petitioner. On federal habeas review, and with new&para;<br>counsel, petitioner sought to argue he had received ineffec­&para;<br>tive assistance of counsel at trial and in the first phase of&para;<br>his state collateral proceeding. Because the state collat­&para;<br>eral proceeding was the first place to challenge his conviction on grounds of ineffective assistance, petitioner&para;<br>maintained he had a constitutional right to an effective&para;<br>attorney in the collateral proceeding. While petitioner&para;<br>frames the question in this case as a constitutional one, a&para;<br>more narrow, but still dispositive, formulation is whether&para;<br>a federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an ineffective-assistance claim when the claim was not&para;<br>properly presented in state court due to an attorney’s&para;<br>errors in an initial-review collateral proceeding.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A jury convicted petitioner, Luis Mariano Martinez, of&para;<br>two counts of sexual conduct with a minor under the age&para;<br>of 15. The prosecution introduced a videotaped forensic&para;<br>interview with the victim, Martinez’s 11-year-old step­&para;<br>daughter. It also put in evidence the victim’s nightgown,&para;<br>with traces of Martinez’s DNA. As part of his defense,&para;<br>Martinez introduced evidence of the victim’s recantations,&para;<br>including testimony from the victim’s grandmother and&para;<br>mother and a second videotaped interview in which the&para;<br>victim denied any abuse. The victim also denied any&para;<br>abuse when she testified at trial. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>38a–39a. To explain the inconsistencies, a prosecution&para;<br>expert testified that recantations of child-abuse accusa­&para;<br>tions are caused often by reluctance on the part of the&para;<br>victim’s mother to lend support to the child’s claims. Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 3. After considering the conflicting evidence, the&para;<br>jury convicted Martinez. He was sentenced to two consec­&para;<br>utive terms of life imprisonment with no possibility of&para;<br>parole for 35 years. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.&para;<br>The State appointed a new attorney to represent Mar­&para;<br>tinez in his direct appeal. Ibid.; Pet. for Cert. 4. She&para;<br>made numerous arguments on Martinez’s behalf, includ­&para;<br>ing a claim that the evidence was insufficient and that&para;<br>newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 39a. Arizona law, however, did not permit&para;<br>her to argue on direct appeal that trial counsel was inef­&para;<br>fective. State v. Spreitz, 202 Ariz. 1, 3, 39 P. 3d 525, 527&para;<br>(2002). Arizona instead requires claims of ineffective&para;<br>assistance at trial to be reserved for state collateral&para;<br>proceedings.&para;<br>While Martinez’s direct appeal was pending, the attor­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Schriro, 623 F. 3d&para;<br>731, 733–734 (CA9 2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(a)&para;<br>(2011). Despite initiating this proceeding, counsel made&para;<br>no claim trial counsel was ineffective and later filed a&para;<br>statement asserting she could find no colorable claims at&para;<br>all. 623 F. 3d, at 734. Cf. State v. Smith, 184 Ariz. 456,&para;<br>459, 910 P. 2d 1, 4 (1996).&para;<br>The state trial court hearing the collateral proceeding&para;<br>gave Martinez 45 days to file a pro se petition in support of&para;<br>postconviction relief and to raise any claims he believed&para;<br>his counsel overlooked. 623 F. 3d, at 734; see Smith,&para;<br>supra, at 459, 910 P. 2d, at 4. Martinez did not respond.&para;<br>He later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing col­&para;<br>lateral proceedings and that counsel failed to advise him&para;<br>of the need to file a pro se petition to preserve his rights.&para;<br>The state trial court dismissed the action for postconvic­&para;<br>tion relief, in effect affirming counsel’s determination that&para;<br>Martinez had no meritorious claims. 623 F. 3d, at 734.&para;<br>The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed Martinez’s convic­&para;<br>tion, and the Arizona Supreme Court denied review. Id.,&para;<br>at 733.&para;<br>About a year and a half later, Martinez, now represent­&para;<br>ed by new counsel, filed a second notice of postconviction&para;<br>relief in the Arizona trial court. Id., at 734. Martinez&para;<br>claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to&para;<br>challenge the prosecution’s evidence. He argued, for ex­&para;<br>ample, that his trial counsel should have objected to the&para;<br>expert testimony explaining the victim’s recantations or&para;<br>should have called an expert witness in rebuttal. Mar­&para;<br>tinez also faulted trial counsel for not pursuing an excul­&para;<br>patory explanation for the DNA on the nightgown. App. to&para;<br>Brief in Opposition B–6 to B–12. Martinez’s petition was&para;<br>dismissed, in part in reliance on an Arizona Rule barring&para;<br>relief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous&para;<br>collateral proceeding. Id., at B–27; see Ariz. Rule Crim.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Proc. 32.2(a)(3). Martinez, the theory went, should have&para;<br>asserted the claims of ineffective assistance of trial coun­&para;<br>sel in his first notice for postconviction relief. The Arizona&para;<br>Court of Appeals agreed. It denied Martinez relief be­&para;<br>cause he failed to raise his claims in the first collateral&para;<br>proceeding. 623 F. 3d, at 734. The Arizona Supreme&para;<br>Court declined to review Martinez’s appeal.&para;<br>Martinez then sought relief in United States District&para;<br>Court for the District of Arizona, where he filed a petition&para;<br>for a writ of habeas corpus, again raising the ineffective­&para;<br>assistance-of-trial-counsel claims. Martinez acknowledged&para;<br>the state courts denied his claims by relying on a well­&para;<br>established state procedural rule, which, under the doc­&para;<br>trine of procedural default, would prohibit a federal court&para;<br>from reaching the merits of the claims. See, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85, 90–91 (1977). He&para;<br>could overcome this hurdle to federal review, Martinez&para;<br>argued, because he had cause for the default: His first&para;<br>postconviction counsel was ineffective in failing to raise&para;<br>any claims in the first notice of postconviction relief and in&para;<br>failing to notify Martinez of her actions. See id., at 84–85.&para;<br>On the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation, the District&para;<br>Court denied the petition, ruling that Arizona’s preclusion&para;<br>rule was an adequate and independent state-law ground&para;<br>to bar federal review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. Martinez&para;<br>had not shown cause to excuse the procedural default,&para;<br>the District Court reasoned, because under Coleman v.&para;<br>Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753–754 (1991), an attorney’s&para;<br>errors in a postconviction proceeding do not qualify as&para;<br>cause for a default. See id., at 754–755.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals relied on general statements in&para;<br>Coleman that, absent a right to counsel in a collateral&para;<br>proceeding, an attorney’s errors in the proceeding do not&para;<br>establish cause for a procedural default. Expanding on&para;<br>the District Court’s opinion, the Court of Appeals, citing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Coleman, noted the general rule that there is no constitu­&para;<br>tional right to counsel in collateral proceedings. 623 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 736. The Court of Appeals recognized that Coleman&para;<br>reserved ruling on whether there is “an exception” to this&para;<br>rule in those cases “where ‘state collateral review is the&para;<br>first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his convic­&para;<br>tion.’ ” 623 F. 3d, at 736 (quoting Coleman, supra, at 755).&para;<br>It concluded, nevertheless, that the controlling cases&para;<br>established no basis for the exception. Certiorari was&para;<br>granted. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Coleman v. Thompson, supra, left open, and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals in this case addressed, a question of constitution­&para;<br>al law: whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel&para;<br>in collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion&para;<br>to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. These&para;<br>proceedings can be called, for purposes of this opinion,&para;<br>“initial-review collateral proceedings.” Coleman had suggested, though without holding, that the Constitution&para;<br>may require States to provide counsel in initial-review&para;<br>collateral proceedings because “in [these] cases . . . state&para;<br>collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a&para;<br>challenge to his conviction.” Id., at 755. As Coleman&para;<br>noted, this makes the initial-review collateral proceeding a&para;<br>prisoner’s “one and only appeal” as to an ineffective­&para;<br>assistance claim, id., at 756 (emphasis deleted; internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted), and this may justify an excep­&para;<br>tion to the constitutional rule that there is no right to&para;<br>counsel in collateral proceedings. See id., at 755; Douglas&para;<br>v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 357 (1963) (holding States&para;<br>must appoint counsel on a prisoner’s first appeal).&para;<br>This is not the case, however, to resolve whether that&para;<br>exception exists as a constitutional matter. The precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>assistance at trial may provide cause for a procedural&para;<br>default in a federal habeas proceeding. To protect prison­&para;<br>ers with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assis­&para;<br>tance of trial counsel, it is necessary to modify the unqual­&para;<br>ified statement in Coleman that an attorney’s ignorance&para;<br>or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not&para;<br>qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default. This&para;<br>opinion qualifies Coleman by recognizing a narrow excep­&para;<br>tion: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review&para;<br>collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner’s&para;<br>procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at&para;<br>trial.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of&para;<br>a state prisoner’s conviction and sentence are guided by&para;<br>rules designed to ensure that state-court judgments are&para;<br>accorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the&para;<br>integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federal­&para;<br>ism. These rules include the doctrine of procedural de­&para;<br>fault, under which a federal court will not review the&para;<br>merits of claims, including constitutional claims, that a&para;<br>state court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to&para;<br>abide by a state procedural rule. See, e.g., Coleman, supra, at 747–748; Sykes, supra, at 84–85. A state court’s&para;<br>invocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner’s claims&para;<br>precludes federal review of the claims if, among other&para;<br>requisites, the state procedural rule is a nonfederal&para;<br>ground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is&para;<br>firmly established and consistently followed. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Walker v. Martin, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7–&para;<br>8); Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at&para;<br>7). The doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims&para;<br>from being heard is not without exceptions. A prisoner&para;<br>may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing&para;<br>cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal law. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 750. There is no&para;<br>dispute that Arizona’s procedural bar on successive peti­&para;<br>tions is an independent and adequate state ground. Thus,&para;<br>a federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance&para;<br>claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the proce­&para;<br>dural default.&para;<br>Coleman held that “[n]egligence on the part of a prison­&para;<br>er’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as ‘cause.’ ”&para;<br>Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at&para;<br>12). Coleman reasoned that “because the attorney is the&para;<br>prisoner’s agent . . . under ‘well-settled principles of agen­&para;<br>cy law,’ the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on&para;<br>the part of his agent.” Maples, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>12).&para;<br>Coleman, however, did not present the occasion to apply&para;<br>this principle to determine whether attorney errors in&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceedings may qualify as cause&para;<br>for a procedural default. The alleged failure of counsel in&para;<br>Coleman was on appeal from an initial-review collateral&para;<br>proceeding, and in that proceeding the prisoner’s claims&para;<br>had been addressed by the state habeas trial court. See&para;<br>501 U. S., at 755.&para;<br>As Coleman recognized, this marks a key difference&para;<br>between initial-review collateral proceedings and other&para;<br>kinds of collateral proceedings. When an attorney errs in&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceedings, it is likely that no&para;<br>state court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim.&para;<br>This Court on direct review of the state proceeding could&para;<br>not consider or adjudicate the claim. See, e.g., Fox Film&para;<br>Corp. v. Muller, 296 U. S. 207 (1935); Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875); cf. Coleman, supra, at 730–731.&para;<br>And if counsel’s errors in an initial-review collateral pro­&para;<br>ceeding do not establish cause to excuse the procedural&para;<br>default in a federal habeas proceeding, no court will re­&para;<br>view the prisoner’s claims.&para;<br>The same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>postconviction proceedings. While counsel’s errors in&para;<br>these proceedings preclude any further review of the&para;<br>prisoner’s claim, the claim will have been addressed by&para;<br>one court, whether it be the trial court, the appellate court&para;<br>on direct review, or the trial court in an initial-review&para;<br>collateral proceeding. See, e.g., Coleman, supra, at 756.&para;<br>Where, as here, the initial-review collateral proceeding&para;<br>is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance at trial, the collateral pro­&para;<br>ceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s&para;<br>direct appeal as to the ineffective-assistance claim. This&para;<br>is because the state habeas court “looks to the merits of&para;<br>the clai[m]” of ineffective assistance, no other court has&para;<br>addressed the claim, and “defendants pursuing first-tier&para;<br>review . . . are generally ill equipped to represent them­&para;<br>selves” because they do not have a brief from counsel or an&para;<br>opinion of the court addressing their claim of error. Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617 (2005); see Douglas,&para;<br>372 U. S., at 357–358.&para;<br>As Coleman recognized, an attorney’s errors during an&para;<br>appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a&para;<br>procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by the&para;<br>State to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective, the prison­&para;<br>er has been denied fair process and the opportunity to&para;<br>comply with the State’s procedures and obtain an adjudi­&para;<br>cation on the merits of his claims. See 501 U. S., at 754;&para;<br>Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985); Douglas, supra,&para;<br>at 357–358. Without the help of an adequate attorney,&para;<br>a prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a&para;<br>substantial ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.&para;<br>Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require&para;<br>investigative work and an understanding of trial strategy.&para;<br>When the issue cannot be raised on direct review, moreover, a prisoner asserting an ineffective-assistance-of-trial­&para;<br>counsel claim in an initial-review collateral proceeding&para;<br>cannot rely on a court opinion or the prior work of an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>attorney addressing that claim. Halbert, 545 U. S., at 619.&para;<br>To present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in&para;<br>accordance with the State’s procedures, then, a prisoner&para;<br>likely needs an effective attorney.&para;<br>The same would be true if the State did not appoint an&para;<br>attorney to assist the prisoner in the initial-review collat­&para;<br>eral proceeding. The prisoner, unlearned in the law, may&para;<br>not comply with the State’s procedural rules or may mis­&para;<br>apprehend the substantive details of federal constitutional&para;<br>law. Cf., e.g., id., at 620–621 (describing the educational&para;<br>background of the prison population). While confined to&para;<br>prison, the prisoner is in no position to develop the eviden­&para;<br>tiary basis for a claim of ineffective assistance, which often&para;<br>turns on evidence outside the trial record.&para;<br>A prisoner’s inability to present a claim of trial error is&para;<br>of particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective&para;<br>assistance of counsel. The right to the effective assistance&para;<br>of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice&para;<br>system. It is deemed as an “obvious truth” the idea that&para;<br>“any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a&para;<br>lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is&para;<br>provided for him.” Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335,&para;<br>344 (1963). Indeed, the right to counsel is the foundation&para;<br>for our adversary system. Defense counsel tests the pros­&para;<br>ecution’s case to ensure that the proceedings serve the&para;<br>function of adjudicating guilt or innocence, while protect­&para;<br>ing the rights of the person charged. See, e.g., Powell v.&para;<br>Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68–69 (1932) (“[The defendant]&para;<br>requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the&para;<br>proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not&para;<br>guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does&para;<br>not know how to establish his innocence”). Effective trial&para;<br>counsel preserves claims to be considered on appeal, see,&para;<br>e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b), and in federal habeas&para;<br>proceedings, Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446 (2000).&para;<br>This is not to imply the State acted with any impropri­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a&para;<br>collateral proceeding. See Massaro v. United States, 538&para;<br>U. S. 500, 505 (2003). Ineffective-assistance claims often&para;<br>depend on evidence outside the trial record. Direct ap­&para;<br>peals, without evidentiary hearings, may not be as effec­&para;<br>tive as other proceedings for developing the factual basis&para;<br>for the claim. Ibid. Abbreviated deadlines to expand the&para;<br>record on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for&para;<br>an attorney to investigate the ineffective-assistance claim.&para;<br>See Primus, Structural Reform in Criminal Defense, 92&para;<br>Cornell L. Rev. 679, 689, and n. 57 (2004) (most rules give&para;<br>between 5 and 30 days from the time of conviction to file a&para;<br>request to expand the record on appeal). Thus, there are&para;<br>sound reasons for deferring consideration of ineffective­&para;<br>assistance-of-trial-counsel claims until the collateral­&para;<br>review stage, but this decision is not without consequences&para;<br>for the State’s ability to assert a procedural default in&para;<br>later proceedings. By deliberately choosing to move trial­&para;<br>ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process,&para;<br>where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State&para;<br>significantly diminishes prisoners’ ability to file such&para;<br>claims. It is within the context of this state procedural&para;<br>framework that counsel’s ineffectiveness in an initial­&para;<br>review collateral proceeding qualifies as cause for a proce­&para;<br>dural default.&para;<br>The rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to&para;<br>excuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise&para;<br>of the Court’s discretion. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.&para;<br>467, 490 (1991); see also Coleman, supra, at 730–731;&para;<br>Sykes, 433 U. S., at 83; Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984);&para;<br>Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963), overruled in part&para;<br>by Sykes, supra. These rules reflect an equitable judg­&para;<br>ment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed&para;<br>in complying with the State’s established procedures will a&para;<br>federal habeas court excuse the prisoner from the usual&para;<br>sanction of default. See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>263, 289 (1999); Reed, supra, at 16. Allowing a federal&para;<br>habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of&para;<br>trial counsel when an attorney’s errors (or the absence of&para;<br>an attorney) caused a procedural default in an initial­&para;<br>review collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable&para;<br>matter, that the initial-review collateral proceeding, if&para;<br>undertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel,&para;<br>may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consid­&para;<br>eration was given to a substantial claim. From this it&para;<br>follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise an&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a collateral&para;<br>proceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a default of&para;<br>an ineffective-assistance claim in two circumstances. The&para;<br>first is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in&para;<br>the initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of inef­&para;<br>fective assistance at trial. The second is where appointed&para;<br>counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where&para;<br>the claim should have been raised, was ineffective under&para;<br>the standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668&para;<br>(1984). To overcome the default, a prisoner must also&para;<br>demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of­&para;<br>trial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say&para;<br>that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has&para;<br>some merit. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003)&para;<br>(describing standards for certificates of appealability to&para;<br>issue).&para;<br>Most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure&para;<br>counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance&para;<br>claims. Some States, including Arizona, appoint counsel&para;<br>in every first collateral proceeding. See, e.g., Alaska Stat.&para;<br>18.85.100(c) (2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(c)(2)&para;<br>(2011); Conn. Gen. Stat. §51–296(a) (2011); Me. Rules&para;<br>Crim. Proc. 69, 70(c) (2010); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §7A–&para;<br>451(a)(2) (2009); N. J. Ct.

It is likely that most of the&para;<br>attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional&para;<br>norms; and, where that is so, the States may enforce a&para;<br>procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.&para;<br>B&para;<br>This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate&para;<br>the usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests pro­&para;<br>tected by stare decisis principles. Cf., e.g., Montejo v.&para;<br>Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009). Coleman held&para;<br>that an attorney’s negligence in a postconviction proceed­&para;<br>ing does not establish cause, and this remains true except&para;<br>as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of&para;<br>ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Coleman itself&para;<br>did not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceeding with respect to a claim&para;<br>of ineffective trial counsel; and in the 20 years since Coleman was decided, we have not held Coleman applies in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>circumstances like this one.&para;<br>The holding here ought not to put a significant strain on&para;<br>state resources. When faced with the question whether&para;<br>there is cause for an apparent default, a State may answer&para;<br>that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is in­&para;<br>substantial, i.e., it does not have any merit or that it is&para;<br>wholly without factual support, or that the attorney in the&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceeding did not perform below&para;<br>constitutional standards.&para;<br>This is but one of the differences between a constitu­&para;<br>tional ruling and the equitable ruling of this case. A&para;<br>constitutional ruling would provide defendants a free­&para;<br>standing constitutional claim to raise; it would require the&para;<br>appointment of counsel in initial-review collateral proceed­&para;<br>ings; it would impose the same system of appointing coun­&para;<br>sel in every State; and it would require a reversal in all&para;<br>state collateral cases on direct review from state courts if&para;<br>the States’ system of appointing counsel did not conform to&para;<br>the constitutional rule. An equitable ruling, by contrast,&para;<br>permits States a variety of systems for appointing counsel&para;<br>in initial-review collateral proceedings. And it permits a&para;<br>State to elect between appointing counsel in initial-review&para;<br>collateral proceedings or not asserting a procedural de­&para;<br>fault and raising a defense on the merits in federal habeas&para;<br>proceedings. In addition, state collateral cases on direct&para;<br>review from state courts are unaffected by the ruling in&para;<br>this case.&para;<br>The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited cir­&para;<br>cumstances recognized here. The holding in this case does&para;<br>not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,&para;<br>including appeals from initial-review collateral proceed­&para;<br>ings, second or successive collateral proceedings, and&para;<br>petitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate&para;<br>courts. See 501 U. S., at 754; Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488.

RYAN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceeding may be deficient for&para;<br>other reasons.&para;<br>In addition, the limited nature of the qualification to&para;<br>Coleman adopted here reflects the importance of the right&para;<br>to the effective assistance of trial counsel and Arizona’s&para;<br>decision to bar defendants from raising ineffective­&para;<br>assistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here&para;<br>addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this&para;<br>case, where the State barred the defendant from raising&para;<br>the claims on direct appeal.&para;<br>Arizona contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective&para;<br>Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254,&para;<br>bars Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for&para;<br>a procedural default. AEDPA refers to attorney error in&para;<br>collateral proceedings, but it does not speak to the ques­&para;<br>tion presented in this case. Section 2254(i) provides that&para;<br>“the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during&para;<br>Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings&para;<br>shall not be a ground for relief.” “Cause,” however, is not&para;<br>synonymous with “a ground for relief.” A finding of cause&para;<br>and prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief.&para;<br>It merely allows a federal court to consider the merits of&para;<br>a claim that otherwise would have been procedurally de­&para;<br>faulted. In this case, for example, Martinez’s “ground for&para;<br>relief ” is his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, a&para;<br>claim that AEDPA does not bar. Martinez relies on the&para;<br>ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney to excuse his&para;<br>failure to comply with Arizona’s procedural rules, not as&para;<br>an independent basis for overturning his conviction. In&para;<br>short, while §2254(i) precludes Martinez from relying on&para;<br>the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a&para;<br>“ground for relief,” it does not stop Martinez from using it&para;<br>to establish “cause.” Holland v.

After all, that&para;<br>would have meant, in a case such as the one before us,&para;<br>that failing to provide assistance of counsel, or providing&para;<br>assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland&para;<br>standard, would constitute cause for excusing procedural&para;<br>default. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668&para;<br>(1984). Instead of taking that radical step, the Court&para;<br>holds that, for equitable reasons, in a case such as the one&para;<br>before us, failing to provide assistance of counsel, or&para;<br>providing assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland standard, constitutes cause for excusing procedural&para;<br>default. The result, of course, is precisely the same.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Ah, but perhaps the explanation of why the Court’s&para;<br>action today amounts to praiseworthy self-restraint is this:&para;<br>It pronounces this excuse from the usual rule of procedural default only in initial-review state habeas raising an&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. But it could&para;<br>have limited its invention of a new constitutional right to&para;<br>collateral-review counsel in precisely the same fashion—&para;<br>and with precisely the same consequences. Moreover, no&para;<br>one really believes that the newly announced “equitable”&para;<br>rule will remain limited to ineffective-assistance-of-trialcounsel cases. There is not a dime’s worth of difference&para;<br>in principle between those cases and many other cases in&para;<br>which initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for&para;<br>a particular claim to be raised: claims of “newly discovered” prosecutorial misconduct, for example, see Brady v.&para;<br>Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), claims based on “newly&para;<br>discovered” exculpatory evidence or “newly discovered”&para;<br>impeachment of prosecutorial witnesses, and claims asserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The&para;<br>Court’s soothing assertion, ante, at 14, that its holding&para;<br>“addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this&para;<br>case,” insults the reader’s intelligence.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Court also seeks to restrict its holding to cases in which the&para;<br>State has “deliberately cho[sen]” to move the asserted claim “outside of&para;<br>the direct-appeal process,” ante, at 10. That line lacks any principled&para;<br>basis, and will not last. Is there any relevant difference between cases&para;<br>in which the State says that certain claims can only be brought on&para;<br>collateral review and cases in which those claims by their nature can&para;<br>only be brought on collateral review, since they do not manifest themselves until the appellate process is complete? Our cases establish that&para;<br>to constitute cause for failure to raise an issue on direct review, the&para;<br>excuse must be “an objective factor external to the defense.” See infra,&para;<br>at 7. That the factual basis for a claim was not available until the&para;<br>collateral-review stage is no less such a factor than a State’s requiring&para;<br>that a claim be brought on collateral review. See Murray v. Carrier,&para;<br>477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). The Court’s asserted limitation makes sense&para;<br>only if the opinion means that a State has “deliberately chos[en]” to&para;<br>move newly-arisen claims “outside of the direct-appeal process” if it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Despite the Court’s suggestion&para;<br>to the contrary, see ante, at 13, the rule it adopts calls into&para;<br>question the common state practice of not appointing&para;<br>counsel in all first collateral proceedings, see ante, at 11–&para;<br>12. It does not, to be sure, call into question the lawfulness of that practice; only its sanity. For if the prisoner&para;<br>goes through state collateral proceedings without counsel,&para;<br>and fails to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claim which is, because of that failure, defaulted, the&para;<br>default will not preclude federal habeas review of the&para;<br>merits of that claim. And since ineffective assistance of&para;<br>trial counsel is a monotonously standard claim on federal&para;<br>habeas (has a duly convicted defendant ever been effectively represented?), whoever advises the State would himself&para;<br>be guilty of ineffective assistance if he did not counsel&para;<br>the appointment of state-collateral-review counsel in all&para;<br>cases—lest the failure to raise that claim in the state proceedings be excused and the State be propelled into federal&para;<br>habeas review of the adequacy of trial-court representation that occurred many years ago.2 Which is to say that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>fails to reopen the direct-appeal process in order to entertain such&para;<br>claims. Such a radical change in what we require of the States surely&para;<br>ought to be prescribed by language clearer than what today’s opinion&para;<br>contains.&para;<br>2 The Court says that to establish cause a prisoner must demonstrate&para;<br>that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is “substantial,”&para;<br>which apparently means the claim has at least some merit. See ante, at&para;<br>11. The Court does not explain where this substantiality standard&para;<br>comes from, and how it differs from the normal rule that a prisoner&para;<br>must demonstrate actual prejudice to avoid the enforcement of a&para;<br>procedural default, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750&para;<br>(1991). But whatever the standard, examination of the adequacy of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Court’s pretended avoidance of requiring States to appoint collateral-review counsel is a sham.3&para;<br>Of course even the appointment of state-collateralreview counsel will not guarantee that the State’s criminal&para;<br>proceeding can be concluded without years-long federal&para;<br>retrial. Appointment of counsel may, as I have said, avoid&para;<br>federal review of the adequacy of representation that&para;<br>occurred years ago, at the original trial. But since, under&para;<br>today’s opinion, the condition for exclusion of federal&para;<br>habeas is the very same condition that would apply if&para;<br>appointment of state-collateral-review counsel were constitutionally required, it will remain to be determined in&para;<br>federal habeas review whether the state-appointed counsel&para;<br>was effective. Thus, as a consequence of today’s decision&para;<br>the States will always be forced to litigate in federal habeas, for all defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel&para;<br>claims (and who knows what other claims), either (1) the&para;<br>validity of the defaulted claim (where collateral-review&para;<br>counsel was not appointed), or (2) the effectiveness of&para;<br>collateral-review counsel (where collateral-review counsel&para;<br>was appointed). The Court notes that many States already provide for the appointment of counsel in first col——————&para;<br>years-ago representation has been substituted for summary dismissal&para;<br>by reason of procedural default.&para;<br>3 The Court also claims, ante, at 13, that its “equitable” ruling, unlike&para;<br>a constitutional ruling, will not require “a reversal in all state collateral&para;<br>cases on direct review from state courts” where counsel has not been&para;<br>appointed. Surely the Court does not mean to suggest that an unconstitutional failure to appoint counsel on collateral review, like an&para;<br>unconstitutional failure to appoint counsel at trial, would require the&para;<br>entire conviction to be set aside. That is inconceivable. So either one of&para;<br>two things would happen: Either the reviewing state court would be&para;<br>able to inquire into prejudice (which is an improvement over having the&para;<br>federal habeas court make that inquiry, as the Court’s “equitable”&para;<br>solution requires); or else the appellate state court will remand for a&para;<br>collateral proceeding with counsel (which is, as we have said, just what&para;<br>the Court’s “equitable” ruling effectively requires anyway). So the&para;<br>Court’s “equitable” ruling is no boon to the States.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lateral challenges—as though this proves that what the&para;<br>Court forces the States to do today is eminently reasonable. But what the Court fails to point out is that currently, when state-appointed counsel does not raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, that is the end of the&para;<br>matter: The issue has been procedurally defaulted. By&para;<br>virtue of today’s opinion, however, all those cases can (and&para;<br>where capital punishment is at issue assuredly will) proceed to federal habeas on the issue of whether stateappointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel issue. That is the&para;<br>meaning of the Court’s (supposedly comforting) statement:&para;<br>“It is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by&para;<br>the courts are qualified to perform, and do perform,&para;<br>according to prevailing professional norms; and, where&para;<br>that is so, the States may enforce a procedural default&para;<br>in federal habeas proceedings.” Ante, at 12 (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>To be more precise, the Court should have said “where&para;<br>that is so, and where federal habeas courts have finally&para;<br>rejected claims that it is not so, the States may enforce a&para;<br>procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.”&para;<br>I cannot possibly imagine the basis for the Court’s confidence, ante, at 12–13, that all this will not put a significant strain on state resources. The principal escape route&para;<br>from federal habeas—existence of an “adequate and independent state ground”—has been closed.4 Whether&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See N. King, F. Cheesman, &amp; B.

In practical effect, that may&para;<br>not make much difference in noncapital cases (except for&para;<br>the squandering of state taxpayers’ money): The defendant&para;<br>will stay in prison, continuing to serve his sentence, while&para;<br>federal habeas review grinds on. But in capital cases, it will&para;<br>effectively reduce the sentence, giving the defendant as&para;<br>many more years to live, beyond the lives of the innocent&para;<br>victims whose life he snuffed out, as the process of federal&para;<br>habeas may consume. I guarantee that an assertion of&para;<br>ineffective assistance of trial counsel will be made in all&para;<br>capital cases from this date on, causing (because of today’s&para;<br>holding) execution of the sentence to be deferred until&para;<br>either that claim, or the claim that appointed counsel was&para;<br>ineffective in failing to make that claim, has worked its&para;<br>way through the federal system.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court would have us believe that today’s holding&para;<br>is no more than a “limited qualification” to Coleman v.&para;<br>Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Ante, at 12. It is much&para;<br>more than that: a repudiation of the longstanding principle governing procedural default, which Coleman and&para;<br>other cases consistently applied. Coleman itself involved a&para;<br>habeas petitioner’s contention that his attorney’s failure to&para;<br>file a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceeding, which resulted in procedural default of the claims&para;<br>raised in that proceeding, was cause to excuse that default&para;<br>in federal habeas. 501 U. S., at 752. The petitioner in&para;<br>that case contended that whether a violation of his constitutional right to effective counsel had occurred was of no&para;<br>consequence, so long as the attorney’s conduct fell short of&para;<br>the effectiveness standard set forth in Strickland. See 501&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>Clerk of Court’s case file). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S., at 753. Whereas Coleman flatly repudiated that&para;<br>claim as being inconsistent with our precedent, see ibid.,&para;<br>today’s majority wholeheartedly embraces it, ante, at 11.&para;<br>Rejection of the argument in Coleman was compelled by&para;<br>our jurisprudence pertaining to cause for excusing procedural default, and in particular Murray v. Carrier, 477&para;<br>U. S. 478 (1986). See Coleman, supra, at 752–753. Carrier involved the failure of a defendant’s attorney to raise a&para;<br>claim on direct appeal. 477 U. S., at 482. This failure did&para;<br>not constitute cause, we explained, because it was not an&para;<br>“objective factor external to the defense.” Id., at 488 (emphasis added). This external-factor requirement reflects&para;<br>the judgment that States should not be forced to undergo&para;<br>federal habeas review of a defaulted claim unless a factor&para;<br>not attributable to the prisoner obstructed his compliance&para;<br>with state procedures. See id., at 487–488.&para;<br>Although this externality requirement has been the&para;<br>North Star of our excuse-for-cause jurisprudence, today’s&para;<br>opinion does not whisper its name—no doubt because it is&para;<br>impossible to say that Martinez’s procedural default was&para;<br>caused by a factor external to his defense. Coleman and&para;<br>Carrier set forth in clear terms when it is that attorney&para;<br>error constitutes an external factor: Attorney error by itself does not, because when an attorney acts (or fails to&para;<br>act) in furtherance of the litigation, he is acting as the&para;<br>petitioner’s agent. Coleman, supra, at 753; Carrier, supra,&para;<br>at 492. Any other rule would be inconsistent with our&para;<br>system of representative litigation, under which “each&para;<br>party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.”&para;<br>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92&para;<br>(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). But when&para;<br>attorney error amounts to constitutionally ineffective&para;<br>assistance of counsel, that error is imputed to the State&para;<br>(for the State has failed to comply with the constitutional&para;<br>requirement to provide effective counsel), rendering the&para;<br>error external to the petitioner. Coleman, supra, at 754;&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Carrier, supra, at 488. Accordingly, as Martinez himself&para;<br>appears to recognize, see Brief for Petitioner 22, our cases&para;<br>require that absent a determination that Arizona violated&para;<br>the Constitution by failing to provide effective counsel,&para;<br>attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse his procedural default. Rather than apply that rule here, the Court&para;<br>adopts the very approach Coleman explicitly addressed&para;<br>and rejected.&para;<br>The Court essentially disclaims any need to give full&para;<br>consideration to the principle of stare decisis because&para;<br>Coleman did not involve an initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See ante, at 12. That is rather like saying that Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), does not establish&para;<br>our authority to review the constitutionality of a new&para;<br>federal statute because it involved a different enactment.&para;<br>Just as the reasoning of Marbury was categorical, so was&para;<br>the reasoning of Coleman and Carrier: Attorney error is&para;<br>not an external factor constituting cause for excusing&para;<br>default unless the State has a constitutional obligation to&para;<br>provide effective counsel. Had the majority seriously&para;<br>considered the relevant stare decisis factors, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009), it&para;<br>would have had difficulty justifying today’s decision. Nor&para;<br>can it escape the demands of stare decisis by saying that&para;<br>our rules regarding the excuse of procedural default reflect&para;<br>an “equitable judgment” that is “elaborated in the exercise&para;<br>of the Court’s discretion.” Ante, at 10. Equity is not lawlessness, and discretion is not license to cast aside established jurisprudence reaffirmed this very Term. See Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)&para;<br>(“Negligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction&para;<br>attorney does not qualify as ‘cause’ ” (quoting Coleman,&para;<br>supra, at 753)). “ ‘[C]ourts of equity must be governed by&para;<br>rules and precedents no less than courts of law.’ ” Lonchar&para;<br>v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996) (quoting Missouri&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring)).&para;<br>Noticeably absent from the Court’s equitable analysis,&para;<br>moreover, is any consideration of the very reason for a&para;<br>procedural-default rule: the comity and respect that federal courts must accord state-court judgments.&para;<br>See&para;<br>Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446, 451 (2000). The&para;<br>procedural-default doctrine reflects the understanding that&para;<br>federal review of defaulted claims may “circumvent the&para;<br>jurisdictional limits of direct review and ‘undermine the&para;<br>State’s interest in enforcing its laws.’ ” Lee v. Kemna, 534&para;<br>U. S. 362, 388 (2002) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting&para;<br>Coleman, supra, at 731). Unlike today’s decision, Carrier&para;<br>and Coleman took account of the significant costs federal&para;<br>habeas review imposes on States, including the “reduction&para;<br>in the finality of litigation and the frustration of ‘both the&para;<br>States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their&para;<br>good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.’ ” Carrier, supra, at 487 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107,&para;<br>128 (1982)). Criminal conviction ought to be final before&para;<br>society has forgotten the crime that justifies it. When a&para;<br>case arrives at federal habeas, the state conviction and&para;<br>sentence at issue (never mind the underlying crime) are&para;<br>already a dim memory, on average more than 6 years old&para;<br>(7 years for capital cases).5 I would adhere to the precedents that prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>We granted certiorari on, and the parties addressed&para;<br>their arguments to, the following question:&para;<br>“Whether a defendant in a state criminal case who is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 See&para;<br>&para;<br>King, Cheesman, &amp; Ostrom, Final Technical Report, at 21–22&para;<br>(reporting the average interval between state judgment and federal&para;<br>habeas filing for a sample of federal habeas cases filed in the early-tomid 2000’s).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v.

To avoid his procedural default,&para;<br>Martinez advocates in favor of an exception to this rule&para;<br>where the prisoner seeks the right to counsel in an initialreview collateral proceeding—an argument we have previously declined to address. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 755.&para;<br>The argument is quite clearly foreclosed by our precedent. In Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987), and&para;<br>Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989), we stated unequivocally that prisoners do not “have a constitutional&para;<br>right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon&para;<br>their convictions.” Finley, supra, at 555. See also Giarratano, 492 U. S., at 10 (plurality opinion) (“[T]he rule&para;<br>of Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differently&para;<br>in capital cases than in noncapital cases”); id., at 14&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (indicating that&para;<br>the Constitution does not categorically require States to&para;<br>provide counsel to death-row inmates seeking state habeas&para;<br>review). Though Finley may have involved only claims&para;<br>that could have been raised on direct review, see 481 U. S.,&para;<br>at 553; Giarratano, supra, at 24 (Stevens, J., dissenting),&para;<br>the Court was no doubt aware that States often limit “the&para;<br>collateral review process [to] issues that have not previously been litigated or argued on the direct appeal.” Brief&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

And Giarratano, which involved a class action filed&para;<br>under 42 U. S. C. §1983, addressed the general assertion&para;<br>that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel&para;<br>for collateral attacks on capital convictions. See 492 U. S.,&para;<br>at 3–4 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected that assertion without qualification. The dissenting opinion, moreover, made the precise argument Martinez now asserts:&para;<br>under state law “some claims [including ineffective assistance of trial counsel] ordinarily heard on direct review&para;<br>will be relegated to postconviction proceedings.” Id., at 24&para;<br>(Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Brief for Respondents in&para;<br>Giarratano, O. T. 1988, No. 88–411, p. 29, n. 8 (“In [Virginia capital habeas] proceedings, Death Row inmates&para;<br>seek to assert claims that have not been, and could not&para;<br>have been addressed on direct appeal . . . ”). Thus, in&para;<br>announcing a categorical rule in Finley, see Giarratano,&para;<br>supra, at 12 (plurality opinion), and then reaffirming it in&para;<br>Giarratano, the Court knew full well that a collateral&para;<br>proceeding may present the first opportunity for a prisoner to raise a constitutional claim. I would follow that rule&para;<br>in this case and reject Martinez’s argument that there is a&para;<br>constitutional right to counsel in initial-review collateral&para;<br>proceedings.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Far from avoiding the consequences a constitutional&para;<br>holding would have imposed on the States, today’s holding&para;<br>as a practical matter requires States to appoint counsel in&para;<br>initial-review collateral proceedings—and, to boot, eliminates the pre-existing assurance of escaping federalhabeas review for claims that appointed counsel fails to&para;<br>present. Despite the Court’s protestations to the contrary,&para;<br>the decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurisprudence that will impose considerable economic costs on the&para;<br>States and further impair their ability to provide justice in&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. RYAN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>a timely fashion. The balance it strikes between the finality of criminal judgments and the need to provide for&para;<br>review of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial&para;<br>counsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such&para;<br>claims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue&para;<br>(since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed&para;<br>counsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims. The&para;<br>balance might have been close (though it would disregard&para;<br>our established jurisprudence) if the Court merely held&para;<br>that uncounseled failure to raise ineffective assistance of&para;<br>trial counsel would not constitute default. But in adding&para;<br>to that the rule that counseled failure to raise it may also&para;<br>provide an excuse, the Court creates a monstrosity. For&para;<br>these reasons, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
