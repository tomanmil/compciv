MARCUS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1341. Argued February 24, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>Respondent Marcus was convicted of engaging in forced labor and sex&para;<br>trafficking between January 1999 and October 2001. On appeal, he&para;<br>pointed out for the first time that the federal statutes he violated did&para;<br>not become law until October 2000. Thus, he claimed, the indictment&para;<br>and evidence permitted at trial allowed a jury to convict him exclu&para;<br>sively on the basis of preenactment conduct in violation of the Ex Post&para;<br>Facto Clause. He conceded that he had not raised this objection in&para;<br>the District Court, but argued that because the constitutional error&para;<br>was plain, his conviction must be set aside. The Second Circuit&para;<br>agreed and vacated the conviction. In doing so, the court held that,&para;<br>even in the case of a continuing offense, retrial is necessary if there is&para;<br>“any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could have&para;<br>convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.” The court&para;<br>noted that this was “true even under plain error review.”&para;<br>Held: The Second Circuit’s plain-error standard conflicts with this&para;<br>Court’s interpretation of the plain-error rule. An appellate court may&para;<br>recognize a “plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if that&para;<br>error was “not brought” to the district court’s “attention.” Fed. Rule&para;<br>Crim. Proc. 52(b). This Court’s cases interpret this rule such that an&para;<br>appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at&para;<br>trial only when the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error;&para;<br>(2) the error is clear or obvious; (3) the error affected the appellant’s&para;<br>substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, in&para;<br>tegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.&para;<br>The standard the Second Circuit applied in this case is inconsistent&para;<br>with the third and fourth of these criteria. To begin, it is irreconcil&para;<br>able with the criterion that the error “affec[t] the appellant’s substan&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tial rights,” Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. This condi&para;<br>tion requires the error to be prejudicial, meaning that there is a rea&para;<br>sonable probability that the error affected the trial’s outcome, not&para;<br>that there is “any possibility,” however remote, that the jury could&para;<br>have convicted based exclusively on preenactment conduct.&para;<br>Nor does this error fall within the category of “structural errors”&para;<br>that may “affect substantial rights” regardless of their actual impact&para;<br>on an appellant’s trial. Id., at ___. Here, a jury instruction might&para;<br>have minimized or eliminated the risk that Marcus would have been&para;<br>convicted based solely on preenactment conduct. A reviewing court&para;<br>should find it no more difficult to assess the failure to give such an&para;<br>instruction than to assess numerous other instructional errors previ&para;<br>ously found nonstructural, see, e.g., Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___&para;<br>(per curiam). The Court further rejects Marcus’ argument that the&para;<br>error at issue should be labeled an Ex Post Facto Clause violation,&para;<br>and that all such violations should be treated as special, structural&para;<br>errors warranting reversal without a showing of prejudice. As an ini&para;<br>tial matter, the Government never argued that the statute that&para;<br>criminalized Marcus’ conduct applied retroactively, and Marcus’&para;<br>claim is thus properly brought under the Due Process, and not the&para;<br>Ex Post Facto, Clause. Moreover, we see no reason why errors simi&para;<br>lar to the one at issue in this case, taken as a class, would automati&para;<br>cally affect substantial rights without a showing of prejudice.&para;<br>In any event, the Second Circuit’s “any possibility,” however re&para;<br>mote, standard also cannot be reconciled with the criterion that “the&para;<br>error seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of&para;<br>judicial proceedings.” Puckett, supra, at ___ (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Under the Second Circuit’s approach, a retrial&para;<br>would be required even where the evidence supporting conviction&para;<br>consists of a few days of preenactment conduct along with several&para;<br>continuous years of identical postenactment conduct. Given the tiny&para;<br>risk that a jury would base its conviction in these circumstances on&para;<br>the few preenactment days alone, such an error is most unlikely to&para;<br>cast serious doubt on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of&para;<br>the judicial system.

GLENN MARCUS&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[May 24, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The question before us concerns an appellate court’s&para;<br>“plain error” review of a claim not raised at trial. See Fed.&para;<br>Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). The Second Circuit has said that&para;<br>it must recognize a “plain error” if there is “any possibil&para;<br>ity,” however remote, that a jury convicted a defendant&para;<br>exclusively on the basis of actions taken before enactment&para;<br>of the statute that made those actions criminal. 538 F. 3d&para;<br>97, 102 (2008) (per curiam) (emphasis added). In our view,&para;<br>the Second Circuit’s standard is inconsistent with this&para;<br>Court’s “plain error” cases. We therefore reverse.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A federal grand jury indicted respondent Glenn Marcus&para;<br>on charges that he engaged in unlawful forced labor and&para;<br>sex trafficking between “ ‘January 1999 and October&para;<br>2001.’ ” Id., at 100; see also 18 U. S. C. §§1589, 1591(a)(1).&para;<br>At trial, the Government presented evidence of his conduct&para;<br>during that entire period. 538 F. 3d, at 100. And a jury&para;<br>found him guilty of both charges. Ibid.&para;<br>On appeal, Marcus pointed out for the first time that the&para;<br>statutes he violated were enacted as part of the Traffick&para;<br>ing Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), which did not&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>become law until October 28, 2000. §112(a)(2), 114 Stat.&para;<br>1486. Marcus noted that the indictment and the evidence&para;<br>presented at trial permitted a jury to convict him exclu&para;<br>sively upon the basis of actions that he took before October&para;<br>28, 2000. And for that reason, Marcus argued that his&para;<br>conviction violated the Constitution—in Marcus’ view, the&para;<br>Ex Post Facto Clause, Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Marcus conceded&para;<br>that he had not objected on these grounds in the District&para;<br>Court. Letter Brief for Appellant in No. 07–4005–cr&para;<br>(CA2), p. 12. But, he said, the constitutional error is&para;<br>“plain,” and his conviction therefore must be set aside.&para;<br>Id., at 13.&para;<br>The Government replied by arguing that Marcus’ con&para;<br>viction was for a single course of conduct, some of which&para;<br>took place before, and some of which took place after, the&para;<br>statute’s enactment date. 538 F. 3d, at 101. The Consti&para;<br>tution, it said, does not forbid the application of a new&para;<br>statute to such a course of conduct so long as the course of&para;<br>conduct continued after the enactment of the statute. See,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Harris, 79 F. 3d 223, 229 (CA2 1996);&para;<br>United States v. Duncan, 42 F. 3d 97, 104 (CA2 1994).&para;<br>The Government conceded that the conviction could not&para;<br>rest exclusively upon conduct which took place before the&para;<br>TVPA’s enactment, but it argued that the possibility that&para;<br>the jury here had convicted on that basis was “ ‘remote.’ ”&para;<br>538 F. 3d, at 102. Hence, the Government claimed, it was&para;<br>highly unlikely that the judge’s failure to make this aspect&para;<br>of the law clear (say, by explaining to the jury that it could&para;<br>not convict based on preenactment conduct alone) affected&para;<br>Marcus’ “substantial rights.” Letter Brief for United&para;<br>States in No. 07–4005–cr (CA2), p. 9. And the Govern&para;<br>ment thus argued that the court should not recognize a&para;<br>“plain error.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Second Circuit noted that Marcus had not raised&para;<br>his ex post facto argument in the District Court. 538 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 102. The court also recognized that, under Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>precedent, the Constitution did not prohibit conviction for&para;<br>a “ ‘continuing offense’ ” so long as the conviction rested, at&para;<br>least in part, upon postenactment conduct. Id., at 101&para;<br>(quoting Harris, supra, at 229). But, the court held, “even&para;<br>in the case of a continuing offense, if it was possible for the&para;<br>jury—wh[ich] had not been given instructions regarding&para;<br>the date of enactment—to convict exclusively on [the basis&para;<br>of] pre-enactment conduct, then the conviction constitutes&para;<br>a violation” of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 538 F. 3d, at 101.&para;<br>The court noted that this was “true even under plain error&para;<br>review.” Ibid. In short, under the Second Circuit’s ap&para;<br>proach, “a retrial is necessary whenever there is any&para;<br>possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could&para;<br>have convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment con&para;<br>duct.” Id., at 102 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Government sought certiorari. And we granted the&para;<br>writ, agreeing to decide whether the Second Circuit’s&para;<br>approach to “plain error” review, as we have set it forth,&para;<br>conflicts with this Court’s interpretation of the “plain&para;<br>error” rule. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Rule 52(b) permits an appellate court to recognize a&para;<br>“plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if the&para;<br>claim of error was “not brought” to the district court’s&para;<br>“attention.” Lower courts, of course, must apply the Rule&para;<br>as this Court has interpreted it. And the cases that set&para;<br>forth our interpretation hold that an appellate court may,&para;<br>in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only&para;<br>where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an&para;<br>“error”; (2) the error is “clear or obvious, rather than sub&para;<br>ject to reasonable dispute”; (3) the error “affected the&para;<br>appellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case&para;<br>means” it “affected the outcome of the district court pro&para;<br>ceedings”; and (4) “the error seriously affect[s] the fair&para;<br>ness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ings.” Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also&para;<br>United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731–737 (1993);&para;<br>Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466–467 (1997);&para;<br>United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 631–632 (2002).&para;<br>In our view, the Second Circuit’s standard is inconsis&para;<br>tent with the third and the fourth criteria set forth in&para;<br>these cases. The third criterion specifies that a “plain&para;<br>error” must “affec[t]” the appellant’s “substantial rights.”&para;<br>In the ordinary case, to meet this standard an error must&para;<br>be “prejudicial,” which means that there must be a rea&para;<br>sonable probability that the error affected the outcome of&para;<br>the trial. Olano, supra, at 734–735 (stating that, to satisfy&para;<br>the third criterion of Rule 52(b), a defendant must “nor&para;<br>mally” demonstrate that the alleged error was not “harm&para;<br>less”); see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542&para;<br>U. S. 74, 83 (2004). The Court of Appeals, however, would&para;<br>notice a “plain error” and set aside a conviction whenever&para;<br>there exists “any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that&para;<br>the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre&para;<br>enactment conduct.” 538 F. 3d, at 102 (emphasis added).&para;<br>This standard is irreconcilable with our “plain error”&para;<br>precedent. See, e.g., Olano, supra, at 734–735.&para;<br>We recognize that our cases speak of a need for a show&para;<br>ing that the error affected the “outcome of the district&para;<br>court proceedings” in the “ordinary case.” Puckett, 556&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). And we have noted the possibility that certain&para;<br>errors, termed “structural errors,” might “affect substan&para;<br>tial rights” regardless of their actual impact on an appel&para;<br>lant’s trial. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (reserving the&para;<br>question whether “structural errors” automatically satisfy&para;<br>the third “plain error” criterion); Cotton, supra, at 632&para;<br>(same); Johnson, supra, at 469 (same); Olano, supra, at&para;<br>735 (same). But “structural errors” are “a very limited&para;<br>class” of errors that affect the “ ‘framework within which&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the trial proceeds,’ ” Johnson, supra, at 468 (quoting Ari&para;<br>zona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)), such that&para;<br>it is often “difficul[t]” to “asses[s] the effect of the error,”&para;<br>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 149, n. 4&para;<br>(2006). See Johnson, supra, at 468–469 (citing cases in&para;<br>which this Court has found “structural error,” including&para;<br>Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (total depriva&para;<br>tion of counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (lack&para;<br>of an impartial trial judge); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465&para;<br>U. S. 168 (1984) (right to self-representation at trial);&para;<br>Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984) (violation of the&para;<br>right to a public trial); and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508&para;<br>U. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction)).&para;<br>We cannot conclude that the error here falls within that&para;<br>category.&para;<br>The error at issue in this case created a risk that the&para;<br>jury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con&para;<br>duct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in&para;<br>that conduct. A judge might have minimized, if not elimi&para;<br>nated, this risk by giving the jury a proper instruction.&para;<br>We see no reason why, when a judge fails to give such an&para;<br>instruction, a reviewing court would find it any more&para;<br>difficult to assess the likely consequences of that failure&para;<br>than with numerous other kinds of instructional errors&para;<br>that we have previously held to be non-“structural”—for&para;<br>example, instructing a jury as to an invalid alternative&para;<br>theory of guilt, Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008)&para;<br>(per curiam), omitting mention of an element of an offense,&para;<br>Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999), or erroneously&para;<br>instructing the jury on an element, Yates v. Evatt, 500&para;<br>U. S. 391 (1991); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263&para;<br>(1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987);&para;<br>Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986).&para;<br>Marcus argues that, like the Second Circuit, we should&para;<br>apply the label “Ex Post Facto Clause violation” to the&para;<br>error in this case, and that we should then treat all errors&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>so labeled as special, “structural,” errors that warrant&para;<br>reversal without a showing of prejudice. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 27–29. But we cannot accept this argument.&para;<br>As an initial matter, we note that the Government has&para;<br>never claimed that the TVPA retroactively criminalizes&para;<br>preenactment conduct, see Brief for United States 16, and&para;<br>that Marcus and the Second Circuit were thus incorrect to&para;<br>classify the error at issue here as an Ex Post Facto Clause&para;<br>violation, see Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 191&para;<br>(1977) (“The Ex Post Facto Clause is a limitation upon the&para;<br>powers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force&para;<br>apply to the Judicial Branch of government” (citation&para;<br>omitted)). Rather, if the jury, which was not instructed&para;<br>about the TVPA’s enactment date, erroneously convicted&para;<br>Marcus based exclusively on noncriminal, preenactment&para;<br>conduct, Marcus would have a valid due process claim. Cf.&para;<br>Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 353–354 (1964)&para;<br>(applying Due Process Clause to ex post facto judicial&para;<br>decisions). In any event, however Marcus’ claim is la&para;<br>beled, we see no reason why this kind of error would&para;<br>automatically “affect substantial rights” without a show&para;<br>ing of individual prejudice.&para;<br>That is because errors similar to the one at issue in this&para;<br>case—i.e., errors that create a risk that a defendant will be&para;<br>convicted based exclusively on noncriminal conduct—come&para;<br>in various shapes and sizes. The kind and degree of harm&para;<br>that such errors create can consequently vary. Sometimes&para;<br>a proper jury instruction might well avoid harm; other&para;<br>times, preventing the harm might only require striking or&para;<br>limiting the testimony of a particular witness. And some&para;<br>times the error might infect an entire trial, such that a&para;<br>jury instruction would mean little. There is thus no rea&para;<br>son to believe that all or almost all such errors always&para;<br>“affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,”&para;<br>Fulminante, supra, at 310, or “necessarily render a crimi&para;<br>nal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>determining guilt or innocence,” Neder, supra, at 9 (em&para;<br>phasis deleted).&para;<br>Moreover, while the rights at issue in this case are&para;<br>important, they do not differ significantly in importance&para;<br>from the constitutional rights at issue in other cases&para;<br>where we have insisted upon a showing of individual&para;<br>prejudice. See Fulminante, supra, at 306–307 (collecting&para;<br>cases). Indeed, we have said that “if the defendant had&para;<br>counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is&para;<br>a strong presumption that any other errors that may have&para;<br>occurred” are not “structural errors.” Rose, supra, at 579.&para;<br>No one here denies that defendant had counsel and was&para;<br>tried by an impartial adjudicator.&para;<br>In any event, the Second Circuit’s approach also cannot&para;<br>be reconciled with this Court’s fourth “plain error” crite&para;<br>rion, which permits an appeals court to recognize “plain&para;<br>error” only if the error “seriously affect[s] the fairness,&para;<br>integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”&para;<br>Johnson, 520 U. S., at 467 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). In cases applying this fourth criterion, we have&para;<br>suggested that, in most circumstances, an error that does&para;<br>not affect the jury’s verdict does not significantly impugn&para;<br>the “fairness,” “integrity,” or “public reputation” of the&para;<br>judicial process. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted);&para;<br>Cotton, 535 U. S., at 633. The Second Circuit’s “any possi&para;<br>bility, no matter how unlikely” standard, however, would&para;<br>require finding a “plain error” in a case where the evi&para;<br>dence supporting a conviction consisted of, say, a few days&para;<br>of preenactment conduct along with several continuous&para;<br>years of identical postenactment conduct. Given the tiny&para;<br>risk that the jury would have based its conviction upon&para;<br>those few preenactment days alone, a refusal to recognize&para;<br>such an error as a “plain error” (and to set aside the ver&para;<br>dict) is most unlikely to cast serious doubt on the “fair&para;<br>ness,” “integrity,” or “public reputation” of the judicial&para;<br>system.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We do not intend to trivialize the claim that respondent&para;<br>here raises. Nor do we imply that the kind of error at&para;<br>issue here is unimportant. But the rule that permits&para;<br>courts to recognize a “plain error” does not “remove” “se&para;<br>riou[s]” errors “from the ambit of the Federal Rules of&para;<br>Criminal Procedure.” Johnson, supra, at 466. Rather, the&para;<br>“plain error” rule, as interpreted by this Court, sets forth&para;<br>criteria that a claim of error not raised at trial must sat&para;<br>isfy. The Second Circuit’s rule would require reversal&para;<br>under the “plain error” standard for errors that do not&para;<br>meet those criteria. We can find no good reason to treat&para;<br>respondent’s claim of error differently from others. See&para;<br>Puckett, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (reviewing the&para;<br>Government’s violation of a plea agreement for “plain&para;<br>error”); Cotton, supra, at 631–632 (reviewing an indict&para;<br>ment’s failure to charge a fact that increased defendant’s&para;<br>statutory maximum sentence for “plain error”); Johnson,&para;<br>supra, at 464 (reviewing the failure to submit an element&para;<br>of the crime to the jury for “plain error”). Hence we must&para;<br>reject the Second Circuit’s rule.&para;<br>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals&para;<br>is reversed. As the Court of Appeals has not yet consid&para;<br>ered whether the error at issue in this case satisfies this&para;<br>Court’s “plain error” standard—i.e., whether the error&para;<br>affects “substantial rights” and “the fairness, integrity, or&para;<br>public reputation of judicial proceedings”—we remand the&para;<br>case to that court so that it may do so.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration&para;<br>or decision of this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Most of the evi&para;<br>dence supporting the sex trafficking charge, and some of&para;<br>the evidence supporting the forced labor charge, related to&para;<br>discrete events that occurred before October 28, 2000.&para;<br>At trial, Marcus failed to ask the judge to inform the&para;<br>jury that his preenactment conduct was not unlawful, and&para;<br>the judge failed to give an instruction to that effect. If a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>request had been made, it is clear that an appropriate&para;<br>instruction would have been given. Indeed, it is equally&para;<br>clear that the judge would have given such an instruction&para;<br>sua sponte if she had been aware of the effective date of&para;<br>the statute. No one disputes that error was committed in&para;<br>the way Marcus was charged and tried, and the error was&para;<br>sufficiently plain to be considered on appeal.&para;<br>The record demonstrates that Marcus’ sex trafficking&para;<br>conviction likely violated the ex post facto rule, as applied&para;<br>to trial proceedings through the Due Process Clause, see&para;<br>ante, at 6, because the postenactment evidence appears to&para;<br>have been insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt. See 538 F. 3d, at 105–106 (Sotomayor, J., concur&para;<br>ring). Whether his forced labor conviction is invalid for&para;<br>the same reason is not clear. What is clear, however, is&para;<br>that neither the Second Circuit nor this Court has to&para;<br>determine that an error of constitutional magnitude oc&para;<br>curred for Marcus to be eligible for relief. The question&para;<br>under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) is&para;<br>whether the trial error was sufficiently weighty to affect&para;<br>“substantial rights,” and in my view this error surely was.&para;<br>The Court notes that the error “created a risk that the&para;<br>jury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con&para;<br>duct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in&para;<br>that conduct.” Ante, at 5. That is true, and it is of funda&para;<br>mental concern because imposing criminal sanctions for&para;<br>nonproscribed conduct has always been considered a&para;<br>hallmark of tyranny—no matter how morally reprehensi&para;<br>ble the prosecuted party.&para;<br>But in addition to the very real possibility that the jury&para;<br>convicted Marcus of sex trafficking solely on the basis of&para;<br>preenactment conduct, the error created another risk:&para;<br>namely, that both verdicts, returned after seven days of&para;<br>deliberation, rested in part on the jury’s incorrect belief&para;<br>that the conduct before October 28, 2000, was unlawful.&para;<br>The error committed at trial not only prevented the jury&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>from focusing on the relevant time period, but it also&para;<br>distorted the jury’s perception of Marcus’ actions. By&para;<br>arguing that its preenactment evidence showed a violation&para;<br>of the TVPA, the Government effectively mischaracterized&para;<br>all of that evidence as descriptions of illegal behavior. And&para;<br>by giving the jury the impression that Marcus committed&para;<br>a much larger amount of criminal conduct than he really&para;<br>did, the error may have tipped the scales in favor of the&para;<br>prosecution, when the actual evidence of guilt would not&para;<br>have persuaded the jury to convict.&para;<br>There is no need to decide whether the Government’s&para;<br>arguments or the trial court’s failure to give a curative&para;<br>instruction reached a level of unfairness sufficient to&para;<br>violate the Due Process Clause. For the foregoing reasons,&para;<br>I am convinced that the error prejudiced Marcus and&para;<br>seriously undermined the integrity of the proceedings.&para;<br>While I do not endorse the reasoning in the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals’ opinion,* I would therefore affirm its judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The per curiam opinion contained a curious wrinkle, apart from&para;<br>misclassifying the trial error. See ante, at 6. The per curiam applied a&para;<br>standard from earlier Second Circuit cases that asked whether there&para;<br>was any possibility the jury convicted the defendant exclusively on the&para;<br>basis of preenactment conduct. 538 F. 3d 97, 101 (CA2 2008) (citing&para;<br>United States v. Torres, 901 F. 2d 205, 229 (1990), United States v.&para;<br>Monaco, 194 F. 3d 381, 386 (1999), and United States v. Harris, 79&para;<br>F. 3d 223, 229 (1996)). As I read the Second Circuit precedents, how&para;<br>ever, they used that standard to determine whether an ex post facto&para;<br>violation occurred, not to determine whether that violation warranted&para;<br>vacatur of the conviction pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Proce&para;<br>dure 52(b). Torres is the only one of the cited cases that even consid&para;<br>ered Rule 52(b), and its holding rested on a combination of factors,&para;<br>including that “the defendants brought the general ex post facto ques&para;<br>tion to the attention of the district court,” albeit imprecisely, and that a&para;<br>mandatory life sentence was imposed. 901 F. 2d, at 229. It is thus&para;<br>unclear why the Court of Appeals believed itself foreclosed from con&para;<br>ducting a regular “plain error” review.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. MARCUS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court does not engage the merits of that judgment,&para;<br>but instead remands to the Court of Appeals to apply the&para;<br>test we have devised for evaluating claims of “plain error.”&para;<br>That test requires lower courts to conduct four separate&para;<br>inquiries, each of which requires a distinct form of judg&para;<br>ment and several of which have generated significant&para;<br>appellate-court dissensus; the test may also contain an&para;<br>exception for “structural errors,” a category we have never&para;<br>defined clearly. With great concision, the Court manages&para;<br>to summarize all of these moving parts in about five&para;<br>pages. Ante, at 3–8.&para;<br>Yet the language of Rule 52(b) is straightforward. It&para;<br>states simply: “A plain error that affects substantial rights&para;<br>may be considered even though it was not brought to the&para;<br>court’s attention.” This is the mirror image of Rule 52(a),&para;<br>which instructs courts to disregard any error “that does&para;<br>not affect substantial rights.” The Federal Rules thus set&para;<br>forth a unitary standard, which turns on whether the&para;<br>error in question affected substantial rights (either in a&para;<br>particular defendant’s case or in the mine run of compara&para;<br>ble cases), and they leave it to judges to figure out how&para;<br>best to apply that standard.&para;<br>In our attempt to clarify Rule 52(b), we have, I fear,&para;<br>both muddied the waters and lost sight of the wisdom&para;<br>embodied in the Rule’s spare text. Errors come in an&para;<br>endless variety of “shapes and sizes.” Ante, at 6. Because&para;<br>error-free trials are so rare, appellate courts must repeat&para;<br>edly confront the question whether a trial judge’s mistake&para;<br>was harmless or warrants reversal. They become familiar&para;<br>with particular judges and with the vast panoply of trial&para;<br>procedures, they acquire special expertise in dealing with&para;<br>recurring issues, and their doctrine evolves over time to&para;<br>help clarify and classify various types of mistakes. These&para;<br>are just a few of the reasons why federal appellate courts&para;<br>are “allowed a wide measure of discretion in the supervi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sion of litigation in their respective circuits.” United&para;<br>States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 745 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). This Court’s ever more intensive efforts to&para;<br>rationalize plain-error review may have been born of a&para;<br>worthy instinct. But they have trapped the appellate&para;<br>courts in an analytic maze that, I have increasingly come&para;<br>to believe, is more liable to frustrate than to facilitate&para;<br>sound decisionmaking.&para;<br>The trial error at issue in this case undermined the&para;<br>defendant’s substantial rights by allowing the jury to&para;<br>convict him on the basis of an incorrect belief that lawful&para;<br>conduct was unlawful, and it does not take an elaborate&para;<br>formula to see that. Because, in my view, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals properly exercised its discretion to remedy the&para;<br>error and to order a retrial, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
