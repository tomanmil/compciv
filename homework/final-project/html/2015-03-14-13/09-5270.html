GEORGIA&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF GEORGIA&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–5270. Decided January 19, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>After a jury trial in the Superior Court of DeKalb&para;<br>County, Georgia, petitioner Eric Presley was convicted of a&para;<br>cocaine trafficking offense. The conviction was affirmed&para;<br>by the Supreme Court of Georgia. 285 Ga. 270, 674 S. E.&para;<br>2d 909 (2009). Presley seeks certiorari, claiming his Sixth&para;<br>and Fourteenth Amendment right to a public trial was&para;<br>violated when the trial court excluded the public from the&para;<br>voir dire of prospective jurors. The Supreme Court of&para;<br>Georgia’s affirmance contravened this Court’s clear prece&para;<br>dents. Certiorari and petitioner’s motion for leave to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are now granted, and the judg&para;<br>ment is reversed.&para;<br>Before selecting a jury in Presley’s trial, the trial court&para;<br>noticed a lone courtroom observer. Id., at 270–271, 674&para;<br>S. E. 2d, at 910. The court explained that prospective&para;<br>jurors were about to enter and instructed the man that he&para;<br>was not allowed in the courtroom and had to leave that&para;<br>floor of the courthouse entirely. Id., at 271, 674 S. E. 2d,&para;<br>at 910. The court then questioned the man and learned&para;<br>he was Presley’s uncle. Ibid. The court reiterated its&para;<br>instruction:&para;<br>“ ‘Well, you still can’t sit out in the audience with the&para;<br>jurors. You know, most of the afternoon actually&para;<br>we’re going to be picking a jury. And we may have a&para;<br>couple of pre-trial matters, so you’re welcome to come&para;<br>in after we . . . complete selecting the jury this after&para;<br>noon. But, otherwise, you would have to leave the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PRESLEY v. GEORGIA&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sixth floor, because jurors will be all out in the hall&para;<br>way in a few moments. That applies to everybody&para;<br>who’s got a case.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>Presley’s counsel objected to “ ‘the exclusion of the public&para;<br>from the courtroom,’ ” but the court explained, “ ‘[t]here&para;<br>just isn’t space for them to sit in the audience.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>When Presley’s counsel requested “ ‘some accommoda&para;<br>tion,’ ” the court explained its ruling further:&para;<br>“ ‘Well, the uncle can certainly come back in once the&para;<br>trial starts. There’s no, really no need for the uncle to&para;<br>be present during jury selection. . . . [W]e have 42 ju&para;<br>rors coming up. Each of those rows will be occupied&para;<br>by jurors. And his uncle cannot sit and intermingle&para;<br>with members of the jury panel. But, when the trial&para;<br>starts, the opening statements and other matters, he&para;<br>can certainly come back into the courtroom.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>After Presley was convicted, he moved for a new trial&para;<br>based on the exclusion of the public from the juror voir&para;<br>dire. At a hearing on the motion, Presley presented evi&para;<br>dence showing that 14 prospective jurors could have fit in&para;<br>the jury box and the remaining 28 could have fit entirely&para;<br>on one side of the courtroom, leaving adequate room for&para;<br>the public. App. to Pet. for Cert. E–37, E–41. The trial&para;<br>court denied the motion, commenting that it preferred to&para;<br>seat jurors throughout the entirety of the courtroom, and&para;<br>“it’s up to the individual judge to decide . . . what’s com&para;<br>fortable.” Id., E–38. The court continued: “It’s totally up&para;<br>to my discretion whether or not I want family members in&para;<br>the courtroom to intermingle with the jurors and sit di&para;<br>rectly behind the jurors where they might overhear some&para;<br>inadvertent comment or conversation.” Id., at E–42 to E–&para;<br>43. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Georgia agreed,&para;<br>finding “[t]here was no abuse of discretion here, when the&para;<br>trial court explained the need to exclude spectators at the&para;<br>voir dire stage of the proceedings and when members of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the public were invited to return afterward.” 290 Ga. App.&para;<br>99, 100–101, 658 S. E. 2d 773, 775 (2008).&para;<br>The Supreme Court of Georgia granted certiorari and&para;<br>affirmed, with two justices dissenting. After finding “the&para;<br>trial court certainly had an overriding interest in ensuring&para;<br>that potential jurors heard no inherently prejudicial re&para;<br>marks from observers during voir dire,” the Supreme&para;<br>Court of Georgia rejected Presley’s argument that the trial&para;<br>court was required to consider alternatives to closing the&para;<br>courtroom. 285 Ga., at 272, 273, 674 S. E. 2d, at 911. It&para;<br>noted that “the United States Supreme Court [has] not&para;<br>provide[d] clear guidance regarding whether a court must,&para;<br>sua sponte, advance its own alternatives to [closure],” and&para;<br>the court ruled that “Presley was obliged to present the&para;<br>court with any alternatives that he wished the court to&para;<br>consider.” Id., at 273, 674 S. E. 2d, at 911, 912. When no&para;<br>alternatives are offered, it concluded, “there is no abuse of&para;<br>discretion in the court’s failure to sua sponte advance its&para;<br>own alternatives.” Id., at 274, 674 S. E. 2d, at 912.&para;<br>This Court’s rulings with respect to the public trial right&para;<br>rest upon two different provisions of the Bill of Rights,&para;<br>both applicable to the States via the Due Process Clause of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment.&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment&para;<br>directs, in relevant part, that “[i]n all criminal prosecu&para;<br>tions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and&para;<br>public trial . . . .” The Court in In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257,&para;<br>273 (1948), made it clear that this right extends to the&para;<br>States. The Sixth Amendment right, as the quoted lan&para;<br>guage makes explicit, is the right of the accused.&para;<br>The Court has further held that the public trial right&para;<br>extends beyond the accused and can be invoked under the&para;<br>First Amendment. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court&para;<br>of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U. S. 501 (1984) (PressEnterprise I). This requirement, too, is binding on the&para;<br>States. Ibid.&para;<br>The case now before the Court is brought under the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PRESLEY v. GEORGIA&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Sixth Amendment, for it is the accused who invoked his&para;<br>right to a public trial. An initial question is whether the&para;<br>right to a public trial in criminal cases extends to the jury&para;<br>selection phase of trial, and in particular the voir dire of&para;<br>prospective jurors. In the First Amendment context that&para;<br>question was answered in Press-Enterprise I. Id., at 510.&para;<br>The Court there held that the voir dire of prospective&para;<br>jurors must be open to the public under the First Amend&para;<br>ment. Later in the same Term as Press-Enterprise I, the&para;<br>Court considered a Sixth Amendment case concerning&para;<br>whether the public trial right extends to a pretrial hearing&para;<br>on a motion to suppress certain evidence. Waller v. Geor&para;<br>gia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984). The Waller Court relied heavily&para;<br>upon Press-Enterprise I in finding that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment right to a public trial extends beyond the actual&para;<br>proof at trial. It ruled that the pretrial suppression hear&para;<br>ing must be open to the public because “there can be little&para;<br>doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the&para;<br>accused is no less protective of a public trial than the&para;<br>implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.”&para;<br>467 U. S., at 46.&para;<br>While Press-Enterprise I was heavily relied upon in&para;<br>Waller, the jury selection issue in the former case was&para;<br>resolved under the First, not the Sixth, Amendment.&para;<br>Press-Enterprise I, supra, at 516 (STEVENS, J., concurring)&para;<br>(“The constitutional protection for the right of access that&para;<br>the Court upholds today is found in the First Amendment,&para;<br>rather than the public trial provision of the Sixth” (foot&para;<br>note omitted)). In the instant case, the question then&para;<br>arises whether it is so well settled that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment right extends to jury voir dire that this Court may&para;<br>proceed by summary disposition.&para;<br>The point is well settled under Press-Enterprise I and&para;<br>Waller. The extent to which the First and Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment public trial rights are coextensive is an open ques&para;<br>tion, and it is not necessary here to speculate whether or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>in what circumstances the reach or protections of one&para;<br>might be greater than the other. Still, there is no legiti&para;<br>mate reason, at least in the context of juror selection&para;<br>proceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment&para;<br>privilege greater rights to insist on public proceedings&para;<br>than the accused has. “Our cases have uniformly recog&para;<br>nized the public-trial guarantee as one created for the&para;<br>benefit of the defendant.” Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443&para;<br>U. S. 368, 380 (1979). There could be no explanation for&para;<br>barring the accused from raising a constitutional right&para;<br>that is unmistakably for his or her benefit. That rationale&para;<br>suffices to resolve the instant matter. The Supreme Court&para;<br>of Georgia was correct in assuming that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment right to a public trial extends to the voir dire of&para;<br>prospective jurors.&para;<br>While the accused does have a right to insist that the&para;<br>voir dire of the jurors be public, there are exceptions to&para;<br>this general rule. “[T]he right to an open trial may give&para;<br>way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as&para;<br>the defendant’s right to a fair trial or the government’s&para;<br>interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.”&para;<br>Waller, 467 U. S., at 45. “Such circumstances will be rare,&para;<br>however, and the balance of interests must be struck with&para;<br>special care.” Ibid. Waller provided standards for courts&para;<br>to apply before excluding the public from any stage of a&para;<br>criminal trial:&para;<br>“[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must ad&para;<br>vance an overriding interest that is likely to be preju&para;<br>diced, the closure must be no broader than necessary&para;<br>to protect that interest, the trial court must consider&para;<br>reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and&para;<br>it must make findings adequate to support the clo&para;<br>sure.” Id., at 48.&para;<br>In upholding exclusion of the public at juror voir dire in&para;<br>the instant case, the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PRESLEY v. GEORGIA&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>despite our explicit statements to the contrary, that trial&para;<br>courts need not consider alternatives to closure absent an&para;<br>opposing party’s proffer of some alternatives. While the&para;<br>Supreme Court of Georgia concluded this was an open&para;<br>question under this Court’s precedents, the statement in&para;<br>Waller that “the trial court must consider reasonable&para;<br>alternatives to closing the proceeding” settles the point.&para;<br>Ibid. If that statement leaves any room for doubt, the&para;<br>Court was more explicit in Press-Enterprise I:&para;<br>“Even with findings adequate to support closure, the&para;<br>trial court’s orders denying access to voir dire testi&para;<br>mony failed to consider whether alternatives were&para;<br>available to protect the interests of the prospective ju&para;<br>rors that the trial court’s orders sought to guard. Ab&para;<br>sent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial&para;<br>court could not constitutionally close the voir dire.”&para;<br>464 U. S., at 511.&para;<br>The conclusion that trial courts are required to consider&para;<br>alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by&para;<br>the parties is clear not only from this Court’s precedents&para;<br>but also from the premise that “[t]he process of juror&para;<br>selection is itself a matter of importance, not simply to the&para;<br>adversaries but to the criminal justice system.” Id., at&para;<br>505. The public has a right to be present whether or not&para;<br>any party has asserted the right. In Press-Enterprise I, for&para;<br>instance, neither the defendant nor the prosecution re&para;<br>quested an open courtroom during juror voir dire proceed&para;<br>ings; in fact, both specifically argued in favor of keeping&para;<br>the transcript of the proceedings confidential. Id., at 503–&para;<br>504. The Court, nonetheless, found it was error to close&para;<br>the courtroom. Id., at 513.&para;<br>Trial courts are obligated to take every reasonable&para;<br>measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal&para;<br>trials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court&para;<br>could not have accommodated the public at Presley’s trial.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Without knowing the precise circumstances, some possi&para;<br>bilities include reserving one or more rows for the public;&para;<br>dividing the jury venire panel to reduce courtroom conges&para;<br>tion; or instructing prospective jurors not to engage or&para;<br>interact with audience members.&para;<br>Petitioner also argues that, apart from failing to con&para;<br>sider alternatives to closure, the trial court erred because&para;<br>it did not even identify any overriding interest likely to be&para;<br>prejudiced absent the closure of voir dire. There is some&para;<br>merit to this complaint. The generic risk of jurors over&para;<br>hearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any&para;<br>specific threat or incident, is inherent whenever members&para;<br>of the public are present during the selection of jurors. If&para;<br>broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a&para;<br>defendant’s constitutional right to a public trial, a court&para;<br>could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a&para;<br>matter of course. As noted in the dissent below, “the&para;<br>majority’s reasoning permits the closure of voir dire in&para;<br>every criminal case conducted in this courtroom whenever&para;<br>the trial judge decides, for whatever reason, that he or she&para;<br>would prefer to fill the courtroom with potential jurors&para;<br>rather than spectators.” 285 Ga., at 276, 674 S. E. 2d, at&para;<br>913 (opinion of Sears, C. J.).&para;<br>There are no doubt circumstances where a judge could&para;<br>conclude that threats of improper communications with&para;<br>jurors or safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant&para;<br>closing voir dire. But in those cases, the particular inter&para;<br>est, and threat to that interest, must “be articulated along&para;<br>with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can&para;<br>determine whether the closure order was properly en&para;<br>tered.” Press-Enterprise I, supra, at 510; see also PressEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., County of River&para;<br>side, 478 U. S. 1, 15 (1986) (“The First Amendment right&para;<br>of access cannot be overcome by the conclusory assertion&para;<br>that publicity might deprive the defendant of [the right to&para;<br>a fair trial]”).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PRESLEY v. GEORGIA&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>We need not rule on this second claim of error, because&para;<br>even assuming, arguendo, that the trial court had an&para;<br>overriding interest in closing voir dire, it was still incum&para;<br>bent upon it to consider all reasonable alternatives to&para;<br>closure. It did not, and that is all this Court needs to&para;<br>decide.&para;<br>The Supreme Court of Georgia’s judgment is reversed,&para;<br>and the case is remanded for further proceedings not&para;<br>inconsistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

GEORGIA&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF GEORGIA&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–5270. Decided January 19, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,&para;<br>dissenting.&para;<br>Today the Court summarily disposes of two important&para;<br>questions it left unanswered 25 years ago in Waller v.&para;<br>Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984), and Press-Enterprise Co. v.&para;<br>Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U. S. 501 (1984)&para;<br>(Press-Enterprise I).&para;<br>I respectfully dissent from the&para;<br>Court’s summary disposition of these important questions.&para;<br>First, the Court addresses “whether it is so well settled&para;<br>that [a defendant’s] Sixth Amendment right” to a public&para;<br>trial “extends to jury voir dire that this Court may proceed&para;<br>by summary disposition.” Ante, at 4. The Court’s affirma&para;<br>tive answer to this question relies exclusively on Waller&para;<br>and Press-Enterprise I; but those cases cannot bear the&para;<br>weight of this answer.&para;<br>The Court correctly notes that Waller answers whether&para;<br>a “defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial&para;<br>applies to a suppression hearing” (not to jury voir dire),&para;<br>467 U. S., at 43, and that Press-Enterprise I interprets the&para;<br>public’s First Amendment right to attend jury voir dire,&para;<br>464 U. S., at 509, n. 8, so neither Waller nor PressEnterprise I expressly answers the question here, see ante,&para;<br>at 4. That acknowledgment should have eliminated any&para;<br>basis for disposing of this case summarily; the Court&para;<br>should reserve that procedural option for cases that our&para;<br>precedents govern squarely and directly. See, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Haley, 358 U. S. 644 (1959) (per curiam) (summa&para;<br>rily reversing a federal court’s judgment that refused to&para;<br>follow, or even mention, one of our precedents upholding&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PRESLEY v. GEORGIA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the statute in issue under identical circumstances).&para;<br>The Court nevertheless concludes that Waller and PressEnterprise I—in combination—“well settl[e]” the “point.”&para;<br>Ante, at 4. It admits that “[t]he extent to which the First&para;<br>and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are coextensive&para;<br>is an open question,” but, apparently extrapolating from&para;<br>Press-Enterprise I, asserts that “there is no legitimate&para;<br>reason, at least in the context of juror selection proceed&para;<br>ings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment privilege&para;<br>greater rights to insist on public proceedings than the&para;<br>accused has.” Ante, at 4–5. But this conclusion decides by&para;<br>implication an unstated premise: that jury voir dire is part&para;<br>of the “public trial” that the Sixth Amendment guarantees.&para;<br>As JUSTICE STEVENS recognized in Press-Enterprise I, that&para;<br>case did not decide this issue. See 464 U. S., at 516 (con&para;<br>curring opinion) (“If the defendant had advanced a claim&para;<br>that his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was&para;<br>violated by the closure of the voir dire, it would be impor&para;<br>tant to determine whether the selection of the jury was a&para;<br>part of the ‘trial’ within the meaning of that Amendment”).&para;<br>Until today, that question remained open; the majority&para;<br>certainly cites no other case from this Court answering it.&para;<br>Yet the Court does so here—even though the Supreme&para;<br>Court of Georgia did not meaningfully consider that ques&para;<br>tion, and petitioner does not ask us to do so.* I am unwill&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* In full, petitioner’s two questions presented state:&para;<br>“I. This Court has established that the public cannot be expelled from a&para;<br>courtroom unless the presence of the public creates a ‘substantial&para;<br>probability’ of prejudice to an ‘overriding interest.’ But is some case&para;<br>specific evidence required to meet this ‘substantial probability’ test, or&para;<br>can generalized fears that would apply equally to nearly every trial&para;<br>suffice?&para;<br>“II. This Court has repeatedly held that a trial court must consider&para;<br>reasonable alternatives to closing a proceeding before it can exclude the&para;<br>public. But who bears the burden of suggesting such alternatives?&para;<br>Must the proponent of closure establish that closure is necessary, in&para;<br>that there are no reasonable alternatives available? Or to overcome a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing to decide this important question summarily without&para;<br>the benefit of full briefing and argument.&para;<br>Second, I am also unwilling to join the Court in reading&para;<br>the “ ‘alternatives to closure’ ” language it quotes from&para;<br>Waller and Press Enterprise I as squarely foreclosing the&para;<br>decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia. See ante, at 6.&para;<br>The Court chides the Supreme Court of Georgia for “con&para;<br>clud[ing], despite our explicit statements to the contrary,&para;<br>that trial courts need not consider alternatives to closure&para;<br>absent an opposing party’s proffer of some alternatives.”&para;<br>Ante, at 5–6 (emphasis added). But neither Waller nor&para;<br>Press-Enterprise I expressly holds that jury voir dire is&para;<br>covered by the Sixth Amendment’s “[P]ublic [T]rial”&para;<br>Clause. Accordingly, it is not obvious that the “alterna&para;<br>tives to closure” language in those opinions governs this&para;<br>case.&para;<br>Even assuming the Court correctly extends Waller and&para;<br>Press-Enterprise I to this (Sixth Amendment voir dire)&para;<br>context, neither opinion “explicit[ly]” places on trial courts&para;<br>the burden of sua sponte suggesting alternatives to closure&para;<br>“absent an opposing party’s proffer of some alternatives.”&para;<br>Ante, at 6. The statement that a “ ‘trial court must con&para;<br>sider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,’ ”&para;<br>ibid. (quoting Waller, supra, at 48), does not definitively&para;<br>establish who must suggest alternatives to closure that the&para;<br>trial court must then consider, nor does it expressly ad&para;<br>dress whether the trial court must suggest such alterna&para;<br>tives in the absence of a proffer. I concede that the lan&para;<br>guage can easily be read to imply the latter, and the Court&para;<br>may well be right that a trial court violates the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment if it closes the courtroom without sua sponte&para;<br>considering reasonable alternatives to closure. But I&para;<br>would not decide the issue summarily, and certainly would&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>closure motion must an opponent of closure establish that reasonable&para;<br>&para;<br>alternatives do exist?” Pet. for Cert. i. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PRESLEY v. GEORGIA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not declare, as the Court does, that Waller and PressEnterprise I “settl[e] the point” without “leav[ing] any&para;<br>room for doubt.” Ante, at 6.&para;<br>Besides departing from the standards that should gov&para;<br>ern summary dispositions, today’s decision belittles the&para;<br>efforts of our judicial colleagues who have struggled with&para;<br>these issues in attempting to interpret and apply the same&para;<br>opinions upon which the Court so confidently relies today.&para;<br>See, e.g., Ayala v. Speckard, 131 F. 3d 62, 70–72 (CA2&para;<br>1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 524 U. S. 958 (1998); 131&para;<br>F. 3d, at 74–75 (Walker, J., concurring); id., at 77–80&para;<br>(Parker, J., dissenting). The Court’s decision will also&para;<br>surely surprise petitioner, who did not seek summary&para;<br>reversal based on the allegedly incorrect application of&para;<br>this Court’s well-established precedents by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of Georgia, but instead asked us to “resolve this&para;<br>split of authority” over whether “the opponent of closure&para;<br>must suggest alternatives to closure” or whether “those&para;<br>seeking to exclude the public must show that there is no&para;<br>available less-intrusive alternative.” Pet. for Cert. 18.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
