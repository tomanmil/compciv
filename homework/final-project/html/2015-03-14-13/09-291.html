He filed his own charge and a&para;<br>subsequent suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming that&para;<br>NAS fired him to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge.&para;<br>The District Court granted NAS summary judgment on the ground&para;<br>that third-party retaliation claims were not permitted by Title VII,&para;<br>which prohibits discrimination against an employee “because he has&para;<br>made a [Title VII] charge,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a), and which per­&para;<br>mits, inter alia, a “person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by [an] alleged&para;<br>employment practice” to file a civil action, §2000e–5(f)(1). The en&para;<br>banc Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Thompson was not enti­&para;<br>tled to sue NAS for retaliation because he had not engaged in any ac­&para;<br>tivity protected by the statute.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. If the facts Thompson alleges are true, his firing by NAS consti­&para;<br>tuted unlawful retaliation. Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must&para;<br>be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct. Burlington&para;<br>N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53. It prohibits any employer ac­&para;<br>tion that “ ‘well might have “dissuaded a reasonable worker from&para;<br>making or supporting a [discrimination] charge,” ’ ” id., at 68. That&para;<br>test must be applied in an objective fashion, to “avoi[d] the uncertain­&para;<br>ties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to de­&para;<br>termine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective feelings.” Id., at 68–69. A&para;<br>reasonable worker obviously might be dissuaded from engaging in&para;<br>protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired. Pp. 2–4.&para;<br>2. Title VII grants Thompson a cause of action. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) For Title VII standing purposes, the term “person aggrieved”&para;<br>must be construed more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Arti­&para;<br>cle III. Dictum in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S.&para;<br>205, suggesting that Title VII’s aggrievement requirement reaches as&para;<br>far as Article III permits, is too expansive and the Court declines to&para;<br>follow it. At the other extreme, limiting “person aggrieved” to the&para;<br>person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation is an artificially&para;<br>narrow reading. A common usage of the term “person aggrieved”&para;<br>avoids both of these extremes. The Administrative Procedure Act,&para;<br>which authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any “person&para;<br>. . . adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the meaning of a rele­&para;<br>vant statute,” 5 U. S. C. §702, establishes a regime under which a&para;<br>plaintiff may not sue unless he “falls within the ‘zone of interests’&para;<br>sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation&para;<br>forms the legal basis for his complaint,” Lujan v. National Wildlife&para;<br>Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 883. Title VII’s term “aggrieved” incorpo­&para;<br>rates that test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest “ ‘ar­&para;<br>guably [sought] to be protected’ by the statutes,” National Credit Un&para;<br>ion Admin. v. First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495, while&para;<br>excluding plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III&para;<br>sense but whose interests are unrelated to Title VII’s statutory pro­&para;<br>hibitions. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) Applying that test here, Thompson falls within the zone of in­&para;<br>terests protected by Title VII. He was an employee of NAS, and Title&para;<br>VII’s purpose is to protect employees from their employers’ unlawful&para;<br>actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an&para;<br>accidental victim of the retaliation. Hurting him was the unlawful&para;<br>act by which NAS punished Regalado. Thus, Thompson is a person&para;<br>aggrieved with standing to sue under Title VII.

THOMPSON, PETITIONER v. NORTH&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP&para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 24, 2011] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Until 2003, both petitioner Eric Thompson and his&para;<br>fiancée, Miriam Regalado, were employees of respondent&para;<br>North American Stainless (NAS). In February 2003, the&para;<br>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)&para;<br>notified NAS that Regalado had filed a charge alleging sex&para;<br>discrimination. Three weeks later, NAS fired Thompson.&para;<br>Thompson then filed a charge with the EEOC. After&para;<br>conciliation efforts proved unsuccessful, he sued NAS in&para;<br>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of&para;<br>Kentucky under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,&para;<br>78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., claiming that NAS&para;<br>had fired him in order to retaliate against Regalado for&para;<br>filing her charge with the EEOC. The District Court&para;<br>granted summary judgment to NAS, concluding that Title&para;<br>VII “does not permit third party retaliation claims.” 435&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 633, 639 (ED Ky. 2006). After a panel of the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court, the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>granted rehearing en banc and affirmed by a 10-to-6 vote.&para;<br>567 F. 3d 804 (2009). The court reasoned that because&para;<br>Thompson did not “engag[e] in any statutorily protected&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>activity, either on his own behalf or on behalf of Miriam&para;<br>Regalado,” he “is not included in the class of persons for&para;<br>whom Congress created a retaliation cause of action.” Id.,&para;<br>at 807–808.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>I&para;<br>Title VII provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful em­&para;<br>ployment practice for an employer to discriminate against&para;<br>any of his employees . . . because he has made a charge”&para;<br>under Title VII. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The statute&para;<br>permits “a person claiming to be aggrieved” to file a charge&para;<br>with the EEOC alleging that the employer committed an&para;<br>unlawful employment practice, and, if the EEOC declines&para;<br>to sue the employer, it permits a civil action to “be brought&para;<br>. . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by the al­&para;<br>leged unlawful employment practice.” §2000e–5(b), (f)(1).&para;<br>It is undisputed that Regalado’s filing of a charge with&para;<br>the EEOC was protected conduct under Title VII. In the&para;<br>procedural posture of this case, we are also required to&para;<br>assume that NAS fired Thompson in order to retaliate&para;<br>against Regalado for filing a charge of discrimination.&para;<br>This case therefore presents two questions: First, did&para;<br>NAS’s firing of Thompson constitute unlawful retaliation?&para;<br>And second, if it did, does Title VII grant Thompson a&para;<br>cause of action?&para;<br>II&para;<br>With regard to the first question, we have little diffi­&para;<br>culty concluding that if the facts alleged by Thompson are&para;<br>true, then NAS’s firing of Thompson violated Title VII. In&para;<br>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53 (2006),&para;<br>we held that Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must be&para;<br>construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct. We&para;<br>reached that conclusion by contrasting the text of Title&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>VII’s antiretaliation provision with its substantive antidis­&para;<br>crimination provision. Title VII prohibits discrimination&para;<br>on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin&para;<br>“ ‘with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or&para;<br>privileges of employment,’ ” and discriminatory practices&para;<br>that would “ ‘deprive any individual of employment oppor­&para;<br>tunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an&para;<br>employee.’ ” Id., at 62 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)&para;<br>(emphasis deleted)). In contrast, Title VII’s antiretaliation&para;<br>provision prohibits an employer from “ ‘discriminat[ing]&para;<br>against any of his employees’ ” for engaging in protected&para;<br>conduct, without specifying the employer acts that are&para;<br>prohibited. 548 U. S., at 62 (quoting §2000e–3(a) (empha­&para;<br>sis deleted)). Based on this textual distinction and our&para;<br>understanding of the antiretaliation provision’s purpose,&para;<br>we held that “the antiretaliation provision, unlike the&para;<br>substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory&para;<br>actions that affect the terms and conditions of employ­&para;<br>ment.” Id., at 64. Rather, Title VII’s antiretaliation pro­&para;<br>vision prohibits any employer action that “well might have&para;<br>dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting&para;<br>a charge of discrimination.” Id., at 68 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be&para;<br>dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew&para;<br>that her fiancé would be fired. Indeed, NAS does not&para;<br>dispute that Thompson’s firing meets the standard set&para;<br>forth in Burlington. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. NAS raises the&para;<br>concern, however, that prohibiting reprisals against third&para;<br>parties will lead to difficult line-drawing problems con­&para;<br>cerning the types of relationships entitled to protection.&para;<br>Perhaps retaliating against an employee by firing his&para;<br>fiancée would dissuade the employee from engaging in&para;<br>protected activity, but what about firing an employee’s&para;<br>girlfriend, close friend, or trusted co-worker? Applying the&para;<br>Burlington standard to third-party reprisals, NAS argues,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>will place the employer at risk any time it fires any em­&para;<br>ployee who happens to have a connection to a different&para;<br>employee who filed a charge with the EEOC.&para;<br>Although we acknowledge the force of this point, we do&para;<br>not think it justifies a categorical rule that third-party&para;<br>reprisals do not violate Title VII. As explained above, we&para;<br>adopted a broad standard in Burlington because Title&para;<br>VII’s antiretaliation provision is worded broadly. We&para;<br>think there is no textual basis for making an exception to&para;<br>it for third-party reprisals, and a preference for clear rules&para;<br>cannot justify departing from statutory text.&para;<br>We must also decline to identify a fixed class of relation­&para;<br>ships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful. We&para;<br>expect that firing a close family member will almost al­&para;<br>ways meet the Burlington standard, and inflicting a&para;<br>milder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never&para;<br>do so, but beyond that we are reluctant to generalize. As&para;<br>we explained in Burlington, 548 U. S., at 69, “the signifi­&para;<br>cance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon&para;<br>the particular circumstances.” Given the broad statutory&para;<br>text and the variety of workplace contexts in which re­&para;<br>taliation may occur, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision is&para;<br>simply not reducible to a comprehensive set of clear rules.&para;<br>We emphasize, however, that “the provision’s standard for&para;<br>judging harm must be objective,” so as to “avoi[d] the&para;<br>uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a&para;<br>judicial effort to determine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective&para;<br>feelings.” Id., at 68–69.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The more difficult question in this case is whether&para;<br>Thompson may sue NAS for its alleged violation of Title&para;<br>VII. The statute provides that “a civil action may be&para;<br>brought . . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved.” 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1). The Sixth Circuit concluded that&para;<br>this provision was merely a reiteration of the requirement&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the plaintiff have Article III standing. 567 F. 3d, at&para;<br>808, n. 1. We do not understand how that can be. The&para;<br>provision unquestionably permits a person “claiming to be&para;<br>aggrieved” to bring “a civil action.” It is arguable that the&para;<br>aggrievement referred to is nothing more than the mini­&para;<br>mal Article III standing, which consists of injury in fact&para;<br>caused by the defendant and remediable by the court. See&para;<br>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561&para;<br>(1992). But Thompson’s claim undoubtedly meets those&para;<br>requirements, so if that is indeed all that aggrievement&para;<br>consists of, he may sue.&para;<br>We have suggested in dictum that the Title VII ag­&para;<br>grievement requirement conferred a right to sue on all&para;<br>who satisfied Article III standing. Trafficante v. Metro&para;<br>politan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205 (1972), involved the&para;<br>“person aggrieved” provision of Title VIII (the Fair Hous­&para;<br>ing Act) rather than Title VII. In deciding the case, how­&para;<br>ever, we relied upon, and cited with approval, a Third&para;<br>Circuit opinion involving Title VII, which, we said, “con­&para;<br>cluded that the words used showed ‘a congressional&para;<br>intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by&para;<br>Article III of the Constitution.’ ” Id., at 209 (quoting&para;<br>Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F. 2d 442, 446 (1971)).&para;<br>We think that dictum regarding Title VII was too expan­&para;<br>sive. Indeed, the Trafficante opinion did not adhere to it&para;<br>in expressing its Title VIII holding that residents of an&para;<br>apartment complex could sue the owner for his racial&para;<br>discrimination against prospective tenants. The opinion&para;<br>said that the “person aggrieved” of Title VIII was coexten­&para;<br>sive with Article III “insofar as tenants of the same hous&para;<br>ing unit that is charged with discrimination are con&para;<br>cerned.” 409 U. S., at 209 (emphasis added). Later&para;<br>opinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term&para;<br>“aggrieved” in Title VIII reaches as far as Article III per­&para;<br>mits, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 165–166 (1997);&para;<br>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>109 (1979), though the holdings of those cases are com­&para;<br>patible with the “zone of interests” limitation that we&para;<br>discuss below. In any event, it is Title VII rather than&para;<br>Title VIII that is before us here, and as to that we are&para;<br>surely not bound by the Trafficante dictum.&para;<br>We now find that this dictum was ill-considered, and we&para;<br>decline to follow it. If any person injured in the Article III&para;<br>sense by a Title VII violation could sue, absurd conse­&para;<br>quences would follow. For example, a shareholder would&para;<br>be able to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for&para;<br>racially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show&para;<br>that the value of his stock decreased as a consequence. At&para;<br>oral argument Thompson acknowledged that such a suit&para;<br>would not lie, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6. We agree, and there­&para;<br>fore conclude that the term “aggrieved” must be construed&para;<br>more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Article III.&para;<br>At the other extreme from the position that “person&para;<br>aggrieved” means anyone with Article III standing, NAS&para;<br>argues that it is a term of art that refers only to the em­&para;<br>ployee who engaged in the protected activity. We know of&para;<br>no other context in which the words carry this artificially&para;<br>narrow meaning, and if that is what Congress intended it&para;<br>would more naturally have said “person claiming to have&para;<br>been discriminated against” rather than “person claiming&para;<br>to be aggrieved.” We see no basis in text or prior practice&para;<br>for limiting the latter phrase to the person who was the&para;<br>subject of unlawful retaliation. Moreover, such a reading&para;<br>contradicts the very holding of Trafficante, which was that&para;<br>residents of an apartment complex were “person[s] ag­&para;<br>grieved” by discrimination against prospective tenants.&para;<br>We see no reason why the same phrase in Title VII should&para;<br>be given a narrower meaning.&para;<br>In our view there is a common usage of the term “person&para;<br>aggrieved” that avoids the extremity of equating it with&para;<br>Article III and yet is fully consistent with our application&para;<br>of the term in Trafficante.

We have held that this language establishes a&para;<br>regime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he&para;<br>“falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected&para;<br>by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal&para;<br>basis for his complaint.” Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed&para;<br>eration, 497 U. S. 871, 883 (1990). We have described the&para;<br>“zone of interests” test as denying a right of review “if&para;<br>the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or in­&para;<br>consistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it&para;<br>cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to&para;<br>permit the suit.” Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479&para;<br>U. S. 388, 399–400 (1987). We hold that the term “ag­&para;<br>grieved” in Title VII incorporates this test, enabling suit&para;<br>by any plaintiff with an interest “arguably [sought] to be&para;<br>protected by the statutes,” National Credit Union Admin.&para;<br>v. First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495 (1998)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted), while excluding plain­&para;<br>tiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III&para;<br>sense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory&para;<br>prohibitions in Title VII.&para;<br>Applying that test here, we conclude that Thompson&para;<br>falls within the zone of interests protected by Title VII.&para;<br>Thompson was an employee of NAS, and the purpose of&para;<br>Title VII is to protect employees from their employers’&para;<br>unlawful actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged,&para;<br>Thompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation—&para;<br>collateral damage, so to speak, of the employer’s unlawful&para;<br>act. To the contrary, injuring him was the employer’s&para;<br>intended means of harming Regalado. Hurting him was&para;<br>the unlawful act by which the employer punished her. In&para;<br>those circumstances, we think Thompson well within the&para;<br>zone of interests sought to be protected by Title VII.
