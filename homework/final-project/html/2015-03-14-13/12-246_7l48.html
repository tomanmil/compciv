At&para;<br>petitioner’s murder trial in Texas state court, and over his objection,&para;<br>the prosecution used his failure to answer the question as evidence of&para;<br>guilt. He was convicted, and both the State Court of Appeals and&para;<br>Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, rejecting his claim that the prosecution’s use of his silence in its case in chief violated the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>369 S. W. 3d 176, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY,&para;<br>concluded that petitioner’s Fifth Amendment claim fails because he&para;<br>did not expressly invoke the privilege in response to the officer’s&para;<br>question. Pp. 3−12.&para;<br>(a) To prevent the privilege against self-incrimination from shielding information not properly within its scope, a witness who “ ‘desires&para;<br>the protection of the privilege . . . must claim it’ ” at the time he relies&para;<br>on it. Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 427. This Court has recognized two exceptions to that requirement. First, a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own&para;<br>trial. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 613–615. Petitioner’s silence falls outside this exception because he had no comparable unqualified right not to speak during his police interview. Second, a&para;<br>witness’ failure to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination&para;<br>must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of&para;<br>the privilege involuntary. See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.&para;<br>436, 467−468, and n. 37. Petitioner cannot benefit from this principle&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>because it is undisputed that he agreed to accompany the officers to&para;<br>the station and was free to leave at any time. Pp. 3−6.&para;<br>(b) Petitioner seeks a third exception to the express invocation requirement for cases where the witness chooses to stand mute rather&para;<br>than give an answer that officials suspect would be incriminating,&para;<br>but this Court’s cases all but foreclose that argument. A defendant&para;<br>normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent. See Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 560. And the express invocation&para;<br>requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that&para;<br>the answer to his question would incriminate the witness. See Murphy, supra, at 427−428. For the same reasons that neither a witness’&para;<br>silence nor official suspicion is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness&para;<br>of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, they do not do so&para;<br>together. The proposed exception also would be difficult to reconcile&para;<br>with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S. 370, where this Court held in&para;<br>the closely related context of post-Miranda silence that a defendant&para;<br>failed to invoke his right to cut off police questioning when he remained silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Id., at ___.&para;<br>Petitioner claims that reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege is&para;<br>the most likely explanation for silence in a case like his, but such silence is “insolubly ambiguous.” See Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, 617.&para;<br>To be sure, petitioner might have declined to answer the officer’s&para;<br>question in reliance on his constitutional privilege. But he also might&para;<br>have done so because he was trying to think of a good lie, because he&para;<br>was embarrassed, or because he was protecting someone else. Not&para;<br>every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt, but&para;<br>neither is every possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amendment. Petitioner also suggests that it would be unfair to require a&para;<br>suspect unschooled in the particulars of legal doctrine to do anything&para;<br>more than remain silent in order to invoke his “right to remain silent.” But the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no one may be&para;<br>“compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,” not&para;<br>an unqualified “right to remain silent.” In any event, it is settled&para;<br>that forfeiture of the privilege against self-incrimination need not be&para;<br>knowing. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 427–428. Pp. 6−10.&para;<br>(c) Petitioner’s argument that applying the express invocation requirement in this context will be unworkable is also unpersuasive.&para;<br>The Court has long required defendants to assert the privilege in order to subsequently benefit from it, and this rule has not proved difficult to apply in practice. Pp. 10−12.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that petitioner’s claim would fail even if he invoked the privilege because the&para;<br>prosecutor’s comments regarding his precustodial silence did not&para;<br>compel him to give self-incriminating testimony.

But&para;<br>petitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the&para;<br>crime scene would match petitioner’s shotgun. Petitioner&para;<br>was subsequently charged with murder, and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officer’s question&para;<br>suggested that he was guilty. Petitioner claims that this&para;<br>argument violated the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.”&para;<br>Petitioner’s Fifth Amendment claim fails because he&para;<br>did not expressly invoke the privilege against selfincrimination in response to the officer’s question. It has&para;<br>long been settled that the privilege “generally is not selfexecuting” and that a witness who desires its protection&para;<br>“ ‘must claim it.’ ” Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420,&para;<br>425, 427 (1984) (quoting United States v. Monia, 317 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>424, 427 (1943)). Although “no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege,” Quinn v. United&para;<br>States, 349 U. S. 155, 164 (1955), a witness does not do so&para;<br>by simply standing mute. Because petitioner was required&para;<br>to assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the&para;<br>judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting&para;<br>petitioner’s Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On the morning of December 18, 1992, two brothers&para;<br>were shot and killed in their Houston home. There were&para;<br>no witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard&para;<br>gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed&para;<br>away in a dark-colored car. Police recovered six shotgun&para;<br>shell casings at the scene. The investigation led police to&para;<br>petitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims&para;<br>hosted the night before they were killed. Police visited&para;<br>petitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in&para;<br>the driveway. He agreed to hand over his shotgun for&para;<br>ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station&para;<br>for questioning.&para;<br>Petitioner’s interview with the police lasted approximately one hour. All agree that the interview was noncustodial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption&para;<br>that he was not read Miranda warnings. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). For most of the&para;<br>interview, petitioner answered the officer’s questions. But&para;<br>when asked whether his shotgun “would match the shells&para;<br>recovered at the scene of the murder,” App. 17, petitioner&para;<br>declined to answer. Instead, petitioner “[l]ooked down at&para;<br>the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his&para;<br>hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.” Id., at 18.&para;<br>After a few moments of silence, the officer asked additional questions, which petitioner answered. Ibid.&para;<br>Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on&para;<br>outstanding traffic warrants. Prosecutors soon concluded&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with&para;<br>the murders, and he was released. A few days later, police&para;<br>obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard&para;<br>petitioner confess to the killings. On the strength of&para;<br>that additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge petitioner, but by this time he had absconded. In 2007, police&para;<br>discovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an&para;<br>assumed name.&para;<br>Petitioner did not testify at trial. Over his objection,&para;<br>prosecutors used his reaction to the officer’s question during the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt. The jury&para;<br>found petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sentence. On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of&para;<br>Texas, petitioner argued that prosecutors’ use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, reasoning that petitioner’s prearrest, pre-Miranda&para;<br>silence was not “compelled” within the meaning of the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment. 368 S. W. 3d 550, 557–559 (2011). The&para;<br>Texas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and&para;<br>affirmed on the same ground. 369 S. W. 3d 176 (2012).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve&para;<br>a division of authority in the lower courts over whether&para;<br>the prosecution may use a defendant’s assertion of the&para;<br>privilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial&para;<br>police interview as part of its case in chief. Compare, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Rivera, 944 F. 2d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991),&para;<br>with United States v. Moore, 104 F. 3d 377, 386 (CADC&para;<br>1997). But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege&para;<br>during his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that&para;<br>question.&para;<br>II&para;<br>A&para;<br>The privilege against self-incrimination “is an exception&para;<br>to the general principle that the Government has the right&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>to everyone’s testimony.” Garner v. United States, 424&para;<br>U. S. 648, 658, n. 11 (1976). To prevent the privilege from&para;<br>shielding information not properly within its scope, we&para;<br>have long held that a witness who “ ‘desires the protection&para;<br>of the privilege . . . must claim it’ ” at the time he relies on&para;<br>it. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 427 (quoting Monia, 317 U. S., at&para;<br>427). See also United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927).&para;<br>That requirement ensures that the Government is put&para;<br>on notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege&para;<br>so that it may either argue that the testimony sought&para;<br>could not be self-incriminating, see Hoffman v. United&para;<br>States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951), or cure any potential&para;<br>self-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 448 (1972). The express invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with&para;<br>evaluating a Fifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous&para;<br>record establishing the witness’ reasons for refusing to&para;<br>answer. See Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 560,&para;<br>n. 7 (1980) (“A witness may not employ the privilege to&para;<br>avoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not&para;<br>to give”); Hutcheson v. United States, 369 U. S. 599, 610–&para;<br>611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as&para;<br>proper assertion of the privilege). In these ways, insisting&para;<br>that witnesses expressly invoke the privilege “assures that&para;<br>the Government obtains all the information to which it is&para;<br>entitled.” Garner, supra, at 658, n. 11.&para;<br>We have previously recognized two exceptions to the&para;<br>requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but&para;<br>neither applies here. First, we held in Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 613–615 (1965), that a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at&para;<br>his own trial. That exception reflects the fact that a criminal defendant has an “absolute right not to testify.”&para;<br>Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398, 433 (1970) (Black,&para;<br>J., dissenting); see United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>637 (2004) (plurality opinion). Since a defendant’s reasons&para;<br>for remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitutional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke&para;<br>the privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing&para;<br>that his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a&para;<br>grant of immunity could force him to speak. Because petitioner had no comparable unqualified right during his&para;<br>interview with police, his silence falls outside the Griffin&para;<br>exception.&para;<br>Second, we have held that a witness’ failure to invoke&para;<br>the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.&para;<br>Thus, in Miranda, we said that a suspect who is subjected&para;<br>to the “inherently compelling pressures” of an unwarned&para;<br>custodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege. 384&para;<br>U. S., at 467–468, and n. 37. Due to the uniquely coercive&para;<br>nature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody&para;<br>cannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege&para;<br>“unless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.”&para;<br>Murphy, supra, at 429–430.&para;<br>For similar reasons, we have held that threats to withdraw a governmental benefit such as public employment&para;<br>sometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it&para;<br>need not be affirmatively asserted. Garrity v. New Jersey,&para;<br>385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967) (public employment). See also&para;<br>Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 802–804 (1977)&para;<br>(public office); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 84–85&para;<br>(1973) (public contracts). And where assertion of the&para;<br>privilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed&para;<br>witnesses to exercise the privilege through silence. See,&para;<br>e.g., Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, 28–29 (1969) (no&para;<br>requirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing&para;<br>so would have revealed income from illegal activities);&para;<br>Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 382 U. S.&para;<br>70, 77–79 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not&para;<br>required to complete registration form “where response to&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>any of the form’s questions . . . might involve [them] in the&para;<br>admission of a crucial element of a crime”). The principle&para;<br>that unites all of those cases is that a witness need not&para;<br>expressly invoke the privilege where some form of official&para;<br>compulsion denies him “a ‘free choice to admit, to deny,&para;<br>or to refuse to answer.’ ” Garner, 424 U. S., at 656–657&para;<br>(quoting Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941)).&para;<br>Petitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it&para;<br>is undisputed that his interview with police was voluntary. As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to&para;<br>accompany the officers to the station and “was free to&para;<br>leave at any time during the interview.” Brief for Petitioner 2–3 (internal quotation marks omitted). That places&para;<br>petitioner’s situation outside the scope of Miranda and&para;<br>other cases in which we have held that various forms of&para;<br>governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking the privilege. The dissent elides this point&para;<br>when it cites our precedents in this area for the proposition that “[c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation,&para;<br>trigger the protection of the Fifth Amendment.” Post,&para;<br>at 7–8 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The critical question is&para;<br>whether, under the “circumstances” of this case, petitioner&para;<br>was deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. He was not. We have before us no allegation&para;<br>that petitioner’s failure to assert the privilege was involuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to&para;<br>say that he was not answering the officer’s question on&para;<br>Fifth Amendment grounds. Because he failed to do so, the&para;<br>prosecution’s use of his noncustodial silence did not violate&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the invocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands&para;<br>mute and thereby declines to give an answer that officials suspect would be incriminating. Our cases all but&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>foreclose such an exception, which would needlessly burden the Government’s interests in obtaining testimony&para;<br>and prosecuting criminal activity. We therefore decline&para;<br>petitioner’s invitation to craft a new exception to the&para;<br>“general rule” that a witness must assert the privilege to&para;<br>subsequently benefit from it. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 429.&para;<br>Our cases establish that a defendant normally does not&para;<br>invoke the privilege by remaining silent. In Roberts v.&para;<br>United States, 445 U. S. 552, for example, we rejected the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained&para;<br>silent throughout a police investigation and received a&para;<br>harsher sentence for his failure to cooperate. In so ruling,&para;<br>we explained that “if [the defendant] believed that his&para;<br>failure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so&para;<br>at a time when the sentencing court could have determined whether his claim was legitimate.” Id., at 560. See&para;<br>also United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 263–264&para;<br>(1927); Vajtauer, 273 U. S., at 113.1 A witness does not&para;<br>expressly invoke the privilege by standing mute.&para;<br>We have also repeatedly held that the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason&para;<br>to suspect that the answer to his question would incriminate the witness. Thus, in Murphy we held that the&para;<br>defendant’s self-incriminating answers to his probation officer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to&para;<br>invoke the privilege. 465 U. S., at 427–428. In reaching&para;<br>that conclusion, we rejected the notion “that a witness&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The dissent argues that in these cases “neither the nature of the&para;<br>questions nor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them provided&para;<br>any basis to infer a tie between the silence and the Fifth Amendment.”&para;<br>Post, at 5–6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But none of our precedents suggests that governmental officials are obliged to guess at the meaning of&para;<br>a witness’ unexplained silence when implicit reliance on the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment seems probable. Roberts does not say as much, despite its&para;<br>holding that the defendant in that case was required to explain the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment basis for his failure to cooperate with an investigation that led to his prosecution. 445 U. S., at 559.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>must ‘put the Government on notice by formally availing&para;<br>himself of the privilege’ only when he alone ‘is reasonably&para;<br>aware of the incriminating tendency of the questions.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 428 (quoting Roberts, supra, at 562, n.* (Brennan,&para;<br>J., concurring)). See also United States v. Kordel, 397&para;<br>U. S. 1, 7 (1970).2&para;<br>Petitioner does not dispute the vitality of either of those&para;<br>lines of precedent but instead argues that we should adopt&para;<br>an exception for cases at their intersection. Thus, petitioner would have us hold that although neither a witness’ silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse&para;<br>the express invocation requirement, the invocation requirement does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of&para;<br>official suspicions. For the same reasons that neither&para;<br>of those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of&para;<br>the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, we conclude that they do not do so together. A contrary result&para;<br>would do little to protect those genuinely relying on the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment privilege while placing a needless new&para;<br>burden on society’s interest in the admission of evidence&para;<br>that is probative of a criminal defendant’s guilt.&para;<br>Petitioner’s proposed exception would also be very difficult to reconcile with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S.&para;<br>370 (2010). There, we held in the closely related context of&para;<br>post-Miranda silence that a defendant failed to invoke the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Our cases do not support the distinction the dissent draws between&para;<br>silence and the failure to invoke the privilege before making incriminating statements. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissenting). For example,&para;<br>Murphy, a case in which the witness made incriminating statements&para;<br>after failing to invoke the privilege, repeatedly relied on Roberts&para;<br>and Vajtauer—two cases in which witnesses remained silent and did&para;<br>not make incriminating statements. 465 U. S., at 427, 429, 455–456,&para;<br>n. 20. Similarly, Kordel cited Vajtauer, among other cases, for the&para;<br>proposition that the defendant’s “failure at any time to assert the&para;<br>constitutional privilege leaves him in no position to complain now that&para;<br>he was compelled to give testimony against himself.” 397 U. S., at 10,&para;<br>and n. 18.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>3, 8–10). If the extended custodial silence in that case did&para;<br>not invoke the privilege, then surely the momentary silence in this case did not do so either.&para;<br>Petitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish Berghuis by observing that it did not concern the admissibility of the defendant’s silence but instead involved the&para;<br>admissibility of his subsequent statements. Post, at 8–9&para;<br>(opinion of BREYER, J.). But regardless of whether prosecutors seek to use silence or a confession that follows, the&para;<br>logic of Berghuis applies with equal force: A suspect who&para;<br>stands mute has not done enough to put police on notice&para;<br>that he is relying on his Fifth Amendment privilege.3&para;<br>In support of their proposed exception to the invocation&para;<br>requirement, petitioner and the dissent argue that reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege is the most likely&para;<br>explanation for silence in a case such as this one. Reply&para;<br>Brief 17; see post, at 9–10 (BREYER, J., dissenting). But&para;<br>whatever the most probable explanation, such silence is&para;<br>“insolubly ambiguous.” See Doyle, v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610,&para;<br>617 (1976). To be sure, someone might decline to answer a&para;<br>police officer’s question in reliance on his constitutional&para;<br>privilege. But he also might do so because he is trying to&para;<br>think of a good lie, because he is embarrassed, or because&para;<br>he is protecting someone else. Not every such possible&para;<br>explanation for silence is probative of guilt, but neither is&para;<br>every possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amendment.

I think there is&para;<br>a simpler way to resolve this case. In my view, Salinas’&para;<br>claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege because the prosecutor’s comments regarding his precustodial silence did not compel him to give self-incriminating&para;<br>testimony.&para;<br>In Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), this Court&para;<br>held that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor or&para;<br>judge from commenting on a defendant’s failure to testify.&para;<br>Id., at 614. The Court reasoned that such comments, and&para;<br>any adverse inferences drawn from them, are a “penalty”&para;<br>imposed on the defendant’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege. Ibid. Salinas argues that we should&para;<br>extend Griffin’s no-adverse-inference rule to a defendant’s&para;<br>silence during a precustodial interview. I have previously&para;<br>explained that the Court’s decision in Griffin “lacks foundation in the Constitution’s text, history, or logic” and&para;<br>should not be extended. See Mitchell v.

I adhere to that&para;<br>view today.&para;<br>Griffin is impossible to square with the text of the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment, which provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be&para;<br>compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against&para;<br>himself.” A defendant is not “compelled . . . to be a witness&para;<br>against himself ” simply because a jury has been told that&para;<br>it may draw an adverse inference from his silence. See&para;<br>Mitchell, supra, at 331 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[T]he&para;<br>threat of an adverse inference does not ‘compel’ anyone to&para;<br>testify. . . . Indeed, I imagine that in most instances, a&para;<br>guilty defendant would choose to remain silent despite&para;<br>the adverse inference, on the theory that it would do&para;<br>him less damage than his cross-examined testimony”);&para;<br>Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.

And I dissent from the&para;<br>Court’s contrary conclusion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In January 1993, Houston police began to suspect petitioner Genovevo Salinas of having committed two murders&para;<br>the previous month. They asked Salinas to come to the&para;<br>police station “to take photographs and to clear him as [a]&para;<br>suspect.” App. 3. At the station, police took Salinas into&para;<br>what he describes as “an interview room.” Brief for Petitioner 3. Because he was “free to leave at that time,” App.&para;<br>14, they did not give him Miranda warnings. The police&para;<br>then asked Salinas questions. And Salinas answered until&para;<br>the police asked him whether the shotgun from his home&para;<br>“would match the shells recovered at the scene of the&para;<br>murder.” Id., at 17. At that point Salinas fell silent. Ibid.&para;<br>Salinas was later tried for, and convicted of, murder. At&para;<br>closing argument, drawing on testimony he had elicited&para;<br>earlier, the prosecutor pointed out to the jury that Salinas,&para;<br>during his earlier questioning at the police station, had&para;<br>remained silent when asked about the shotgun. The&para;<br>prosecutor told the jury, among other things, that “ ‘[a]n&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>innocent person’ ” would have said, “ ‘What are you talking&para;<br>about? I didn’t do that. I wasn’t there.’ ” 368 S. W. 3d&para;<br>550, 556 (Tex. Ct. App. 2011). But Salinas, the prosecutor&para;<br>said, “ ‘didn’t respond that way.’ ” Ibid. Rather, “ ‘[h]e&para;<br>wouldn’t answer that question.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The question before us is whether the Fifth Amendment&para;<br>prohibits the prosecutor from eliciting and commenting&para;<br>upon the evidence about Salinas’ silence. The plurality&para;<br>believes that the Amendment does not bar the evidence&para;<br>and comments because Salinas “did not expressly invoke&para;<br>the privilege against self-incrimination” when he fell silent&para;<br>during the questioning at the police station. Ante, at 1.&para;<br>But, in my view, that conclusion is inconsistent with this&para;<br>Court’s case law and its underlying practical rationale.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Fifth Amendment prohibits prosecutors from commenting on an individual’s silence where that silence&para;<br>amounts to an effort to avoid becoming “a witness against&para;<br>himself.” This Court has specified that “a rule of evidence”&para;<br>permitting “commen[t] . . . by counsel” in a criminal case&para;<br>upon a defendant’s failure to testify “violates the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment.” Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 610,&para;<br>n. 2, 613 (1965) (internal quotation marks omitted). See&para;<br>also United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 637 (2004)&para;<br>(plurality opinion); Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398,&para;<br>433 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting). And, since “it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth&para;<br>Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial&para;<br>interrogation,” the “prosecution may not . . . use at trial&para;<br>the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the&para;<br>face of accusation.” Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,&para;<br>468, n. 37 (1966) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Particularly in the context of police interrogation, a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>contrary rule would undermine the basic protection that&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment provides. Cf. Kastigar v. United&para;<br>States, 406 U. S. 441, 461 (1972) (“The privilege . . . usually operates to allow a citizen to remain silent when asked&para;<br>a question requiring an incriminatory answer”). To permit&para;<br>a prosecutor to comment on a defendant’s constitutionally&para;<br>protected silence would put that defendant in an impossible predicament. He must either answer the question or&para;<br>remain silent. If he answers the question, he may well&para;<br>reveal, for example, prejudicial facts, disreputable associates, or suspicious circumstances—even if he is innocent.&para;<br>See, e.g., Griffin, supra, at 613; Kassin, Inside Interrogation: Why Innocent People Confess, 32 Am. J. Trial Advoc.&para;<br>525, 537 (2009). If he remains silent, the prosecutor may&para;<br>well use that silence to suggest a consciousness of guilt.&para;<br>And if the defendant then takes the witness stand in order&para;<br>to explain either his speech or his silence, the prosecution&para;<br>may introduce, say for impeachment purposes, a prior&para;<br>conviction that the law would otherwise make inadmissible. Thus, where the Fifth Amendment is at issue, to&para;<br>allow comment on silence directly or indirectly can compel&para;<br>an individual to act as “a witness against himself ”—very&para;<br>much what the Fifth Amendment forbids. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 596–597 (1990) (definition of&para;<br>“testimonial” includes responses to questions that require&para;<br>a suspect to communicate an express or implied assertion&para;<br>of fact or belief). And that is similarly so whether the&para;<br>questioned individual, as part of his decision to remain&para;<br>silent, invokes the Fifth Amendment explicitly or implicitly, through words, through deeds, or through reference to&para;<br>surrounding circumstances.&para;<br>B&para;<br>It is consequently not surprising that this Court, more&para;<br>than half a century ago, explained that “no ritualistic&para;<br>formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Quinn v. United States, 349 U. S. 155, 164 (1955). Thus,&para;<br>a prosecutor may not comment on a defendant’s failure to&para;<br>testify at trial—even if neither the defendant nor anyone&para;<br>else ever mentions a Fifth Amendment right not to do so.&para;<br>Circumstances, not a defendant’s statement, tie the defendant’s silence to the right. Similarly, a prosecutor may&para;<br>not comment on the fact that a defendant in custody, after&para;<br>receiving Miranda warnings, “stood mute”—regardless of&para;<br>whether he “claimed his privilege” in so many words.&para;<br>Miranda, supra, at 468, n. 37. Again, it is not any explicit&para;<br>statement but, instead, the defendant’s deeds (silence) and&para;<br>circumstances (receipt of the warnings) that tie together&para;<br>silence and constitutional right. Most lower courts have so&para;<br>construed the law, even where the defendant, having&para;<br>received Miranda warnings, answers some questions&para;<br>while remaining silent as to others. See, e.g., Hurd v.&para;<br>Terhune, 619 F. 3d 1080, 1087 (CA9 2010); United States&para;<br>v. May, 52 F. 3d 885, 890 (CA10 1995); United States v.&para;<br>Scott, 47 F. 3d 904, 907 (CA7 1995); United States v. Canterbury, 985 F. 2d 483, 486 (CA10 1993); Grieco v. Hall,&para;<br>641 F. 2d 1029, 1034 (CA1 1981); United States v. Ghiz,&para;<br>491 F. 2d 599, 600 (CA4 1974). But see, e.g., United States&para;<br>v. Harris, 956 F. 2d 177, 181 (CA8 1992).&para;<br>The cases in which this Court has insisted that a defendant expressly mention the Fifth Amendment by name&para;<br>in order to rely on its privilege to protect silence are cases&para;<br>where (1) the circumstances surrounding the silence (unlike the present case) did not give rise to an inference that&para;<br>the defendant intended, by his silence, to exercise his Fifth&para;<br>Amendment rights; and (2) the questioner greeted by the&para;<br>silence (again unlike the present case) had a special need&para;<br>to know whether the defendant sought to rely on the&para;<br>protections of the Fifth Amendment. See ante, at 4 (explaining that, in such cases, the government needs to&para;<br>know the basis for refusing to answer “so that it may&para;<br>either argue that the testimony sought could not be self-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>incriminating or cure any potential self-incrimination&para;<br>through a grant of immunity” (citation omitted)). These&para;<br>cases include Roberts, Rogers, Sullivan, Vajtauer, and&para;<br>Jenkins—all of which at least do involve the protection of&para;<br>silence—and also include cases emphasized by the plurality that are not even about silence—namely, Murphy and&para;<br>Garner.&para;<br>In Roberts and Rogers, the individual refused to answer&para;<br>questions that government investigators (in Roberts) and a&para;<br>grand jury (in Rogers) asked, principally because the&para;<br>individual wanted to avoid incriminating other persons.&para;<br>Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 553–556 (1980);&para;<br>Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 368–370, and n. 4&para;<br>(1951). But the Fifth Amendment does not protect someone from incriminating others; it protects against selfincrimination. In turn, neither the nature of the questions&para;<br>nor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them provided any basis to infer a tie between the silence and the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment, while knowledge of any such tie would&para;<br>have proved critical to the questioner’s determination as to&para;<br>whether the defendant had any proper legal basis for&para;<br>claiming Fifth Amendment protection.&para;<br>In Sullivan, the defendant’s silence consisted of his&para;<br>failure to file a tax return—a return, he later claimed, that&para;<br>would have revealed his illegal activity as a bootlegger.&para;<br>United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 262–264 (1927).&para;<br>The circumstances did not give rise to an inference of a tie&para;<br>between his silence (in the form of failing to file a tax&para;<br>return) and the Fifth Amendment; and, if he really did&para;<br>want to rely on the Fifth Amendment, then the government would have had special need to know of any such tie&para;<br>in order to determine whether, for example, the assertion&para;<br>of privilege was valid and, perhaps, an offer of immunity&para;<br>was appropriate.&para;<br>In Vajtauer, an alien refused to answer questions asked&para;<br>by an immigration official at a deportation proceeding.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927). Here, the circumstances&para;<br>gave rise to a distinct inference that the alien was not&para;<br>invoking any Fifth Amendment privilege: The alien’s&para;<br>lawyer had stated quite publicly at the hearing that he&para;<br>advised his client to remain silent not on Fifth Amendment grounds; rather, the lawyer “ ‘advise[d] the alien not&para;<br>to answer any further questions until the evidence upon&para;<br>which the warrant is based will be presented here.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 106–107 (quoting the lawyer). This statement weakened or destroyed the possibility of a silence-Fifth&para;<br>Amendment linkage; the Government could not challenge&para;<br>his right to invoke the Fifth Amendment; and this Court&para;<br>described its later invocation as “evidently an afterthought.” Id., at 113.&para;<br>Perhaps most illustrative is Jenkins, a case upon which&para;<br>the plurality relies, ante, at 9, n. 3, and upon which the&para;<br>Texas Court of Criminal Appeals relied almost exclusively,&para;<br>369 S. W. 3d 176, 178–179 (2012). Jenkins killed someone, and was not arrested until he turned himself in two&para;<br>weeks later. Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 232&para;<br>(1980). On cross-examination at his trial, Jenkins claimed&para;<br>that his killing was in self-defense after being attacked.&para;<br>Id., at 232–233. The prosecutor then asked why he did not&para;<br>report the alleged attack, and in closing argument suggested that Jenkins’ failure to do so cast doubt on his&para;<br>claim to have acted in self-defense. Id., at 233–234. We&para;<br>explained that this unusual form of “prearrest silence”&para;<br>was not constitutionally protected from use at trial. Id., at&para;<br>240. Perhaps even more aptly, Justice Stevens’ concurrence noted that “the privilege against compulsory selfincrimination is simply irrelevant” in such circumstances.&para;<br>Id., at 241 (footnote omitted). How would anyone have&para;<br>known that Jenkins, while failing to report an attack, was&para;<br>relying on the Fifth Amendment? And how would the&para;<br>government have had any way of determining whether his&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>claim was valid? In Jenkins, as in Roberts, Rogers, Sullivan, and Vajtauer, no one had any reason to connect silence to the Fifth Amendment; and the government had no&para;<br>opportunity to contest any alleged connection.&para;<br>Still further afield from today’s case are Murphy and&para;<br>Garner, neither of which involved silence at all. Rather, in&para;<br>both cases, a defendant had earlier answered questions&para;<br>posed by the government—in Murphy, by speaking with a&para;<br>probation officer, and in Garner, by completing a tax&para;<br>return. Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 422–425&para;<br>(1984); Garner v. United States, 424 U. S. 648, 649–650&para;<br>(1976). At the time of providing answers, neither circumstances nor deeds nor words suggested reliance on the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment: Murphy simply answered questions&para;<br>posed by his probation officer; Garner simply filled out a&para;<br>tax return.&para;<br>They did not argue that their selfincriminating statements had been “compelled” in violation of the Fifth Amendment until later, at trial. Murphy,&para;<br>supra, at 425, 431; Garner, supra, at 649, 665. The Court&para;<br>held that those statements were not compelled. Murphy,&para;<br>supra, at 440; Garner, supra, at 665. The circumstances&para;<br>indicated that the defendants had affirmatively chosen to&para;<br>speak and to write.&para;<br>Thus, we have two sets of cases: One where express&para;<br>invocation of the Fifth Amendment was not required to tie&para;<br>one’s silence to its protections, and another where something like express invocation was required, because circumstances demanded some explanation for the silence&para;<br>(or the statements) in order to indicate that the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment was at issue.&para;<br>There is also a third set of cases, cases that may well fit&para;<br>into the second category but where the Court has held that&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment both applies and does not require&para;<br>express invocation despite ambiguous circumstances. The&para;<br>Court in those cases has made clear that an individual,&para;<br>when silent, need not expressly invoke the Fifth Amend-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ment if there are “inherently compelling pressures” not to&para;<br>do so. Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467. Thus, in Garrity v.&para;<br>New Jersey, 385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967), the Court held that&para;<br>no explicit assertion of the Fifth Amendment was required&para;<br>where, in the course of an investigation, such assertion&para;<br>would, by law, have cost police officers their jobs. Similarly,&para;<br>this Court did not require explicit assertion in response&para;<br>to a grand jury subpoena where that assertion would have&para;<br>cost two architects their public contracts or a political&para;<br>official his job. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 75–76&para;<br>(1973); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 802–804&para;<br>(1977). In Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, 28–29&para;<br>(1969), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not&para;<br>require explicit assertion of the privilege against selfincrimination because, in the context of the Marihuana&para;<br>Tax Act, such assertion would have been inherently incriminating. In Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control&para;<br>Bd., 382 U. S. 70, 77–79 (1965), we held the same where&para;<br>explicit assertion of the Fifth Amendment would have&para;<br>required, as a first step, the potentially incriminating&para;<br>admission of membership in the Communist Party. The&para;<br>Court has also held that gamblers, without explicitly&para;<br>invoking the Fifth Amendment, need not comply with tax&para;<br>requirements that would, inherently and directly, lead to&para;<br>self-incrimination. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S.&para;<br>39, 60–61 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62,&para;<br>67–68 (1968). All told, this third category of cases receives&para;<br>the same treatment as the first: Circumstances, rather&para;<br>than explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. So, too, in today’s case.&para;<br>The plurality refers to one additional case, namely&para;<br>Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S. 370 (2010). See ante, at&para;<br>8. But that case is here beside the point. In Berghuis, the&para;<br>defendant was in custody, he had been informed of his&para;<br>Miranda rights, and he was subsequently silent in the&para;<br>face of 2 hours and 45 minutes of questioning before he&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>offered any substantive answers. Id., at ___–___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 2–4). The Court held that he had waived his Fifth&para;<br>Amendment rights in respect to his later speech. The&para;<br>Court said nothing at all about a prosecutor’s right to&para;<br>comment on his preceding silence and no prosecutor&para;<br>sought to do so. Indeed, how could a prosecutor lawfully&para;<br>have tried to do so, given this Court’s statement in Miranda itself that a prosecutor cannot comment on the fact&para;<br>that, after receiving Miranda warnings, the suspect “stood&para;<br>mute”? 384 U. S., at 468, n. 37.&para;<br>We end where we began. “[N]o ritualistic formula is&para;<br>necessary in order to invoke the privilege.” Quinn, 349&para;<br>U. S., at 164. Much depends on the circumstances of the&para;<br>particular case, the most important circumstances being:&para;<br>(1) whether one can fairly infer that the individual being&para;<br>questioned is invoking the Amendment’s protection; (2) if&para;<br>that is unclear, whether it is particularly important for&para;<br>the questioner to know whether the individual is doing so;&para;<br>and (3) even if it is, whether, in any event, there is a good&para;<br>reason for excusing the individual from referring to the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment, such as inherent penalization simply&para;<br>by answering.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Applying these principles to the present case, I would&para;<br>hold that Salinas need not have expressly invoked the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment. The context was that of a criminal&para;<br>investigation. Police told Salinas that and made clear that&para;<br>he was a suspect. His interrogation took place at the&para;<br>police station. Salinas was not represented by counsel.&para;<br>The relevant question—about whether the shotgun from&para;<br>Salinas’ home would incriminate him—amounted to a&para;<br>switch in subject matter. And it was obvious that the new&para;<br>question sought to ferret out whether Salinas was guilty of&para;<br>murder. See 368 S. W. 3d, at 552–553.&para;<br>These circumstances give rise to a reasonable inference&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that Salinas’ silence derived from an exercise of his Fifth&para;<br>Amendment rights. This Court has recognized repeatedly&para;<br>that many, indeed most, Americans are aware that they&para;<br>have a constitutional right not to incriminate themselves&para;<br>by answering questions posed by the police during an&para;<br>interrogation conducted in order to figure out the perpetrator of a crime. See Dickerson v. United States, 530&para;<br>U. S. 428, 443 (2000); Brogan v. United States, 522 U. S.&para;<br>398, 405 (1998); Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 439&para;<br>(1974). The nature of the surroundings, the switch of&para;<br>topic, the particular question—all suggested that the right&para;<br>we have and generally know we have was at issue at the&para;<br>critical moment here. Salinas, not being represented by&para;<br>counsel, would not likely have used the precise words&para;<br>“Fifth Amendment” to invoke his rights because he would&para;<br>not likely have been aware of technical legal requirements, such as a need to identify the Fifth Amendment by&para;<br>name.&para;<br>At the same time, the need to categorize Salinas’ silence&para;<br>as based on the Fifth Amendment is supported here by the&para;<br>presence, in full force, of the predicament I discussed&para;<br>earlier, namely that of not forcing Salinas to choose between incrimination through speech and incrimination&para;<br>through silence. That need is also supported by the absence of any special reason that the police had to know,&para;<br>with certainty, whether Salinas was, in fact, relying on the&para;<br>Fifth Amendment—such as whether to doubt that there&para;<br>really was a risk of self-incrimination, see Hoffman v.&para;<br>United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951), or whether to&para;<br>grant immunity, see Kastigar, 406 U. S., at 448. Given&para;<br>these circumstances, Salinas’ silence was “sufficient to put&para;<br>the [government] on notice of an apparent claim of the&para;<br>privilege.” Quinn, supra, at 164. That being so, for reasons similar to those given in Griffin, the Fifth Amendment bars the evidence of silence admitted against Salinas&para;<br>and mentioned by the prosecutor. See 380 U. S., at 614–615.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>D&para;<br>&para;<br>I recognize that other cases may arise where facts and&para;<br>circumstances surrounding an individual’s silence present&para;<br>a closer question. The critical question—whether those&para;<br>circumstances give rise to a fair inference that the silence&para;<br>rests on the Fifth Amendment—will not always prove easy&para;<br>to administer. But that consideration does not support the&para;<br>plurality’s rule-based approach here, for the administrative problems accompanying the plurality’s approach are&para;<br>even worse.&para;<br>The plurality says that a suspect must “expressly invoke&para;<br>the privilege against self-incrimination.” Ante, at 1. But&para;<br>does it really mean that the suspect must use the exact&para;<br>words “Fifth Amendment”? How can an individual who is&para;<br>not a lawyer know that these particular words are legally&para;<br>magic? Nor does the Solicitor General help when he adds&para;<br>that the suspect may “mak[e] the claim ‘in any language&para;<br>that [the questioner] may reasonably be expected to understand as an attempt to invoke the privilege.’ ” Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (quoting Quinn, supra,&para;<br>at 162–163; alteration in original). What counts as “making the claim”? Suppose the individual says, “Let’s discuss&para;<br>something else,” or “I’m not sure I want to answer that”; or&para;<br>suppose he just gets up and leaves the room. Cf. Davis v.&para;<br>Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721, 727, n. 6 (1969) (affirming “the&para;<br>settled principle that while the police have the right to&para;<br>request citizens to answer voluntarily questions concerning unsolved crimes[,] they have no right to compel them&para;<br>to answer”); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439&para;<br>(1984) (noting that even someone detained in a Terry stop&para;<br>“is not obliged to respond” to police questions); Florida v.&para;<br>Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 497–498 (1983) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>How is simple silence in the present context any different?&para;<br>The basic problem for the plurality is that an effort to&para;<br>have a simple, clear “explicit statement” rule poses a&para;<br>serious obstacle to those who, like Salinas, seek to assert&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SALINAS v. TEXAS&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>their basic Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, for&para;<br>they are likely unaware of any such linguistic detail. At&para;<br>the same time, acknowledging that our case law does not&para;<br>require use of specific words, see ante, at 2, leaves the&para;<br>plurality without the administrative benefits it might&para;<br>hope to find in requiring that detail.&para;<br>Far better, in my view, to pose the relevant question&para;<br>directly: Can one fairly infer from an individual’s silence&para;<br>and surrounding circumstances an exercise of the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment’s privilege? The need for simplicity, the&para;<br>constitutional importance of applying the Fifth Amendment to those who seek its protection, and this Court’s&para;<br>case law all suggest that this is the right question to ask&para;<br>here. And the answer to that question in the circumstances&para;<br>of today’s case is clearly: yes.&para;<br>For these reasons, I believe that the Fifth Amendment&para;<br>prohibits a prosecutor from commenting on Salinas’s&para;<br>silence. I respectfully dissent from the Court’s contrary&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
