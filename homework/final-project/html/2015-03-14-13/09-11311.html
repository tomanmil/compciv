UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–11311.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued January 12, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>When he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, see 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §922(g)(1), petitioner Sykes had prior convictions for at least&para;<br>three felonies, including the state-law crime of “us[ing] a vehicle” to&para;<br>“knowingly or intentionally” “fle[e] from a law enforcement officer”&para;<br>after being ordered to stop, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A) (2004).&para;<br>The Federal District Court decided that the prior convictions sub&para;<br>jected Sykes to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term that the&para;<br>Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e), provides for&para;<br>an armed defendant who has three prior “violent felony” convictions.&para;<br>Rejecting Sykes’ argument that his vehicle flight felony was not “vio&para;<br>lent” under ACCA, the Seventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Felony vehicle flight, as proscribed by Indiana law, is a violent&para;<br>felony for purposes of ACCA. Pp. 5–14.&para;<br>(a) The “categorical approach” used to determine if a particular&para;<br>crime is a violent felony “consider[s] whether the elements of the of&para;<br>fense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the resid&para;<br>ual provision [of 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)], without inquiring into the&para;<br>specific conduct of th[e] particular offender.” James v. United States,&para;<br>550 U. S. 192, 202 (emphasis deleted). When punishable by more&para;<br>than one year in prison, burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes that&para;<br>involve use of explosives are violet felonies. Under the residual&para;<br>clause in question so too is a crime that “otherwise involves conduct&para;<br>that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,”&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii), i.e., a risk “comparable to that posed by its closest&para;<br>analog among” the statute’s enumerated offenses. Id., at 203. When&para;<br>a perpetrator flees police in a car, his determination to elude capture&para;<br>makes a lack of concern for the safety of others an inherent part of&para;<br>the offense. Even if he drives without going full speed or the wrong&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and&para;<br>lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring&para;<br>him within their custody. His indifference to these collateral conse&para;<br>quences has violent—even lethal—potential for others. A fleeing&para;<br>criminal who creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in&para;<br>degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails inten&para;<br>tional release of a destructive force dangerous to others. Also telling&para;<br>is a comparison to burglary, which is dangerous because it can end in&para;<br>confrontation leading to violence. In fact, the risks associated with&para;<br>vehicle flight may outstrip the dangers of both burglary and arson.&para;<br>While statistics are not dispositive, studies show that the risk of per&para;<br>sonal injuries is about 20% lower for each of those enumerated crimes&para;<br>than for vehicle pursuits. Thus, Indiana’s prohibition on vehicle&para;<br>flight falls within §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s residual clause because, as a&para;<br>categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical in&para;<br>jury to another. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(b) Sykes’ argument—that Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137,&para;<br>and Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, require ACCA predi&para;<br>cate crimes to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that ve&para;<br>hicle flight is not—overreads those opinions. In general, levels of risk&para;<br>divide crimes that qualify as violent felonies from those that do not.&para;<br>Chambers is no exception: It explained that failure to report does not&para;<br>qualify because the typical offender is not “significantly more likely&para;<br>than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender.” 555&para;<br>U. S., at ___–___. Begay, which held that driving under the influence&para;<br>(DUI) is not an ACCA predicate and stated that it is not purposeful,&para;<br>violent, and aggressive, 553 U. S., at 145–148, is the Court’s sole re&para;<br>sidual clause decision in which risk was not the dispositive factor.&para;<br>But Begay also gave a more specific reason for its holding: DUI “need&para;<br>not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145, and is analogous to&para;<br>strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes. Begay’s “pur&para;<br>poseful, violent, and aggressive” phrase is an addition to the statu&para;<br>tory text that has no precise link to the residual clause. Because ve&para;<br>hicle flight is not a strict-liability, negligence, or recklessness crime&para;<br>and is, as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the crimes listed in&para;<br>the residual clause, it is a violent felony. Pp. 10–11&para;<br>(c) Sykes contends that the fact that Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(B)&para;<br>criminalizes flight by an offender who “operates a vehicle in a man&para;<br>ner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person”&para;<br>indicates that Indiana did not intend for §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A), under&para;<br>which he was convicted, to encompass the particular class of vehicle&para;<br>flights reached by subsection (b)(1)(B). This argument is unconvinc&para;<br>ing. Indiana treats the two subsections as felonies of the same mag&para;<br>nitude carrying similar prison terms, suggesting that subsection&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(b)(1)(A) is roughly equivalent to one type of subsection (b)(1)(B) vio&para;<br>lation. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(d) Congress framed ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than&para;<br>encyclopedic, terms. The residual clause imposes enhanced punish&para;<br>ment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior of&para;<br>fenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that pre&para;<br>sented by several enumerated offenses.&para;<br>It instructs potential&para;<br>recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again&para;<br>transgress. This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a&para;<br>person to conform his conduct to the law. While this approach may at&para;<br>times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congres&para;<br>sional power to enact.

S. C. §922(g)(1). The or&para;<br>dinary maximum sentence for that crime is 10 years of&para;<br>imprisonment. §924(a)(2). If, however, when the unlawful&para;<br>possession occurred, the felon had three previous convic&para;<br>tions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, the&para;<br>punishment is increased to a minimum term of 15 years.&para;<br>§924(e). The instant case is another in a series in which&para;<br>the Court is called upon to interpret §924(e) to determine&para;<br>if a particular previous conviction was for a “violent fel&para;<br>ony,” as that term is used in the punishment enhancement&para;<br>statute. See James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007);&para;<br>Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v.&para;<br>United States, 555 U. S. 122 (2009).&para;<br>In this case the previous conviction in question is under&para;<br>an Indiana statute that makes it a criminal offense when&para;<br>ever the driver of a vehicle knowingly or intentionally&para;<br>“flees from a law enforcement officer.” Ind. Code §35–44–&para;<br>3–3 (2004). The relevant text of the statute is set out&para;<br>in the discussion below. For the reasons explained, the&para;<br>vehicle flight that the statute proscribes is a violent felony&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>as the federal statute uses that term.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Marcus Sykes pleaded guilty to being a felon&para;<br>in possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1), in con&para;<br>nection with an attempted robbery of two people at gun&para;<br>point. Sykes had previous convictions for at least three&para;<br>felonies. On two separate occasions Sykes used a firearm&para;<br>to commit robbery, in one case to rob a man of his $200&para;<br>wristwatch and in another to rob a woman of her purse.&para;<br>His third prior felony is the one of concern here. Sykes&para;<br>was convicted for vehicle flight, in violation of Indiana’s&para;<br>“resisting law enforcement” law. Ind. Code §35–44–3–3.&para;<br>That law provides:&para;<br>“(a) A person who knowingly or intentionally:&para;<br>“(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a&para;<br>law enforcement officer or a person assisting the offi&para;<br>cer while the officer is lawfully engaged in the execu&para;<br>tion of his duties as an officer;&para;<br>“(2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the&para;<br>authorized service or execution of a civil or criminal&para;<br>process or order of a court; or&para;<br>“(3) flees from a law enforcement officer after the of&para;<br>ficer has, by visible or audible means, identified him&para;<br>self and ordered the person to stop;&para;<br>“commits resisting law enforcement, a Class A mis&para;<br>demeanor, except as provided in subsection (b).&para;<br>“(b) The offense under subsection (a) is a:&para;<br>“(1) Class D felony if:&para;<br>“(A) the offense is described in subsection (a)(3) and&para;<br>the person uses a vehicle to commit the offense; or&para;<br>“(B) while committing any offense described in sub&para;<br>section (a), the person draws or uses a deadly weapon,&para;<br>inflicts bodily injury on another person, or operates a&para;<br>vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of&para;<br>bodily injury to another person;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(2) Class C felony if, while committing any offense&para;<br>described in subsection (a), the person operates a ve&para;<br>hicle in a manner that causes serious bodily injury to&para;<br>another person; and&para;<br>(3) Class B felony if, while committing any offense&para;<br>described in subsection (a), the person operates a ve&para;<br>hicle in a manner that causes the death of another&para;<br>person.”&para;<br>Here, as will be further explained, Sykes used a vehicle&para;<br>to flee after an officer ordered him to stop, which was, as&para;<br>the statute provides, a class D felony. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals of Indiana has interpreted the crime of vehicle flight&para;<br>to require “a knowing attempt to escape law enforcement.”&para;<br>Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d 897, 901 (2002) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Woodward involved a driver&para;<br>who repeatedly flashed his bright lights and failed to obey&para;<br>traffic signals. Id., at 898. When an officer activated his&para;<br>emergency equipment, the defendant became “aware . . .&para;<br>that [the officer] wanted him to pull his vehicle over,” but&para;<br>instead drove for a mile without “stopping, slowing, or&para;<br>otherwise acknowledging” the officer because, he later&para;<br>testified, he “was ‘trying to rationalize why [he] would be&para;<br>pulled over.’ ” Id., at 898, 901. Though the defendant later&para;<br>claimed that he was also seeking a “well-lighted place to&para;<br>stop where there would be someone who knew him,” id.,&para;<br>at 901, his actions suggested otherwise. He passed two&para;<br>gas stations, a food outlet store, and a McDonald’s before pulling over. When he got out of the car, he began to&para;<br>shout profanities at the pursuing officer. Ibid. By that&para;<br>time, the officer had called for backup and exited his own&para;<br>vehicle with his gun drawn. Id., at 898. In answering the&para;<br>defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the above evi&para;<br>dence, the Indiana court held that because he knew that a&para;<br>police officer sought to stop him, the defendant could not&para;<br>“choose the location of the stop” and insist on completing&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the stop “on his own terms,” as he had done, “without&para;<br>adequate justification,” which he lacked. Id., at 901–902.&para;<br>In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes’ federal&para;<br>sentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.&para;<br>After observing Sykes driving without using needed head&para;<br>lights, police activated their emergency equipment for a&para;<br>traffic stop. Sykes did not stop. A chase ensued. Sykes&para;<br>wove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road&para;<br>and through yards containing bystanders, passed through&para;<br>a fence, and struck the rear of a house. Then he fled on&para;<br>foot. He was found only with the aid of a police dog.&para;<br>The District Court decided that his three prior convic&para;<br>tions, including the one for violating the prohibition on&para;<br>vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute&para;<br>just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of §924(e)&para;<br>and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment. On&para;<br>appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con&para;<br>victions were violent felonies. He did not dispute that his&para;<br>vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it&para;<br>was not violent. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit affirmed. 598 F. 3d 334 (2010). The court’s opin&para;<br>ion was consistent with the rulings of the Courts of Ap&para;<br>peals in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits. Powell&para;<br>v. United States, 430 F. 3d 490 (CA1 2005) (per curiam);&para;<br>United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d 531, 534–537 (CA5&para;<br>2009); United States v.

It was in conflict&para;<br>with a ruling by a Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir&para;<br>cuit in United States v. Harrison, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1291–&para;<br>1296 (2009), and at least in tension, if not in conflict, with&para;<br>the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir&para;<br>cuit in United States v.

S. ___ (2010), allows this&para;<br>Court to address the conflict.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In determining whether an offense is a violent felony,&para;<br>this Court has explained,&para;<br>“we employ the categorical approach . . . . Under this&para;<br>approach, we look only to the fact of conviction and&para;<br>the statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not&para;<br>generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the&para;<br>record of conviction. That is, we consider whether the&para;<br>elements of the offense are of the type that would&para;<br>justify its inclusion within the residual provision,&para;<br>without inquiring into the specific conduct of this par&para;<br>ticular offender.” James, 550 U. S., at 202 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Tay&para;<br>lor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–602 (1990).&para;<br>So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances&para;<br>of the flight in Sykes’ own case were violent, the question&para;<br>is whether §35–44–3–3 of the Indiana Code, as a categori&para;<br>cal matter, is a violent felony.&para;<br>Under 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), an offense is deemed a&para;<br>violent felony if it is a crime punishable by more than one&para;<br>year of imprisonment that&para;<br>“(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or&para;<br>threatened use of physical force against the person of&para;<br>another; or&para;<br>“(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of&para;<br>explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre&para;<br>sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to&para;<br>another.”&para;<br>Resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not&para;<br>among the specific offenses named in clause (ii). Thus, it&para;<br>is violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within&para;<br>the so-called residual provision of clause (ii). To be a vio&para;<br>lent crime, it must be an offense that “otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of&para;<br>physical injury to another.”&para;<br>The question, then, is whether Indiana’s prohibition on&para;<br>flight from an officer by driving a vehicle—the violation of&para;<br>Indiana law for which Sykes sustained his earlier convic&para;<br>tion—falls within the residual clause because, as a cate&para;<br>gorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of&para;<br>physical injury to another. The offenses enumerated in&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes&para;<br>involving use of explosives—provide guidance in making&para;<br>this determination. For instance, a crime involves the&para;<br>requisite risk when “the risk posed by [the crime in ques&para;<br>tion] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog&para;<br>among the enumerated offenses.” James, 550 U. S., at 203&para;<br>(explaining that attempted burglary poses risks akin to&para;<br>that of completed burglary).&para;<br>When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command&para;<br>by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture&para;<br>makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and&para;<br>persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part&para;<br>of the offense. Even if the criminal attempting to elude&para;<br>capture drives without going at full speed or going the&para;<br>wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a&para;<br>legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his&para;<br>speed or use force to bring him within their custody. A&para;<br>perpetrator’s indifference to these collateral consequences&para;<br>has violent—even lethal—potential for others. A criminal&para;<br>who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes&para;<br>action similar in degree of danger to that involved in&para;<br>arson, which also entails intentional release of a destruc&para;<br>tive force dangerous to others. This similarity is a begin&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a&para;<br>serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&para;<br>Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of&para;<br>burglary. Burglary is dangerous because it can end in&para;<br>confrontation leading to violence. Id., at 200. The same is&para;<br>true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree. The&para;<br>attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an offi&para;<br>cer’s authority. It is a provocative and dangerous act that&para;<br>dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give&para;<br>chase. The felon’s conduct gives the officer reason to&para;<br>believe that the defendant has something more serious&para;<br>than a traffic violation to hide. In Sykes’ case, officers&para;<br>pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions&para;<br>and marijuana in his possession. In other cases officers&para;<br>may discover more about the violent potential of the flee&para;<br>ing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by&para;<br>recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2).&para;<br>Because an accepted way to restrain a driver who poses&para;<br>dangers to others is through seizure, officers pursuing&para;<br>fleeing drivers may deem themselves duty bound to esca&para;<br>late their response to ensure the felon is apprehended.&para;<br>Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 385 (2007), rejected the&para;<br>possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a&para;<br>vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetra&para;<br>tor “might have been just as likely to respond by continu&para;<br>ing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his&para;<br>brow.” And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is&para;<br>sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns&para;<br>drawn to effect arrest. Confrontation with police is the&para;<br>expected result of vehicle flight. It places property and&para;<br>persons at serious risk of injury.&para;<br>Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight. Between&para;<br>the confrontations that initiate and terminate the inci&para;<br>dent, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.&para;<br>It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>burglary. It is well known that when offenders use motor&para;<br>vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po&para;<br>tential risks of physical injury to others. Flight from a&para;<br>law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.&para;<br>As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumu&para;<br>lates. And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a&para;<br>crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to&para;<br>avoid capture.&para;<br>Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by&para;<br>definitional necessity occur when police are present, are&para;<br>flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected&para;<br>with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious&para;<br>potential risk of physical injury to another. See post, at 5–&para;<br>6 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also post, at&para;<br>6–7 (listing Indiana cases addressing ordinary intentional&para;<br>vehicle flight and noting the high-risk conduct that those&para;<br>convictions involved).&para;<br>Although statistics are not dispositive, here they con&para;<br>firm the commonsense conclusion that Indiana’s vehicular&para;<br>flight crime is a violent felony. See Chambers, 555 U. S.,&para;<br>at 129 (explaining that statistical evidence sometimes&para;<br>“helps provide a conclusive . . . answer” concerning the&para;<br>risks that crimes present). As JUSTICE THOMAS explains,&para;<br>chase-related crashes kill more than 100 nonsuspects&para;<br>every year. See post, at 4–5. Injury rates are much&para;<br>higher. Studies show that between 18% and 41% of chases&para;<br>involve crashes, which always carry a risk of injury, and&para;<br>that between 4% and 17% of all chases end in injury. See&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>A 2008 International Association of Chiefs of Police&para;<br>(IACP) study examined 7,737 police pursuits reported by&para;<br>56 agencies in 30 States during 2001–2007. C. Lum &amp; G.&para;<br>Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and&para;<br>Reform 54. Those pursuits, the study found, resulted in&para;<br>313 injuries to police and bystanders, a rate of slightly&para;<br>over 4 injuries to these nonsuspects per 100 pursuits.

Given that police may be least likely to pursue&para;<br>suspects where the dangers to bystanders are greatest—&para;<br>i.e., when flights occur at extraordinarily high speeds—&para;<br>it is possible that risks associated with vehicle flight are&para;<br>even higher.&para;<br>Those risks may outstrip the dangers of at least two&para;<br>offenses enumerated in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Ac&para;<br>cording to a study by the Department of Justice, approxi&para;<br>mately 3.7 million burglaries occurred on average each&para;<br>year in the United States between 2003 and 2007.

Those burglaries&para;<br>resulted in an annual average of approximately 118,000&para;<br>injuries, or 3.2 injuries for every 100 burglaries. Id., at 9–&para;<br>10. That risk level is 20% lower than that which the IACP&para;<br>found for vehicle pursuits.&para;<br>The U. S. Fire Administration (USFA) maintains the&para;<br>world’s largest data bank on fires. It secures participation&para;<br>from over one-third of U. S. fire departments. It reports&para;<br>an estimated 38,400 arsons in 2008. Those fires resulted&para;<br>in an estimated 1,255 injuries, or 3.3 injuries per 100&para;<br>arsons.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehi&para;<br>cle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the&para;<br>Armed Career Criminal Act’s (ACCA) residual clause&para;<br>demands. In his view this Court’s decisions in Begay and&para;<br>Chambers require ACCA predicates to be purposeful,&para;<br>violent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not.&para;<br>Sykes, in taking this position, overreads the opinions of&para;<br>this Court.&para;<br>ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes “typically&para;<br>committed by those whom one normally labels ‘armed&para;<br>career criminals,’ ” that is, crimes that “show an increased&para;<br>likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who&para;<br>might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.”&para;<br>Begay, 553 U. S., at 146. In general, levels of risk divide&para;<br>crimes that qualify from those that do not. See, e.g.,&para;<br>James, 550 U. S. 192 (finding attempted burglary risky&para;<br>enough to qualify). Chambers is no exception. 555 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6) (explaining that failure to&para;<br>report does not qualify because the typical offender is not&para;<br>“significantly more likely than others to attack, or physi&para;<br>cally to resist, an apprehender”).&para;<br>The sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of&para;<br>ACCA’s residual clause in which risk was not the dis&para;<br>positive factor is Begay, which held that driving under&para;<br>the influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate. There, the&para;<br>Court stated that DUI is not purposeful, violent, and&para;<br>aggressive. 553 U. S., at 145–148. But the Court also&para;<br>gave a more specific reason for its holding. “[T]he conduct&para;<br>for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the&para;<br>influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145&para;<br>(analogizing DUI to strict-liability, negligence, and reck&para;<br>lessness crimes). By contrast, the Indiana statute at issue&para;<br>here has a stringent mens rea requirement. Violators&para;<br>must act “knowingly or intentionally.” Ind. Code §35–44–&para;<br>3–3(a); see Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d, at 901 (construing the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>statute to require “a knowing attempt to escape law en&para;<br>forcement” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>The phrase “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” has no&para;<br>precise textual link to the residual clause, which requires&para;<br>that an ACCA predicate “otherwise involv[e] conduct that&para;<br>presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to&para;<br>another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The Begay phrase is an addi&para;<br>tion to the statutory text. In many cases the purposeful,&para;<br>violent, and aggressive inquiry will be redundant with the&para;<br>inquiry into risk, for crimes that fall within the former&para;<br>formulation and those that present serious potential risks&para;<br>of physical injury to others tend to be one and the same.&para;<br>As between the two inquiries, risk levels provide a cate&para;<br>gorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve&para;<br>the case before us.&para;<br>Begay involved a crime akin to strict liability, negli&para;<br>gence, and recklessness crimes; and the purposeful, vio&para;<br>lent, and aggressive formulation was used in that case to&para;<br>explain the result. The felony at issue here is not a strict&para;<br>liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and because it&para;<br>is, for the reasons stated and as a categorical matter,&para;<br>similar in risk to the listed crimes, it is a crime that “oth&para;<br>erwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential&para;<br>risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was&para;<br>not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in&para;<br>which the offender “operates a vehicle in a manner that&para;<br>creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another per&para;<br>son.” Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(B). In structuring its&para;<br>laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that&para;<br>it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)’s general prohibition&para;<br>on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehi&para;<br>cle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.&para;<br>Sykes’ argument is unconvincing. Indiana treats viola&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the&para;<br>same magnitude. They are both class D felonies, and both&para;<br>carry terms of between six months and three years, Ind.&para;<br>Code §35–50–2–7(a). The distinction between the provi&para;<br>sions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohib&para;<br>its, among other acts, much conduct in which a person&para;<br>“(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en&para;<br>forcement officer . . . ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or&para;<br>interferes with the authorized service or execution of . . .&para;<br>process . . . ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.”&para;<br>§35–44–3–3(a). Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the&para;<br>conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)—flight—which, it&para;<br>states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.&para;<br>Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses&para;<br>in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it&para;<br>while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily&para;<br>injury to another. Taken together, the statutory incen&para;<br>tives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under sub&para;<br>section (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B). They&para;<br>reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can&para;<br>be committed without a vehicle or without creating sub&para;<br>stantial risks. They reflect the further judgment that this&para;<br>is not so for vehicle flights.&para;<br>Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of&para;<br>vehicle flight. Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be&para;<br>proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magni&para;<br>tude to those available for other forms of resisting law&para;<br>enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.&para;<br>In other words, the “similarity in punishment for these&para;<br>related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(B)] violation.” Post, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment); see also ibid., n. 2. By adding subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(A) in 1998, the Indiana Legislature determined that&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(A) by itself sufficed as a basis for the&para;<br>punishments available under subsection (b)(1)(B).

As&para;<br>the above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand&para;<br>does not present the occasion to decide that question.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualita&para;<br>tive, rather than encyclopedic, terms. It could have de&para;<br>fined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered&para;<br>offenses. Under the principle that all are deemed to know&para;<br>the law, every armed felon would then be assumed to&para;<br>know which of his prior felonies could serve to increase&para;<br>his sentence. Given that ACCA “requires judges to make&para;<br>sometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by dif&para;<br>ferent offenses,” this approach could simplify adjudica&para;<br>tions for judges in some cases. James, 550 U. S., at 210,&para;<br>n. 6.&para;<br>Congress instead stated a normative principle. The re&para;<br>sidual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlawful possession of the firearm when the relevant prior&para;<br>offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar&para;<br>to that presented by burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes&para;<br>involving use of explosives. The provision instructs poten&para;<br>tial recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime&para;<br>if they again transgress. It states an intelligible principle&para;<br>and provides guidance that allows a person to “conform his&para;<br>or her conduct to the law.” Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.

Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A)&para;<br>(2004), is a “violent felony” under the Armed Career&para;<br>Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The&para;<br>majority also correctly refuses to apply the “ purposeful,&para;<br>violent, and aggressive ” test created in Begay v. United&para;<br>States, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008). However, the majority&para;<br>errs by implying that the “purposeful, violent, and aggres&para;<br>sive” test may still apply to offenses “akin to strict liabil&para;<br>ity, negligence, and recklessness crimes.” Ante, at 11.&para;<br>The error in imposing that test, which does not appear&para;<br>in ACCA, is well catalogued. See, e.g., Begay, 553 U. S., at&para;<br>150–152 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 158–&para;<br>159 (ALITO, J., dissenting); ante, at 11 (finding “no pre&para;<br>cise textual link” in the statute). I agree with JUSTICES&para;<br>SCALIA and KAGAN that the majority’s partial retreat from&para;<br>Begay only further muddies ACCA’s residual clause. Post,&para;<br>at 1 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); post, at 1, n. 1 (KAGAN, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>The only question here is whether, in the ordinary case,&para;<br>using a vehicle to knowingly flee from the police after&para;<br>being ordered to stop “involves conduct that presents a&para;<br>serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). I believe that it does. Therefore I concur&para;<br>in the judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a&para;<br>felony. Any person who “knowingly or intentionally . . .&para;<br>flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has,&para;<br>by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered&para;<br>the person to stop” commits a misdemeanor. Ind. Code&para;<br>§35–44–3–3(a)(3). If the person “uses a vehicle” to flee,&para;<br>however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(A). That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a&para;<br>“violent felony” under ACCA if it is “burglary, arson, or&para;<br>extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves&para;<br>conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical&para;<br>injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).&para;<br>As explained below, Indiana’s crime of intentional ve&para;<br>hicular flight “involves conduct that presents a serious&para;<br>potential risk of physical injury to another.” Ibid. The&para;<br>elements of §3(b)(1)(A), compared to those of the enumer&para;<br>ated ACCA offense of burglary, suggest that an ordinary&para;<br>violation of §3(b)(1)(A) is far riskier than an ordinary&para;<br>burglary. Statistics, common experience, and Indiana&para;<br>cases support this conclusion.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The specific crimes Congress listed as “violent felon&para;<br>[ies]” in ACCA—arson, extortion, burglary, and use of&para;<br>explosives—provide a “baseline against which to measure&para;<br>the degree of risk” that a nonenumerated offense must&para;<br>present in order to qualify as a violent felony. James v.&para;<br>United States, 550 U. S. 192, 208 (2007); see also ante, at&para;<br>6. Burglary, for instance, sets a low baseline level for risk.&para;<br>Its elements are “unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or&para;<br>remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to com&para;<br>mit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599&para;<br>(1990). As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary&para;<br>is in “the possibility that an innocent person might appear&para;<br>while the crime is in progress” and the danger inherent in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>such a “face-to-face confrontation.” James, 550 U. S., at&para;<br>203. The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an&para;<br>ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars gen&para;<br>erally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward&para;<br>avoiding detection. Nevertheless, that small chance suf&para;<br>ficed for Congress to list burglary as a “violent felony,” and&para;<br>for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also quali&para;<br>fies. See id., at 195.&para;<br>Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional ve&para;<br>hicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses&para;<br>greater potential risk. Although interruption and confron&para;<br>tation are quite rare for burglary, every §3(a)(3) flight is&para;<br>committed in the presence of a police officer. Every&para;<br>§3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in know&para;<br>ing defiance of an officer’s direct order to stop, “which is a&para;<br>clear challenge to the officer’s authority and typically&para;<br>initiates pursuit.” United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d&para;<br>531, 535 (CA5 2009); see also United States v. Spells, 537&para;<br>F. 3d 743, 752 (CA7 2008) (“Taking flight calls the officer&para;<br>to give chase, and aside from any accompanying risk to&para;<br>pedestrians and other motorists, such flight dares the&para;<br>officer to needlessly endanger himself in pursuit”). Fi&para;<br>nally, in every §3(b)(1)(A) flight, the perpetrator is armed&para;<br>with what can be a deadly weapon: a vehicle. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007) (noting that “the&para;<br>threat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect”&para;<br>was not “even remotely comparable to the extreme danger&para;<br>to human life” posed by that vehicular chase); United&para;<br>States v. Kendrick, 423 F. 3d 803, 809 (CA8 2005) (“[T]he&para;<br>dangerous circumstances surrounding a person’s attempt&para;<br>to flee from law enforcement are compounded by the&para;<br>person’s operation of a motor vehicle”); United States v.&para;<br>Aceves-Rosales, 832 F. 2d 1155, 1157 (CA9 1987) (per&para;<br>curiam) (“It is indisputable that an automobile . . . can be&para;<br>used as a deadly weapon”).&para;<br>In sum, every violation of §3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in&para;<br>front of a police officer. Based on its elements, the poten&para;<br>tial risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles “armed&para;<br>burglary in the presence of a security guard” more than&para;<br>simple burglary. Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with&para;<br>much more risk—a far greater likelihood of confrontation&para;<br>with police and a greater chance of violence in that&para;<br>confrontation—than burglary. It follows that the “the con&para;<br>duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi&para;<br>nary case,” poses a greater risk of harm than the enumer&para;<br>ated offense of burglary. James, supra, at 208.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Common experience and statistical evidence confirm the&para;<br>“potential risk” of intentional vehicular flight. Cf. Cham&para;<br>bers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, 129 (2009) (statistical&para;<br>evidence, though not always necessary, “strongly supports&para;<br>the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a&para;<br>serious potential risk of physical injury”). Data from the&para;<br>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows&para;<br>that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and&para;<br>occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase&para;<br>related crashes. National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis,&para;<br>Fatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving&para;<br>Police in Pursuit 37–56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such&para;<br>deaths between 2000 and 2009).&para;<br>The number injured must be much higher. Many thou&para;<br>sands of police chases occur every year.

First, he asserts that&para;<br>it is possible to violate Indiana’s intentional vehicular&para;<br>flight statute without doing anything dangerous. Second,&para;<br>he urges that the existence of Ind. Code §35–44–3–&para;<br>3(b)(1)(B), which includes “substantial risk” as an addi&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tional element, indicates that §3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.&para;<br>Neither argument is persuasive.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Sykes observes that it would violate the statute to flee&para;<br>at low speed, obeying traffic signs and stopping after only&para;<br>a short distance. See Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d&para;<br>897, 900–901 (Ind. App. 2002); post, at 4 (KAGAN, J., dis&para;<br>senting). Such a flight, he urges, would not present “a&para;<br>serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” so&para;<br>a conviction under the statute cannot categorically be a&para;<br>violent felony.&para;<br>The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to&para;<br>violate §3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional ve&para;<br>hicular flight is dangerous “in the ordinary case.” See&para;<br>James, 550 U. S., at 208. It is also possible to imagine&para;<br>committing burglary—an enumerated offense—under&para;<br>circumstances that pose virtually no risk of physical in&para;<br>jury. See id., at 207 (hypothesizing a “break-in of an&para;<br>unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and&para;<br>away from any potential intervenors”).&para;<br>Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he&para;<br>imagines is the ordinary violation of §3(b)(1)(A). Sykes&para;<br>offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his&para;<br>view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight. See&para;<br>Swain v. State, 923 N. E. 2d 32, 2010 WL 623720 (Ind.&para;<br>App., Feb. 23, 2010); Woodward, supra, at 898. Yet not&para;<br>even those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct. In&para;<br>Swain, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up&para;<br>her boyfriend’s accomplice as he ran on foot from two&para;<br>police officers. 2010 WL 623720, *1, *3. As the officers&para;<br>approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled,&para;<br>“ ‘Hurry up. Come on. They’re coming,’ ” and drove off as&para;<br>the runner jumped in. Id., at *1. She stopped 10 to 15&para;<br>seconds later, when police vehicles converging on the&para;<br>scene took up pursuit. Ibid. In Woodward, the defendant&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed&para;<br>several good places to pull over, and drove all the way&para;<br>home, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and&para;<br>obeyed traffic laws. 770 N. E. 2d, at 898. Eventually the&para;<br>defendant got out of his car and shouted profanities at the&para;<br>officer, who drew his pistol. Id., at 898, 901; see also id.,&para;<br>at 901, 902 (observing that the defendant had refused to&para;<br>stop “except on his own terms” and noting “the dangers&para;<br>that could await a police officer stopping where the citizen&para;<br>selects”). These two cases fall well short of showing&para;<br>that intentional flight in Indiana is ordinarily nonrisky.1&para;<br>See also post, at 6 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (noting that&para;<br>the “intuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures&para;<br>to stop . . . seems consistent with common sense and&para;<br>experience”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Sykes also notes that a different subparagraph, §3(b)&para;<br>(1)(B), covers intentional flight committed while “oper&para;<br>at[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person,” whereas&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(A) has no such element. From this, Sykes infers&para;<br>that §3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does&para;<br>not present a serious potential risk. The argument is that,&para;<br>even though the elements of §3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct&para;<br>that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the&para;<br>presence of §3(b)(1)(B) casts §3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous&para;<br>light. Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). But the fact that&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(B) includes “substantial risk of bodily injury”&para;<br>as an element does not restrict §3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.&para;<br>His&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car&para;<br>at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road,&para;<br>weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among&para;<br>bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house. Ante, at 4; 2&para;<br>App. 11 (Sealed).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>conduct.&para;<br>First, apart from the existence of §3(b)(1)(B), the ab&para;<br>sence of risk as an element of §3(b)(1)(A) does not mean&para;<br>that the offense is not a violent felony. ACCA does not&para;<br>require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of&para;<br>injury as an element of the offense. Enumerated violent&para;<br>felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.&para;<br>Second, §3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version&para;<br>of §3(b)(1)(A). Both are class D felonies, and at the time of&para;<br>Sykes’ conviction, there was no statutory difference in&para;<br>punishment between them. Even now, the offenses re&para;<br>main of a single class, meriting similar punishments.&para;<br>The similarity in punishment for these related, overlap&para;<br>ping offenses suggests that §3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equiva&para;<br>lent of one type of §3(b)(1)(B) violation. Section 3(b)(1)(B)&para;<br>enhances punishments for three separate types of in&para;<br>tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, §3(a)(1);&para;<br>interfering with service of process, §3(a)(2); and fleeing&para;<br>from a police officer, §3(a)(3). Under §3(b)(1)(B), commit&para;<br>ting any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly&para;<br>weapon, inflicting injury, or “operat[ing] a vehicle in a&para;<br>manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to&para;<br>another person” has long been a class D felony.&para;<br>In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added §3(b)(1)(A) to&para;<br>provide that any use of a vehicle to flee from an officer&para;<br>under §3(a)(3) is always a class D felony.&para;<br>Section&para;<br>3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment&para;<br>for one particular violation of §3(b)(1)(B).2 It is still the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Indiana&para;<br>&para;<br>law at the time of Sykes’ conviction presented two related&para;<br>provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment. One&para;<br>was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a&para;<br>narrower provision that did not. While JUSTICE KAGAN would infer that&para;<br>the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky,&para;<br>post, at 6–8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.&para;<br>Consider reckless endangerment statutes. In Hawaii, for instance, it&para;<br>is “reckless endangering in the second degree” either to “recklessly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>case that under §3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an&para;<br>officer or interfere with service of process is a class D&para;<br>felony only if the vehicle is “operate[d] . . . in a manner&para;<br>that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another&para;<br>person.” §3(b)(1)(B). But using a vehicle to intentionally&para;<br>flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove&para;<br>risk. §3(b)(1)(A).&para;<br>This rough equivalence between §3(b)(1)(A) and §3(b)&para;<br>(1)(B) is borne out in Indiana case law. The conduct&para;<br>underlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see supra,&para;<br>at 6–7, demonstrates that despite §3(b)(1)(B), convictions&para;<br>under §3(b)(1)(A) include risky flights.&para;<br>Third, the remainder of Indiana’s resisting law enforce&para;<br>——————&para;<br>plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,”&para;<br>Haw. Rev. Stat. §707–714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to “[i]ntentionally&para;<br>discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,” §707–714(1)(b). I would&para;<br>infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se&para;<br>that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given&para;<br>case. Other States have similar statutes. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.&para;<br>11, §§603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§6–2–504(a), (b) (2009); Me.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §§301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).&para;<br>Similarly here, I infer that §3(b)(1)(A)’s upgrade of intentional flight&para;<br>to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the&para;<br>offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, “operat[ing] a vehicle&para;<br>in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another&para;<br>person” under §3(b)(1)(B).&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana&para;<br>Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(B) when it added §3(b)(1)(A). Post, at 12. There are at least&para;<br>two problems with this reasoning. First, even though §3(b)(1)(A) may&para;<br>be redundant with §3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in&para;<br>subsection (a)(3), the reference to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B) is&para;<br>still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).&para;<br>Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference&para;<br>to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B). Second, although JUSTICE&para;<br>KAGAN can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require&para;<br>perfection in statutory drafting. See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC,&para;<br>562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). I think it clear enough what&para;<br>the statute means.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ment statute confirms that its other provisions do not&para;<br>reserve §3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct. An intentional&para;<br>vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is&para;<br>operated “in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.”&para;<br>Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(2). The same act becomes a class&para;<br>B felony if someone is killed. §35–44–3–3(b)(3).3 JUSTICE&para;<br>KAGAN asserts that each of these “separate, escalating&para;<br>crimes” captures an increasing degree of risk and neces&para;<br>sarily means that §3(b)(1)(A), the offense simpliciter, is&para;<br>less risky than it otherwise seems. Post, at 7.&para;<br>The flaw in this reasoning is that §§3(b)(2) and (3) en&para;<br>hance punishment based solely on the results of the flight,&para;<br>not the degree of risk it posed. Neither provision requires&para;<br>any action by a suspect beyond that which satisfies the&para;<br>elements of §3(b)(1)(A).4 Rather, each provision addresses&para;<br>what happens when the risk inherent in a violation of&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(A) is actualized and someone is hurt or killed.&para;<br>The risk of physical injury inherent in intentional vehicu&para;<br>lar flight simpliciter was apparently clear enough to spur&para;<br>the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the&para;<br>inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.&para;<br>By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insur&para;<br>ance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legisla&para;<br>tures do not specify what additional punishment is war&para;<br>ranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or&para;<br>police. See, e.g., Ind. Code §35–43–5–7.2; §35–43–9–7. In&para;<br>sum, §§3(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that §3(b)(1)(A)&para;<br>is less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support&para;<br>the idea that it is inherently risky.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Indiana recently added that if a police officer dies, it becomes a class&para;<br>A felony. 2010 Ind. Acts p. 1197.&para;<br>4 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight&para;<br>that did not satisfy §3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on JUSTICE&para;<br>KAGAN’s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly&para;<br>progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.&para;<br>See post, at 7.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

More specifically, it is an at&para;<br>tempt to clarify, for the fourth time since 2007, what&para;<br>distinguishes “violent felonies” under the residual clause&para;<br>of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii), from other crimes. See James v. United&para;<br>States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007); Begay v. United States, 553&para;<br>U. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122&para;<br>(2009). We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in&para;<br>about every second or third volume of the United States&para;<br>Reports.&para;<br>As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar&para;<br>ification of the Delphic residual clause, today’s opinion&para;<br>produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further&para;<br>confusion. Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same&para;<br>thing over and over again, but expecting different results.&para;<br>Four times is enough. We should admit that ACCA’s&para;<br>residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void&para;<br>for vagueness. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357&para;<br>(1983).&para;<br>I&para;<br>ACCA defines “violent felony,” in relevant part, as “any&para;<br>crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding&para;<br>one year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v.

S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Many years of&para;<br>prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this defini&para;<br>tion. A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has&para;<br>three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year man&para;<br>datory minimum sentence and the possibility of life im&para;<br>prisonment. See §924(e)(1); see United States v. Harrison,&para;<br>558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009). Without those&para;<br>prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence,&para;<br>which could not possibly exceed 10 years. See §924(a)(2).&para;<br>Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within&para;<br>ACCA’s residual clause; that is, if it “involves conduct&para;<br>that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to&para;<br>another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Today’s opinion says, or ini&para;<br>tially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent&para;<br>felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree&para;<br>of risk “ ‘comparable to that posed by its closest analog&para;<br>among the enumerated offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is a&para;<br>quotation from the Court’s opinion in the first of our&para;<br>residual-clause trilogy, James, 550 U. S., at 203. I did not&para;<br>join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the&para;<br>elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least&para;<br>risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was&para;<br>the closest analog. See id., at 230 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>The problem with applying the James standard to the pres&para;<br>ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under&para;<br>Indiana law are not analogous to any of the four enumer&para;<br>ated offenses. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3 (2004). Nor is it&para;<br>apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely&para;<br>resembles, for example, statutory rape, see United States&para;<br>v. Daye, 571 F. 3d 225, 228–236 (CA2 2009); possession of&para;<br>a sawed-off shotgun, see United States v. Upton, 512 F. 3d&para;<br>394, 403–405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison,&para;<br>see Chambers, supra. I predicted this inadequacy of the&para;<br>“closest analog” test in my James dissent. See 550 U. S.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at 215.&para;<br>But as it turns out, the Court’s inability to identify an&para;<br>analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present&para;<br>case. For today’s opinion introduces the James standard&para;<br>with the words “[f]or instance,” ante, at 6. It is (according&para;<br>to the Court) merely one example of how the enumerated&para;<br>crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explo&para;<br>sives) “provide guidance.” Ibid. And the opinion then&para;<br>proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least&para;<br>risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in&para;<br>James—finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both&para;<br>arson and burglary. See ante, at 6–9.&para;<br>But what about the test that determined the outcome in&para;<br>our second case in this “series”—the “purposeful, violent,&para;<br>and aggressive” test of Begay? Fear not. That incompati&para;<br>ble variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in&para;<br>today’s tutti-frutti opinion. “In many cases,” we are told,&para;<br>it “will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.” Ante, at&para;<br>11. That seems to be the case here—though why, and&para;<br>when it will not be the case, are not entirely clear. The&para;<br>Court’s accusation that Sykes “overreads the opinions of&para;<br>this Court,” ante, at 10, apparently applies to his interpre&para;<br>tation of Begay’s “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” test,&para;<br>which the Court now suggests applies only “to strict liabil&para;<br>ity, negligence, and recklessness crimes,” ante, at 11. But&para;<br>that makes no sense. If the test excluded only those unin&para;<br>tentional crimes, it would be recast as the “purposeful”&para;<br>test, since the last two adjectives (“violent, and aggres&para;<br>sive”) would do no work. For that reason, perhaps, all 11&para;<br>Circuits that have addressed Begay “overrea[d]” it just as&para;<br>Sykes does*—and as does the Government, see Brief for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* See United States v.

To ask the question is to answer&para;<br>it. A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.&para;<br>II&para;<br>When I dissented from the Court’s judgment in James, I&para;<br>said that the residual clause’s “shoddy draftsmanship” put&para;<br>courts to a difficult choice:&para;<br>“They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtu&para;<br>ally all predicate offenses, . . . ; (2) apply it case by&para;<br>case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable&para;<br>whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the par&para;<br>ticular reviewing panel) believes there is a ‘serious po&para;<br>tential risk of physical injury to another’ (whatever&para;<br>that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of in&para;<br>terpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively&para;<br>predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller&para;<br>subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the&para;<br>drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness&para;<br>. . . .” 550 U.

United&para;<br>States, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008).1 Because we use the&para;<br>“categorical approach,” we do not concern ourselves with&para;<br>Sykes’s own conduct. See Taylor v. United States, 495&para;<br>U. S. 575, 602 (1990). Nor do we proceed by exploring&para;<br>whether some platonic form of an offense—here, some&para;<br>abstract notion of vehicular flight—satisfies ACCA’s re&para;<br>sidual clause. We instead focus on the elements of the&para;<br>actual state statute at issue. Cf. Chambers v. United&para;<br>States, 555 U. S. 122, 126–127 (2009) (breaking down an&para;<br>Illinois statute into discrete offenses to decide whether the&para;<br>crime of conviction fit within the residual clause); James v.&para;<br>United States, 550 U. S. 192, 202 (2007) (examining how&para;<br>Florida’s law defined attempted burglary to determine if&para;<br>the residual clause included that offense). More particu&para;<br>larly, we ask whether “the conduct encompassed by the&para;<br>elements” of that statute, “in the ordinary case” (not in&para;<br>every conceivable case), involves the requisite danger and&para;<br>violence. Id., at 208. By making this inquiry, we attempt&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 I understand the majority to retain the “purposeful, violent, and&para;<br>aggressive” test, but to conclude that it is “redundant” in this case. See&para;<br>ante, at 11. Like JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 3 (dissenting opinion), I&para;<br>find this conclusion puzzling. I do not think the majority could mean to&para;<br>limit the test to “strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.”&para;<br>Ante, at 11 (majority opinion). As JUSTICE SCALIA notes, see ante, at 3,&para;<br>that would be to eliminate the test’s focus on “violence” and “aggres&para;<br>sion.” And it would collide with Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S.&para;<br>122 (2009)—a decision the majority cites approvingly, see ante, at 8—&para;<br>which applied the test to an intentional crime. See 555 U. S., at 128&para;<br>(opinion of the Court), 130 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (hold&para;<br>ing that “knowin[g] fail[ure] to report to a penal institution” does not&para;<br>involve “purposeful, violent, or aggressive conduct” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)). So I assume this test will make a resurgence—that it&para;<br>will be declared non-redundant—the next time the Court considers a&para;<br>crime, whether intentional or not, that involves risk of injury but not&para;<br>aggression or violence.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to determine whether the crime involved is “characteristic&para;<br>of the armed career criminal”—or otherwise said, whether&para;<br>the prohibited conduct is of a kind that “makes more likely&para;<br>that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun&para;<br>deliberately to harm a victim.” Begay, 553 U. S., at 145 (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Under this approach, some vehicular flight offenses&para;<br>should count as violent felonies under ACCA. Consider,&para;<br>for example, a statute that makes it a crime to “willfully&para;<br>flee from a law enforcement officer by driving at high&para;<br>speed or otherwise demonstrating reckless disregard for&para;<br>the safety of others.” Such a statute, by its terms, encom&para;<br>passes conduct that ordinarily “presents a serious poten&para;<br>tial risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).&para;<br>And the covered conduct qualifies as “purposeful, violent,&para;<br>and aggressive.” Id., at 145. When a motorist responds to&para;<br>an officer’s signal to stop by increasing his speed or taking&para;<br>reckless evasive action, he turns his car into a weapon and&para;<br>provokes confrontation. In so doing, he engages in behav&para;<br>ior “roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk&para;<br>posed,” to that involved in ACCA’s enumerated offenses—&para;<br>the sort of conduct, in other words, “typically committed&para;<br>by . . . ‘armed career criminals.’ ” Id., at 143, 146. Like the&para;<br>majority, see ante, at 9–10, I therefore would classify&para;<br>crimes of this type—call them aggravated vehicular flight&para;<br>offenses—as violent felonies under ACCA.&para;<br>But a vehicular flight offense need not target aggressive&para;<br>and dangerous behavior. Imagine the converse of the&para;<br>statute described above—a statute making it a crime to&para;<br>“willfully flee from a law enforcement officer without&para;<br>driving at high speed or otherwise demonstrating reckless&para;<br>disregard for the safety of others.” That hypothetical&para;<br>statute addresses only simple vehicular flight: mere dis&para;<br>regard of a police officer’s directive to stop, devoid of addi&para;<br>tional conduct creating risk to others. This behavior—&para;<br>often called “failure to stop”—is illegal in most States&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(under a wide variety of statutory provisions). In Indiana,&para;<br>for example, a driver who “know[s] that a police officer&para;<br>wishes to effectuate a traffic stop” may commit a felony if&para;<br>he attempts to “choose the location of the stop,” rather&para;<br>than pulling over immediately; it makes no difference that&para;<br>the driver “did not speed or disobey any . . . traffic laws.”&para;<br>Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d 897, 902 (Ind. App.&para;<br>2002).2 But a mere failure to stop does not usually “pre&para;<br>sen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to an&para;<br>other,” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), any more than normal driving&para;<br>does.

Under ACCA, all&para;<br>that matters is the elements of the offense, and the Indiana Court of&para;<br>Appeals held in Woodward that a person who “merely fail[s] to stop” for&para;<br>police, and does nothing more, commits a felony under state law. 770&para;<br>N.

That provision, subsection (b)(1)(A), states that a&para;<br>person commits a felony if he “flees from a law enforce&para;<br>ment officer” while “us[ing] a vehicle.” Ind. Code §§35–44–&para;<br>3–3(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2009). As the Indiana courts have&para;<br>recognized, the subsection thus criminalizes mere failure&para;<br>to stop, which should not count as a violent felony under&para;<br>ACCA. See Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d 897; supra, at 4, and&para;<br>n. 2. But the provision also includes more violent forms of&para;<br>vehicular flight: It covers a person who speeds or drives&para;<br>recklessly, who leads the police on a “Hollywood-style car&para;<br>chase,” Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007), and who&para;<br>endangers police officers, other drivers, and pedestrians.&para;<br>And so the “conduct encompassed by the elements” of&para;<br>this subsection, James, 550 U. S., at 208, runs the gamut—&para;<br>from simple to aggravated vehicular flight, from the least&para;<br>violent to the most violent form of the activity. Accord,&para;<br>ante, at 9–10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (stat&para;<br>ing that subsection (b)(1)(A) is “not restrict[ed] . . . to&para;<br>nonrisky conduct”). The question presented is whether&para;<br>such a facially broad provision meets the requirements of&para;<br>ACCA’s residual clause.&para;<br>If subsection (b)(1)(A) were the whole of Indiana’s law&para;<br>on vehicular flight, the majority would have a reasonable&para;<br>argument that the provision does so. As noted, a statute&para;<br>fits within the residual clause if it covers conduct that in&para;<br>the ordinary case—not in every conceivable case—poses&para;<br>serious risk of physical injury and is purposeful, violent,&para;<br>and aggressive. See James, 550 U. S., at 208; Begay, 553&para;<br>U. S., at 145. We therefore must decide what the ordinary&para;<br>case of vehicular flight actually is. Is it the person trying&para;<br>to escape from police by speeding or driving recklessly, in&para;<br>a way that endangers others? Or is it instead the person&para;<br>driving normally who, for whatever reason, fails to re&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v.

And even assuming the study is comprehensive,&para;<br>it is entirely consistent with the possibility that the “ordinary case”—&para;<br>i.e., the most common form—of vehicular flight is mere failure to stop,&para;<br>which produces a much lower rate of injury.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Code&para;<br>§35–44–3–3. Indiana classified as a felon any person who:&para;<br>•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “us[ing]&para;<br>a vehicle,” §3(b)(1)(A);&para;<br>•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op&para;<br>erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a sub&para;<br>stantial risk of bodily injury to another person,”&para;<br>§3(b)(1)(B);6&para;<br>•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op&para;<br>erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes serious&para;<br>bodily injury to another person,” §3(b)(2); or&para;<br>•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op&para;<br>erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes the&para;<br>death of another person,” §3(b)(3) (all emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>Vehicular flight in Indiana is therefore not a single of&para;<br>fense, but instead a series of separate, escalating crimes.&para;<br>Each category captures conduct more dangerous than the&para;<br>one before it, as shown by the language italicized above.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 After Sykes’s conviction, Indiana added yet a fifth degree. See 2010&para;<br>Ind. Acts p. 1197. The four degrees described above remain unchanged.&para;<br>6 This provision also bars a range of other conduct. See n. 9, infra.&para;<br>7 JUSTICE THOMAS attempts to bisect this series by stating that the&para;<br>two most serious degrees of aggravated vehicular flight “enhance&para;<br>punishment based solely on the results of the flight, not the degree of&para;<br>risk it posed.” Ante, at 11–12. But conduct that leads to serious injury&para;<br>or death is ordinarily more risky, viewed ex ante, than conduct that&para;<br>does not produce these results. And in any event, the fundamental&para;<br>point here is that the Indiana statute grades vehicular flight according&para;<br>to the seriousness of the behavior—ranging from flight that need not&para;<br>pose any risk of harm, through flight posing a substantial risk of harm,&para;<br>to flight involving a certainty of harm.

In&para;<br>Chambers, 555 U.

The&para;<br>courts below had treated the statute as defining a single&para;<br>crime of felonious escape and held that crime to qualify as&para;<br>a violent felony under ACCA. See id., at 125; United&para;<br>States v. Chambers, 473 F. 3d 724, 725–726 (CA7 2007).&para;<br>We disagreed, stating that failure to report was a distinct&para;<br>offense, which did not meet ACCA’s requirements. That&para;<br>was so, we stated, because “[t]he behavior that likely&para;<br>underlies a failure to report would seem less likely to&para;<br>involve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more&para;<br>aggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.”&para;<br>Chambers, 555 U. S., at 127. In addition, we noted, the&para;<br>statute “list[ed] escape and failure to report separately&para;<br>(in its title and its body).” Ibid. We thus considered&para;<br>the failure-to-report clause in its statutory context—as&para;<br>one part of a legislature’s delineation of related criminal&para;<br>offenses—to determine whether the behavior it encom&para;<br>passed ordinarily poses a serious risk of injury.&para;<br>That same focus on statutory structure resolves this&para;<br>case, because it reveals subsection (b)(1)(A) to aim at a&para;<br>single form—the least serious form—of vehicular flight.&para;<br>Remember: Indiana has made a purposeful choice to di&para;<br>vide the full spectrum of vehicular flight into different&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>thus underscore that Indiana has divided the world of vehicular flight&para;<br>&para;<br>into discrete, ascending crimes, rather than treating all vehicular flight &para;<br>&para;<br>as of a piece. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Once again, starting with the most serious con&para;<br>duct: flight resulting in death; flight resulting in physical&para;<br>injury; flight creating a substantial risk of physical injury; flight. That last category—flight—almost screams to&para;<br>have the word “mere” placed before it. Under the In&para;<br>diana statute, flight—the conduct prohibited by subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(A)—is what is left over when no aggravating factor&para;<br>causing substantial risk or harm exists. Put on blinders,&para;<br>and the subsection is naturally understood to address all&para;<br>flight, up to and including the most dangerous kinds. But&para;<br>take off those blinders—view the statute as a whole—and&para;<br>the subsection is instead seen to target failures to stop.&para;<br>In this vein, the distinction between subsections&para;<br>(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) is especially telling. As noted,&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits vehicular flight that “creates&para;<br>a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.”&para;<br>That language almost precisely tracks the phrasing of&para;<br>ACCA’s residual clause, which refers to conduct that&para;<br>“presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to&para;<br>another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This correspon&para;<br>dence indicates that the conduct criminalized under sub&para;<br>section (b)(1)(B) qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA.&para;<br>But subsection (b)(1)(A) lacks the very feature that makes&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(B) and ACCA such a perfect match: It&para;<br>does not require any behavior that poses serious risk to&para;<br>others. This difference in statutory elements indicates&para;<br>that subsection (b)(1)(B)—but not subsection (b)(1)(A)—is&para;<br>directed toward the conduct described in ACCA’s residual&para;<br>clause. To count both as ACCA offenses is to pay insuffi&para;<br>cient heed to the way the Indiana Legislature drafted its&para;<br>statute—as a series of escalating offenses, ranging from&para;<br>the simple to the most aggravated.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 None of this is to deny that prosecutors may sometimes charge vio&para;<br>lent and dangerous offenders under subsection (b)(1)(A).

The Court rejects the structural argument&para;<br>here for one, and only one, reason. Indiana, the majority says, “treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and&para;<br>(b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude”: They are both&para;<br>class D felonies carrying the same punishment.9 See also&para;<br>——————&para;<br>may elect to use a lower grade of vehicular flight when he could use a&para;<br>higher one, either as a matter of discretion or because the defendant&para;<br>entered into a plea bargain. This case provides one example, see ante,&para;<br>at 4 (majority opinion), and JUSTICE THOMAS offers several others, see&para;<br>ante, at 6–7. But as everyone agrees, what matters in determining&para;<br>whether an offense qualifies under ACCA’s residual clause is the&para;<br>“ordinary case” of conviction. And in the absence of reliable empirical&para;<br>evidence, the structure of the Indiana statute provides the best way to&para;<br>discern the ordinary case under each subsection.&para;<br>9 The Government spurns the structural argument on a different&para;<br>ground, contending that subsection (b)(1)(A) is not a lesser included&para;<br>offense of subsection (b)(1)(B). The Court wisely does not accept this&para;<br>claim. Both subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) involve the use of a&para;<br>vehicle to flee, with subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally requiring that this&para;<br>use “creat[e] a substantial risk of bodily injury.” So a fleeing driver&para;<br>who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) necessarily runs afoul of subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(A) as well. The Government contends, in response, that a person&para;<br>can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) and not (b)(1)(A) by engaging in conduct&para;<br>other than vehicular flight. See Brief for United States 48–49, n. 11.&para;<br>That is because subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally prohibits “obstruct&para;<br>[ing]” or “resist[ing]” a police officer by a variety of means, including&para;<br>through use of a vehicle. But Indiana law makes clear that subsec&para;<br>tion (b)(1)(A) still counts as a lesser included offense of subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(B) in any prosecution involving vehicular flight. See Wright v.&para;<br>State, 658 N. E. 2d 563, 566–567 (Ind. 1995) (holding a crime to be a&para;<br>lesser included offense if its elements are “factually” subsumed within&para;<br>another offense). And even if that were not the case, it should make no&para;<br>difference. The meaningful question for purposes of ACCA is whether&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition of aggravated vehicular flight indi&para;<br>cates that subsection (b)(1)(A) targets simple vehicular flight. That a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ante, at 8–9 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). But&para;<br>the Court is wrong to think that fact dispositive.&para;<br>In general, “similar punishment does not necessarily&para;<br>imply similar risk” (or similar violence). James, 550 U. S.,&para;<br>at 217 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because this is so, the&para;<br>Court has never suggested that all state offenses falling&para;<br>within a single felony class and subject to the same penal&para;<br>ties must receive the same treatment under ACCA. To the&para;<br>contrary, we have always focused on the “conduct encom&para;<br>passed by the elements of the offense,” id., at 208 (major&para;<br>ity opinion)—an inquiry that does not mention the of&para;<br>fense’s sentencing consequences. And that is for good&para;<br>reason. It would be quite remarkable if either all or none&para;<br>of Indiana’s (or any State’s) class D felonies satisfied the&para;<br>requirements of the residual clause. In Indiana, other&para;<br>such felonies, subject to “the same magnitude” of punish&para;<br>ment, ante, at 12, include election fraud, computer tam&para;<br>pering, and “cemetery mischief.” See Ind. Code §3–14–2–1&para;<br>et seq. (2009); §35–43–1–4; §35–43–1–2.1. I presume the&para;<br>Court does not also intend to treat these offenses as vio&para;<br>lent felonies under ACCA.&para;<br>Moreover, Indiana sentencing law has always enabled&para;<br>judges to take account of the difference between subsec&para;<br>tions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) in imposing punishment. As&para;<br>the majority notes, ante, at 12, Indiana provides for a&para;<br>range of prison terms for class D felonies, stretching&para;<br>from six months to three years. And in deciding what&para;<br>term to impose (or whether to suspend the term), courts&para;<br>may consider an array of aggravating factors—including&para;<br>whether the crime “threatened serious harm to persons,” §35–38–1–7.1(b)(1). Convictions under subsections&para;<br>(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) therefore may produce widely vary&para;<br>ing sentences, as judges respond to the different forms&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>person can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) by means independent of any&para;<br>&para;<br>vehicular flight has no bearing on that question. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SYKES v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of vehicular flight targeted by the offenses.&para;<br>The Court argues, in support of its position, that the&para;<br>“similarity in punishment” reveals that the conduct falling&para;<br>within subsection (b)(1)(A) is “rough[ly] equivalent,” in&para;<br>terms of risk, to the conduct falling within subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted);&para;<br>see also ante, at 10–11 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg&para;<br>ment). More specifically, the Court claims that the Indi&para;<br>ana Legislature added subsection (b)(1)(A) to the statute&para;<br>in 1998 because it determined that vehicular flight is per&para;<br>se risky—and that all such flight therefore deserves the&para;<br>same punishment as is meted out to the various non-flight&para;<br>conduct that subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits upon a showing&para;<br>of risk. See ante, at 12; see also n. 9, supra. But that&para;<br>argument disregards the legislature’s decision to criminal&para;<br>ize vehicular flight in both provisions—that is, to retain&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition on risky vehicular flight&para;<br>alongside subsection (b)(1)(A)’s ban on simple flight. In&para;<br>effect, the Court reads subsection (b)(1)(A) as including all&para;<br>vehicular flight and subsection (b)(1)(B) as including only&para;<br>the other (non-flight) things it mentions—even though&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(B) specifically bars “flee[ing] from a law&para;<br>enforcement officer . . . in a manner that creates a sub&para;<br>stantial risk of bodily injury.”&para;<br>Perhaps the Court assumes that the Indiana Legisla&para;<br>ture, in enacting subsection (b)(1)(A), simply forgot to&para;<br>remove the reference to vehicular flight in subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(B). Cf. ante, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg&para;<br>ment) (acknowledging superfluity). But if so, the legis&para;<br>lature forgot four more times to correct its error, as it&para;<br>serially amended and re-amended its vehicular-flight statute over the last 13 years.10 And more fundamentally, a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 See 2011 Ind. Acts pp. 91–92; 2010 Ind. Acts pp. 1196–1197, 1186–&para;<br>1187; 2006 Ind. Acts p. 2470. Notably, one of these amendments&para;<br>revised subsection (b)(1)(B) itself.

See 1998 Ind. Acts&para;<br>677–678. So Indiana’s decision to create that offense in&para;<br>subsection (b)(1)(A)—and to distinguish it from the more&para;<br>aggravated forms of vehicular flight already penalized&para;<br>under subsections (b)(1)(B), (b)(2), and (b)(3)—brought&para;<br>the State’s vehicular-flight statute into conformity with&para;<br>the prevailing approach used nationwide. Especially given&para;<br>that backdrop, I would not impute shoddy draftsmanship&para;<br>to the Indiana Legislature. I would heed what that body&para;<br>said, rather than assume (just because it made both of&para;<br>fenses class D felonies) that it must have meant something&para;<br>different. And what the legislature said is that vehicular&para;<br>flight comes in different forms—one posing substantial&para;<br>risk of injury (subsection (b)(1)(B)) and one not (subsection&para;<br>(b)(1)(A)).&para;<br>The best that can be said for the Court’s approach is&para;<br>that it is very narrow—indeed, that it decides almost no&para;<br>case other than this one. As noted above, see supra, at 10,&para;<br>the Court reserves the question whether a vehicular flight&para;<br>provision like subsection (b)(1)(A) is a crime of violence&para;<br>under ACCA “where that offense carries a less severe&para;<br>penalty than [a greater] offense that includes it.” Ante, at&para;<br>13. But as fate would have it, that reservation describes&para;<br>the great majority of vehicular flight statutes across the&para;<br>country. Indiana is idiosyncratic in this respect; other&para;<br>States not only separately prohibit, but also differently&para;<br>punish, simple and aggravated vehicular flight.11 Or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 See, e.g., Fla.

That is&para;<br>because in 2006, a few years after Sykes’s conviction,&para;<br>Indiana amended its vehicular flight statute to set differ&para;<br>ent penalties for violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and&para;<br>(b)(1)(B). A person who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) today&para;<br>faces a mandatory 30-day sentence that cannot be sus&para;<br>pended; that sentence rises to six months or one year&para;<br>for repeat offenders.

So by its own terms, the Court’s&para;<br>opinion—our fourth applying ACCA’s residual clause in as&para;<br>many years—applies only to a single State’s vehicular&para;<br>flight statute as it existed from 1998 to 2006.
