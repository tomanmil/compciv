P.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–586.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 2, 2009—Decided March 30, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners, shareholders in mutual funds managed by respondent in&para;<br>vestment adviser, filed this suit alleging that respondent violated&para;<br>§36(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes a&para;<br>“fiduciary duty [on investment advisers] with respect to the receipt of&para;<br>compensation for services,” 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b). Granting respon&para;<br>dent summary judgment, the District Court concluded that petition&para;<br>ers had not raised a triable issue of fact under the applicable stan&para;<br>dard set forth in Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.,&para;<br>694 F. 2d 923, 928 (CA2): “[T]he test is essentially whether the fee&para;<br>schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have&para;<br>been negotiated at arm’s-length in light of all of the surrounding cir&para;<br>cumstances. . . . To be guilty of a violation of §36(b), . . . the adviser&para;<br>must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no rea&para;<br>sonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been&para;<br>the product of arm’s length bargaining.” Rejecting the Gartenberg&para;<br>standard, the Seventh Circuit panel affirmed based on different rea&para;<br>soning.&para;<br>Held: Based on §36(b)’s terms and the role that a shareholder action for&para;<br>breach of the investment adviser’s fiduciary duty plays in the Act’s&para;<br>overall structure, Gartenberg applied the correct standard. Pp. 7–17.&para;<br>(a) A consensus has developed regarding the standard Gartenberg&para;<br>set forth over 25 years ago: The standard has been adopted by other&para;<br>federal courts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s regu&para;<br>lations have recognized, and formalized, Gartenberg-like factors. Both&para;<br>petitioners and respondents generally endorse the Gartenberg ap&para;<br>proach but disagree in some respects about its meaning. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) Section 36(b)’s “fiduciary duty” phrase finds its meaning in Pep&para;<br>per v. Linton, 308 U. S. 295, 306–307, where the Court discussed the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>concept in the analogous bankruptcy context: “The essence of the test&para;<br>is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries&para;<br>the earmarks of an arm’s length bargain. If it does not, equity will&para;<br>set it aside.” Gartenberg’s approach fully incorporates this under&para;<br>standing, insisting that all relevant circumstances be taken into ac&para;<br>count and using the range of fees that might result from arm’s-length&para;<br>bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees. Pp. 9–&para;<br>11.&para;<br>(c) Gartenberg’s approach also reflects §36(b)’s place in the statu&para;<br>tory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protec&para;<br>tions the Act affords investors. Under the Act, scrutiny of investment&para;<br>adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board, see&para;<br>Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 482, and shareholder suits under&para;<br>§36(b) are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for con&para;<br>trolling adviser conflicts of interest, see Daily Income Fund, Inc. v.&para;<br>Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 541. In recognition of the disinterested directors’&para;<br>role, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser’s&para;<br>compensation “such consideration . . . as is deemed appropriate under&para;<br>all the circumstances.” §80a–35(b)(1). It may be inferred from this&para;<br>formulation that (1) a measure of deference to a board’s judgment&para;<br>may be appropriate in some instances, and (2) the appropriate meas&para;<br>ure of deference varies depending on the circumstances. Gartenberg&para;<br>heeds these precepts. See 694 F. 2d, at 930. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(d) The Court resolves the parties’ disagreements on several impor&para;<br>tant questions. First, since the Act requires consideration of all rele&para;<br>vant factors, §80a–35(b)(2), courts must give comparisons between&para;<br>the fees an investment adviser charges a captive mutual fund and&para;<br>the fees it charges its independent clients the weight they merit in&para;<br>light of the similarities and differences between the services the cli&para;<br>ents in question require. In doing so, the Court must be wary of in&para;<br>apt comparisons based on significant differences between those ser&para;<br>vices and must be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure&para;<br>fee parity between the two types of clients. However, courts should&para;<br>not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged mutual funds&para;<br>by other advisers, which may not result from arm’s-length negotia&para;<br>tions. Finally, a court’s evaluation of an investment adviser’s fiduci&para;<br>ary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.&para;<br>Where disinterested directors consider all of the relevant factors,&para;<br>their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to&para;<br>considerable weight, even if the court might weigh the factors differ&para;<br>ently. Cf. Lasker, 441 U. S., at 486. In contrast, where the board’s&para;<br>process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information,&para;<br>the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome. Id., at 484.&para;<br>Gartenberg’s “so disproportionately large” standard, 694 F. 2d, at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>928, reflects Congress’ choice to “rely largely upon [independent]&para;<br>‘watchdogs’ to protect shareholders interests,” Lasker, supra, at 482.&para;<br>Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(e) The Seventh Circuit erred in focusing on disclosure by invest&para;<br>ment advisers rather than the Gartenberg standard, which the panel&para;<br>rejected. That standard may lack sharp analytical clarity, but it ac&para;<br>curately reflects the compromise embodied in §36(b) as to the appro&para;<br>priate method of testing investment adviser compensation, and it has&para;<br>provided a workable standard for nearly three decades.

S. C. §80a–35(b) (hereinafter §36(b)).&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Act), 54 Stat.&para;<br>789, 15 U. S. C. §80a–1 et seq., regulates investment com&para;<br>panies, including mutual funds. “A mutual fund is a pool&para;<br>of assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio [of] securi&para;<br>ties, and belonging to the individual investors holding&para;<br>shares in the fund.” Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 480&para;<br>(1979). The following arrangements are typical. A sepa&para;<br>rate entity called an investment adviser creates the mu&para;<br>tual fund, which may have no employees of its own. See&para;<br>Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 93&para;<br>(1991); Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 536&para;<br>(1984); Burks, 441 U. S., at 480–481. The adviser selects&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the fund’s directors, manages the fund’s investments, and&para;<br>provides other services. See id., at 481. Because of the&para;<br>relationship between a mutual fund and its investment&para;<br>adviser, the fund often “ ‘cannot, as a practical matter&para;<br>sever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the&para;<br>forces of arm’s-length bargaining do not work in the mu&para;<br>tual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other&para;<br>sectors of the American economy.’ ” Ibid. (quoting S. Rep.&para;<br>No. 91–184, p. 5 (1969) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).&para;<br>“Congress adopted the [Investment Company Act of&para;<br>1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse&para;<br>inherent in the structure of investment companies.” Daily&para;<br>Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 536 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a&para;<br>fund and its investment adviser was “fraught with poten&para;<br>tial conflicts of interest,” the Act created protections for&para;<br>mutual fund shareholders. Id., at 536–538 (internal quo&para;<br>tation marks omitted); Burks, supra, at 482–483. Among&para;<br>other things, the Act required that no more than 60 per&para;<br>cent of a fund’s directors could be affiliated with the ad&para;<br>viser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by&para;<br>the directors and the shareholders of the fund. See §§10,&para;<br>15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.&para;<br>The growth of mutual funds in the 1950’s and 1960’s&para;<br>prompted studies of the 1940 Act’s effectiveness in protect&para;<br>ing investors. See Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 537–&para;<br>538. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities&para;<br>and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identi&para;<br>fied problems relating to the independence of investment&para;<br>company boards and the compensation received by in&para;<br>vestment advisers. See ibid. In response to such con&para;<br>cerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered&para;<br>shareholder protection in two primary ways.&para;<br>First, the amendments strengthened the “cornerstone”&para;<br>of the Act’s efforts to check conflicts of interest, the inde&para;<br>pendence of mutual fund boards of directors, which nego&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tiate and scrutinize adviser compensation. Burks, supra,&para;<br>at 482. The amendments required that no more than 60&para;<br>percent of a fund’s directors be “persons who are inter&para;<br>ested persons,” e.g., that they have no interest in or affilia&para;<br>tion with the investment adviser.1 15 U. S. C. §80a–&para;<br>10(a); §80a–2(a)(19); see also Daily Income Fund, supra, at&para;<br>538. These board members are given “a host of special&para;<br>responsibilities.” Burks, 441 U. S., at 482–483. In par&para;<br>ticular, they must “review and approve the contracts of the&para;<br>investment adviser” annually, id., at 483, and a majority&para;<br>of these directors must approve an adviser’s compensation,&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §80a–15(c). Second, §36(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of&para;<br>the Act imposed upon investment advisers a “fiduciary&para;<br>duty” with respect to compensation received from a mu&para;<br>tual fund, 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b), and granted individual&para;<br>investors a private right of action for breach of that duty,&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>The “fiduciary duty” standard contained in §36(b) repre&para;<br>sented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of the&para;<br>1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment&para;<br>adviser fees under state law were required to meet “com&para;<br>mon-law standards of corporate waste, under which an&para;<br>unreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 An&para;<br>&para;<br>“affiliated person” includes (1) a person who owns, controls, or&para;<br>holds the power to vote 5 percent or more of the securities of the in&para;<br>vestment adviser; (2) an entity which the investment adviser owns,&para;<br>controls, or in which it holds the power to vote more than 5 percent of&para;<br>the securities; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, con&para;<br>trolled by, or under common control with the investment adviser; (4) an&para;<br>officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of the investment&para;<br>adviser; (5) an investment adviser or a member of the investment&para;<br>adviser’s board of directors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated&para;<br>investment adviser. See §80a–2(a)(3). The Act defines “interested&para;<br>person” to include not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath&para;<br>of people such as the immediate family of affiliated persons, interested&para;<br>persons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal counsel for the&para;<br>company, and interested broker-dealers. §80a–2(a)(19).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>court deemed it ‘unconscionable’ or ‘shocking,’ ” and “secu&para;<br>rity holders challenging adviser fees under the [Invest&para;<br>ment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross&para;<br>abuse of trust.” Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 540,&para;<br>n. 12. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the&para;<br>SEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the&para;<br>Commission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was&para;<br>not “reasonable” and to intervene in any similar action&para;<br>brought by or on behalf of an investment company. Id., at&para;<br>538. This approach was included in a bill that passed the&para;<br>House. H. R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., §8(d) (1967); see&para;<br>also S. 1659, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., §8(d) (1967). Industry&para;<br>representatives, however, objected to this proposal, fearing&para;<br>that it “might in essence provide the Commission with&para;<br>ratemaking authority.” Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at&para;<br>538.&para;<br>The provision that was ultimately enacted adopted “a&para;<br>different method of testing management compensation,”&para;<br>id., at 539 (quoting S. Rep., at 5 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)), that was more favorable to shareholders&para;<br>than the previously available remedies but that did not&para;<br>permit a compensation agreement to be reviewed in court&para;<br>for “reasonableness.” This is the fiduciary duty standard&para;<br>in §36(b).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioners are shareholders in three different mutual&para;<br>funds managed by respondent Harris Associates L. P., an&para;<br>investment adviser. Petitioners filed this action in the&para;<br>Northern District of Illinois pursuant to §36(b) seeking&para;<br>damages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agree&para;<br>ments between Harris Associates and the mutual funds.&para;<br>The complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated&para;<br>§36(b) by charging fees that were “disproportionate to the&para;<br>services rendered” and “not within the range of what&para;<br>would have been negotiated at arm’s length in light of all&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the surrounding circumstances.” App. 52.&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment for&para;<br>Harris Associates. Applying the standard adopted in&para;<br>Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694&para;<br>F. 2d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners&para;<br>had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to “whether the&para;<br>fees charged . . . were so disproportionately large that they&para;<br>could not have been the result of arm’s-length bargaining.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed&para;<br>that it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with&para;<br>those that Harris Associates charged its other clients. Id.,&para;<br>at 30a. But in light of those comparisons as well as com&para;<br>parisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to&para;<br>similar mutual funds, the Court held that it could not&para;<br>reasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside&para;<br>the range that could have been the product of arm’s-length&para;<br>bargaining. Id., at 29a–32a.&para;<br>A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based on differ&para;<br>ent reasoning, explicitly “disapprov[ing] the Gartenberg&para;<br>approach.” 527 F. 3d 627, 632 (2008). Looking to trust&para;<br>law, the panel noted that, while a trustee “owes an obliga&para;<br>tion of candor in negotiation,” a trustee, at the time of the&para;<br>creation of a trust, “may negotiate in his own interest and&para;<br>accept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to&para;<br>pay.” Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts §242,&para;<br>and Comment f)). The panel thus reasoned that “[a] fidu&para;<br>ciary duty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must&para;<br>make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject&para;<br>to a cap on compensation.” 527 F. 3d, at 632. In the&para;<br>panel’s view, the amount of an adviser’s compensation&para;<br>would be relevant only if the compensation were “so un&para;<br>usual” as to give rise to an inference “that deceit must&para;<br>have occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision&para;<br>have abdicated.” Ibid.&para;<br>The panel argued that this understanding of §36(b) is&para;<br>consistent with the forces operating in the contemporary&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mutual fund market. Noting that “[t]oday thousands of&para;<br>mutual funds compete,” the panel concluded that “sophis&para;<br>ticated investors” shop for the funds that produce the best&para;<br>overall results, “mov[e] their money elsewhere” when fees&para;<br>are “excessive in relation to the results,” and thus “create&para;<br>a competitive pressure” that generally keeps fees low. Id.,&para;<br>at 633–634. The panel faulted Gartenberg on the ground&para;<br>that it “relies too little on markets.” 527 F. 3d, at 632.&para;<br>And the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the&para;<br>fees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the&para;<br>fees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients,&para;<br>observing that “[d]ifferent clients call for different com&para;<br>mitments of time” and that costs, such as research, that&para;<br>may benefit several categories of clients “make it hard to&para;<br>draw inferences from fee levels.” Id., at 634.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an&para;<br>equally divided vote. 537 F. 3d 728 (2008). The dissent&para;<br>from the denial of rehearing argued that the panel’s rejec&para;<br>tion of Gartenberg was based “mainly on an economic&para;<br>analysis that is ripe for reexamination.” 537 F. 3d, at 730&para;<br>(opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent&para;<br>expressed concern that Harris Associates charged “its&para;<br>captive funds more than twice what it charges independ&para;<br>ent funds,” and the dissent questioned whether high ad&para;<br>viser fees actually drive investors away. Id., at 731.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals over the proper standard under §36(b).2&para;<br>556 U.

Instead of the&para;<br>standard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negoti&para;<br>ate the trustee’s fee at the time of the creation of a trust,&para;<br>petitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trus&para;<br>tee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 20–23, 35–37. A compensation agreement&para;<br>reached at that time, they point out, “ ‘will not bind the&para;<br>beneficiary’ if either ‘the trustee failed to make a full&para;<br>disclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement’ ”&para;<br>which he knew or should have known or if the agreement&para;<br>is unfair to the beneficiary. Id., at 23 (quoting Restate&para;<br>ment (Second) of Trusts §242, Comment i). Respondent,&para;<br>on the other hand, contends that the term “fiduciary” is&para;<br>not exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means&para;<br>different things in different contexts, and that there is no&para;<br>reason to believe that §36(b) incorporates the specific&para;<br>meaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Re&para;<br>spondent 34–36.&para;<br>We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In&para;<br>Pepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939), we discussed the&para;<br>meaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that&para;<br>is analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to&para;<br>trust law. At issue in Pepper was whether a bankruptcy&para;<br>court could disallow a dominant or controlling share&para;<br>holder’s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corpo&para;<br>ration. Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are&para;<br>“fiduciar[ies]” whose “powers are powers [held] in trust.”&para;<br>Id., at 306. We then explained:&para;<br>“Their dealings with the corporation are subjected to&para;<br>rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or&para;<br>engagements with the corporation is challenged the&para;<br>burden is on the director or stockholder not only to&para;<br>prove the good faith of the transaction but also to&para;<br>show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the&para;<br>corporation and those interested therein. . . .

The&para;<br>Investment Company Act modifies this duty in a signifi&para;<br>cant way: it shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to&para;<br>the party claiming breach, 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b)(1), to&para;<br>show that the fee is outside the range that arm’s-length&para;<br>bargaining would produce.&para;<br>The Gartenberg approach fully incorporates this under&para;<br>standing of the fiduciary duty as set out in Pepper and&para;<br>reflects §36(b)(1)’s imposition of the burden on the plain&para;<br>tiff. As noted, Gartenberg insists that all relevant circum&para;<br>stances be taken into account, see 694 F. 2d, at 929, as&para;<br>does §36(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (“[A]pproval by the board of&para;<br>directors . . . shall be given such consideration by the court&para;<br>as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances ”&para;<br>(emphasis added)). And Gartenberg uses the range of fees&para;<br>that might result from arm’s-length bargaining as the&para;<br>benchmark for reviewing challenged fees.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Gartenberg’s approach also reflects §36(b)’s place in the&para;<br>statutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the&para;<br>other protections that the Act affords investors.&para;<br>Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compen&para;<br>sation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the “cor&para;<br>nerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest&para;<br>within mutual funds.” Burks, 441 U.

Second, the appro&para;<br>priate measure of deference varies depending on the&para;<br>circumstances.&para;<br>Gartenberg heeds these precepts.

As noted, the Gartenberg&para;<br>court rejected a comparison between the fees that the&para;<br>adviser in that case charged a money market fund and the&para;<br>fees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3&para;<br>(noting the “[t]he nature and extent of the services re&para;<br>quired by each type of fund differ sharply”). Petitioners&para;<br>contend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 30–31, but respondent disagrees. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 38–44. Since the Act requires consideration of&para;<br>all relevant factors, 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b)(2); see also&para;<br>§80a–15(c), we do not think that there can be any cate&para;<br>gorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees charged&para;<br>different types of clients. See Daily Income Fund, supra,&para;<br>at 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers’&para;<br>practice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to&para;<br>their other clients). Instead, courts may give such com&para;<br>parisons the weight that they merit in light of the simi&para;<br>larities and differences between the services that the&para;<br>clients in question require, but courts must be wary of&para;<br>inapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may&para;<br>be significant differences between the services provided by&para;<br>an investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it pro&para;<br>vides to a pension fund which are attributable to the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>JONES v.

If the services ren&para;<br>dered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not&para;<br>probative, then courts must reject such a comparison.&para;<br>Even if the services provided and fees charged to an inde&para;<br>pendent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that&para;<br>the Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between&para;<br>mutual funds and institutional clients contrary to peti&para;<br>tioners’ contentions. See id., at 631. (“Plaintiffs maintain&para;<br>that a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more&para;<br>than its independent clients”).8&para;<br>By the same token, courts should not rely too heavily on&para;<br>comparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other&para;<br>advisers. These comparisons are problematic because&para;<br>these fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of&para;<br>negotiations conducted at arm’s length. See 537 F. 3d, at&para;<br>731–732 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en&para;<br>banc); Gartenberg, supra, at 929 (“Competition between&para;<br>money market funds for shareholder business does not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Comparisons with fees charged to institutional clients, therefore,&para;<br>will not “doo[m] [a]ny [f]und to [t]rial.” Brief for Respondent 49; see&para;<br>also Strougo v. BEA Assocs., 188 F. Supp. 2d 373, 384 (SDNY 2002)&para;<br>(suggesting that fee comparisons, where permitted, might produce a&para;<br>triable issue). First, plaintiffs bear the burden in showing that fees are&para;<br>beyond the range of arm’s-length bargaining. §80a–35(b)(1). Second, a&para;<br>showing of relevance requires courts to assess any disparity in fees in&para;<br>light of the different markets for advisory services. Only where plain&para;<br>tiffs have shown a large disparity in fees that cannot be explained by&para;<br>the different services in addition to other evidence that the fee is&para;<br>outside the arm’s-length range will trial be appropriate. Cf. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 30a; see also In re AllianceBernstein Mut.

See 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b)(2) (requiring defer&para;<br>ence to board’s consideration “as is deemed appropriate&para;<br>under all the circumstances”); cf. Daily Income Fund, 464&para;<br>U. S., at 541 (“Congress intended security holder and SEC&para;<br>actions under §36(b), on the one hand, and directorial&para;<br>approval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as inde&para;<br>pendent checks on excessive fees”). Where a board’s proc&para;<br>ess for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser&para;<br>compensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford&para;<br>commensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining&para;<br>process. See Burks, 441 U. S., at 484 (unaffiliated direc&para;<br>tors serve as “independent watchdogs”). Thus, if the&para;<br>disinterested directors considered the relevant factors,&para;<br>their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is&para;<br>entitled to considerable weight, even if a court might&para;<br>weigh the factors differently. Cf. id., at 485. This is not to&para;<br>deny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated&para;<br>by a board in possession of all relevant information, but&para;<br>such a determination must be based on evidence that the&para;<br>fee “is so disproportionately large that it bears no reason&para;<br>able relationship to the services rendered and could not&para;<br>have been the product of arm’s-length bargaining.” Gar&para;<br>tenberg, supra, at 928.&para;<br>In contrast, where the board’s process was deficient or&para;<br>the adviser withheld important information, the court&para;<br>must take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an&para;<br>investment adviser fails to disclose material information&para;<br>to the board, greater scrutiny is justified because the&para;<br>withheld information might have hampered the board’s&para;<br>ability to function as “an independent check upon the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>JONES v.

But an adviser’s compliance or non&para;<br>compliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that&para;<br>must be considered in calibrating the degree of deference&para;<br>that is due a board’s decision to approve an adviser’s fees.&para;<br>It is also important to note that the standard for fiduci&para;<br>ary breach under §36(b) does not call for judicial second&para;<br>guessing of informed board decisions. See Daily Income&para;<br>Fund, supra, at 538; see also Burks, 441 U. S., at 483&para;<br>(“Congress consciously chose to address the conflict-of&para;<br>interest problem through the Act’s independent-directors&para;<br>section, rather than through more drastic remedies”).&para;<br>“[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some re&para;<br>straints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinter&para;<br>ested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transac&para;<br>tions with the investment adviser,” but they do not&para;<br>suggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disin&para;<br>terested directors apprised of all relevant information,&para;<br>without additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm’s&para;<br>length range. Id., at 481. In reviewing compensation&para;<br>under §36(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in&para;<br>a precise calculation of fees representative of arm’s-length&para;<br>bargaining. See 527 F. 3d, at 633 (“Judicial price-setting&para;<br>does not accompany fiduciary duties”). As recounted&para;<br>above, Congress rejected a “reasonableness” requirement&para;<br>that was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting&para;<br>responsibilities.
