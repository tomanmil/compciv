The next day, the Nation filed this&para;<br>action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims&para;<br>(CFC), alleging almost identical violations and requesting money&para;<br>damages. The CFC case was dismissed under 28 U. S. C. §1500,&para;<br>which bars CFC jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another&para;<br>suit “for or in respect to” that claim pending against the United&para;<br>States or its agents in another court. The Federal Circuit reversed,&para;<br>finding that the two suits were not for or in respect to the same claim&para;<br>because, although they shared operative facts, they did not seek over&para;<br>lapping relief.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim, precluding CFC&para;<br>jurisdiction, if they are based on substantially the same operative&para;<br>facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit. Pp. 2–9.&para;<br>(a) Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the&para;<br>CFC and its predecessors when related actions are pending else&para;<br>where. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212, held that&para;<br>two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are “based&para;<br>on substantially the same operative facts . . . , at least if there [is]&para;<br>some overlap in the relief requested,” but it reserved the question&para;<br>whether the jurisdictional bar operates if suits based on the same op&para;<br>erative facts do not seek overlapping relief. The rule now codified in&para;<br>§1500 was first enacted to curb duplicate lawsuits by residents of the&para;<br>Confederacy who, in seeking to recover for cotton taken by the Fed&para;<br>eral Government, sued the Government in the Court of Claims and,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>at the same time, sued federal officials in other courts, seeking tort&para;<br>relief for the same actions. Section 1500’s robust response to this&para;<br>problem bars CFC jurisdiction not only if the plaintiff sues on an&para;<br>identical claim elsewhere, but also if the other action is related but&para;<br>not identical. The phrase “in respect to” does not resolve all doubt as&para;<br>to the bar’s scope, but it suggests a broad prohibition, regardless of&para;<br>whether “claim” carries a special or limited meaning. Pp. 2–4.&para;<br>(b) Keene permits two constructions of “for or in respect to” the&para;<br>same claim, one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus&para;<br>remedial overlap. The former is the more reasonable interpretation&para;<br>in light of the statute’s use of a similar phrase in a way consistent&para;<br>only with factual overlap. The CFC bar applies where the other ac&para;<br>tion is against a “person who, . . . when the cause of action . . . arose,&para;<br>was, in respect thereto, acting” under color of federal law. But at the&para;<br>time that a cause of action arose, the person could not act in respect&para;<br>to the relief requested, for no complaint was yet filed. Although the&para;<br>phrase at issue involves a “claim” rather than a cause of action, there&para;<br>is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to re&para;<br>lief. As Keene explained, “ ‘claim’ is used here synonymously with&para;<br>‘cause of action,’ ” 508 U. S., at 210. And if the phrase that uses&para;<br>“cause of action,” the more technical term, does not embrace the con&para;<br>cept of remedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.&para;<br>Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(c) This reading also makes sense in light of the CFC’s unique&para;<br>remedial powers. Because the CFC is the only judicial forum for&para;<br>most nontort requests for significant monetary relief against the&para;<br>United States and because it has no general power to provide equita&para;<br>ble relief against the Government or its officers, a statute aimed at&para;<br>precluding duplicate CFC suits would be unlikely to require remedial&para;<br>overlap. Remedial overlap was even more unusual when §1500’s rule&para;<br>was first enacted in 1868. The Federal Circuit could identify no pur&para;<br>pose the statute served in light of that court’s precedent. But courts&para;<br>should not render statutes nugatory through construction. The stat&para;<br>ute’s purpose is clear from its origins—the need to save the Govern&para;<br>ment from redundant litigation—and the conclusion that two suits&para;<br>are for or in respect to the same claim when they share substantially&para;<br>the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve that aim. Con&para;<br>centrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of&para;<br>claim preclusion, or res judicata. The Nation errs in arguing that&para;<br>this Court’s interpretation unjustly forces plaintiffs to choose be&para;<br>tween partial remedies available in different courts. The Nation&para;<br>could have recovered any losses in the CFC alone. Even if some&para;<br>hardship were shown, this Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add an excep&para;<br>tion . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene, supra, at 217–218.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

The substantial overlap in operative facts between the Nation’s&para;<br>District Court and CFC suits precludes jurisdiction in the CFC.

The Nation’s main reservation is in&para;<br>the Sonoran desert of southern Arizona. Counting this&para;<br>and other reservation lands, the Nation’s landholdings are&para;<br>approximately 3 million acres.&para;<br>The Nation brought two actions based on the same&para;<br>alleged violations of fiduciary duty with respect to the&para;<br>Nation’s lands and other assets. One action was filed&para;<br>against federal officials in district court and the other&para;<br>against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims&para;<br>(CFC). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held&para;<br>that the CFC suit was not barred by the rule that the CFC&para;<br>lacks jurisdiction over an action “for or in respect to” a&para;<br>claim that is also the subject of an action pending in an&para;<br>other court. 28 U. S. C. §1500. The question presented is&para;<br>whether a common factual basis like the one apparent in&para;<br>the Nation’s suits suffices to bar jurisdiction under §1500.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The case turns on the relationship between the two suits&para;<br>the Nation filed. The first suit was filed in the United&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States District Court for the District of Columbia against&para;<br>federal officials responsible for managing tribal assets&para;<br>held in trust by the Federal Government. The complaint&para;<br>alleged various violations of fiduciary duty with respect to&para;<br>those assets. The Nation claimed, for example, that the&para;<br>officials failed to provide an accurate accounting of trust&para;<br>property; to refrain from self-dealing; or to use reasonable&para;<br>skill in investing trust assets. The complaint requested&para;<br>equitable relief, including an accounting.&para;<br>The next day the Nation filed the instant action against&para;<br>the United States in the CFC. The CFC complaint de&para;<br>scribed the same trust assets and the same fiduciary&para;<br>duties that were the subject of the District Court com&para;<br>plaint. And it alleged almost identical violations of fiduci&para;<br>ary duty, for which it requested money damages. The CFC&para;<br>case was dismissed under §1500 for want of jurisdiction.&para;<br>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal&para;<br>Circuit reversed. 559 F. 3d 1284 (2009). Two suits are for&para;<br>or in respect to the same claim, it reasoned, only if they&para;<br>share operative facts and also seek overlapping relief.&para;<br>Finding no overlap in the relief requested, the court held&para;<br>that the two suits at issue were not for or in respect to the&para;<br>same claim.&para;<br>This Court granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of&para;<br>the CFC and its predecessors when related actions are&para;<br>pending elsewhere. Section 1500, identical in most re&para;<br>spects to the original statute, provides:&para;<br>“The United States Court of Federal Claims shall&para;<br>not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to&para;<br>which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any&para;<br>other court any suit or process against the United&para;<br>States or any person who, at the time when the cause&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in&para;<br>respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or&para;<br>indirectly under the authority of the United States.”&para;<br>The rule is more straightforward than its complex wording&para;<br>suggests. The CFC has no jurisdiction over a claim if the&para;<br>plaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim&para;<br>pending against the United States or its agents.&para;<br>The question to be resolved is what it means for two&para;<br>suits to be “for or in respect to” the same claim. Keene&para;<br>Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200 (1993), provided a&para;<br>partial answer. It held that two suits are for or in respect&para;<br>to the same claim when they are “based on substantially&para;<br>the same operative facts . . . , at least if there [is] some&para;<br>overlap in the relief requested.” Id., at 212. The Keene&para;<br>case did not decide whether the jurisdictional bar also&para;<br>operates if the suits are based on the same operative facts&para;<br>but do not seek overlapping relief. Still, Keene narrows&para;<br>the permissible constructions of “for or in respect to” a&para;<br>claim to one of two interpretations. Either it requires&para;<br>substantial factual and some remedial overlap, or it re&para;<br>quires substantial factual overlap without more.&para;<br>Congress first enacted the jurisdictional bar now codi&para;<br>fied in §1500 to curb duplicate lawsuits brought by resi&para;<br>dents of the Confederacy following the Civil War. The&para;<br>so-called “cotton claimants”—named for their suits to&para;<br>recover for cotton taken by the Federal Government—sued&para;<br>the United States in the Court of Claims under the Aban&para;<br>doned Property Collection Act, 12 Stat. 820, while at the&para;<br>same time suing federal officials in other courts, seeking&para;<br>relief under tort law for the same alleged actions. See&para;<br>Keene, supra, at 206–207; Schwartz, Section 1500 of the&para;<br>Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Govern&para;<br>ment and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 574–580 (1967).&para;<br>Although the rule embodied in §1500 originated long ago,&para;<br>Congress reenacted the statute at various times, most&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>recently in 1948. See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 942;&para;<br>Keene, 508 U. S., at 206–207.&para;<br>The text of §1500 reflects a robust response to the prob&para;<br>lem first presented by the cotton claimants. It bars juris&para;<br>diction in the CFC not only if the plaintiff sues on an&para;<br>identical claim elsewhere—a suit “for” the same claim—&para;<br>but also if the plaintiff’s other action is related although&para;<br>not identical—a suit “in respect to” the same claim. The&para;<br>phrase “in respect to” does not resolve all doubt as to the&para;<br>scope of the jurisdictional bar, but “it does make it clear&para;<br>that Congress did not intend the statute to be rendered&para;<br>useless by a narrow concept of identity.” Id., at 213. It&para;<br>suggests a broad prohibition, regardless of whether&para;<br>“claim” carries a special or limited meaning. Cf. United&para;<br>States v. Jones, 131 U. S. 1 (1889) (“claim” in the Little&para;<br>Tucker Act refers only to requests for money).&para;<br>Of the two constructions of “for or in respect to” the&para;<br>same claim that Keene permits—one based on facts alone&para;<br>and the other on factual plus remedial overlap—the for&para;<br>mer is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the&para;<br>statute’s use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only&para;<br>with factual overlap. The CFC bar applies even where the&para;<br>other action is not against the Government but instead&para;<br>against a “person who, at the time when the cause of&para;<br>action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect&para;<br>thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly&para;<br>under the authority of the United States.” The statute&para;<br>refers to a person who acts under color of federal law in&para;<br>respect to a cause of action at the time it arose. But at&para;<br>that time, the person could not act in respect to the relief&para;<br>requested, for no complaint was yet filed. This use of the&para;<br>phrase “in respect to a cause of action” must refer to op&para;<br>erative facts and not whatever remedies an aggrieved&para;<br>party might later request. A person acts under color of&para;<br>federal law in respect to a cause of action by claiming or&para;<br>wielding federal authority in the relevant factual context.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Although the two phrases are not identical—one is in&para;<br>respect to a claim, the other a cause of action—they are&para;<br>almost so, and there is reason to think that both phrases&para;<br>refer to facts alone and not to relief. As the Keene Court&para;<br>explained, “the term ‘claim’ is used here synonymously&para;<br>with ‘cause of action.’ ” 508 U. S., at 210. And if either of&para;<br>the two phrases were to include both operative facts and a&para;<br>specific remedy, it would be the one that uses the term&para;<br>“cause of action” rather than “claim.” “Cause of action” is&para;<br>the more technical term, while “claim” is often used in a&para;<br>commonsense way to mean a right or demand. Here, for&para;<br>the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, “in respect&para;<br>to a cause of action” refers simply to facts without regard&para;<br>to judicial remedies. So, if the phrase with the more tech&para;<br>nical of the two terms does not embrace the concept of&para;<br>remedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase&para;<br>does. Even if the terms “claim” or “cause of action” include&para;<br>the request for relief, the phrase “for or in respect to” gives&para;<br>the statutory bar a broader scope.&para;<br>Reading the statute to require only factual and not also&para;<br>remedial overlap makes sense in light of the unique reme&para;<br>dial powers of the CFC. The CFC is the only judicial&para;<br>forum for most non-tort requests for significant monetary&para;<br>relief against the United States. See 28 U. S. C. §1491&para;<br>(2006 ed. and Supp. III); §1346(a)(2) (2006 ed.). Unlike&para;<br>the district courts, however, the CFC has no general power&para;<br>to provide equitable relief against the Government or its&para;<br>officers. Compare United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 2–3&para;<br>(1969), with 5 U. S. C. §702; see also United States v.&para;<br>Alire, 6 Wall. 573, 575 (1868) (“[T]he only judgments&para;<br>which the Court of Claims are authorized to render&para;<br>against the government . . . are judgments for money&para;<br>found due from the government to the petitioner”). The&para;<br>distinct jurisdiction of the CFC makes overlapping relief&para;<br>the exception and distinct relief the norm. For that rea&para;<br>son, a statute aimed at precluding suits in the CFC that&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>duplicate suits elsewhere would be unlikely to require&para;<br>remedial overlap.&para;<br>Remedial overlap between CFC actions and those in&para;<br>other courts was even more unusual when §1500’s rule&para;<br>was first enacted in 1868. At that time the CFC had a&para;<br>more limited jurisdiction than it does now, for the Tucker&para;<br>Act’s general waiver of sovereign immunity for non-tort&para;<br>claims for monetary relief had not yet been enacted. See&para;<br>24 Stat. 505. And while the district courts can today&para;<br>adjudicate suits against the United States for money&para;<br>damages under the Little Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1346(a)(2), and the Federal Tort Claims Act §1346(b), in&para;<br>1868 the United States could only be sued in the Court of&para;<br>Claims. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 212–214&para;<br>(1983); G. Sisk, Litigation with the Federal Government&para;<br>§4.02(a)(1) (4th ed. 2006). Because the kinds of suits and&para;<br>forms of relief available against the United States were&para;<br>few and constrained, remedial overlap between CFC suits&para;<br>and those in other courts was even less common then than&para;<br>now. If the statute were to require remedial as well as&para;<br>factual overlap, it would have had very limited application&para;<br>in 1868 despite its broad language that bars not only&para;<br>identical but also related claims. The rule in §1500 effects&para;<br>a significant jurisdictional limitation, and Congress reen&para;<br>acted it even as changes in the structure of the courts&para;<br>made suits on the same facts more likely to arise. Doing&para;<br>so reaffirmed the force of the bar and thus the commit&para;<br>ment to curtailing redundant litigation.&para;<br>The panel of the Court of Appeals could not identify&para;<br>“any purpose that §1500 serves today,” 559 F. 3d, at 1292,&para;<br>in large part because it was bound by Circuit precedent&para;<br>that left the statute without meaningful force. For exam&para;<br>ple, the panel cited Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States,&para;<br>170 Ct. Cl. 389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), which held that&para;<br>§1500 does not prohibit two identical suits from proceed&para;<br>ing so long as the action in the CFC, or at that time the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Claims, is filed first. The Tecon holding is not&para;<br>presented in this case because the CFC action here was&para;<br>filed after the District Court suit.&para;<br>Still, the Court of Appeals was wrong to allow its prece&para;<br>dent to suppress the statute’s aims. Courts should not&para;<br>render statutes nugatory through construction. In fact the&para;<br>statute’s purpose is clear from its origins with the cotton&para;<br>claimants—the need to save the Government from bur&para;<br>dens of redundant litigation—and that purpose is no less&para;<br>significant today. The conclusion that two suits are for or&para;<br>in respect to the same claim when they are based on sub&para;<br>stantially the same operative facts allows the statute to&para;<br>achieve its aim. Keene, supra, at 206. Developing a fac&para;<br>tual record is responsible for much of the cost of litigation.&para;<br>Discovery is a conspicuous example, and the preparation&para;<br>and examination of witnesses at trial is another. The form&para;<br>of relief requested matters less, except insofar as it affects&para;<br>what facts parties must prove. An interpretation of §1500&para;<br>focused on the facts rather than the relief a party seeks&para;<br>preserves the provision as it was meant to function, and it&para;<br>keeps the provision from becoming a mere pleading rule,&para;<br>to be circumvented by carving up a single transaction into&para;<br>overlapping pieces seeking different relief. Cf. Casman v.&para;<br>United States, 135 Ct. Cl. 647 (1956) (CFC had jurisdiction&para;<br>notwithstanding common facts in district court suit be&para;<br>cause the plaintiff sought different relief in each forum).&para;<br>Concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with&para;<br>the doctrine of claim preclusion, or res judicata, which&para;<br>bars “repetitious suits involving the same cause of action”&para;<br>once “a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final&para;<br>judgment on the merits.” Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333&para;<br>U. S. 591, 597 (1948). The jurisdictional bar in §1500 was&para;<br>enacted in part to address the problem that judgments in&para;<br>suits against officers were not preclusive in suits against&para;<br>the United States. Matson Nav. Co. v. United States, 284&para;<br>U. S. 352, 355–356 (1932). So it is no surprise that the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>statute would operate in similar fashion. The now&para;<br>accepted test in preclusion law for determining whether&para;<br>two suits involve the same claim or cause of action de&para;<br>pends on factual overlap, barring “claims arising from the&para;<br>same transaction.” Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456&para;<br>U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982); see also Restatement (Second)&para;<br>of Judgments §24 (1980). The transactional test is of&para;<br>course much younger than the rule embodied in §1500, but&para;<br>even in the 19th century it was not uncommon to identify&para;<br>a claim for preclusion purposes based on facts rather than&para;<br>relief. See J. Wells, Res Adjudicata and Stare Decisis&para;<br>§241, p. 208 (1878) (“The true distinction between de&para;<br>mands or rights of action which are single and entire, and&para;<br>those which are several and distinct, is, that the former&para;<br>immediately arise out of one and the same act or contract,&para;<br>and the latter out of different acts or contracts” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)); 2 H. Black, Law of Judgments&para;<br>§726, p. 866 (1891) (The test for identity is: “Would the&para;<br>same evidence support and establish both the present and&para;<br>the former cause of action?”). Reading §1500 to depend on&para;<br>the underlying facts and not also on the relief requested&para;<br>gives effect to the principles of preclusion law embodied in&para;<br>the statute.&para;<br>There is no merit to the Nation’s assertion that the&para;<br>interpretation adopted here cannot prevail because it is&para;<br>unjust, forcing plaintiffs to choose between partial reme&para;<br>dies available in different courts. The hardship in this&para;<br>case is far from clear. The Nation could have filed in the&para;<br>CFC alone and if successful obtained monetary relief to&para;<br>compensate for any losses caused by the Government’s&para;<br>breach of duty. It also seems likely that Indian tribes in&para;<br>the Nation’s position could go to district court first without&para;<br>losing the chance to later file in the CFC, for Congress has&para;<br>provided in every appropriations Act for the Department&para;<br>of Interior since 1990 that the statute of limitations on&para;<br>Indian trust mismanagement claims shall not run until&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

See, e.g., 123 Stat. 2922; 104 Stat. 1930.&para;<br>Even were some hardship to be shown, considerations of&para;<br>policy divorced from the statute’s text and purpose could&para;<br>not override its meaning. Although Congress has permit&para;<br>ted claims against the United States for monetary relief in&para;<br>the CFC, that relief is available by grace and not by right.&para;<br>See Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858) (“[A]s this&para;<br>permission is altogether voluntary on the part of the&para;<br>sovereignty, it follows that it may prescribe the terms and&para;<br>conditions on which it consents to be sued, and the man&para;<br>ner in which the suit shall be conducted”). If indeed the&para;<br>statute leads to incomplete relief, and if plaintiffs like the&para;<br>Nation are dissatisfied, they are free to direct their com&para;<br>plaints to Congress. This Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add&para;<br>an exception . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene,&para;<br>508 U. S., at 217–218 (quoting Corona Coal Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 263 U.

Instead, discarding the restraint we exhibited in&para;<br>Keene, the Court unnecessarily chooses to hold that §1500&para;<br>bars jurisdiction in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s CFC&para;<br>action is based on substantially the same facts as a suit&para;<br>pending elsewhere.3 This reading of §1500 is, in my opin&para;<br>ion, incorrect.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Since the enactment of §1500 in 1868, Congress has&para;<br>expanded the avenues by which persons with legitimate&para;<br>claims against the United States may obtain relief. See&para;<br>ante, at 6. In some circumstances, Congress has chosen to&para;<br>require plaintiffs to file actions in two different courts to&para;<br>obtain complete relief relating to a single set of operative&para;<br>facts. For example, with some exceptions, the CFC has no&para;<br>power to issue equitable relief. See Bowen v.

It justifies its decision to reach the question on&para;<br>the ground that its rule would eliminate “an unnecessary and compli&para;<br>cated remedial inquiry” and would decrease “the expense and duration&para;<br>of litigation.” Ante, at 9. It provides no reason to believe, however, that&para;<br>inquiry into relief requested is unduly complicated in the vast majority&para;<br>of cases. Cf. Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v.

More importantly, the majority does not explain why the&para;<br>benefits it perceives to result from deciding this question today out&para;<br>weigh the potential for its reading of the statute to leave some plaintiffs&para;<br>with incomplete recompense for their injuries.

As a result, a plaintiff seeking both money&para;<br>damages and injunctive relief to remedy distinct harms&para;<br>arising from the same set of facts may be forced to file&para;<br>actions in both the CFC and federal district court.&para;<br>For half a century, the CFC has recognized that §1500&para;<br>does not preclude jurisdiction in that court when Congress&para;<br>has required a plaintiff to split a claim into two actions to&para;<br>obtain different forms of relief necessary to make the&para;<br>plaintiff whole. In Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl.&para;<br>647 (1956), a terminated federal employee sought backpay&para;<br>in the Court of Claims and reinstatement to his position in&para;<br>District Court. The plaintiff’s two suits arose from the&para;<br>same facts (his termination) but sought “entirely different”&para;<br>forms of relief within the exclusive jurisdiction of two&para;<br>courts.4 Id., at 650. In light of our previous recognition&para;<br>that the purpose of §1500 “ ‘was only to require an election&para;<br>between a suit in the Court of Claims and one brought in&para;<br>another court,’ ” id., at 649 (quoting Matson Nav.

To hold otherwise, the court acknowledged, “would&para;<br>be to say to plaintiff, ‘If you want your job back you must&para;<br>forget your back pay’; conversely, ‘If you want your back&para;<br>pay, you cannot have your job back.’ ” Ibid.; see also Love&para;<br>ladies Harbor, Inc. v.

Under the majority’s&para;<br>reading of §1500, because Casman’s two suits were based&para;<br>on common facts, §1500 barred jurisdiction in the CFC&para;<br>over his backpay claim even though he could not have&para;<br>obtained backpay in his District Court action.&para;<br>The jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the&para;<br>United States often requires other plaintiffs to file two&para;<br>actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in&para;<br>connection with one set of facts. As just one example, an&para;<br>action seeking injunctive relief to set aside agency action&para;<br>must proceed in district court, but a claim that the same&para;<br>agency action constitutes a taking of property requiring&para;<br>just compensation must proceed in the CFC. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Alaska v. United States, 32 Fed. Cl. 689 (1995). After&para;<br>today’s decision, §1500 may well prevent a plaintiff from&para;<br>pursuing a takings claim in the CFC if an action to set&para;<br>aside the agency action is pending in district court. This&para;<br>type of plaintiff may face a choice between equally unat&para;<br>tractive options: forgo injunctive relief in the district court&para;<br>to preserve her claim for monetary relief in the CFC, or&para;<br>pursue injunctive relief and hope that the statute of limi&para;<br>tations on her takings claim, see 28 U. S. C. §2501, does&para;<br>not expire before the district court action is resolved.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The majority apparently doubts that its holding puts the Nation to a&para;<br>similarly difficult choice. It first suggests that the Nation could file&para;<br>solely in the CFC to obtain damages for the Government’s alleged&para;<br>breaches of fiduciary duty. See ante, at 8. The Nation could indeed&para;<br>choose to file only in the CFC—just as any plaintiff could choose to&para;<br>forgo injunctive relief to pursue money damages in the CFC—but the&para;<br>Nation believes it is entitled to more than monetary relief. The Na&para;<br>tion’s District Court action seeks an equitable accounting to remedy the&para;<br>same breaches of fiduciary duty, and the CFC has held that it lacks&para;<br>jurisdiction to issue a preliability accounting.

The statute bars jurisdiction in the CFC over&para;<br>a “claim for or in respect to which” a plaintiff has a suit or&para;<br>process pending elsewhere. When Congress first enacted&para;<br>§1500’s predecessor, the statute establishing the jurisdic&para;<br>tion of the Court of Claims used the term “claims” to refer&para;<br>to demands for money damages.

See ante, at 8–9. But&para;<br>the cited statute only applies to claims “concerning losses to or mis&para;<br>management of trust funds.” 123 Stat. 2922.

See App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a–69a (seeking&para;<br>damages for the Government’s mismanagement of the Nation’s mineral&para;<br>estates). Expiration of the 6-year statute of limitations governing&para;<br>claims in the CFC is a very real prospect in this and other cases; the&para;<br>Nation’s District Court action has been pending for more than four&para;<br>years.&para;<br>As the majority notes, see ante, at 6–7, the validity of the Court of&para;<br>Claims’ holding in Tecon Engineers, Inc. v.

The question remains what constitutes&para;<br>a suit or process “for or in respect to” a CFC claim. The&para;<br>purpose and history of the statute elucidate the meaning&para;<br>of this ambiguous phrase. As the majority explains, Con&para;<br>gress enacted the statute to prevent “duplicative lawsuits”&para;<br>brought by the so-called “cotton claimants” in the after&para;<br>math of the Civil War. Keene, 508 U. S., at 206; see ante,&para;<br>at 3. The cotton claimants sought monetary compensation&para;<br>for seized cotton in the Court of Claims pursuant to the&para;<br>Abandoned Property Collection Act, 12 Stat. 820. Because&para;<br>they had difficulty satisfying the statutory requirement&para;<br>that, to obtain compensation, they must not have given aid&para;<br>or comfort to participants in the rebellion, see §3 of the&para;<br>Act, they also sought relief—either in the form of money&para;<br>damages or actual cotton—in separate lawsuits against&para;<br>federal officials on tort theories such as conversion. “It&para;<br>was these duplicative lawsuits that induced Congress” to&para;<br>enact §1500’s predecessor. Keene, 508 U. S., at 206.&para;<br>This historical backdrop sheds light on what Congress&para;<br>would have understood to be a suit or process “for or in&para;<br>respect to” a “claim” in the Court of Claims. Congress&para;<br>undoubtedly intended to preclude a claim for money in the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>mand for money in the context of the CFC. See 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1)&para;<br>(conferring jurisdiction in the CFC over “any claim against the United&para;<br>States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress&para;<br>or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or&para;<br>implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliqui&para;<br>dated damages in cases not sounding in tort” (emphasis added)). Of&para;<br>course, since §1500’s enactment, Congress has authorized the CFC&para;<br>to issue relief other than money damages in certain cases.

Had the courts&para;<br>awarded such plaintiffs both the cotton itself and money&para;<br>damages, the plaintiffs would have obtained twice what&para;<br>they deserved. In this way, Congress eschewed “a narrow&para;<br>concept of identity” that would have permitted plaintiffs to&para;<br>pursue and obtain duplicative relief to remedy the very&para;<br>same harm. Id., at 213.&para;<br>The legislative history confirms Congress’ intent to&para;<br>preclude requests for duplicative relief. The statute’s&para;<br>sponsor explained that the purpose of the statute was “to&para;<br>put to their election that large class of persons having&para;<br>cotton claims[,] . . . who are here at the same time endeav&para;<br>oring to prosecute their claims, and have filed them in the&para;<br>Court of Claims, so that after they put the Government to&para;<br>the expense of beating them once in a court of law they&para;<br>can turn around and try the whole question in the Court of&para;<br>Claims.”7 Cong.

First, the majority rea&para;<br>sons that the phrase “claim for or in respect to” must refer&para;<br>only to factual overlap because the statute uses the phrase&para;<br>“cause of action . . . in respect thereto” (which the majority&para;<br>paraphrases as “in respect to a cause of action”) in a way&para;<br>that is “consistent only with factual overlap.” Ante, at 4.&para;<br>This point rests on a misreading of the statutory text. The&para;<br>statute asks whether a plaintiff has pending a “suit or&para;<br>process” for or in respect to the plaintiff’s CFC claim—not&para;<br>whether it has pending a “cause of action” for or in respect&para;<br>to that claim.8 Even if the term “cause of action” refers&para;<br>only to operative facts—such that the inquiry whether a&para;<br>person was acting under color of federal law in respect to&para;<br>a cause of action is purely factual in nature—a “suit or&para;<br>process” will inevitably include a request for relief.&para;<br>Second, the majority states that, “in light of the unique&para;<br>remedial powers of the CFC,” requiring remedial overlap&para;<br>would make no sense because it would result in a “very&para;<br>limited application” of the statute. Ante, at 5, 6. Here, the&para;<br>majority overlooks the nearly 150-year history of the&para;<br>statute. It was the cotton claimants’ parallel requests for&para;<br>duplicative relief that prompted passage of §1500 in the&para;<br>first place. Since then, litigants have continued to seek&para;<br>duplicative relief against the Government in two courts, as&para;<br>Keene and this very case illustrate. See 508 U. S., at 204–&para;<br>205 (seeking tort damages in the District Court and com&para;<br>pensation on a takings theory in the CFC); supra, at 1–3&para;<br>(seeking restitution and disgorgement in the District&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Section 1500 refers to the “cause of action alleged in such suit or&para;<br>process” only for the limited purpose of determining whether the other&para;<br>suit or process is against an agent of the United States. When the&para;<br>plaintiff’s other action is against the United States itself, the term&para;<br>“cause of action” has no relevance to the §1500 inquiry.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Court and money damages in the CFC); see also, e.g., Ex&para;<br>parte Skinner &amp; Eddy Corp., 265 U. S. 86, 91–92 (1924)&para;<br>(seeking money damages against the United States in the&para;<br>Court of Claims and against a federal entity in state&para;<br>court); Corona Coal Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 537,&para;<br>539 (1924) (seeking money damages against the United&para;<br>States in the Court of Claims and against a federal agent&para;<br>in District Court); British American Tobacco Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 89 Ct. Cl. 438, 439–440 (1939) (per curiam) (seek&para;<br>ing tort damages in the District Court and contract dam&para;<br>ages in the Court of Claims). As these cases make clear,&para;<br>interpreting §1500 to prohibit requests for duplicative&para;<br>relief hardly renders the statute of limited application.&para;<br>Third, the majority suggests that its construction of&para;<br>§1500 is necessary to achieve the statute’s aim of “sav[ing]&para;<br>the Government from burdens of redundant litigation.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7. Parallel actions seeking the same or duplica&para;<br>tive relief, or different forms of relief that are available&para;<br>entirely in one court, are redundant; actions seeking dif&para;<br>ferent forms of relief that Congress has made available&para;<br>exclusively in different courts are not. To the extent the&para;<br>majority is concerned about the burdens of parallel discov&para;<br>ery, federal courts have ample tools at their disposal, such&para;<br>as stays, to prevent such burdens. See Schwartz, Section&para;<br>1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the&para;<br>Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 599 (1967).&para;<br>Finally, the majority contends that focusing on opera&para;<br>tive facts is consistent with the principles of claim preclu&para;<br>sion embodied in the statute. Claim preclusion ordinarily&para;<br>“bar[s] claims arising from the same transaction.” Kremer&para;<br>v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982).&para;<br>There is, however, an exception to this rule when a plain&para;<br>tiff was unable to obtain a certain remedy in the earlier&para;<br>action. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §26(1)(c)&para;<br>(1980) (claim preclusion does not apply where “[t]he plain&para;<br>tiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action&para;<br>because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdic&para;<br>tion of the courts”); see also Marrese v. American Academy&para;<br>of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U. S. 373, 382 (1985); 18 C.&para;<br>Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and&para;<br>Procedure §4412, p. 276 (2d ed. 2002). This principle has&para;<br>long informed claim preclusion law. See, e.g., Restatement&para;<br>of Judgments §62, Comment k (1942) (“[W]here a plaintiff&para;<br>brings an action in a State in which the courts have juris&para;<br>diction only with reference to one portion of his cause of&para;<br>action, he is not barred from maintaining an action in a&para;<br>proper court for the other portion”); 2 H. Black, Law of&para;<br>Judgments §618, p. 744 (1891) (“A judgment is not conclu&para;<br>sive of any matter which, from the nature of the case, the&para;<br>form of action, or the character of the pleadings, could not&para;<br>have been adjudicated in the former suit”). For these&para;<br>reasons, preclusion doctrine actually undermines the&para;<br>majority’s position.&para;<br>In sum, the majority offers no coherent justification for&para;<br>its conclusion that Congress intended to preclude jurisdic&para;<br>tion in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s claim in that court&para;<br>is based on substantially the same facts as a suit pending&para;<br>elsewhere without reference to the relief sought.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Even before today’s decision, §1500 had been described&para;<br>as “anachronistic,” Keene, 508 U. S., at 217, “harsh,” id., at&para;<br>222 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and “arbitrar[y],” 79 Fed. Cl.&para;<br>645, 659, n. 16 (2007). Judges and commentators have&para;<br>long called for congressional attention to the statute. See,&para;<br>e.g., Keene, 508 U. S., at 222 (Stevens, J., dissenting);&para;<br>Schwartz, supra, at 601. Today’s decision—which unnec&para;<br>essarily considers and repudiates the Casman rule—&para;<br>renders such attention all the more pressing. Under the&para;<br>Court’s construction of §1500, plaintiffs whom Congress&para;<br>has forced to file parallel actions in the CFC and a district&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

I cannot agree that Congress&para;<br>intended, or intends, for §1500 to produce this result. For&para;<br>these reasons, I respectfully concur only in the judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §1500 and would affirm the Federal Circuit’s&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>According to the Court, the Court of Federal Claims&para;<br>(CFC) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Tohono&para;<br>O’odham Nation’s (Nation) claim because the Tribe was&para;<br>simultaneously pursuing in the D. C. District Court an&para;<br>action with “a common factual basis.” Ante, at 1. It mat&para;<br>ters not, the Court holds, that to gain complete relief, the&para;<br>Nation had to launch two suits, for neither of the two&para;<br>courts whose jurisdiction the Tribe invoked could alone&para;<br>provide full redress. See ante, at 8–9.&para;<br>The Court concludes that “claim” or “cause of action,”&para;<br>terms the Court considers synonymous as used in §1500,*&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* “ ‘Cause of action,’ ” the Court simultaneously states, “is the more&para;<br>technical term.” Ante, at 5. If “more technical” means more precise,&para;<br>clear or certain, the Court is incorrect. See United States v. Memphis&para;<br>Cotton Oil Co., 288 U. S. 62, 67–68 (1933) (“A ‘cause of action’ may&para;<br>mean one thing for one purpose and something different for another.”).&para;<br>In its discourse on the term, the Court has fallen into an old error; the&para;<br>drafters of the Federal Rules endeavored to “eliminate the unfortunate&para;<br>rigidity and confusion surrounding the words ‘cause of action.’ ” 5 C.&para;<br>Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1216, p. 207 (3d&para;<br>ed. 2004). Today’s invocation of a supposed particular or exact meaning&para;<br>for the phrase risks reviving that confusion.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>see ante, at 5, refers to “operative facts,” and not to the&para;<br>remedies a plaintiff seeks. See ante, at 4. Section 1500&para;<br>speaks of “the time when the cause of action . . . arose,” a&para;<br>time antedating the commencement of suit. The Court&para;<br>infers, therefore, that a “claim” or “cause of action” is&para;<br>discrete from a pleading’s request for relief. See ante, at 4.&para;<br>In fact, however, entitlement to relief is essential to the&para;<br>existence of a claim or cause of action, which arises when a&para;<br>person suffers a harm capable of judicial redress. See 2 J.&para;<br>Story, Equity Jurisprudence §1521a, p. 741 (8th ed. 1861)&para;<br>(“[T]he cause of action . . . arises when . . . the party has a&para;<br>right to apply to a court . . . for relief.”).&para;<br>A plaintiff may not, §1500 instructs, petition both the&para;<br>CFC and a district court, invoking in each a distinct legal&para;<br>theory appropriate to the forum, but seeking redress for a&para;<br>single injury. When Congress bars a plaintiff from obtain&para;<br>ing complete relief in one suit, however, and does not call&para;<br>for an election of remedies, Congress is most sensibly read&para;<br>to have comprehended that the operative facts give rise to&para;<br>two discrete claims. Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl.&para;<br>647 (1956), as JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR spells out, see ante, at&para;<br>5, is the paradigm case. There, a discharged federal em&para;<br>ployee, complaining of wrongful termination, sought rein&para;<br>statement in a district-court action and backpay in the&para;<br>Court of Claims. Section 1500 does not stand in the way,&para;<br>the Court of Claims held in Casman, when the plaintiff&para;<br>suffered two distinct injuries, for which she seeks discrete&para;<br>forms of relief within the exclusive competence of different&para;<br>courts. See 135 Ct. Cl., at 649–650 (claim for backpay&para;<br>“entirely different” from claim for reinstatement). The&para;<br>Federal Circuit, in my view, rightly adhered to Casman in&para;<br>Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545&para;<br>(1994) (en banc), and rightly did so in this case.&para;<br>While I agree with much of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opin&para;<br>ion concurring in the judgment, I do not agree with her&para;<br>conclusion that §1500 bars the Nation’s CFC action.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins the Court’s judgment (although&para;<br>not the Court’s reasoning) because the “Tohono O’odham&para;<br>Nation seeks in the [CFC] . . . some of the same relief on&para;<br>the same facts as it does in its pending District Court&para;<br>action.” Ante, at 1 (emphasis added). But to the extent&para;<br>that “the Nation’s two actions seek overlapping relief,”&para;<br>ibid., a disposition less harsh would be in order. Ordinar&para;<br>ily, when a plaintiff’s allegations and demands for relief&para;<br>are excessive, her complaint is not instantly dismissed on&para;<br>that account. Instead, she may seek leave to trim her&para;<br>pleading, permission a court “should freely give . . . when&para;<br>justice so requires.” Rule 15(a)(2) (CFC 2010). Cf. Rule&para;<br>54(c) (CFC 2010) (judgment, other than default, need not&para;<br>conform to demand for relief, but “should grant the relief&para;<br>to which each party is entitled”).&para;<br>As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and the Nation recognize, to&para;<br>avoid both duplication and the running of the statute of&para;<br>limitations, the CFC suit could be stayed while the com&para;<br>panion District Court action proceeds. See ante, at 11;&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 35. That is a common practice when&para;<br>a prior action is pending. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v.&para;<br>United States, 363 U. S. 202, 204–206 (1960) (instructing&para;<br>Court of Claims to stay pending proceedings to enable&para;<br>litigant to obtain District Court review of relevant agency&para;<br>order); Creppel v.

I see no&para;<br>impediment to either course, in §1500 or any other law or&para;<br>rule.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
