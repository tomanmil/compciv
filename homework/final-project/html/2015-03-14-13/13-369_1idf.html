S. C. §112, ¶2. This case concerns the proper reading of the stat­&para;<br>ute’s clarity and precision demand.&para;<br>Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dis­&para;<br>pute (the ’753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exer­&para;<br>cise equipment. Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were&para;<br>often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying&para;<br>each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the&para;<br>presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals),&para;<br>generated by the user’s skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal&para;<br>detection. The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting&para;<br>and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG inter­&para;<br>ference.&para;<br>Claim 1 of the ’753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to&para;<br>this dispute, refers to a “heart rate monitor for use by a user in asso­&para;<br>ciation with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.” The&para;<br>claim “comprise[s],” among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted&para;<br>with a display device; “electronic circuitry including a difference am­&para;<br>plifier”; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a “live” electrode and&para;<br>a “common” electrode “mounted . . . in spaced relationship with each&para;<br>other.”&para;<br>Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus,&para;<br>Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing&para;<br>Biosig’s patented technology. The District Court, after conducting a&para;<br>hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent’s claims,&para;<br>granted Nautilus’ motion for summary judgment on the ground that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the claim term “in spaced relationship with each other” failed §112,&para;<br>¶2’s definiteness requirement. The Federal Circuit reversed and re­&para;<br>manded, concluding that a patent claim passes the §112, ¶2 thresh­&para;<br>old so long as the claim is “amenable to construction,” and the claim,&para;<br>as construed, is not “insolubly ambiguous.” Under that standard, the&para;<br>court determined, the ’753 patent survived indefiniteness review.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of&para;<br>the patent’s specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with&para;<br>reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the&para;<br>invention. The parties agree that definiteness is to be evaluated from&para;<br>the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, that claims are&para;<br>to be read in light of the patent’s specification and prosecution histo­&para;<br>ry, and that definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the pa­&para;<br>tent application. The parties disagree as to how much imprecision&para;<br>§112, ¶2 tolerates.&para;<br>Section 112’s definiteness requirement must take into account the&para;<br>inherent limitations of language. See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731. On the one hand, some&para;<br>modicum of uncertainty is the “price of ensuring the appropriate in­&para;<br>centives for innovation,” id., at 732; and patents are “not addressed to&para;<br>lawyers, or even to the public generally,” but to those skilled in the&para;<br>relevant art, Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403,&para;<br>437. At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford&para;<br>clear notice of what is claimed, thereby “ ‘appris[ing] the public of&para;<br>what is still open to them,’ ” Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,&para;<br>517 U. S. 370, 373, in a manner that avoids “[a] zone of uncertainty&para;<br>which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of&para;<br>infringement claims,” United Carbon Co. v. Binney &amp; Smith Co., 317&para;<br>U. S. 228, 236. The standard adopted here mandates clarity, while&para;<br>recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable. It also accords&para;<br>with opinions of this Court stating that “the certainty which the law&para;<br>requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard&para;<br>to their subject-matter.” Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, 242 U. S.&para;<br>261, 270. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>2. The Federal Circuit’s standard, which tolerates some ambiguous&para;<br>claims but not others, does not satisfy the statute’s definiteness re­&para;<br>quirement. The Court of Appeals inquired whether the ’753 patent’s&para;<br>claims were “amenable to construction” or “insolubly ambiguous,” but&para;<br>such formulations lack the precision §112, ¶2 demands. To tolerate&para;<br>imprecision just short of that rendering a claim “insolubly ambigu­&para;<br>ous” would diminish the definiteness requirement’s public-notice&para;<br>function and foster the innovation-discouraging “zone of uncertainty,”&para;<br>United Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court has&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>warned. While some of the Federal Circuit’s fuller explications of the&para;<br>term “insolubly ambiguous” may come closer to tracking the statuto­&para;<br>ry prescription, this Court must ensure that the Federal Circuit’s test&para;<br>is at least “probative of the essential inquiry.” Warner-Jenkinson Co.&para;<br>v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17, 40. The expressions “in­&para;<br>solubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction,” which permeate&para;<br>the Federal Circuit’s recent decisions concerning §112, ¶2, fall short&para;<br>in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without&para;<br>a reliable compass. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>3. This Court, as “a court of review, not of first view,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7, follows its ordinary practice of re­&para;<br>manding so that the Federal Circuit can reconsider, under the proper&para;<br>standard, whether the relevant claims in the ’753 patent are suffi­&para;<br>ciently definite, see, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515.&para;<br>Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>715 F. 3d 891, vacated and remanded.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

S. 370, 373 (1996) (“It has long been understood&para;<br>that a patent must describe the exact scope of an inven­&para;<br>tion and its manufacture . . . .”). Thus, when Congress&para;<br>enacted the first Patent Act in 1790, it directed that pa­&para;<br>tent grantees file a written specification “containing a&para;<br>description . . . of the thing or things . . . invented or dis­&para;<br>covered,” which “shall be so particular” as to “distinguish&para;<br>the invention or discovery from other things before known&para;<br>and used.” Act of Apr. 10, 1790, §2, 1 Stat. 110.&para;<br>The patent laws have retained this requirement of&para;<br>definiteness even as the focus of patent construction has&para;<br>shifted. Under early patent practice in the United States,&para;<br>we have recounted, it was the written specification that&para;<br>“represented the key to the patent.” Markman, 517 U. S.,&para;<br>at 379. Eventually, however, patent applicants began to&para;<br>set out the invention’s scope in a separate section known&para;<br>as the “claim.” See generally 1 R. Moy, Walker on Patents&para;<br>§4.2, pp. 4–17 to 4–20 (4th ed. 2012). The Patent Act of&para;<br>1870 expressly conditioned the receipt of a patent on the&para;<br>inventor’s inclusion of one or more such claims, described&para;<br>with particularity and distinctness. See Act of July 8,&para;<br>1870, §26, 16 Stat. 201 (to obtain a patent, the inventor&para;<br>must “particularly point out and distinctly claim the part,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Patent No. 5,337,753 (’753&para;<br>patent), issued to Dr. Gregory Lekhtman in 1994 and&para;<br>assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., concerns&para;<br>a heart-rate monitor for use during exercise. Previous&para;<br>heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccu­&para;<br>rate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying&para;<br>each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals). The&para;<br>inaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different&para;<br>sort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated&para;<br>by an exerciser’s skeletal muscles when, for example, she&para;<br>moves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her&para;<br>hand. These EMG signals can “mask” ECG signals and&para;<br>thereby impede their detection. App. 52, 147.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In&para;<br>&para;<br>the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. 112–29, 125 Stat.&para;<br>284, enacted in 2011, Congress amended several parts of the Patent&para;<br>Act. Those amendments modified §§112 and 282 in minor respects not&para;<br>pertinent here. In any event, the amended versions of those provisions&para;<br>are inapplicable to patent applications filed before September 16, 2012,&para;<br>and proceedings commenced before September 16, 2011.

Here, the application for the patent-in-suit was filed in 1992, and&para;<br>the relevant court proceedings were initiated in 2010. Accordingly, this&para;<br>opinion’s citations to the Patent Act refer to the 2006 edition of the&para;<br>United States Code.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Dr. Lekhtman’s invention claims to improve on prior art&para;<br>by eliminating that impediment. The invention focuses on&para;<br>a key difference between EMG and ECG waveforms: while&para;<br>ECG signals detected from a user’s left hand have a polar­&para;<br>ity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right&para;<br>hand,2 EMG signals from each hand have the same polarity. The patented device works by measuring equalized&para;<br>EMG signals detected at each hand and then using cir­&para;<br>cuitry to subtract the identical EMG signals from each&para;<br>other, thus filtering out the EMG interference.&para;<br>As relevant here, the ’753 patent describes a heart-rate&para;<br>monitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user&para;<br>grips with both hands, such that each hand comes into&para;<br>contact with two electrodes, one “live” and one “common.”&para;<br>The device is illustrated in figure 1 of the patent, id., at&para;<br>41, reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.&para;<br>Claim 1 of the ’753 patent, which contains the limita­&para;<br>tions critical to this dispute, refers to a “heart rate monitor&para;<br>for use by a user in association with exercise apparatus&para;<br>and/or exercise procedures.” Id., at 61. The claim “com­&para;<br>prise[s],” among other elements, an “elongate member”&para;<br>(cylindrical bar) with a display device; “electronic circuitry&para;<br>including a difference amplifier”; and, on each half of the&para;<br>cylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode&para;<br>“mounted . . . in spaced relationship with each other.”&para;<br>Ibid.3 The claim sets forth additional elements, including&para;<br>that the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that&para;<br>each of the user’s hands “contact[s]” both electrodes on&para;<br>each side of the bar. Id., at 62. Further, the EMG signals&para;<br>detected by the two electrode pairs are to be “of substan­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 This difference in polarity occurs because the heart is not aligned&para;<br>vertically in relation to the center of the body; the organ tilts leftward&para;<br>from apex to bottom.

Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The dispute between the parties arose in the 1990’s,&para;<br>when Biosig allegedly disclosed the patented technology to&para;<br>StairMaster Sports Medical Products, Inc. According to&para;<br>Biosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold&para;<br>exercise machines that included Biosig’s patented technol­&para;<br>ogy, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after&para;<br>acquiring the StairMaster brand. In 2004, based on these&para;<br>allegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit&para;<br>against Nautilus in the U. S. District Court for the South­&para;<br>ern District of New York.&para;<br>With Biosig’s lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U. S.&para;<br>Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the ’753&para;<br>patent.&para;<br>The reexamination proceedings centered on&para;<br>whether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious&para;<br>by prior art—principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an&para;<br>inventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a&para;<br>heart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a&para;<br>difference amplifier. Endeavoring to distinguish the ’753&para;<br>patent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from&para;<br>Dr. Lekhtman. The declaration attested, among other&para;<br>things, that the ’753 patent sufficiently informed a person&para;<br>skilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes&para;<br>so as “to produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and&para;<br>right hands.” Id., at 160. Although the electrodes’ design&para;<br>variables—including spacing, shape, size, and material—&para;<br>cannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr.&para;<br>Lekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a&para;<br>“trial and error” process of equalization. This would entail&para;<br>experimentation with different electrode configurations in&para;<br>order to optimize EMG signal cancellation. Id., at 155–&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>156, 158.4 In 2010, the PTO issued a determination con­&para;<br>firming the patentability of the ’753 patent’s claims.&para;<br>Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit,&para;<br>which the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prej­&para;<br>udice while PTO reexamination was underway. In 2011,&para;<br>the District Court conducted a hearing to determine the&para;<br>proper construction of the patent’s claims, see Markman v.&para;<br>Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370 (1996) (claim&para;<br>construction is a matter of law reserved for court decision),&para;<br>including the claim term “in spaced relationship with each&para;<br>other.” According to Biosig, that “spaced relationship”&para;<br>referred to the distance between the live electrode and the&para;<br>common electrode in each electrode pair. Nautilus, seizing&para;<br>on Biosig’s submissions to the PTO during the reexamina­&para;<br>tion, maintained that the “spaced relationship” must be a&para;<br>distance “greater than the width of each electrode.” App.&para;<br>245. The District Court ultimately construed the term to&para;<br>mean “there is a defined relationship between the live&para;<br>electrode and the common electrode on one side of the&para;<br>cylindrical bar and the same or a different defined rela­&para;<br>tionship between the live electrode and the common elec­&para;<br>trode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,” without any&para;<br>reference to the electrodes’ width. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>43a–44a.&para;<br>Nautilus moved for summary judgment, arguing that&para;<br>the term “spaced relationship,” as construed, was indefi­&para;<br>nite under §112, ¶2. The District Court granted the mo­&para;<br>tion. Those words, the District Court concluded, “did not&para;<br>tell [the court] or anyone what precisely the space should&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Dr. Lekhtman’s declaration also referred to an expert report pre­&para;<br>pared by Dr. Henrietta Galiana, Chair of the Department of Biomedical&para;<br>Engineering at McGill University, for use in the infringement litiga­&para;<br>tion. That report described how Dr. Galiana’s laboratory technician,&para;<br>equipped with a wooden dowel, wire, metal foil, glue, electrical tape,&para;<br>and the drawings from the ’753 patent, was able in two hours to build a&para;<br>monitor that “worked just as described in the . . . patent.” Id., at 226.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Id., at 72a.&para;<br>The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded. A claim is&para;<br>indefinite, the majority opinion stated, “only when it is&para;<br>‘not amenable to construction’ or ‘insolubly ambiguous.’ ”&para;<br>715 F. 3d 891, 898 (2013) (quoting Datamize, LLC v.&para;<br>Plumtree Software, Inc., 417 F. 3d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed.&para;<br>2005)). Under that standard, the majority determined, the&para;<br>’753 patent survived indefiniteness review. Considering&para;<br>first the “intrinsic evidence”—i.e., the claim language, the&para;<br>specification, and the prosecution history—the majority&para;<br>discerned “certain inherent parameters of the claimed&para;<br>apparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to&para;<br>understand the metes and bounds of ‘spaced relation­&para;<br>ship.’ ” 715 F. 3d, at 899. These sources of meaning, the&para;<br>majority explained, make plain that the distance separat­&para;<br>ing the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar&para;<br>“cannot be greater than the width of a user’s hands”; that&para;<br>is so “because claim 1 requires the live and common elec­&para;<br>trodes to independently detect electrical signals at two&para;<br>distinct points of a hand.” Ibid. Furthermore, the major­&para;<br>ity noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance&para;<br>cannot be “infinitesimally small, effectively merging the&para;<br>live and common electrodes into a single electrode with&para;<br>one detection point.” Ibid. The claim’s functional provi­&para;<br>sions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional&para;<br>light on the meaning of “spaced relationship.” Surveying&para;<br>the record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority&para;<br>concluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could&para;<br>attain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing&para;<br>EMG signals by adjusting design variables, including&para;<br>spacing.&para;<br>In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the ma­&para;<br>jority’s result employing “a more limited analysis.” Id., at&para;<br>905. Judge Schall accepted the majority’s recitation of the&para;<br>definiteness standard, under which claims amenable to&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>construction are nonetheless indefinite when “the con­&para;<br>struction remains insolubly ambiguous.” Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). The District Court’s construc­&para;<br>tion of “spaced relationship,” Judge Schall maintained,&para;<br>was sufficiently clear: the term means “there is a fixed&para;<br>spatial relationship between the live electrode and the&para;<br>common electrode” on each side of the cylindrical bar.&para;<br>Ibid. Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the&para;<br>intrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.&para;<br>But, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not “presum[e]&para;<br>a functional linkage between the ‘spaced relationship’&para;<br>limitation and the removal of EMG signals.” Id., at 906.&para;<br>Other limitations of the claim, in his view, and not the&para;<br>“ ‘spaced relationship’ limitation itself,” “included a func­&para;<br>tional requirement to remove EMG signals.” Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 571 U.

First, definiteness is to be evaluated&para;<br>from the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art.&para;<br>See, e.g., General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304&para;<br>U. S. 364, 371 (1938). See also §112, ¶1 (patent’s specifi­&para;<br>cation “shall contain a written description of the invention,&para;<br>and of the manner and process of making and using it, in&para;<br>such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any&para;<br>person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which&para;<br>it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same”&para;<br>(emphasis added)). Second, in assessing definiteness,&para;<br>claims are to be read in light of the patent’s specification&para;<br>and prosecution history. See, e.g., United States v. Adams,&para;<br>383 U.

It cannot be&para;<br>sufficient that a court can ascribe some meaning to a&para;<br>patent’s claims; the definiteness inquiry trains on the&para;<br>understanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the pa­&para;<br>tent application, not that of a court viewing matters&para;<br>post hoc. To tolerate imprecision just short of that render­&para;<br>ing a claim “insolubly ambiguous” would diminish the&para;<br>definiteness requirement’s public-notice function and&para;<br>foster the innovation-discouraging “zone of uncertainty,”&para;<br>United Carbon, 317 U.

The Federal&para;<br>Circuit’s fuller explications of the term “insolubly ambigu­&para;<br>ous,” we recognize, may come closer to tracking the statu­&para;<br>tory prescription. See, e.g., 715 F. 3d, at 898 (case below)&para;<br>(“[I]f reasonable efforts at claim construction result in a&para;<br>definition that does not provide sufficient particularity&para;<br>and clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the&para;<br>claim, the claim is insolubly ambiguous and invalid for&para;<br>indefiniteness.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). But&para;<br>although this Court does not “micromanag[e] the Federal&para;<br>Circuit’s particular word choice” in applying patent-law&para;<br>doctrines, we must ensure that the Federal Circuit’s test is&para;<br>at least “probative of the essential inquiry.” WarnerJenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17,&para;<br>40 (1997). Falling short in that regard, the expressions&para;<br>“insolubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction”&para;<br>permeate the Federal Circuit’s recent decisions concerning&para;<br>§112, ¶2’s requirement.9 We agree with Nautilus and its&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ambiguity’ required to invalidate the claim”).&para;<br>9 E.g., Hearing Components, Inc. v.

As the parties&para;<br>appear to agree, however, this presumption of validity does not alter&para;<br>the degree of clarity that §112, ¶2 demands from patent applicants; to&para;<br>the contrary, it incorporates that definiteness requirement by refer­&para;<br>ence. See §282, ¶2(3) (defenses to infringement actions include&para;<br>“[i]nvalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with&para;<br>. . . any requirement of [§112]”).&para;<br>The parties nonetheless dispute whether factual findings subsidiary&para;<br>to the ultimate issue of definiteness trigger the clear-and-convincing­&para;<br>evidence standard and, relatedly, whether deference is due to the PTO’s&para;<br>resolution of disputed issues of fact. We leave these questions for&para;<br>another day. The court below treated definiteness as “a legal issue&para;<br>[the] court reviews without deference,” 715 F. 3d, at 897, and Biosig has&para;<br>not called our attention to any contested factual matter—or PTO&para;<br>determination thereof—pertinent to its infringement claims.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>NAUTILUS, INC. v.
