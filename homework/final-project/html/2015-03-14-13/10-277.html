DUKES ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–277.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 29, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents, current or former employees of petitioner Wal-Mart,&para;<br>sought judgment against the company for injunctive and declaratory&para;<br>relief, punitive damages, and backpay, on behalf of themselves and a&para;<br>nationwide class of some 1.5 million female employees, because of&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s alleged discrimination against women in violation of Title&para;<br>VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They claim that local managers&para;<br>exercise their discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately&para;<br>in favor of men, which has an unlawful disparate impact on female&para;<br>employees; and that Wal-Mart’s refusal to cabin its managers’ au&para;<br>thority amounts to disparate treatment. The District Court certified&para;<br>the class, finding that respondents satisfied Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 23(a), and Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement of showing that “the&para;<br>party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that&para;<br>apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corre&para;<br>sponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a&para;<br>whole.” The Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed, concluding, inter&para;<br>alia, that respondents met Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement&para;<br>and that their backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2)&para;<br>class because those claims did not predominate over the declaratory&para;<br>and injunctive relief requests. It also ruled that the class action&para;<br>could be manageably tried without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to&para;<br>present its statutory defenses if the District Court selected a random&para;<br>set of claims for valuation and then extrapolated the validity and&para;<br>value of the untested claims from the sample set.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with&para;<br>Rule 23(a). Pp. 8–20.&para;<br>(a) Rule 23(a)(2) requires a party seeking class certification to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>prove that the class has common “questions of law or fact.” Their&para;<br>claims must depend upon a common contention of such a nature that&para;<br>it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determina&para;<br>tion of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the&para;<br>validity of each one of the claims in one stroke. Here, proof of com&para;<br>monality necessarily overlaps with respondents’ merits contention&para;<br>that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.&para;<br>The crux of a Title VII inquiry is “the reason for a particular em&para;<br>ployment decision,” Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467&para;<br>U. S. 867, 876, and respondents wish to sue for millions of employ&para;<br>ment decisions at once. Without some glue holding together the al&para;<br>leged reasons for those decisions, it will be impossible to say that ex&para;<br>amination of all the class members’ claims will produce a common&para;<br>answer to the crucial discrimination question. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(b) General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147,&para;<br>describes the proper approach to commonality. On the facts of this&para;<br>case, the conceptual gap between an individual’s discrimination claim&para;<br>and “the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same&para;<br>injury,” id., at 157–158, must be bridged by “[s]ignificant proof that&para;<br>an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination,” id.,&para;<br>at 159, n. 15. Such proof is absent here. Wal-Mart’s announced pol&para;<br>icy forbids sex discrimination, and the company has penalties for de&para;<br>nials of equal opportunity. Respondents’ only evidence of a general&para;<br>discrimination policy was a sociologist’s analysis asserting that WalMart’s corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias. But be&para;<br>cause he could not estimate what percent of Wal-Mart employment&para;<br>decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking, his testi&para;<br>mony was worlds away from “significant proof” that Wal-Mart “oper&para;<br>ated under a general policy of discrimination.” Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>(c) The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’ evidence convinc&para;<br>ingly establishes is Wal-Mart’s “policy” of giving local supervisors&para;<br>discretion over employment matters. While such a policy could be&para;<br>the basis of a Title VII disparate-impact claim, recognizing that a&para;<br>claim “can” exist does not mean that every employee in a company&para;<br>with that policy has a common claim. In a company of Wal-Mart’s&para;<br>size and geographical scope, it is unlikely that all managers would&para;<br>exercise their discretion in a common way without some common di&para;<br>rection. Respondents’ attempt to show such direction by means of&para;<br>statistical and anecdotal evidence falls well short. Pp. 14–20.&para;<br>2. Respondents’ backpay claims were improperly certified under&para;<br>Rule 23(b)(2). Pp. 20–27.&para;<br>(a) Claims for monetary relief may not be certified under Rule&para;<br>23(b)(2), at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the&para;<br>requested injunctive or declaratory relief. It is unnecessary to decide&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>whether monetary claims can ever be certified under the Rule be&para;<br>cause, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief, like backpay,&para;<br>are excluded. Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single, indivisible&para;<br>remedy would provide relief to each class member. The Rule’s his&para;<br>tory and structure indicate that individualized monetary claims be&para;<br>long instead in Rule 23(b)(3), with its procedural protections of pre&para;<br>dominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out.&para;<br>Pp. 20–23.&para;<br>(b) Respondents nonetheless argue that their backpay claims&para;<br>were appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims&para;<br>do not “predominate” over their injunctive and declaratory relief re&para;<br>quests. That interpretation has no basis in the Rule’s text and does&para;<br>obvious violence to the Rule’s structural features. The mere “pre&para;<br>dominance” of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify&para;<br>eliminating Rule 23(b)(3)’s procedural protections, and creates incen&para;<br>tives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid mone&para;<br>tary relief claims. Moreover, a district court would have to reevalu&para;<br>ate the roster of class members continuously to excise those who&para;<br>leave their employment and become ineligible for classwide injunc&para;<br>tive or declaratory relief. By contrast, in a properly certified (b)(3)&para;<br>class action for backpay, it would be irrelevant whether the plaintiffs&para;<br>are still employed at Wal-Mart. It follows that backpay claims&para;<br>should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). Pp. 23–26.&para;<br>(c) It is unnecessary to decide whether there are any forms of “in&para;<br>cidental” monetary relief that are consistent with the above interpre&para;<br>tation of Rule 23(b)(2) and the Due Process Clause because respon&para;<br>dents’ backpay claims are not incidental to their requested&para;<br>injunction. Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of&para;<br>each employee’s eligibility for backpay. Once a plaintiff establishes a&para;<br>pattern or practice of discrimination, a district court must usually&para;<br>conduct “additional proceedings . . . to determine the scope of indi&para;<br>vidual relief.” Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 361. The&para;<br>company can then raise individual affirmative defenses and demon&para;<br>strate that its action was lawful. Id., at 362. The Ninth Circuit erred&para;<br>in trying to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. Because&para;<br>Rule 23 cannot be interpreted to “abridge, enlarge or modify any sub&para;<br>stantive right,” 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), a class cannot be certified on the&para;<br>premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory de&para;<br>fenses to individual claims. Pp. 26–27.&para;<br>603 F. 3d 571, reversed.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals&para;<br>approved the certification of a class comprising about one&para;<br>and a half million plaintiffs, current and former female&para;<br>employees of petitioner Wal-Mart who allege that the&para;<br>discretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay&para;<br>and promotion matters violates Title VII by discriminat&para;<br>ing against women. In addition to injunctive and declara&para;<br>tory relief, the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay. We&para;<br>consider whether the certification of the plaintiff class&para;<br>was consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)&para;<br>and (b)(2).&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Wal-Mart is the Nation’s largest private&para;<br>employer. It operates four types of retail stores through&para;<br>out the country: Discount Stores, Supercenters, Neighbor&para;<br>hood Markets, and Sam’s Clubs. Those stores are divided&para;<br>into seven nationwide divisions, which in turn comprise 41&para;<br>regions of 80 to 85 stores apiece. Each store has between&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff posi&para;<br>tions. In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400&para;<br>stores and employs more than one million people.&para;<br>Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally&para;<br>committed to local managers’ broad discretion, which is&para;<br>exercised “in a largely subjective manner.” 222 F. R. D.&para;<br>137, 145 (ND Cal. 2004). Local store managers may in&para;<br>crease the wages of hourly employees (within limits) with&para;<br>only limited corporate oversight. As for salaried employ&para;<br>ees, such as store managers and their deputies, higher&para;<br>corporate authorities have discretion to set their pay with&para;<br>in preestablished ranges.&para;<br>Promotions work in a similar fashion. Wal-Mart per&para;<br>mits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria&para;<br>when selecting candidates as “support managers,” which is&para;<br>the first step on the path to management. Admission to&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s management training program, however, does&para;<br>require that a candidate meet certain objective criteria,&para;<br>including an above-average performance rating, at least&para;<br>one year’s tenure in the applicant’s current position, and a&para;<br>willingness to relocate. But except for those requirements,&para;<br>regional and district managers have discretion to use their&para;<br>own judgment when selecting candidates for management&para;<br>training. Promotion to higher office—e.g., assistant man&para;<br>ager, co-manager, or store manager—is similarly at the&para;<br>discretion of the employee’s superiors after prescribed&para;<br>objective factors are satisfied.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit, representing the&para;<br>1.5 million members of the certified class, are three cur&para;<br>rent or former Wal-Mart employees who allege that the&para;<br>company discriminated against them on the basis of their&para;<br>sex by denying them equal pay or promotions, in violation&para;<br>of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Dukes also claims two male greeters in the Pitts&para;<br>burg store are paid more than she is.&para;<br>Christine Kwapnoski has worked at Sam’s Club stores&para;<br>in Missouri and California for most of her adult life. She&para;<br>has held a number of positions, including a supervisory&para;<br>position. She claims that a male manager yelled at her&para;<br>frequently and screamed at female employees, but not at&para;<br>men. The manager in question “told her to ‘doll up,’ to&para;<br>wear some makeup, and to dress a little better.” App.&para;<br>1003a.&para;<br>The final named plaintiff, Edith Arana, worked at a&para;<br>Wal-Mart store in Duarte, California, from 1995 to 2001.&para;<br>In 2000, she approached the store manager on more than&para;<br>one occasion about management training, but was brushed&para;<br>off. Arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for&para;<br>advancement because of her sex. She initiated internal&para;<br>complaint procedures, whereupon she was told to apply&para;<br>directly to the district manager if she thought her store&para;<br>manager was being unfair. Arana, however, decided&para;<br>against that and never applied for management training&para;<br>again. In 2001, she was fired for failure to comply with&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s timekeeping policy.&para;<br>These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The complaint included seven named plaintiffs, but only three re&para;<br>main part of the certified class as narrowed by the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Wal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the&para;<br>advancement of women. Rather, they claim that their&para;<br>local managers’ discretion over pay and promotions is&para;<br>exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an&para;<br>unlawful disparate impact on female employees, see 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000e–2(k). And, respondents say, because WalMart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its manag&para;<br>ers’ authority amounts to disparate treatment, see&para;<br>§2000e–2(a). Their complaint seeks injunctive and de&para;<br>claratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay. It does&para;<br>not ask for compensatory damages.&para;<br>Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that&para;<br>the discrimination to which they have been subjected is&para;<br>common to all Wal-Mart’s female employees. The basic&para;<br>theory of their case is that a strong and uniform “corporate&para;<br>culture” permits bias against women to infect, perhaps&para;<br>subconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of each&para;<br>one of Wal-Mart’s thousands of managers—thereby mak&para;<br>ing every woman at the company the victim of one com&para;<br>mon discriminatory practice. Respondents therefore wish&para;<br>to litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s stores in a nationwide class action.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 23. Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certifi&para;<br>cation must demonstrate, first, that:&para;<br>“(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,&para;<br>“(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the&para;<br>class,&para;<br>“(3) the claims or defenses of the representative par&para;<br>ties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,&para;<br>and&para;<br>“(4) the representative parties will fairly and ade&para;<br>quately protect the interests of the class” (paragraph&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>breaks added).&para;<br>Second, the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the&para;<br>three requirements listed in Rule 23(b). Respondents rely&para;<br>on Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when “the party opposing&para;<br>the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply&para;<br>generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or&para;<br>corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting&para;<br>the class as a whole.”2&para;<br>Invoking these provisions, respondents moved the Dis&para;<br>trict Court to certify a plaintiff class consisting of “ ‘[a]ll&para;<br>women employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store&para;<br>at any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or&para;<br>may be subjected to Wal-Mart’s challenged pay and man&para;<br>agement track promotions policies and practices.’ ” 222&para;<br>F. R. D., at 141–142 (quoting Plaintiff ’s Motion for Class&para;<br>Certification in case No. 3:01–cv–02252–CRB (ND Cal.),&para;<br>Doc. 99, p. 37). As evidence that there were indeed “ques&para;<br>tions of law or fact common to” all the women of Wal-Mart,&para;<br>as Rule 23(a)(2) requires, respondents relied chiefly on&para;<br>three forms of proof: statistical evidence about pay and&para;<br>promotion disparities between men and women at the&para;<br>company, anecdotal reports of discrimination from about&para;<br>120 of Wal-Mart’s female employees, and the testimony of&para;<br>a sociologist, Dr. William Bielby, who conducted a “social&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Rule 23(b)(1) allows a class to be maintained where “prosecuting&para;<br>separate actions by or against individual class members would create a&para;<br>risk of ” either “(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications,” or “(B)&para;<br>adjudications . . . that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the&para;<br>interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudica&para;<br>tions or would substantially impair or impeded their ability to protect&para;<br>their interests.” Rule 23(b)(3) states that a class may be maintained&para;<br>where “questions of law or fact common to class members predominate&para;<br>over any questions affecting only individual members,” and a class&para;<br>action would be “superior to other available methods for fairly and&para;<br>efficiently adjudicating the controversy.” The applicability of these&para;<br>provisions to the plaintiff class is not before us.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v.

It also offered its own countervailing statistical&para;<br>and other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)’s require&para;<br>ments of commonality, typicality, and adequate represen&para;<br>tation. Wal-Mart further contended that respondents’&para;<br>monetary claims for backpay could not be certified under&para;<br>Rule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunc&para;<br>tive and declaratory relief, and second because the back&para;<br>pay claims could not be manageably tried as a class with&para;<br>out depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present certain&para;<br>statutory defenses. With one limitation not relevant here,&para;<br>the District Court granted respondents’ motion and certi&para;<br>fied their proposed class.3&para;<br>D&para;<br>A divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially af&para;<br>firmed the District Court’s certification order. 603 F. 3d&para;<br>571. The majority concluded that respondents’ evidence of&para;<br>commonality was sufficient to “raise the common question&para;<br>whether Wal-Mart’s female employees nationwide were&para;<br>subjected to a single set of corporate policies (not merely a&para;<br>number of independent discriminatory acts) that may&para;<br>have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in&para;<br>violation of Title VII.” Id., at 612 (emphasis deleted). It&para;<br>also agreed with the District Court that the named plain&para;<br>tiffs’ claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The District Court excluded backpay claims based on promotion&para;<br>opportunities that had not been publicly posted, for the reason that no&para;<br>applicant data could exist for such positions. 222 F. R. D. 137, 182 (ND&para;<br>Cal. 2004). It also decided to afford class members notice of the ac&para;<br>tion and the right to opt-out of the class with respect to respondents’&para;<br>punitive-damages claim.

Id., at 614–&para;<br>615. With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) question, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit held that respondents’ backpay claims could be&para;<br>certified as part of a (b)(2) class because they did not&para;<br>“predominat[e]” over the requests for declaratory and&para;<br>injunctive relief, meaning they were not “superior in&para;<br>strength, influence, or authority” to the nonmonetary&para;<br>claims. Id., at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted).4&para;<br>Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that the action&para;<br>could be manageably tried as a class action because the&para;<br>District Court could adopt the approach the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>approved in Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F. 3d 767, 782–&para;<br>787 (1996). There compensatory damages for some 9,541&para;<br>class members were calculated by selecting 137 claims at&para;<br>random, referring those claims to a special master for&para;<br>valuation, and then extrapolating the validity and value of&para;<br>the untested claims from the sample set. See 603 F. 3d, at&para;<br>625–626. The Court of Appeals “s[aw] no reason why a&para;<br>similar procedure to that used in Hilao could not be em&para;<br>ployed in this case.” Id., at 627. It would allow Wal-Mart&para;<br>“to present individual defenses in the randomly selected&para;<br>‘sample cases,’ thus revealing the approximate percentage&para;<br>of class members whose unequal pay or nonpromotion was&para;<br>due to something other than gender discrimination.”&para;<br>Ibid., n. 56 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 To&para;<br>&para;<br>enable that result, the Court of Appeals trimmed the (b)(2) class&para;<br>in two ways: First, it remanded that part of the certification order&para;<br>which included respondents’ punitive-damages claim in the (b)(2) class,&para;<br>so that the District Court might consider whether that might cause the&para;<br>monetary relief to predominate. 603 F. 3d, at 621. Second, it accepted&para;<br>in part Wal-Mart’s argument that since class members whom it no&para;<br>longer employed had no standing to seek injunctive or declaratory&para;<br>relief, as to them monetary claims must predominate. It excluded from&para;<br>the certified class “those putative class members who were no longer&para;<br>Wal-Mart employees at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed,” id., at&para;<br>623 (emphasis added).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v.

Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,&para;<br>700–701 (1979).

But the problem dissipates if the&para;<br>plaintiffs can establish the applicability of the so-called “fraud on the&para;<br>market” presumption, which says that all traders who purchase stock&para;<br>in an efficient market are presumed to have relied on the accuracy of a&para;<br>company’s public statements. To invoke this presumption, the plain&para;<br>tiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certification must prove that their shares were&para;<br>traded on an efficient market, Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton&para;<br>Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5), an issue they will surely&para;<br>have to prove again at trial in order to make out their case on the&para;<br>merits.&para;<br>7 In a pattern-or-practice case, the plaintiff tries to “establish by a&para;<br>preponderance of the evidence that . . . discrimination was the com&para;<br>pany’s standard operating procedure[,] the regular rather than the&para;<br>unusual practice.” Teamsters v.

If he succeeds, that showing will support a rebuttable inference&para;<br>that all class members were victims of the discriminatory practice, and&para;<br>will justify “an award of prospective relief,” such as “an injunctive order&para;<br>against the continuation of the discriminatory practice.” Teamsters,&para;<br>supra, at 361.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v.

S., at 152. We&para;<br>rejected that composite class for lack of commonality and&para;<br>typicality, explaining:&para;<br>“Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an in&para;<br>dividual’s claim that he has been denied a promotion&para;<br>[or higher pay] on discriminatory grounds, and his&para;<br>otherwise unsupported allegation that the company&para;<br>has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of&para;<br>a class of persons who have suffered the same injury&para;<br>as that individual, such that the individual’s claim&para;<br>and the class claim will share common questions of&para;<br>law or fact and that the individual’s claim will be typi&para;<br>cal of the class claims.” Id., at 157–158.&para;<br>Falcon suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap&para;<br>might be bridged. First, if the employer “used a biased&para;<br>testing procedure to evaluate both applicants for employ&para;<br>ment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of&para;<br>every applicant or employee who might have been preju&para;<br>diced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality&para;<br>and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).” Id., at 159,&para;<br>n. 15. Second, “[s]ignificant proof that an employer oper&para;<br>ated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

We think that statement precisely describes respon&para;<br>dents’ burden in this case. The first manner of bridging&para;<br>the gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has&para;<br>no testing procedure or other companywide evaluation&para;<br>method that can be charged with bias. The whole point of&para;<br>permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evalu&para;<br>ating employees under a common standard.&para;<br>The second manner of bridging the gap requires “signifi&para;<br>cant proof ” that Wal-Mart “operated under a general&para;<br>policy of discrimination.” That is entirely absent here.&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s announced policy forbids sex discrimination,&para;<br>see App. 1567a–1596a, and as the District Court recog&para;<br>nized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal&para;<br>employment opportunity, 222 F. R. D., at 154. The only&para;<br>evidence of a “general policy of discrimination” respon&para;<br>dents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby,&para;<br>their sociological expert. Relying on “social framework”&para;<br>analysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a “strong&para;<br>corporate culture,” that makes it “ ‘vulnerable’ ” to “gender&para;<br>bias.” Id., at 152. He could not, however, “determine with&para;<br>any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaning&para;<br>ful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his&para;<br>deposition . . . Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calcu&para;<br>late whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment&para;<br>decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped&para;<br>thinking.” 222 F. R. D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004). The&para;<br>parties dispute whether Bielby’s testimony even met the&para;<br>standards for the admission of expert testimony under&para;<br>Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and our Daubert case,&para;<br>see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U.

D., at 191.&para;<br>We doubt that is so, but even if properly considered,&para;<br>Bielby’s testimony does nothing to advance respondents’&para;<br>case. “[W]hether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employ&para;<br>ment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by&para;<br>stereotyped thinking” is the essential question on which&para;<br>respondents’ theory of commonality depends. If Bielby&para;<br>admittedly has no answer to that question, we can safely&para;<br>disregard what he has to say.

It is also a very common&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Bielby’s conclusions in this case have elicited criticism from the very&para;<br>scholars on whose conclusions he relies for his social-framework analy&para;<br>sis.

Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,&para;<br>487 U. S. 977, 990 (1988).&para;<br>To be sure, we have recognized that, “in appropriate&para;<br>cases,” giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be&para;<br>the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact&para;<br>theory—since “an employer’s undisciplined system of&para;<br>subjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same&para;<br>effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional&para;<br>discrimination.” Id., at 990–991. But the recognition that&para;<br>this type of Title VII claim “can” exist does not lead to&para;<br>the conclusion that every employee in a company using a&para;<br>system of discretion has such a claim in common. To the&para;<br>contrary, left to their own devices most managers in any&para;<br>corporation—and surely most managers in a corporation&para;<br>that forbids sex discrimination—would select sex-neutral,&para;<br>performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that&para;<br>produce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to&para;<br>reward various attributes that produce disparate impact—&para;<br>such as scores on general aptitude tests or educational&para;<br>achievements, see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S.&para;<br>424, 431–432 (1971). And still other managers may be&para;<br>guilty of intentional discrimination that produces a sex&para;<br>based disparity. In such a company, demonstrating the&para;<br>invalidity of one manager’s use of discretion will do noth&para;<br>ing to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s. A party&para;<br>seeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to&para;<br>show that all the employees’ Title VII claims will in fact&para;<br>depend on the answers to common questions.&para;<br>Respondents have not identified a common mode of exer&para;<br>cising discretion that pervades the entire company—aside&para;<br>from their reliance on Dr. Bielby’s social frameworks analy&para;<br>sis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart’s size&para;<br>and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all&para;<br>managers would exercise their discretion in a common way&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>without some common direction. Respondents attempt to&para;<br>make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal&para;<br>evidence, but their evidence falls well short.&para;<br>The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression&para;<br>analyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician,&para;<br>and Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist. Drogin con&para;<br>ducted his analysis region-by-region, comparing the num&para;<br>ber of women promoted into management positions with&para;<br>the percentage of women in the available pool of hourly&para;<br>workers. After considering regional and national data,&para;<br>Drogin concluded that “there are statistically significant&para;<br>disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart . . .&para;<br>[and] these disparities . . . can be explained only by gender&para;<br>discrimination.” 603 F. 3d, at 604 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Bendick compared work-force data from&para;<br>Wal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that&para;<br>Wal-Mart “promotes a lower percentage of women than its&para;<br>competitors.” Ibid.&para;<br>Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are&para;<br>insufficient to establish that respondents’ theory can be&para;<br>proved on a classwide basis. In Falcon, we held that one&para;<br>named plaintiff ’s experience of discrimination was insuffi&para;<br>cient to infer that “discriminatory treatment is typical of&para;<br>[the employer’s employment] practices.” 457 U. S., at 158.&para;<br>A similar failure of inference arises here. As Judge Ikuta&para;<br>observed in her dissent, “[i]nformation about disparities at&para;<br>the regional and national level does not establish the&para;<br>existence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise&para;<br>the inference that a company-wide policy of discrimination&para;<br>is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and&para;<br>district level.” 603 F. 3d, at 637. A regional pay disparity,&para;<br>for example, may be attributable to only a small set of&para;<br>Wal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uni&para;<br>form, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs’&para;<br>theory of commonality depends.&para;<br>There is another, more fundamental, respect in which&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>respondents’ statistical proof fails. Even if it established&para;<br>(as it does not) a pay or promotion pattern that differs&para;<br>from the nationwide figures or the regional figures in all of&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s 3,400 stores, that would still not demonstrate&para;<br>that commonality of issue exists. Some managers will&para;<br>claim that the availability of women, or qualified women,&para;<br>or interested women, in their stores’ area does not mirror&para;<br>the national or regional statistics. And almost all of them&para;<br>will claim to have been applying some sex-neutral,&para;<br>performance-based criteria—whose nature and effects&para;<br>will differ from store to store. In the landmark case of&para;<br>ours which held that giving discretion to lower-level su&para;<br>pervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a&para;<br>disparate-impact theory, the plurality opinion conditioned&para;<br>that holding on the corollary that merely proving that the&para;<br>discretionary system has produced a racial or sexual&para;<br>disparity is not enough. “[T]he plaintiff must begin by&para;<br>identifying the specific employment practice that is chal&para;<br>lenged.” Watson, 487 U. S., at 994; accord, Wards Cove&para;<br>Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 656 (1989) (approv&para;<br>ing that statement), superseded by statute on other&para;<br>grounds, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k). That is all the more&para;<br>necessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certi&para;<br>fied. Other than the bare existence of delegated discre&para;<br>tion, respondents have identified no “specific employment&para;<br>practice”—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million&para;<br>claims together. Merely showing that Wal-Mart’s policy of&para;<br>discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity&para;<br>does not suffice.&para;<br>Respondents’ anecdotal evidence suffers from the same&para;<br>defects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference&para;<br>that all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions&para;<br>are discriminatory. In Teamsters v. United States, 431&para;<br>U. S. 324 (1977), in addition to substantial statistical&para;<br>evidence of company-wide discrimination, the Government&para;<br>(as plaintiff) produced about 40 specific accounts of racial&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>discrimination from particular individuals. See id., at&para;<br>338. That number was significant because the company&para;<br>involved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were&para;<br>minorities, id., at 337, and the class itself consisted of&para;<br>around 334 persons, United States v. T.I.M.E.-D. C., Inc.,&para;<br>517 F. 2d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), overruled on other&para;<br>grounds, Teamsters, supra. The 40 anecdotes thus repre&para;<br>sented roughly one account for every eight members of&para;<br>the class. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the&para;<br>anecdotes came from individuals “spread throughout” the&para;<br>company who “for the most part” worked at the company’s&para;<br>operational centers that employed the largest numbers of&para;<br>the class members. 517 F. 2d, at 315, and n. 30. Here, by&para;<br>contrast, respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting&para;<br>experiences of discrimination—about 1 for every 12,500&para;<br>class members—relating to only some 235 out of WalMart’s 3,400 stores. 603 F. 3d, at 634 (Ikuta, J., dissent&para;<br>ing). More than half of these reports are concentrated in&para;<br>only six States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri,&para;<br>Texas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or&para;<br>two anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about&para;<br>Wal-Mart’s operations at all. Id., at 634–635, and n. 10.&para;<br>Even if every single one of these accounts is true, that&para;<br>would not demonstrate that the entire company “oper&para;<br>ate[s] under a general policy of discrimination,” Falcon,&para;<br>supra, at 159, n. 15, which is what respondents must show&para;<br>to certify a companywide class.9&para;<br>The dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent says that we have adopted “a rule that a discrimination&para;<br>claim, if accompanied by anecdotes, must supply them in numbers&para;<br>proportionate to the size of the class.” Post, at 5, n. 4 (GINSBURG, J.,&para;<br>concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is not quite accurate.&para;<br>A discrimination claimant is free to supply as few anecdotes as he&para;<br>wishes.

DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 652 (dissenting opinion).&para;<br>III&para;<br>We also conclude that respondents’ claims for backpay&para;<br>were improperly certified under Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 23(b)(2). Our opinion in Ticor Title Ins. Co. v.&para;<br>Brown, 511 U. S. 117, 121 (1994) (per curiam) expressed&para;<br>serious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief&para;<br>may be certified under that provision. We now hold that&para;<br>they may not, at least where (as here) the monetary relief&para;<br>is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party&para;<br>opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds&para;<br>that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive&para;<br>relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate&para;<br>respecting the class as a whole.” One possible reading of&para;<br>this provision is that it applies only to requests for such&para;<br>injunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the&para;<br>class certification of monetary claims at all. We need not&para;<br>reach that broader question in this case, because we think&para;<br>that, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like&para;<br>the backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. The&para;<br>key to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the&para;<br>injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion&para;<br>that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared&para;<br>unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none&para;<br>of them.” Nagareda, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 132. In other&para;<br>words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction&para;<br>or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each&para;<br>member of the class. It does not authorize class certifica&para;<br>tion when each individual class member would be entitled&para;<br>to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against&para;<br>the defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certi&para;<br>fication when each class member would be entitled to an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>individualized award of monetary damages.&para;<br>That interpretation accords with the history of the Rule.&para;<br>Because Rule 23 “stems from equity practice” that pre&para;<br>dated its codification, Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor,&para;<br>521 U. S. 591, 613 (1997), in determining its meaning we&para;<br>have previously looked to the historical models on which&para;<br>the Rule was based, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.&para;<br>815, 841–845 (1999). As we observed in Amchem, “[c]ivil&para;<br>rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class&para;<br>based discrimination are prime examples” of what (b)(2) is&para;<br>meant to capture. 521 U. S., at 614. In particular, the&para;<br>Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to&para;<br>racial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single&para;<br>classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory&para;<br>Committee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the&para;<br>plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with&para;<br>their classwide injunction. See Advisory Committee’s&para;<br>Note, 39 F. R. D. 69, 102 (1966) (citing cases); e.g., Potts v.&para;<br>Flax, 313 F. 2d 284, 289, n. 5 (CA5 1963); Brunson v.&para;<br>Board of Trustees of Univ. of School Dist. No. 1, Clarendon&para;<br>Cty., 311 F. 2d 107, 109 (CA4 1962) (per curiam); Frasier&para;<br>v. Board of Trustees of N.C., 134 F. Supp. 589, 593 (NC&para;<br>1955) (three-judge court), aff’d, 350 U. S. 979 (1956).&para;<br>Permitting the combination of individualized and class&para;<br>wide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the&para;<br>structure of Rule 23(b). Classes certified under (b)(1) and&para;<br>(b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class&para;<br>treatment—that individual adjudications would be impos&para;<br>sible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class,11 or that the relief&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Rule 23(b)(1) applies where separate actions by or against individ&para;<br>ual class members would create a risk of “establish[ing] incompatible&para;<br>standards of conduct for the party opposing the class,” Rule 23(b)(1)(A),&para;<br>such as “where the party is obliged by law to treat the members of the&para;<br>class alike,” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 614&para;<br>(1997), or where individual adjudications “as a practical matter, would&para;<br>be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sought must perforce affect the entire class at once, as in a&para;<br>(b)(2) class. For that reason these are also mandatory&para;<br>classes: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or&para;<br>(b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige&para;<br>the District Court to afford them notice of the action. Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3), by contrast, is an “adventuresome innovation” of&para;<br>the 1966 amendments, Amchem, 521 U. S., at 614 (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted), framed for situations “in&para;<br>which ‘class-action treatment is not as clearly called for’,”&para;<br>id., at 615 (quoting Advisory Committee’s Notes, 28&para;<br>U. S. C. App., p. 697 (1994 ed.)). It allows class certifica&para;<br>tion in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater&para;<br>procedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that “the&para;<br>questions of law or fact common to class members pre&para;<br>dominate over any questions affecting only individual&para;<br>members, and that a class action is superior to other&para;<br>available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating&para;<br>the controversy.” Rule 23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and&para;<br>(b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class&para;<br>members are entitled to receive “the best notice that is&para;<br>practicable under the circumstances” and to withdraw&para;<br>from the class at their option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).&para;<br>Given that structure, we think it clear that individ&para;<br>ualized monetary claims belong in Rule 23(b)(3). The&para;<br>procedural protections attending the (b)(3) class—&para;<br>predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the&para;<br>right to opt out—are missing from (b)(2) not because the&para;<br>Rule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers&para;<br>them unnecessary to a (b)(2) class. When a class seeks an&para;<br>indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once,&para;<br>there is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into&para;<br>——————&para;<br>individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their&para;<br>ability to protect their interests,” Rule 23(b)(1)(B), such as in “ ‘limited&para;<br>fund’ cases, . . . in which numerous persons make claims against a fund&para;<br>insufficient to satisfy all claims,” Amchem, supra, at 614.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>whether class issues predominate or whether class action&para;<br>is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute. Pre&para;<br>dominance and superiority are self-evident. But with&para;<br>respect to each class member’s individualized claim for&para;<br>money, that is not so—which is precisely why (b)(3) re&para;<br>quires the judge to make findings about predominance and&para;<br>superiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does&para;<br>not require that class members be given notice and optout rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or&para;<br>wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is&para;<br>mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue&para;<br>in this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In&para;<br>the context of a class action predominantly for money&para;<br>damages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out&para;<br>violates due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,&para;<br>472 U. S. 797, 812 (1985). While we have never held that&para;<br>to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate,&para;<br>the serious possibility that it may be so provides an addi&para;<br>tional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the&para;<br>monetary claims here.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their&para;<br>claims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of&para;<br>a class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not&para;<br>“predominate” over their requests for injunctive and de&para;<br>claratory relief. They rely upon the Advisory Committee’s&para;<br>statement that Rule 23(b)(2) “does not extend to cases in&para;<br>which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or&para;<br>predominantly to money damages.” 39 F. R. D., at 102&para;<br>(emphasis added). The negative implication, they argue,&para;<br>is that it does extend to cases in which the appropriate&para;<br>final relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to&para;<br>money damages. Of course it is the Rule itself, not the&para;<br>Advisory Committee’s description of it, that governs. And&para;<br>a mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>establish a disposition that has no basis in the Rule’s text,&para;<br>and that does obvious violence to the Rule’s structural&para;<br>features. The mere “predominance” of a proper (b)(2)&para;<br>injunctive claim does nothing to justify elimination of Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3)’s procedural protections: It neither establishes the&para;<br>superiority of class adjudication over individual adjudica&para;<br>tion nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to&para;<br>see why the Rule should be read to nullify these protec&para;<br>tions whenever a plaintiff class, at its option, combines its&para;<br>monetary claims with a request—even a “predominating&para;<br>request”—for an injunction.&para;<br>Respondents’ predominance test, moreover, creates&para;<br>perverse incentives for class representatives to place at&para;<br>risk potentially valid claims for monetary relief. In this&para;<br>case, for example, the named plaintiffs declined to include&para;<br>employees’ claims for compensatory damages in their&para;<br>complaint. That strategy of including only backpay claims&para;<br>made it more likely that monetary relief would not “pre&para;<br>dominate.” But it also created the possibility (if the pre&para;<br>dominance test were correct) that individual class mem&para;<br>bers’ compensatory-damages claims would be precluded by&para;<br>litigation they had no power to hold themselves apart&para;<br>from. If it were determined, for example, that a particular&para;<br>class member is not entitled to backpay because her denial&para;<br>of increased pay or a promotion was not the product of&para;<br>discrimination, that employee might be collaterally es&para;<br>topped from independently seeking compensatory dam&para;<br>ages based on that same denial. That possibility under&para;<br>scores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary&para;<br>claims to decide for themselves whether to tie their fates to&para;<br>the class representatives’ or go it alone—a choice Rule&para;<br>23(b)(2) does not ensure that they have.&para;<br>The predominance test would also require the District&para;<br>Court to reevaluate the roster of class members continu&para;<br>ally. The Ninth Circuit recognized the necessity for this&para;<br>when it concluded that those plaintiffs no longer employed&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>by Wal-Mart lack standing to seek injunctive or declara&para;<br>tory relief against its employment practices. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ response to that difficulty, however, was not to&para;<br>eliminate all former employees from the certified class,&para;<br>but to eliminate only those who had left the company’s&para;<br>employ by the date the complaint was filed. That solution&para;<br>has no logical connection to the problem, since those who&para;<br>have left their Wal-Mart jobs since the complaint was filed&para;<br>have no more need for prospective relief than those who&para;<br>left beforehand. As a consequence, even though the valid&para;<br>ity of a (b)(2) class depends on whether “final injunctive&para;<br>relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate&para;<br>respecting the class as a whole,” Rule 23(b)(2) (emphasis&para;<br>added), about half the members of the class approved by&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit have no claim for injunctive or declara&para;<br>tory relief at all. Of course, the alternative (and logical)&para;<br>solution of excising plaintiffs from the class as they leave&para;<br>their employment may have struck the Court of Appeals&para;<br>as wasteful of the District Court’s time. Which indeed it&para;<br>is, since if a backpay action were properly certified for&para;<br>class treatment under (b)(3), the ability to litigate a plain&para;<br>tiff ’s backpay claim as part of the class would not turn on&para;<br>the irrelevant question whether she is still employed at&para;<br>Wal-Mart. What follows from this, however, is not that&para;<br>some arbitrary limitation on class membership should be&para;<br>imposed but that the backpay claims should not be certi&para;<br>fied under Rule 23(b)(2) at all.&para;<br>Finally, respondents argue that their backpay claims&para;<br>are appropriate for a (b)(2) class action because a backpay&para;<br>award is equitable in nature. The latter may be true, but&para;<br>it is irrelevant. The Rule does not speak of “equitable”&para;<br>remedies generally but of injunctions and declaratory&para;<br>judgments. As Title VII itself makes pellucidly clear,&para;<br>backpay is neither. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(g)(2)(B)(i)&para;<br>and (ii) (distinguishing between declaratory and injunc&para;<br>tive relief and the payment of “backpay,” see §2000e–&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>5(g)(2)(A)).&para;<br>C&para;<br>In Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F. 3d 402, 415&para;<br>(CA5 1998), the Fifth Circuit held that a (b)(2) class would&para;<br>permit the certification of monetary relief that is “inciden&para;<br>tal to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,” which it&para;<br>defined as “damages that flow directly from liability to&para;<br>the class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the&para;<br>injunctive or declaratory relief.” In that court’s view, such&para;<br>“incidental damage should not require additional hearings&para;<br>to resolve the disparate merits of each individual’s case; it&para;<br>should neither introduce new substantial legal or factual&para;<br>issues, nor entail complex individualized determinations.”&para;<br>Ibid. We need not decide in this case whether there are&para;<br>any forms of “incidental” monetary relief that are consis&para;<br>tent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) we have&para;<br>announced and that comply with the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>Respondents do not argue that they can satisfy this stan&para;<br>dard, and in any event they cannot.&para;<br>Contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s view, Wal-Mart is enti&para;<br>tled to individualized determinations of each employee’s&para;<br>eligibility for backpay. Title VII includes a detailed reme&para;<br>dial scheme. If a plaintiff prevails in showing that an&para;<br>employer has discriminated against him in violation of the&para;<br>statute, the court “may enjoin the respondent from en&para;<br>gaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order&para;<br>such affirmative action as may be appropriate, [including]&para;<br>reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without&para;<br>backpay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court&para;<br>deems appropriate.” §2000e–5(g)(1). But if the employer&para;<br>can show that it took an adverse employment action&para;<br>against an employee for any reason other than discrimina&para;<br>tion, the court cannot order the “hiring, reinstatement, or&para;<br>promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment&para;<br>to him of any backpay.” §2000e–5(g)(2)(A).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.
