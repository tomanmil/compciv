S. C. §106(3), are qualified by the&para;<br>application of several limitations set out in §§107 through 122, including the “first sale” doctrine, which provides that “the owner of a&para;<br>particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title . . . is&para;<br>entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord,” §109(a).&para;<br>Importing a copy made abroad without the copyright owner’s permission is an infringement of §106(3). See §602(a)(1). In Quality King&para;<br>Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research Int’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145,&para;<br>this Court held that §602(a)(1)’s reference to §106(3) incorporates the&para;<br>§§107 through 122 limitations, including §109’s “first sale” doctrine.&para;<br>However, the copy in Quality King was initially manufactured in the&para;<br>United States and then sent abroad and sold.&para;<br>Respondent, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., an academic textbook publisher, often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary (Wiley&para;<br>Asia) rights to publish, print, and sell foreign editions of Wiley’s English language textbooks abroad. Wiley Asia’s books state that they&para;<br>are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.&para;<br>When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States&para;<br>to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edition English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold&para;<br>at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States. He then&para;<br>sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the&para;<br>profit.&para;<br>Wiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaeng’s unauthorized importation and resale of its books was an infringement of Wiley’s §106(3)&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>exclusive right to distribute and §602’s import prohibition. Kirtsaeng&para;<br>replied that because his books were “lawfully made” and acquired legitimately, §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine permitted importation and&para;<br>resale without Wiley’s further permission. The District Court held&para;<br>that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine&para;<br>does not apply to goods manufactured abroad. The jury then found&para;<br>that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wiley’s American copyrights&para;<br>and assessed damages. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that&para;<br>§109(a)’s “lawfully made under this title” language indicated that the&para;<br>“first sale” doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted&para;<br>works manufactured abroad.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The “first sale” doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work&para;<br>lawfully made abroad. Pp. 7–33.&para;<br>(a) Wiley reads “lawfully made under this title” to impose a geographical limitation that prevents §109(a)’s doctrine from applying to&para;<br>Wiley Asia’s books. Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as imposing the non-geographical limitation made “in accordance with” or “in&para;<br>compliance with” the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine&para;<br>to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner’s&para;<br>permission. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) Section 109(a)’s language, its context, and the “first sale” doctrine’s common-law history favor Kirtsaeng’s reading. Pp. 8–24.&para;<br>(1) Section 109(a) says nothing about geography. “Under” can&para;<br>logically mean “in accordance with.” And a nongeographical interpretation provides each word in the phrase “lawfully made under this&para;<br>title” with a distinct purpose: “lawfully made” suggests an effort to&para;<br>distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,&para;<br>and “under this title” sets forth the standard of “lawful[ness]” (i.e.,&para;<br>the U. S. Copyright Act). This simple reading promotes the traditional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-byword linguistic sense.&para;<br>In contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic&para;<br>difficulties. Wiley first reads “under” to mean “in conformance with&para;<br>the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.” Wiley then&para;<br>argues that the Act “is applicable” only in the United States. However, neither “under” nor any other word in “lawfully made under this&para;<br>title” means “where.” Nor can a geographical limitation be read into&para;<br>the word “applicable.” The fact that the Act does not instantly protect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking&para;<br>place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made&para;<br>abroad. Indeed, §602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies subject to the Copyright Act. And §104 says that works “subject to protection” include unpublished works “without regard to the [author’s]&para;<br>nationality or domicile,” and works “first published” in any of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the&para;<br>United States. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(2) Both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate&para;<br>that Congress did not have geography in mind when writing the present version of §109(a). A comparison of the language in §109(a)’s&para;<br>predecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion. The&para;<br>former version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but&para;<br>mere possessors who “lawfully obtained” a copy, while the present&para;<br>version covers only owners of a “lawfully made” copy. This new language, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of&para;<br>a copy will not receive “first sale” protection but one who owns a copy&para;<br>will be protected, provided that the copy was “lawfully made.” A&para;<br>nongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions&para;<br>of the present statute. For example, the “manufacturing clause,”&para;<br>which limited importation of many copies printed outside the United&para;<br>States, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies&para;<br>made in America and copies made abroad. But that “equal treatment” principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpretation that would grant an American copyright holder permanent control over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed&para;<br>abroad but not those printed in America. Finally, the Court normally&para;<br>presumes that the words “lawfully made under this title” carry the&para;<br>same meaning when they appear in different but related sections,&para;<br>and it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the consequences produced by a geographical interpretation. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(3) A nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of&para;<br>statutory interpretation that “when a statute covers an issue previously governed by the common law,” it is presumed that “Congress&para;<br>intended to retain the substance of the common law.” Samantar v.&para;<br>Yousuf, 560 U. S. ___, ___. The common-law “first sale” doctrine,&para;<br>which has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical&para;<br>distinctions. Nor can such distinctions be found in Bobbs-Merrill Co.&para;<br>v. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, where this Court first applied the “first sale”&para;<br>doctrine, or in §109(a)’s predecessor provision, which Congress enacted a year later. Pp. 17–19.&para;<br>(4) Library associations, used-book dealers, technology companies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point to various ways&para;<br>in which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic&para;<br>constitutional copyright objectives, in particular “promot[ing] the&para;<br>Progress of Science and useful Arts,” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. For example, a&para;<br>geographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely require libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books&para;<br>in their collections that were printed overseas. Wiley counters that&para;<br>such problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>first adopted a geographical interpretation. But the law has not been&para;<br>settled for so long in Wiley’s favor. The Second Circuit in this case&para;<br>was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical interpretation. Reliance on the “first sale” doctrine is also deeply embedded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers,&para;<br>who have long relied on its protection. And the fact that harm has&para;<br>proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright&para;<br>holders to assert geographically based resale rights. Thus, the practical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious,&para;<br>extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant—&para;<br>particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade&para;<br>to America. Pp. 19–24.&para;<br>(c) Several additional arguments that Wiley and the dissent make&para;<br>in support of a geographical interpretation are unpersuasive.

S. C. §106(3). These rights are quali­&para;<br>fied, however, by the application of various limitations set&para;<br>forth in the next several sections of the Act, §§107 through&para;<br>122. Those sections, typically entitled “Limitations on&para;<br>exclusive rights,” include, for example, the principle of&para;<br>“fair use” (§107), permission for limited library archival&para;<br>reproduction, (§108), and the doctrine at issue here, the&para;<br>“first sale” doctrine (§109).&para;<br>Section 109(a) sets forth the “first sale” doctrine as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3) [the&para;<br>section that grants the owner exclusive distribution&para;<br>rights], the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord&para;<br>lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled, without&para;<br>the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or other­&para;<br>wise dispose of the possession of that copy or&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>phonorecord.” (Emphasis added.)&para;<br>Thus, even though §106(3) forbids distribution of a copy of,&para;<br>say, the copyrighted novel Herzog without the copyright&para;<br>owner’s permission, §109(a) adds that, once a copy of Herzog has been lawfully sold (or its ownership otherwise&para;<br>lawfully transferred), the buyer of that copy and subse­&para;<br>quent owners are free to dispose of it as they wish. In&para;<br>copyright jargon, the “first sale” has “exhausted” the&para;<br>copyright owner’s §106(3) exclusive distribution right.&para;<br>What, however, if the copy of Herzog was printed abroad&para;<br>and then initially sold with the copyright owner’s permis­&para;<br>sion? Does the “first sale” doctrine still apply? Is the&para;<br>buyer, like the buyer of a domestically manufactured copy,&para;<br>free to bring the copy into the United States and dispose of&para;<br>it as he or she wishes?&para;<br>To put the matter technically, an “importation” provi­&para;<br>sion, §602(a)(1), says that&para;<br>“[i]mportation into the United States, without the au­&para;<br>thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of&para;<br>copies . . . of a work that have been acquired outside&para;<br>the United States is an infringement of the exclusive&para;<br>right to distribute copies . . . under section 106 . . . .”&para;<br>17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>Thus §602(a)(1) makes clear that importing a copy&para;<br>without permission violates the owner’s exclusive distribution right. But in doing so, §602(a)(1) refers explicitly to&para;<br>the §106(3) exclusive distribution right. As we have just&para;<br>said, §106 is by its terms “[s]ubject to” the various doc­&para;<br>trines and principles contained in §§107 through 122, including §109(a)’s “first sale” limitation. Do those same&para;<br>modifications apply—in particular, does the “first sale”&para;<br>modification apply—when considering whether §602(a)(1)&para;<br>prohibits importing a copy?&para;<br>In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v.

S. 135, 145 (1998), we held that&para;<br>§602(a)(1)’s reference to §106(3)’s exclusive distribution&para;<br>right incorporates the later subsections’ limitations, in­&para;<br>cluding, in particular, the “first sale” doctrine of §109.&para;<br>Thus, it might seem that, §602(a)(1) notwithstanding, one&para;<br>who buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into&para;<br>the United States and dispose of it, just as he could had he&para;<br>bought the copy in the United States.&para;<br>But Quality King considered an instance in which the&para;<br>copy, though purchased abroad, was initially manufac­&para;<br>tured in the United States (and then sent abroad and&para;<br>sold). This case is like Quality King but for one important&para;<br>fact. The copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.&para;<br>That fact is important because §109(a) says that the “first&para;<br>sale” doctrine applies to “a particular copy or phonorecord&para;<br>lawfully made under this title.” And we must decide here&para;<br>whether the five words, “lawfully made under this title,”&para;<br>make a critical legal difference.&para;<br>Putting section numbers to the side, we ask whether&para;<br>the “first sale” doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other&para;<br>lawful owner of a copy (of a copyrighted work) lawfully&para;<br>manufactured abroad. Can that buyer bring that copy&para;<br>into the United States (and sell it or give it away) without&para;<br>obtaining permission to do so from the copyright owner?&para;<br>Can, for example, someone who purchases, say at a used&para;<br>bookstore, a book printed abroad subsequently resell it&para;<br>without the copyright owner’s permission?&para;<br>In our view, the answers to these questions are, yes.

The Second Circuit, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit, Wiley, and the Solicitor General (as amicus) all&para;<br>read those words as imposing a form of geographical limi­&para;<br>tation. The Second Circuit held that they limit the “first&para;<br>sale” doctrine to particular copies “made in territories in&para;<br>which the Copyright Act is law,” which (the Circuit says)&para;<br>are copies “manufactured domestically,” not “outside of the&para;<br>United States.” 654 F. 3d, at 221–222 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Wiley agrees that those five words limit the “first sale”&para;<br>doctrine “to copies made in conformance with the [United&para;<br>States] Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is appli­&para;<br>cable,” which (Wiley says) means it does not apply to copies&para;<br>made “outside the United States” and at least not to “for­&para;<br>eign production of a copy for distribution exclusively&para;<br>abroad.” Brief for Respondent 15–16.

He says that they mean made “in accordance with”&para;<br>or “in compliance with” the Copyright Act. Brief for Peti­&para;<br>tioner 26. In that case, §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine&para;<br>would apply to copyrighted works as long as their manu­&para;<br>facture met the requirements of American copyright law.&para;<br>In particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here,&para;<br>copies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the&para;<br>copyright owner. See §106 (referring to the owner’s right&para;<br>to authorize).&para;<br>In our view, §109(a)’s language, its context, and the&para;<br>common-law history of the “first sale” doctrine, taken&para;<br>together, favor a non-geographical interpretation.

We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng’s&para;<br>nongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The language of §109(a) read literally favors Kirtsaeng’s&para;<br>nongeographical interpretation, namely, that “lawfully&para;<br>made under this title” means made “in accordance with” or&para;<br>“in compliance with” the Copyright Act. The language of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§109(a) says nothing about geography. The word “under”&para;<br>can mean “[i]n accordance with.” 18 Oxford English Dic­&para;<br>tionary 950 (2d ed. 1989). See also Black’s Law Dictionary&para;<br>1525 (6th ed. 1990) (“according to”). And a nongeograph­&para;<br>ical interpretation provides each word of the five-word&para;<br>phrase with a distinct purpose. The first two words of the&para;<br>phrase, “lawfully made,” suggest an effort to distinguish&para;<br>those copies that were made lawfully from those that were&para;<br>not, and the last three words, “under this title,” set forth&para;<br>the standard of “lawful[ness].” Thus, the nongeographical reading is simple, it promotes a traditional copyright&para;<br>objective (combatting piracy), and it makes word-by-word&para;<br>linguistic sense.&para;<br>The geographical interpretation, however, bristles with&para;<br>linguistic difficulties. It gives the word “lawfully” little,&para;<br>if any, linguistic work to do. (How could a book be unlaw­&para;<br>fully “made under this title”?) It imports geography into a&para;<br>statutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.&para;<br>And it is far more complex than may at first appear.&para;<br>To read the clause geographically, Wiley, like the Sec­&para;<br>ond Circuit and the Solicitor General, must first empha­&para;<br>size the word “under.” Indeed, Wiley reads “under this&para;<br>title” to mean “in conformance with the Copyright Act&para;<br>where the Copyright Act is applicable.” Brief for Respond­&para;<br>ent 15. Wiley must then take a second step, arguing that&para;<br>the Act “is applicable” only in the United States. Ibid.&para;<br>And the Solicitor General must do the same. See Brief for&para;<br>United States 6 (“A copy is ‘lawfully made under this title’&para;<br>if Title 17 governs the copy’s creation and the copy is made&para;<br>in compliance with Title 17’s requirements”). See also&para;<br>post, at 7 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“under” describes&para;<br>something “governed or regulated by another”).&para;<br>One difficulty is that neither “under” nor any other&para;<br>word in the phrase means “where.” See, e.g., 18 Oxford&para;<br>English Dictionary, supra, at 947–952 (definition of “un­&para;<br>der”). It might mean “subject to,” see post, at 6, but as this&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court has repeatedly acknowledged, the word evades a&para;<br>uniform, consistent meaning. See Kucana v. Holder, 558&para;<br>U. S. 233, 245 (2010) (“ ‘under’ is chameleon”); Ardestani v.&para;<br>INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991) (“under” has “many dic­&para;<br>tionary definitions” and “must draw its meaning from its&para;<br>context”).&para;<br>A far more serious difficulty arises out of the uncer­&para;<br>tainty and complexity surrounding the second step’s effort&para;<br>to read the necessary geographical limitation into the word&para;<br>“applicable” (or the equivalent). Where, precisely, is the&para;<br>Copyright Act “applicable”? The Act does not instantly&para;<br>protect an American copyright holder from unauthorized&para;<br>piracy taking place abroad. But that fact does not mean&para;<br>the Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad. As a matter&para;<br>of ordinary English, one can say that a statute imposing,&para;<br>say, a tariff upon “any rhododendron grown in Nepal”&para;<br>applies to all Nepalese rhododendrons. And, similarly,&para;<br>one can say that the American Copyright Act is applicable&para;<br>to all pirated copies, including those printed overseas.&para;<br>Indeed, the Act itself makes clear that (in the Solicitor&para;<br>General’s language) foreign-printed pirated copies are “sub­&para;<br>&para;<br>ject to” the Act. §602(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (refer­&para;<br>ring to importation of copies “the making of which either&para;<br>constituted an infringement of copyright, or which would&para;<br>have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title&para;<br>had been applicable”); Brief for United States 5. See also&para;<br>post, at 6 (suggesting that “made under” may be read as&para;<br>“subject to”).&para;<br>The appropriateness of this linguistic usage is under­&para;<br>scored by the fact that §104 of the Act itself says that&para;<br>works “subject to protection under this title” include un­&para;<br>published works “without regard to the nationality or&para;<br>domicile of the author,” and works “first published” in any&para;<br>one of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright&para;<br>treaty with the United States. §§104(a), (b) (2006 ed.)&para;<br>(emphasis added); §101 (2006 ed., Supp. V) (defining&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

As we said, that Cir­&para;<br>cuit interprets the “first sale” doctrine to cover both (1)&para;<br>copies manufactured in the United States and (2) copies&para;<br>manufactured abroad but first sold in the United States&para;<br>with the American copyright owner’s permission.

A publisher such as Wiley&para;<br>would be free to print its books abroad, allow their importation and sale within the United States, but prohibit&para;<br>students from later selling their used texts at a campus&para;<br>bookstore. We see no way, however, to reconcile this half­&para;<br>geographical/half-nongeographical interpretation with the&para;<br>language of the phrase, “lawfully made under this title.”&para;<br>As a matter of English, it would seem that those five&para;<br>words either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they&para;<br>do not.&para;<br>In sum, we believe that geographical interpretations&para;<br>create more linguistic problems than they resolve. And&para;<br>considerations of simplicity and coherence tip the purely&para;<br>linguistic balance in Kirtsaeng’s, nongeographical, favor.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Both historical and contemporary statutory context in­&para;<br>dicate that Congress, when writing the present version of&para;<br>§109(a), did not have geography in mind. In respect to&para;<br>history, we compare §109(a)’s present language with the&para;<br>language of its immediate predecessor. That predecessor&para;<br>said:&para;<br>“[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, pre­&para;<br>vent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copy­&para;<br>righted work the possession of which has been lawfully&para;<br>obtained.” Copyright Act of 1909, §41, 35 Stat. 1084&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>See also Copyright Act of 1947, §27, 61 Stat. 660. The&para;<br>predecessor says nothing about geography (and Wiley does&para;<br>not argue that it does). So we ask whether Congress, in&para;<br>changing its language implicitly introduced a geograph­&para;<br>ical limitation that previously was lacking. See also Part&para;<br>II–C, infra (discussing 1909 codification of common-law&para;<br>principle).&para;<br>A comparison of language indicates that it did not.

The present version covers&para;<br>only those who are owners of a “lawfully made” copy.&para;<br>Whom does the change leave out? Who might have lawfully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned&para;<br>that copy? One answer is owners of movie theaters, who&para;<br>during the 1970’s (and before) often leased films from&para;<br>movie distributors or filmmakers.&para;<br>See S. Donahue,&para;<br>American Film Distribution 134, 177 (1987) (describing&para;<br>producer-distributer and distributer-exhibitor agreements);&para;<br>Note, The Relationship Between Motion Picture Distribu­&para;<br>tion and Exhibition: An Analysis of the Effects of AntiBlind Bidding Legislation, 9 Comm/Ent. L. J. 131, 135&para;<br>(1986). Because the theater owners had “lawfully ob­&para;<br>tained” their copies, the earlier version could be read as&para;<br>allowing them to sell that copy, i.e., it might have given&para;<br>them “first sale” protection. Because the theater owners&para;<br>were lessees, not owners, of their copies, the change in&para;<br>language makes clear that they (like bailees and other&para;<br>lessees) cannot take advantage of the “first sale” doctrine.&para;<br>(Those who find legislative history useful will find confir­&para;<br>mation in, e.g., House Committee on the Judiciary, Copy­&para;<br>right Law Revision, Supplementary Report of the Register&para;<br>of Copyrights on the General Revision of the U.

Section 109(a) now makes clear that a lessee of&para;<br>a copy will not receive “first sale” protection but one who&para;<br>owns a copy will receive “first sale” protection, provided, of&para;<br>course, that the copy was “lawfully made” and not pi­&para;<br>rated. The new language also takes into account that a&para;<br>copy may be “lawfully made under this title” when the copy,&para;<br>say of a phonorecord, comes into its owner’s possession&para;<br>through use of a compulsory license, which “this title”&para;<br>provides for elsewhere, namely, in §115. Again, for those&para;<br>who find legislative history useful, the relevant legislative&para;<br>report makes this clear. H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, p. 79&para;<br>(1976) (“For example, any resale of an illegally ‘pirated’&para;<br>phonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition&para;<br>of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory li­&para;<br>censing provisions of section 115 would not”).&para;<br>Other provisions of the present statute also support&para;<br>a nongeographical interpretation. For one thing, the stat­&para;<br>ute phases out the “manufacturing clause,” a clause that&para;<br>appeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation&para;<br>of many copies (of copyrighted works) printed outside the&para;<br>United States. §601, 90 Stat. 2588 (“Prior to July 1, 1982&para;<br>. . . the importation into or public distribution in the&para;<br>United States of copies of a work consisting preponderantly&para;<br>of nondramatic literary material . . . is prohibited unless&para;<br>the portions consisting of such material have been manufactured in the United States or Canada”). The phasing out&para;<br>of this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manu­&para;<br>factured in America and copies manufactured abroad. See&para;<br>H. R. Rep.

And it is particularly difficult to believe that&para;<br>Congress would have sought this unequal treatment while&para;<br>saying nothing about it and while, in a related clause (the&para;<br>manufacturing phase-out), seeking the opposite kind of&para;<br>policy goal. Cf. Golan v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)&para;<br>(slip op., at 30) (Congress has moved from a copyright&para;<br>regime that, prior to 1891, entirely excluded foreign works&para;<br>from U. S. copyright protection to a regime that now “en­&para;<br>sure[s] that most works, whether foreign or domestic,&para;<br>would be governed by the same legal regime” (emphasis&para;<br>added)).&para;<br>Finally, we normally presume that the words “lawfully&para;<br>made under this title” carry the same meaning when they&para;<br>appear in different but related sections. Department of&para;<br>Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,&para;<br>342 (1994). But doing so here produces surprising conse­&para;<br>quences. Consider:&para;<br>(1) Section 109(c) says that, despite the copyright own­&para;<br>er’s exclusive right “to display” a copyrighted work&para;<br>(provided in §106(5)), the owner of a particular copy “lawfully made under this title” may publicly display it with­&para;<br>out further authorization. To interpret these words&para;<br>geographically would mean that one who buys a copy­&para;<br>righted work of art, a poster, or even a bumper sticker,&para;<br>in Canada, in Europe, in Asia, could not display&para;<br>it in America without the copyright owner’s further&para;<br>authorization.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v.

To inter­&para;<br>pret these words geographically means that an arcade&para;<br>owner could not (“without the authority of the copyright&para;<br>owner”) perform or display arcade games (whether new&para;<br>or used) originally made in Japan. Cf. Red BaronFranklin Park, Inc. v. Taito Corp., 883 F. 2d 275 (CA4&para;<br>1989).&para;<br>(3) Section 110(1) says that a teacher, without the copy­&para;<br>right owner’s authorization, is allowed to perform or&para;<br>display a copyrighted work (say, an audiovisual work)&para;<br>“in the course of face-to-face teaching activities”—unless&para;<br>the teacher knowingly used “a copy that was not lawfully made under this title.” To interpret these words&para;<br>geographically would mean that the teacher could not&para;<br>(without further authorization) use a copy of a film dur­&para;<br>ing class if the copy was lawfully made in Canada, Mex­&para;<br>ico, Europe, Africa, or Asia.&para;<br>(4) In its introductory sentence, §106 provides the Act’s&para;<br>basic exclusive rights to an “owner of a copyright under&para;<br>this title.” The last three words cannot support a geo­&para;<br>graphic interpretation.&para;<br>Wiley basically accepts the first three readings, but argues that Congress intended the restrictive consequences.&para;<br>And it argues that context simply requires that the words&para;<br>of the fourth example receive a different interpretation.&para;<br>Leaving the fourth example to the side, we shall explain in&para;<br>Part II–D, infra, why we find it unlikely that Congress&para;<br>would have intended these, and other related consequences.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

They may&para;<br>decide differently if the law is clarified in their favor.&para;<br>Regardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only&para;<br>if unenforced is not a sound copyright law. It is a law that&para;<br>would create uncertainty, would bring about selective&para;<br>enforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disre­&para;<br>spect for copyright law itself.&para;<br>Thus, we believe that the practical problems that peti­&para;<br>tioner and his amici have described are too serious, too&para;<br>extensive, and too likely to come about for us to dismiss&para;<br>them as insignificant—particularly in light of the ever­&para;<br>growing importance of foreign trade to America.

S., at 138–139.&para;<br>We held that the importation provision did not prohibit&para;<br>sending the products back into the United States (without&para;<br>the copyright owner’s permission). That section says:&para;<br>“Importation into the United States, without the au­&para;<br>thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of&para;<br>copies or phonorecords of a work that have been&para;<br>acquired outside the United States is an infringement&para;<br>of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phono­&para;<br>records under section 106.” 17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See also&para;<br>§602(a) (1994 ed.).&para;<br>We pointed out that this section makes importation an&para;<br>infringement of the “exclusive right to distribute . . . under&para;<br>106.” We noted that §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine limits&para;<br>the scope of the §106 exclusive distribution right. We took&para;<br>as given the fact that the products at issue had at least&para;<br>once been sold. And we held that consequently, importa­&para;<br>tion of the copyrighted labels does not violate §602(a)(1).&para;<br>523 U. S., at 145.&para;<br>In reaching this conclusion we endorsed Bobbs-Merrill&para;<br>and its statement that the copyright laws were not “in­&para;<br>tended to create a right which would permit the holder of&para;<br>the copyright to fasten, by notice in a book . . . a restriction&para;<br>upon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of&para;<br>copyright after the owner had parted with the title to one&para;<br>who had acquired full dominion over it.” 210 U.

JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>349–350.&para;<br>We also explained why we rejected the claim that our&para;<br>interpretation would make §602(a)(1) pointless. Those&para;<br>advancing that claim had pointed out that the 1976 Copy­&para;<br>right Act amendments retained a prior anti-piracy provi­&para;<br>sion, prohibiting the importation of pirated copies. Qual­&para;<br>ity King, supra, at 146. Thus, they said, §602(a)(1) must&para;<br>prohibit the importation of lawfully made copies, for to&para;<br>allow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a&para;<br>first sale, as Quality King’s holding would do, would leave&para;<br>§602(a)(1) without much to prohibit. It would become&para;<br>superfluous, without any real work to do.&para;<br>We do not believe that this argument is a strong one.&para;<br>Under Quality King’s interpretation, §602(a)(1) would still&para;<br>forbid importing (without permission, and subject to the&para;<br>exceptions in §602(a)(3)) copies lawfully made abroad, for&para;<br>example, where (1) a foreign publisher operating as the&para;<br>licensee of an American publisher prints copies of a book&para;<br>overseas but, prior to any authorized sale, seeks to send&para;<br>them to the United States; (2) a foreign printer or other&para;<br>manufacturer (if not the “owner” for purposes of §109(a),&para;<br>e.g., before an authorized sale) sought to send copyrighted&para;<br>goods to the United States; (3) “a book publisher trans­&para;<br>ports copies to a wholesaler” and the wholesaler (not yet&para;<br>the owner) sends them to the United States, see Copyright&para;<br>Law Revision, pt. 4, at 211 (giving this example); or (4)&para;<br>a foreign film distributor, having leased films for distri­&para;<br>bution, or any other licensee, consignee, or bailee sought to&para;<br>send them to the United States. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer on&para;<br>Copyright §8.12[B][1][a], at 8–159 (“Section 109(a) pro­&para;<br>vides that the distribution right may be exercised solely&para;<br>with respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work,&para;<br>not to prevent or restrict the resale or other further trans­&para;<br>fer of possession of such copies”). These examples show&para;<br>that §602(a)(1) retains significance. We concede it has less&para;<br>significance than the dissent believes appropriate, but the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent also adopts a construction of §106(3) that “signifi­&para;<br>cantly curtails” §109(a)’s effect, post, at 26, and so limits&para;<br>the scope of that provision to a similar, or even greater,&para;<br>degree.&para;<br>In Quality King we rejected the “superfluous” argument&para;<br>for similar reasons. But, when rejecting it, we said that,&para;<br>where an author gives exclusive American distribution&para;<br>rights to an American publisher and exclusive British&para;<br>distribution rights to a British publisher, “presumably&para;<br>only those [copies] made by the publisher of the United&para;<br>States edition would be ‘lawfully made under this title’&para;<br>within the meaning of §109(a).” 523 U. S., at 148 (empha­&para;<br>sis added). Wiley now argues that this phrase in the&para;<br>Quality King opinion means that books published abroad&para;<br>(under license) must fall outside the words “lawfully made&para;<br>under this title” and that we have consequently already&para;<br>given those words the geographical interpretation that it&para;<br>favors.&para;<br>We cannot, however, give the Quality King statement&para;<br>the legal weight for which Wiley argues. The language&para;<br>“lawfully made under this title” was not at issue in Qual­&para;<br>ity King; the point before us now was not then fully argued;&para;<br>we did not canvas the considerations we have here set&para;<br>forth; we there said nothing to suggest that the example&para;<br>assumes a “first sale”; and we there hedged our statement with the word “presumably.” Most importantly, the&para;<br>statement is pure dictum. It is dictum contained in a&para;<br>rebuttal to a counterargument. And it is unnecessary&para;<br>dictum even in that respect. Is the Court having once&para;<br>written dicta calling a tomato a vegetable bound to deny&para;<br>that it is a fruit forever after?&para;<br>To the contrary, we have written that we are not neces­&para;<br>sarily bound by dicta should more complete argument&para;<br>demonstrate that the dicta is not correct.

But the historical events to&para;<br>which it points took place more than a decade before the&para;<br>enactment of the Act and, at best, are inconclusive.&para;<br>During the 1960’s, representatives of book, record, and&para;<br>film industries, meeting with the Register of Copyrights to&para;<br>discuss copyright revision, complained about the difficulty&para;<br>of dividing international markets.

For&para;<br>example, Irwin Karp, representing the Authors League&para;<br>of America asked, “If a German jobber lawfully buys copies from a German publisher, are we not running into the&para;<br>problem of restricting his transfer of his lawfully obtained&para;<br>copies?” Id., pt. 4, at 211. The Copyright Office repre­&para;<br>sentative replied, “This could vary from one situation to&para;<br>another, I guess. I should guess, for example, that if&para;<br>a book publisher transports [i.e., does not sell] copies to a&para;<br>wholesaler [i.e., a nonowner], this is not yet the kind of&para;<br>transaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.”&para;<br>Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Office later withdrew the draft, replacing it with a&para;<br>draft, which, by explicitly referring to §106, was similar to&para;<br>the provision that became law, now §602(a)(1). The Office&para;<br>noted in a report that, under the new draft, importation of&para;<br>a copy (without permission) “would violate the exclusive&para;<br>rights of the U.

Cf. Quality King, 523 U. S., at 145 (with­&para;<br>out those five words, the import clause, via its reference to&para;<br>§106, imports the “first sale” doctrine).&para;<br>But to ascertain the best reading of §109(a), rather&para;<br>than dissecting the remarks of industry representatives&para;<br>concerning §602 at congressional meetings held 10 years&para;<br>before the statute was enacted, see post, at 13–16, we&para;<br>would give greater weight to the congressional report&para;<br>accompanying §109(a), written a decade later when Con­&para;<br>gress passed the new law.

This means that, contrary to the&para;<br>dissent’s suggestion, any lack of legislative history per­&para;<br>taining to the “first sale” doctrine only tends to bolster&para;<br>our position that Congress’ 1976 revision did not intend to&para;<br>create a drastic geographical change in its revision to that&para;<br>provision.

We concede that is so. A&para;<br>publisher may find it more difficult to charge different&para;<br>prices for the same book in different geographic markets.&para;<br>But we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can&para;<br>find no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that&para;<br>publishers are especially entitled to such rights.&para;<br>The Constitution describes the nature of American&para;<br>copyright law by providing Congress with the power to&para;<br>“secur[e]” to “[a]uthors” “for limited [t]imes” the “exclusive&para;<br>[r]ight to their . . .

I write to&para;<br>suggest that any problems associated with that limitation&para;<br>come not from our reading of §109(a) here, but from Quality King’s holding that §109(a) limits §602(a)(1).&para;<br>As the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine has played&para;<br>an integral part in American copyright law for over a&para;<br>century. See ante, at 17–19; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,&para;<br>210 U. S. 339 (1908). No codification of the doctrine prior&para;<br>to 1976 even arguably limited its application to copies&para;<br>made in the United States. See ante, at 12. And nothing&para;<br>in the text or history of §109(a)—the Copyright Act of&para;<br>1976’s first-sale provision—suggests that Congress meant&para;<br>to enact the new, geographical restriction John Wiley&para;<br>proposes, which at once would deprive American consumers of important rights and encourage copyright holders to&para;<br>manufacture abroad.

JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>KAGAN, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>That said, John Wiley is right that the Court’s decision,&para;<br>when combined with Quality King, substantially narrows&para;<br>§602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation. Quality&para;<br>King held that the importation ban does not reach any&para;<br>copies receiving first-sale protection under §109(a). See&para;<br>523 U. S., at 151–152. So notwithstanding §602(a)(1), an&para;<br>“owner of a particular copy . . . lawfully made under this&para;<br>title” can import that copy without the copyright owner’s&para;<br>permission. §109(a). In now holding that copies “lawfully&para;<br>made under this title” include copies manufactured&para;<br>abroad, we unavoidably diminish §602(a)(1)’s scope—&para;<br>indeed, limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications. See&para;<br>ante, at 26–27.&para;<br>But if Congress views the shrinking of §602(a)(1) as a&para;<br>problem, it should recognize Quality King—not our decision today—as the culprit. Here, after all, we merely&para;<br>construe §109(a); Quality King is the decision holding that&para;<br>§109(a) limits §602(a)(1). Had we come out the opposite&para;<br>way in that case, §602(a)(1) would allow a copyright owner&para;<br>to restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the&para;<br>first-sale doctrine.1 That result would enable the copyright owner to divide international markets in the way&para;<br>John Wiley claims Congress intended when enacting&para;<br>§602(a)(1). But it would do so without imposing down——————&para;<br>1 Although Quality King concluded that the statute’s text foreclosed&para;<br>that outcome, see 523 U. S., at 151–152, the Solicitor General offered a&para;<br>cogent argument to the contrary. He reasoned that §109(a) does not&para;<br>limit §602(a)(1) because the former authorizes owners only to “sell” or&para;<br>“dispose” of copies—not to import them: The Act’s first-sale provision&para;<br>and its importation ban thus regulate separate, non-overlapping&para;<br>spheres of conduct. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in&para;<br>Quality King, O. T. 1996, No. 96–1470, pp. 5, 8–10. That reading&para;<br>remains the Government’s preferred way of construing the statute.

Ante, at 19. Assuming Congress&para;<br>adopted §602(a)(1) to permit market segmentation, I suspect that is how Congress thought the provision would&para;<br>work—not by removing first-sale protection from every copy&para;<br>manufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do here),&para;<br>but by enabling the copyright holder to control imports&para;<br>even when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King&para;<br>now prevents).2&para;<br>At bottom, John Wiley (together with the dissent) asks&para;<br>us to misconstrue §109(a) in order to restore §602(a)(1)&para;<br>to its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright&para;<br>holders to segment international markets. I think John&para;<br>Wiley may have a point about what §602(a)(1) was designed to do; that gives me pause about Quality King’s&para;<br>holding that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation&para;<br>ban’s scope. But the Court today correctly declines the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Indeed, allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective&para;<br>of the first-sale doctrine—i.e., reversing Quality King—would yield a&para;<br>far more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting&para;<br>John Wiley’s argument here. That is because only the former approach&para;<br>turns on the intended market for copies; the latter rests instead on their&para;<br>place of manufacture. To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley&para;<br>prints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute certain&para;<br>versions only in Thailand. Without Quality King, John Wiley could do&para;<br>so—i.e., produce books in New York, ship them to Thailand, and prevent anyone from importing them back into the United States. But&para;<br>with Quality King, that course is not open to John Wiley even under its&para;<br>reading of §109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from reimporting the books—and so to segment the Thai market—John Wiley&para;<br>would have to move its printing facilities abroad. I can see no reason&para;<br>why Congress would have conditioned a copyright owner’s power to&para;<br>divide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v.

That would swap&para;<br>one (possible) mistake for a much worse one, and make&para;<br>our reading of the statute only less reflective of Congressional intent.

Their ability&para;<br>to engage in such price discrimination, however, is under­&para;<br>mined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies&para;<br>from low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions.&para;<br>The question in this case is whether the unauthorized&para;<br>importation of foreign-made copies constitutes copyright&para;<br>infringement under U. S. law.&para;<br>To answer this question, one must examine three provi­&para;<br>sions of Title 17 of the U. S. Code: §§106(3), 109(a), and&para;<br>602(a)(1). Section 106 sets forth the “exclusive rights” of a&para;<br>copyright owner, including the right “to distribute copies&para;<br>or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by&para;<br>sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or&para;<br>lending.” §106(3). This distribution right is limited by&para;<br>§109(a), which provides: “Notwithstanding the provisions&para;<br>of section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled,&para;<br>without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or&para;<br>otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or&para;<br>phonorecord.” Section 109(a) codifies the “first sale doc­&para;<br>trine,” a doctrine articulated in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.&para;<br>Straus, 210 U. S. 339, 349–351 (1908), which held that a&para;<br>copyright owner could not control the price at which re­&para;<br>tailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work. The&para;<br>first sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner&para;<br>should not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over&para;<br>the distribution of copies of a copyrighted work. At some&para;<br>point—ordinarily the time of the first commercial sale—&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

It reads:&para;<br>“Importation into the United States, without the&para;<br>authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of&para;<br>copies or phonorecords of a work that have been&para;<br>acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or&para;<br>phonorecords under section 106, actionable under sec­&para;<br>tion 501.”&para;<br>In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research&para;<br>Int’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 143–154 (1998), the Court held&para;<br>that a copyright owner’s right to control importation under&para;<br>§602(a)(1) is a component of the distribution right set forth&para;<br>in §106(3) and is therefore subject to §109(a)’s codification&para;<br>of the first sale doctrine. Quality King thus held that&para;<br>the importation of copies made in the United States but&para;<br>sold abroad did not rank as copyright infringement&para;<br>under §602(a)(1). Id., at 143–154. See also id., at 154&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (Quality King “involve[d] a&para;<br>‘round trip’ journey, travel of the copies in question from&para;<br>the United States to places abroad, then back again”).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In 2008, Congress renumbered what was previously §602(a) as&para;<br>§602(a)(1).

Drawing on an&para;<br>example discussed during a 1964 public meeting on pro­&para;<br>posed revisions to the U.

As the Court recognizes, ante, at&para;<br>3, this case turns on the meaning of the phrase “lawfully&para;<br>made under this title” in §109(a). In my view, that phrase&para;<br>is most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a&para;<br>copy’s creation is governed by, and conducted in compli­&para;<br>ance with, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. This reading is&para;<br>consistent with the Court’s interpretation of similar lan­&para;<br>guage in other statutes.

Ac­&para;<br>cording to the Court, the phrase “ ‘lawfully made under&para;<br>this title’ means made ‘in accordance with’ or ‘in compli­&para;<br>ance with’ the Copyright Act.” Ante, at 8. But the Court&para;<br>overlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites,&para;<br>ante, at 9, the word “under” commonly signals a relation­&para;<br>ship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regulated by another. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed.&para;<br>1990) (“under” “frequently” means “inferior” or “subordi­&para;<br>nate” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 18 Oxford&para;<br>English Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989) (“under” means,&para;<br>among other things, “[i]n accordance with (some regulative&para;<br>power or principle)” (emphasis added)). See also Webster’s&para;<br>Third New International Dictionary 2487 (1961) (“under”&para;<br>means, among other things, “in . . . a condition of subjection, regulation, or subordination” and “suffering re­&para;<br>striction, restraint, or control by”). Only by disregarding&para;<br>this established meaning of “under” can the Court arrive&para;<br>at the conclusion that Wiley’s foreign-manufactured text­&para;<br>books were “lawfully made under” U. S. copyright law,&para;<br>even though that law did not govern their creation. It is&para;<br>anomalous, however, to speak of particular conduct as&para;<br>“lawful” under an inapplicable law. For example, one&para;<br>might say that driving on the right side of the road in&para;<br>England is “lawful” under U. S. law, but that would be so&para;<br>only because U. S. law has nothing to say about the sub­&para;<br>ject. The governing law is English law, and English law&para;<br>demands that driving be done on the left side of the road.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The Court asserts that my position gives the word “lawfully” in&para;<br>§109(a) “little, if any, linguistic work to do.” Ante, at 9. That is not so.&para;<br>My reading gives meaning to each word in the phrase “lawfully made&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The logical implication of the Court’s definition of the&para;<br>word “under” is that any copy manufactured abroad—even&para;<br>a piratical one made without the copyright owner’s author­&para;<br>ization and in violation of the law of the country where it&para;<br>was created—would fall within the scope of §109(a). Any&para;<br>such copy would have been made “in accordance with” or&para;<br>“in compliance with” the U. S. Copyright Act, in the sense&para;<br>that manufacturing the copy did not violate the Act (be­&para;<br>cause the Act does not apply extraterritorially).&para;<br>The Court rightly refuses to accept such an absurd&para;<br>conclusion. Instead, it interprets §109(a) as applying only&para;<br>to copies whose making actually complied with Title 17, or&para;<br>would have complied with Title 17 had Title 17 been ap­&para;<br>plicable (i.e., had the copies been made in the United&para;<br>States). See ante, at 8 (“§109(a)’s ‘first sale’ doctrine would&para;<br>apply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture&para;<br>met the requirements of American copyright law.”). Con­&para;<br>gress, however, used express language when it called for&para;<br>such a counterfactual inquiry in 17 U. S. C. §§602(a)(2)&para;<br>and (b). See §602(a)(2) (“Importation into the United&para;<br>States or exportation from the United States, without the&para;<br>authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of&para;<br>copies or phonorecords, the making of which either consti­&para;<br>tuted an infringement of copyright, or which would have&para;<br>constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had&para;<br>been applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right&para;<br>to distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106.”&para;<br>(emphasis added)); §602(b) (“In a case where the making&para;<br>——————&para;<br>under this title.” The word “made” signifies that the conduct at issue is&para;<br>the creation or manufacture of a copy. See Webster’s Third New&para;<br>International Dictionary 1356 (1961) (defining “made” as “artificially&para;<br>produced by a manufacturing process”). The word “lawfully” indicates&para;<br>that for §109(a) to apply, the copy’s creation must have complied with&para;<br>some body of law.

Had&para;<br>Congress intended courts to engage in a similarly hypo­&para;<br>thetical inquiry under §109(a), Congress would pre­&para;<br>sumably have included similar language in that section.&para;<br>See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)&para;<br>(“ ‘[W]here Congress includes particular language in one&para;<br>section of a statute but omits it in another section of the&para;<br>same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts&para;<br>intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion&para;<br>or exclusion.’ ” (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo,&para;<br>472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972) (per curiam); brackets in&para;<br>original)).5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Attempting&para;<br>&para;<br>to show that my reading of §109(a) is susceptible to the&para;<br>same criticism, the Court points to the now-repealed “manufacturing&para;<br>clause,” which required “copies of a work consisting preponderantly of&para;<br>nondramatic literary material . . . in the English language” to be&para;<br>“manufactured in the United States or Canada.” Copyright Act of 1976,&para;<br>§601(a), 90 Stat. 2588. Because Congress expressly referred to manu­&para;<br>facturing in this provision, the Court contends, the phrase “lawfully&para;<br>made under this title” in §109(a) cannot mean “manufactured in the&para;<br>United States.” Ante, at 19. This argument is a non sequitur. I do not&para;<br>contend that the phrases “lawfully made under this title” and “manu­&para;<br>factured in the United States” are interchangeable. To repeat, I read&para;<br>the phrase “lawfully made under this title” as referring to instances in&para;<br>which a copy’s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance&para;<br>with, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. See supra, at 6. Not all copies “manu­&para;<br>factured in the United States” will satisfy this standard. For example,&para;<br>piratical copies manufactured in the United States without the copy­&para;<br>right owner’s authorization are not “lawfully made under [Title 17].”&para;<br>Nor would the phrase “lawfully manufactured in the United States” be&para;<br>an exact substitute for “lawfully made under this title.” The making of&para;<br>a copy may be lawful under Title 17 yet still violate some other provi­&para;<br>sion of law. Consider, for example, a copy made with the copyright&para;<br>owner’s authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum&para;<br>wage. The copy would be “lawfully made under [Title 17]” in the sense&para;<br>that its creation would not violate any provision of that title, but the&para;<br>copy’s manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the viola­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>KIRTSAENG v.

As the Court appears to acknowledge, see ante, at&para;<br>26, the only independent effect §602(a)(1) has under to­&para;<br>day’s decision is to prohibit unauthorized importations&para;<br>carried out by persons who merely have possession of, but&para;<br>do not own, the imported copies.

For example,&para;<br>had Congress conceived of §109(a)’s sweep as the Court&para;<br>does, what earthly reason would there be to provide, as&para;<br>Congress did in §602(a)(3)(C), that a library may import&para;<br>“no more than five copies” of a non-audiovisual work for its&para;<br>“lending or archival purposes”?&para;<br>The far more plausible reading of §§109(a) and 602(a),&para;<br>then, is that Congress intended §109(a) to apply to copies&para;<br>made in the United States, not to copies manufactured&para;<br>and sold abroad. That reading of the first sale and impor­&para;<br>tation provisions leaves §602(a)(3)’s exceptions with real,&para;<br>meaningful work to do. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534&para;<br>U.

Cf. ante, at 19–21.&para;<br>For example, if Wiley, rather than Kirtsaeng, had&para;<br>imported into the United States and then sold the foreign­&para;<br>made textbooks at issue in this case, Wiley’s §106(3) dis­&para;<br>tribution right would have been exhausted under the&para;<br>rationale of Bobbs-Merrill.

If, as I&para;<br>maintain, the term “distribute” in §106(3) incorporates the&para;<br>first sale doctrine by virtue of Bobbs-Merrill, then&para;<br>§109(a)’s codification of that doctrine adds little to the&para;<br>regulatory regime.20 Section 109(a), however, does serve&para;<br>——————&para;<br>that the exclusive rights to “publish” and “vend” works under the&para;<br>Copyright Act of 1947, §1(a), 61 Stat. 652–653, were “redundant”).&para;<br>20 My position that Bobbs-Merrill lives on as a limiting construction of&para;<br>the §106(3) distribution right does not leave §109(a) with no work to do.&para;<br>There can be little doubt that the books at issue in Bobbs-Merrill were&para;<br>published and first sold in the United States.

Congress first codified the first&para;<br>sale doctrine in §41 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat.&para;<br>1084.21 It did so, the House Committee Report on the&para;<br>1909 Act explains, “in order to make . . . clear that [Con­&para;<br>gress had] no intention [of] enlarg[ing] in any way the&para;<br>construction to be given to the word ‘vend.’ ” H. R. Rep.&para;<br>No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1909). According to the&para;<br>Committee Report, §41 was “not intended to change [exist­&para;<br>ing law] in any way.” Ibid. The position I have stated and&para;<br>explained accords with this expression of congressional&para;<br>intent. In enacting §41 and its successors, I would hold,&para;<br>Congress did not “change . . . existing law,” ibid., by strip­&para;<br>ping the word “vend” (and thus its substitute “distribute”)&para;<br>of the limiting construction imposed in Bobbs-Merrill.&para;<br>In any event, the reading of the Copyright Act to which&para;<br>I subscribe honors Congress’ aim in enacting §109(a)&para;<br>while the Court’s reading of the Act severely diminishes&para;<br>§602(a)(1)’s role. See supra, at 10–12. My position in no&para;<br>way tugs against the principle underlying §109(a)—i.e.,&para;<br>that certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>States with the copyright owner’s permission, not when it is distributed&para;<br>abroad. But under §109(a), as interpreted in Quality King, any author­&para;<br>ized distribution of a U. S.-made copy, even a distribution occurring in&para;<br>a foreign country, exhausts the copyright owner’s distribution right&para;<br>under §106(3). See 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14. Section 109(a) therefore&para;<br>provides for exhaustion in a circumstance not reached by Bobbs-Merrill.&para;<br>21 Section 41 of the 1909 Act provided: “[N]othing in this Act shall be&para;<br>deemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a&para;<br>copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.”&para;<br>35 Stat. 1084. This language was repeated without material change in&para;<br>§27 of the Copyright Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 660. As noted above, see&para;<br>supra, at 2, 17 U. S.
