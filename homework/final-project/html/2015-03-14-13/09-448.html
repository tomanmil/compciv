RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE&para;<br>&para;<br>CO. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–448.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 26, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>After medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she&para;<br>filed for long-term disability benefits under her employer’s long-term&para;<br>disability plan. Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt&para;<br>sued respondent Reliance, her employer’s disability insurance car&para;<br>rier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income&para;<br>Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits&para;<br>claim. The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, find&para;<br>ing that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical infor&para;<br>mation, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.&para;<br>Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that&para;<br>it found “compelling evidence” in the record that she was totally dis&para;<br>abled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that&para;<br>it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to ad&para;<br>dress the deficiencies in its approach. The court therefore remanded&para;<br>to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act&para;<br>on Hardt’s application, or else the court would enter judgment in&para;<br>Hardt’s favor. Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt bene&para;<br>fits. Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S. C. §1132(g)(1), a fee&para;<br>shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides&para;<br>that “the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney’s fee&para;<br>and costs . . . to either party.” Granting the motion, the District&para;<br>Court applied the Circuit’s framework governing attorney’s fee re&para;<br>quests in ERISA cases, concluding, inter alia, that Hardt had at&para;<br>tained the requisite “prevailing party” status. The Fourth Circuit va&para;<br>cated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that&para;<br>she qualified as a “prevailing party” under the rule set forth in Buck&para;<br>hannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a&para;<br>“prevailing party” only if he has obtained an “enforceable judgmen[t]&para;<br>on the merits ” or a “court-ordered consent decre[e]. ” The court rea&para;<br>soned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to&para;<br>award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment&para;<br>on the merits.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. A fee claimant need not be a “prevailing party” to be eligible for&para;<br>an attorney’s fees award under §1132(g)(1). Interpreting the section&para;<br>to require a party to attain that status is contrary to §1132(g)(1)’s&para;<br>plain text. The words “prevailing party” do not appear in the provi&para;<br>sion. Nor does anything else in §1132(g)(1)’s text purport to limit the&para;<br>availability of attorney’s fees to a “prevailing party.” Instead,&para;<br>§1132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts “discretion” to award at&para;<br>torney’s fees “to either party.” (Emphasis added.) That language&para;<br>contrasts sharply with §1132(g)(2), which governs the availability of&para;<br>attorney’s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer con&para;<br>tributions to a multiemployer plan. In such cases, only plaintiffs who&para;<br>obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan” may seek attorney’s fees.&para;<br>§1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes&para;<br>clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the avail&para;<br>ability of attorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to&para;<br>include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party” requirement, the&para;<br>Fourth Circuit’s decision adding that term of art to the statute more&para;<br>closely resembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]&para;<br>one.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>2. A court may award fees and costs under §1132(g)(1), as long as&para;<br>the fee claimant has achieved “some degree of success on the merits.”&para;<br>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694. The bedrock princi&para;<br>ple known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of refer&para;<br>ence: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s fees, win or lose, unless a&para;<br>statute or contract provides otherwise. E.g., id., at 683–686. This&para;<br>Court’s “prevailing party” precedents do not govern here because that&para;<br>term of art does not appear in §1132(g)(1). Instead, the Court inter&para;<br>prets §1132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that&para;<br>deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney’s fees based&para;<br>on other criteria. Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authoriz&para;<br>ing a fees award if the court “determines that such an award is ap&para;<br>propriate,” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f), is the principal case in that category.&para;<br>Applying that decision’s interpretive approach to 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1132(g)(1), the Court first looks to “the language of the section,” 463&para;<br>U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attor&para;<br>ney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to either party.” Ruckelshaus also lays&para;<br>down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discre&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion. Because here, as in the statute in Ruckelshaus, Congress failed&para;<br>to indicate clearly that it “meant to abandon historic fee-shifting&para;<br>principles and intuitive notions of fairness,” 463 U. S., at 686, a fees&para;<br>claimant must show “some degree of success on the merits” before a&para;<br>court may award attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1), see id., at 694.&para;<br>Hardt has satisfied that standard. Though she failed to win sum&para;<br>mary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless&para;<br>found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that&para;<br>it was inclined to rule in her favor. She also obtained the remand or&para;<br>der, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, re&para;<br>versed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought. Accord&para;<br>ingly, the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award&para;<br>Hardt attorney’s fees. Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>336 Fed.

The Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Fourth Circuit has interpreted §1132(g)(1) to re&para;<br>quire that a fee claimant be a “prevailing party” before he&para;<br>may seek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as&para;<br>contrary to §1132(g)(1)’s plain text.

Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with&para;<br>carpal tunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her&para;<br>wrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in January 2003.&para;<br>In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability&para;<br>benefits from Dan River’s Group Long-Term Disability&para;<br>Insurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers&para;<br>the Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reli&para;<br>ance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a&para;<br>claimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and under&para;<br>writes any benefits awarded. Reliance provisionally ap&para;<br>proved Hardt’s claim, telling her that final approval&para;<br>hinged on her performance in a functional capacities&para;<br>evaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal&para;<br>tunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.&para;<br>Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in&para;<br>October 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt’s medical&para;<br>history, observed her resulting physical limitations, and&para;<br>ultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount&para;<br>of sedentary work. Based on this finding, Reliance con&para;<br>cluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the&para;<br>meaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability&para;<br>benefits. Hardt filed an administrative appeal. Reliance&para;<br>reversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally&para;<br>disabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore&para;<br>entitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.&para;<br>While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt&para;<br>began experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,&para;<br>including tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physi&para;<br>cians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condi&para;<br>tion that increased her pain and decreased her physical&para;<br>capabilities over the ensuing months.&para;<br>Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Admini&para;<br>stration for disability benefits under the Social Security&para;<br>Act. Her application included questionnaires completed&para;<br>by two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt’s&para;<br>symptoms and stated the doctors’ conclusion that Hardt&para;<br>could not return to full gainful employment because of her&para;<br>neuropathy and other ailments. In February 2005, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Social Security Administration granted Hardt’s applica&para;<br>tion and awarded her disability benefits.&para;<br>About two months later, Reliance told Hardt that her&para;<br>Plan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month&para;<br>period. Reliance explained that under the Plan’s terms,&para;<br>only individuals who are “totally disabled from all occupa&para;<br>tions” were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that,&para;<br>based on its review of Hardt’s records, Hardt was not&para;<br>“totally disabled” as defined by the Plan. Reliance also&para;<br>demanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset&para;<br>the disability benefits she had received from the Social&para;<br>Security Administration. (The Plan contains a provision&para;<br>coordinating benefits with Social Security payments.)&para;<br>Hardt paid Reliance the offset.&para;<br>Hardt then filed another administrative appeal. She&para;<br>gave Reliance all of her medical records, the question&para;<br>naires she had submitted to the Social Security Admini&para;<br>stration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her&para;<br>physicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this&para;<br>material with another functional capacities evaluation.&para;<br>When Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation,&para;<br>it did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuro&para;<br>pathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt had been&para;<br>diagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.&para;<br>Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December&para;<br>2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January&para;<br>2006. The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid&para;<br>because Hardt’s efforts were “submaximal.” Id., at 37a.&para;<br>One evaluator recorded that Hardt “refused multiple tests&para;<br>. . . for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.”&para;<br>Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation,&para;<br>Reliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation&para;<br>counselor to help it resolve Hardt’s administrative appeal.&para;<br>The physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he re&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>viewed some, but not all, of Hardt’s medical records.&para;<br>Based on that review, the physician produced a report in&para;<br>which he opined that Hardt’s health was expected to&para;<br>improve. His report, however, did not mention Hardt’s&para;<br>pain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt’s at&para;<br>tending physicians had completed as part of her applica&para;<br>tion for Social Security benefits. The vocational rehabili&para;<br>tation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study&para;<br>(based on Hardt’s health in 2003) that identified eight&para;<br>employment opportunities suitable for Hardt. After re&para;<br>viewing the physician’s report, the labor market study,&para;<br>and the results of the 2003 functional capacities evalua&para;<br>tion, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate&para;<br>Hardt’s benefits was correct. It advised Hardt of this&para;<br>decision in March 2006.&para;<br>After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt&para;<br>sued Reliance in the United States District Court for the&para;<br>Eastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance&para;<br>violated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long&para;<br>term disability benefits. See §1132(a)(1)(B). The parties&para;<br>filed cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which&para;<br>the District Court denied.&para;<br>The court first rejected Reliance’s request for summary&para;<br>judgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that&para;<br>“Reliance’s decision to deny benefits was based on incom&para;<br>plete information.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most&para;<br>prominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations&para;<br>to which Hardt had submitted had “assessed the impact of&para;<br>neuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.” Ibid. In&para;<br>addition, the reviewing physician’s report “was itself&para;<br>incomplete”; the basis for the physician’s “medical conclu&para;<br>sions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,” ibid., and&para;<br>the physician had “failed to cite any medical evidence to&para;<br>support his conclusions,” id., at 43a, or “to address the&para;<br>treating physicians’ contradictory medical findings,” id., at&para;<br>44a. The court also found that Reliance had “improperly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,”&para;<br>id., at 45a, and had “further ignored the substantial&para;<br>amount of pain medication Ms. Hardt’s treating physi&para;<br>cians had prescribed to her,” id., at 46a. Accordingly, the&para;<br>court thought it “clear that Reliance’s decision to deny Ms.&para;<br>Hardt long-term disability benefits was not based on&para;<br>substantial evidence.” Id., at 47a.&para;<br>The District Court then denied Hardt’s motion for sum&para;<br>mary judgment, which contended that Reliance’s decision&para;<br>to deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In&para;<br>so doing, however, the court found “compelling evidence”&para;<br>in the record that “Ms. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to&para;<br>her neuropathy.” Id., at 48a. Although it was “inclined to&para;<br>rule in Ms. Hardt’s favor,” the court concluded that “it&para;<br>would be unwise to take this step without first giving&para;<br>Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its ap&para;<br>proach.” Ibid. In the District Court’s view, a remand to&para;<br>Reliance was warranted because “[t]his case presents one&para;<br>of those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed&para;<br>to comply with the ERISA guidelines,” meaning “Ms.&para;<br>Hardt did not get the kind of review to which she was&para;<br>entitled under applicable law.” Ibid. Accordingly, the&para;<br>court instructed “Reliance to act on Ms. Hardt’s applica&para;<br>tion by adequately considering all the evidence” within 30&para;<br>days; “[o]therwise,” it warned, “judgment will be issued in&para;<br>favor of Ms. Hardt.” Id., at 49a.&para;<br>Reliance did as instructed.&para;<br>After conducting that&para;<br>review, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term dis&para;<br>ability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due&para;<br>benefits.&para;<br>Hardt then moved for attorney’s fees and costs under&para;<br>§1132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under&para;<br>the three-step framework that governed fee requests in&para;<br>ERISA cases under Circuit precedent. At step one of that&para;<br>framework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant&para;<br>is a “ ‘prevailing party.’ ” Id., at 15a–16a (quoting Martin&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115 F. 3d&para;<br>1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing Buckhannon Board &amp;&para;<br>Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and&para;<br>Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee&para;<br>claimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds&para;<br>to step two and “determin[es] whether an award of attor&para;<br>neys’ fees is appropriate” by examining “five factors.”1&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors&para;<br>suggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court “must&para;<br>review the attorneys’ fees and costs requested and limit&para;<br>them to a reasonable amount.” Id., at 17a (citing Hensley&para;<br>v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).&para;<br>Applying that framework, the District Court granted&para;<br>Hardt’s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a pre&para;<br>vailing party because the court’s remand order “sanctioned&para;<br>a material change in the legal relationship of the parties&para;<br>by ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to&para;<br>which [Hardt] was entitled.” Id., at 22a. The court recog&para;<br>nized that the order did not “sanctio[n] a certain result on&para;<br>remand,” but found that it “quite clearly expressed the&para;<br>consequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its&para;<br>reconsideration in an expeditious manner.” Id., at 19a.&para;<br>Accordingly, the remand order “signif[ied] that the court&para;<br>was displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance]&para;<br>had initially given to [Hardt’s] claim, but was inclined to&para;<br>reserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a&para;<br>proper review of all of the medical evidence.” Ibid. The&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 These factors are: “ ‘(1) the degree of opposing parties’ culpability or&para;<br>bad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attor&para;<br>neys’ fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys’ fees against the opposing&para;<br>parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;&para;<br>(4) whether the parties requesting attorneys’ fees sought to benefit all&para;<br>participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a signifi&para;<br>cant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits&para;<br>of the parties’ positions.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting Quesin&para;<br>berry v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., 987 F. 2d 1017, 1029 (CA4 1993)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

According to&para;<br>the Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one&para;<br>inquiry—i.e., she failed to establish that she was a “pre&para;<br>vailing party.” In reaching that conclusion, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals relied on this Court’s decision in Buckhannon,&para;<br>under which a fee claimant qualifies as a “prevailing&para;<br>party” only if he has obtained an “ ‘enforceable judgmen[t]&para;<br>on the merits’ ” or a “ ‘court-ordered consent decre[e].’ ” 336&para;<br>Fed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) (per curiam) (quoting 532&para;<br>U. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that be&para;<br>cause the remand order “did not require Reliance to award&para;<br>benefits to Hardt,” it did “not constitute an ‘enforceable&para;<br>judgment on the merits’ as Buckhannon requires,” thus&para;<br>precluding Hardt from establishing prevailing party&para;<br>status. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336 (brackets omitted).&para;<br>Hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking&para;<br>review of two aspects of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.&para;<br>First, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that&para;<br>§1132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney’s fees only to&para;<br>a “prevailing party”?2 Second, did the Court of Appeals&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue. Some (a few only&para;<br>tentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion here that only&para;<br>prevailing parties are entitled to fees under §1132(g)(1). See, e.g.,&para;<br>Cottrill v.

In such cases,&para;<br>only plaintiffs who obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan”&para;<br>may seek attorney’s fees. §1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast&para;<br>between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress&para;<br>knows how to impose express limits on the availability of&para;<br>attorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed&para;<br>to include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party”&para;<br>limit on the availability of attorney’s fees, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting&para;<br>statute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely&para;<br>resembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]&para;<br>one.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359&para;<br>(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question,&para;<br>particularly given Reliance’s concessions. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 9–10 (“On its face,” §1132(g)(1) “does not&para;<br>expressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant&para;<br>be a ‘prevailing party’ before receiving attorney’s fees”).&para;<br>We therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a “pre&para;<br>vailing party” to be eligible for an attorney’s fees award&para;<br>under §1132(g)(1).&para;<br>III&para;<br>We next consider the circumstances under which a court&para;<br>may award attorney’s fees pursuant to §1132(g)(1). “Our&para;<br>basic point of reference” when considering the award of&para;<br>attorney’s fees is the bedrock principle known as the&para;<br>“ ‘American Rule’ ”: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s&para;<br>fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides&para;<br>otherwise.

CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>see also Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various&para;<br>forms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to&para;<br>award attorney’s fees only to a “prevailing party.” 3 Others&para;<br>permit a “substantially prevailing” party 4 or a “successful”&para;<br>litigant 5 to obtain fees. Still others authorize district&para;<br>courts to award attorney’s fees where “appropriate,” 6 or&para;<br>simply vest district courts with “discretion” to award fees.7&para;<br>Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule,&para;<br>we have most often considered statutes containing an&para;<br>express “prevailing party” requirement. See, e.g., Texas&para;<br>State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,&para;<br>489 U. S. 782, 792–793 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.

Our “prevailing&para;<br>party” precedents, however, do not govern the availability&para;<br>of fees awards under §1132(g)(1), because this provision&para;<br>does not limit the availability of attorney’s fees to the&para;<br>“prevailing party.” Supra, at 8–9; see also Gross, supra, at&para;<br>___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts “conducting statu&para;<br>tory interpretation . . . ‘not to apply rules applicable under&para;<br>one statute to a different statute without careful and&para;<br>critical examination’ ” (quoting Federal Express Corp. v.&para;<br>Holowecki, 552 U.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vailing party.” In that line of precedents, Ruckelshaus is&para;<br>the principal case. There, the Court interpreted §307(f) of&para;<br>the Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees&para;<br>“whenever it determines that such an award is appropri&para;<br>ate.” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f). We began by noting that be&para;<br>cause nothing in §307(f)’s text “clear[ly] show[ed]” that&para;<br>Congress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S.,&para;<br>at 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating&para;<br>success to be eligible for a fees award under that section,&para;<br>id., at 686. We then concluded that by using the less&para;<br>stringent “whenever . . . appropriate” standard instead of&para;<br>the traditional “prevailing party” standard, Congress had&para;<br>“expand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards&para;<br>from prevailing parties to partially prevailing parties—&para;<br>parties achieving some success, even if not major success.”&para;<br>Id., at 688. We thus held “that, absent some degree of&para;<br>success on the merits by the claimant, it is not ‘appropri&para;<br>ate’ for a federal court to award attorney’s fees under&para;<br>§307(f).” Id., at 694.&para;<br>Applying the interpretive approach we employed in&para;<br>Ruckelshaus to §1132(g)(1), we first look to “the language&para;<br>of the section,” id., at 682, which unambiguously allows a&para;<br>court to award attorney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to&para;<br>either party,” §1132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with&para;<br>such broad discretion are well known in the law, particu&para;<br>larly in the attorney’s fees context. See, e.g., n. 7, supra;&para;<br>see also Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).&para;<br>Equally well known, however, is the fact that a “judge’s&para;<br>discretion is not unlimited.” Ibid. Consistent with Cir&para;<br>cuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to&para;<br>guide its discretion in deciding whether to award attor&para;<br>ney’s fees under §1132(g)(1). See supra, at 6, and n. 1.&para;<br>Because these five factors bear no obvious relation to&para;<br>§1132(g)(1)’s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they&para;<br>are not required for channeling a court’s discretion when&para;<br>awarding fees under this section.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Instead, Ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to&para;<br>guide a court in exercising the discretion that §1132(g)(1)&para;<br>grants. As in the statute at issue in Ruckelshaus, Con&para;<br>gress failed to indicate clearly in §1132(g)(1) that it&para;<br>“meant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and&para;<br>intuitive notions of fairness.” 463 U. S., at 686. Accord&para;<br>ingly, a fees claimant must show “some degree of success&para;<br>on the merits” before a court may award attorney’s fees&para;<br>under §1132(g)(1), id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy&para;<br>that requirement by achieving “trivial success on the&para;<br>merits” or a “purely procedural victor[y],” but does satisfy&para;<br>it if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation&para;<br>some success on the merits without conducting a “lengthy&para;<br>inquir[y] into the question whether a particular party’s&para;<br>success was ‘substantial’ or occurred on a ‘central issue.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 688, n. 9.8&para;<br>Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should&para;<br>govern fee requests under §1132(g)(1), see Brief for Re&para;<br>spondent 13–31, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.&para;<br>Specifically, Reliance contends that a court order remand&para;<br>ing an ERISA claim for further consideration can never&para;<br>constitute “some success on the merits,” even if such a&para;<br>remand results in an award of benefits. See id., at 34–50.&para;<br>Reliance’s argument misses the point, given the facts of&para;<br>this case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that&para;<br>“the plan administrator has failed to comply with the&para;<br>ERISA guidelines” and “that Ms. Hardt did not get the&para;<br>kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable&para;<br>law.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U.
