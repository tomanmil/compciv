WINN ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–987.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 3, 2010—Decided April 4, 2011*&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents, Arizona taxpayers, sued petitioner Director of the State&para;<br>Department of Revenue, challenging Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §43–1089&para;<br>on Establishment Clause grounds. The Arizona law gives tax credits&para;<br>for contributions to school tuition organizations, or STOs, which then&para;<br>use the contributions to provide scholarships to students attending&para;<br>private schools, including religious schools. Petitioner Arizona Chris&para;<br>tian School Tuition Organization and others later intervened. The&para;<br>District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. Revers&para;<br>ing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents had standing as taxpay&para;<br>ers under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, and had stated an Establish&para;<br>ment Clause claim.&para;<br>Held: Because respondents challenge a tax credit as opposed to a gov&para;<br>ernmental expenditure, they lack Article III standing under Flast v.&para;<br>Cohen, supra. Pp. 4–19.&para;<br>(a) Article III vests in the Federal Judiciary the “Power” to resolve&para;<br>“Cases” and “Controversies.” That language limits the Federal Judi&para;<br>ciary to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts: redressing in&para;<br>juries resulting from a specific legal dispute. To obtain a ruling on&para;<br>the merits in federal court a plaintiff must assert more than just the&para;<br>“generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance.”&para;<br>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 217.&para;<br>Instead the plaintiff must establish standing, which requires “an ‘in&para;<br>jury in fact’”; “a causal connection between the injury and the conduct&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 09–991, Garriott, Director, Arizona Department&para;<br>of Revenue v. Winn et al., also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>complained of”; and a conclusion that it is “‘likely,’ as opposed to&para;<br>merely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable&para;<br>decision.’ ” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561.&para;<br>Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) In general, the mere fact that someone is a taxpayer does not&para;<br>provide standing to seek relief in federal court. The typical assertion&para;<br>of taxpayer standing rests on unjustifiable economic and political&para;<br>speculation. See Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447; Doremus v.&para;<br>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429. When a government ex&para;<br>pends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not nec&para;<br>essarily suffer. Even assuming the State’s coffers are depleted, find&para;<br>ing injury would require a court to speculate “that elected officials&para;<br>will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff’s tax bill to make up a deficit.”&para;<br>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 344. And to find re&para;<br>dressability a court must assume that, were the taxpayers’ remedy&para;<br>allowed, “legislators [would] pass along the supposed increased reve&para;<br>nue in the form of tax reductions.” Ibid. These conclusions apply to&para;<br>the present cases. The costs of education may be a significant portion&para;<br>of Arizona’s annual budget, but the tax credit, by facilitating the op&para;<br>eration of both religious and secular private schools, could relieve the&para;<br>burden on public schools and provide cost savings to the State. Even&para;<br>if the tax credit had an adverse effect on Arizona’s budget, problems&para;<br>would remain. To find a particular injury in fact would require&para;<br>speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue shortfalls by in&para;<br>creasing respondents’ tax liability. A causation finding would depend&para;<br>on the additional assumption that any tax increase would be trace&para;<br>able to the STO tax credit. And respondents have not established&para;<br>that an injunction against the credit’s application would prompt Ari&para;<br>zona legislators to “pass along [any] increased revenue [as] tax reduc&para;<br>tions.” Ibid. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(c) Respondents’ suit does not fall within the narrow exception to&para;<br>the rule against taxpayer standing established in Flast v. Cohen, su&para;<br>pra. There, federal taxpayers had standing to mount an Establish&para;<br>ment Clause challenge to a federal statute providing General Treas&para;<br>ury funds to support, inter alia, textbook purchases for religious&para;<br>schools. To have standing under Flast, taxpayers must show (1) a&para;<br>“logical link” between the plaintiff’s taxpayer status “and the type of&para;<br>legislative enactment attacked,” and (2) “a nexus” between such tax&para;<br>payer status and “the precise nature of the constitutional infringe&para;<br>ment alleged.” 392 U. S., at 102. Considering the two requirements&para;<br>together, Flast explained that individuals suffer a particular injury&para;<br>when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of “the&para;<br>taxing and spending power,” their property is transferred through&para;<br>the Government’s Treasury to a sectarian entity. Id., at 105–106.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“The taxpayer’s allegation in such cases would be that his tax money&para;<br>is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.” Id., at 106. The&para;<br>STO tax credit does not visit the injury identified in Flast. When the&para;<br>Government spends funds from the General Treasury, dissenting&para;<br>taxpayers know that they have been made to contribute to an establishment in violation of conscience. In contrast, a tax credit allows&para;<br>dissenting taxpayers to use their own funds in accordance with their&para;<br>own consciences. Here, the STO tax credit does not “extrac[t] and&para;<br>spen[d]” a conscientious dissenter’s funds in service of an establishment, 392 U. S., at 106, or “ ‘force a citizen to contribute’ ” to a sectarian organization, id., at 103. Rather, taxpayers are free to pay their&para;<br>own tax bills without contributing to an STO, to contribute to a religious or secular STO of their choice, or to contribute to other charitable organizations. Because the STO tax credit is not tantamount to a&para;<br>religious tax, respondents have not alleged an injury for standing&para;<br>purposes. Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements&para;<br>of causation and redressability. When the government collects and&para;<br>spends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the&para;<br>transfer of wealth; the resulting subsidy of religious activity is, under&para;<br>Flast, traceable to the government’s expenditures; and an injunction&para;<br>against those expenditures would address taxpayer-plaintiffs’ objections of conscience. Here, by contrast, contributions result from the&para;<br>decisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private&para;<br>citizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and&para;<br>taxpayers then contribute to STOs. Any injury the objectors may suffer are not fairly traceable to the government. And, while an injunction most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy&para;<br>would not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments.&para;<br>Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>(d) Respondents’ contrary position—that Arizonans benefiting from&para;<br>the tax credit in effect are paying their state income tax to STOs—&para;<br>assumes that all income is government property, even if it has not&para;<br>come into the tax collector’s hands. That premise finds no basis in&para;<br>standing jurisprudence. This Court has sometimes reached the merits&para;<br>in Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits as opposed to&para;<br>governmental expenditures. See Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388;&para;<br>Committee for Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756;&para;<br>Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734; Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New&para;<br>York, 397 U. S. 664. But those cases did not mention standing and so&para;<br>do not stand for the proposition that no jurisdictional defects existed.&para;<br>Moreover, it is far from clear that any nonbinding sub silentio standing&para;<br>determinations in those cases depended on Flast, as there are other&para;<br>ways of establishing standing in Establishment Clause cases involving&para;<br>tax benefits.

STOs use these contribu­&para;<br>tions to provide scholarships to students attending private&para;<br>schools, many of which are religious. Respondents are a&para;<br>group of Arizona taxpayers who challenge the STO tax&para;<br>credit as a violation of Establishment Clause principles&para;<br>under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the&para;<br>Arizona Supreme Court rejected a similar Establishment&para;<br>Clause claim on the merits, respondents sought interven­&para;<br>tion from the Federal Judiciary.&para;<br>To obtain a determination on the merits in federal court,&para;<br>parties seeking relief must show that they have standing&para;<br>under Article III of the Constitution. Standing in Estab­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways.&para;<br>Some plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the&para;<br>direct harm of what is claimed to be an establishment of&para;<br>religion, such as a mandatory prayer in a public school&para;<br>classroom. See School Dist. of Abington Township v.&para;<br>Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 224, n. 9 (1963). Other plaintiffs&para;<br>may demonstrate standing on the ground that they have&para;<br>incurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of their&para;<br>religion. Those costs and benefits can result from alleged&para;<br>discrimination in the tax code, such as when the availabil­&para;<br>ity of a tax exemption is conditioned on religious affilia­&para;<br>tion. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 8&para;<br>(1989) (plurality opinion).&para;<br>For their part, respondents contend that they have&para;<br>standing to challenge Arizona’s STO tax credit for one and&para;<br>only one reason: because they are Arizona taxpayers. But&para;<br>the mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally&para;<br>deemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court.&para;<br>To overcome that rule, respondents must rely on an excep­&para;<br>tion created in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968). For the&para;<br>reasons discussed below, respondents cannot take advan­&para;<br>tage of Flast’s narrow exception to the general rule against&para;<br>taxpayer standing. As a consequence, respondents lacked&para;<br>standing to commence this action, and their suit must be&para;<br>dismissed for want of jurisdiction.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondents challenged §43–1089, a provision of the&para;<br>Arizona Tax Code. See 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws §43–1087,&para;<br>codified, as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §43–1089&para;<br>(West Supp. 2010). Section 43–1089 allows Arizona tax­&para;<br>payers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to $500&para;<br>per person and $1,000 per married couple for contribu­&para;<br>tions to STOs. §43–1089(A). If the credit exceeds an&para;<br>individual’s tax liability, the credit’s unused portion can be&para;<br>carried forward up to five years. §43–1089(D). Under a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

See §43–1089 (West&para;<br>2006). The organization was required to be exempt from&para;<br>federal taxation under §501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue&para;<br>Code of 1986. §43–1089(G)(3) (West Supp. 2005). It could&para;<br>not limit its scholarships to students attending only one&para;<br>school. Ibid. And it had to allocate “at least ninety per&para;<br>cent of its annual revenue for educational scholarships or&para;<br>tuition grants” to children attending qualified schools.&para;<br>Ibid. A “qualified school,” in turn, was defined in part as a&para;<br>private school in Arizona that did not discriminate on the&para;<br>basis of race, color, handicap, familial status, or national&para;<br>origin. §43–1089(G)(2).&para;<br>In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona tax­&para;<br>payers challenged §43–1089, invoking both the United&para;<br>States Constitution and the Arizona Constitution. The&para;<br>Arizona Supreme Court rejected the taxpayers’ claims on&para;<br>the merits. Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P. 2d&para;<br>606 (1999). This Court denied certiorari. Rhodes v.&para;<br>Killian, 528 U. S. 810 (1999); Kotterman v. Killian, 528&para;<br>U.

It named the Direc­&para;<br>tor of the Arizona Department of Revenue as defendant.&para;<br>The Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that&para;<br>§43–1089 violates the Establishment Clause of the First&para;<br>Amendment, as incorporated against the States by the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment. Respondents alleged that §43–&para;<br>1089 allows STOs “to use State income-tax revenues to&para;<br>pay tuition for students at religious schools,” some of&para;<br>which “discriminate on the basis of religion in selecting&para;<br>students.” Complaint in No. 00–0287 (D Ariz.), ¶¶29–31,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09–987, pp. 125a–126a.

The&para;<br>District Court once more dismissed respondents’ suit, this&para;<br>time for failure to state a claim. Once again, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals reversed. It held that respondents had standing&para;<br>under Flast v. Cohen, supra. 562 F. 3d 1002 (CA9 2009).&para;<br>Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals ruled that&para;<br>respondents had stated a claim that §43–1089 violated the&para;<br>Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The full&para;<br>Court of Appeals denied en banc review, with eight judges&para;<br>dissenting. 586 F. 3d 649 (CA9 2009). This Court granted&para;<br>certiorari. 560 U. S. __ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The concept and operation of the separation of powers&para;<br>in our National Government have their principal founda­&para;<br>tion in the first three Articles of the Constitution. Under&para;<br>Article III, the Federal Judiciary is vested with the&para;<br>“Power” to resolve not questions and issues but “Cases” or&para;<br>“Controversies.” This language restricts the federal judi­&para;<br>cial power “to the traditional role of the Anglo-American&para;<br>courts.” Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488,&para;<br>___ (2009) (slip op., at 4). In the English legal tradition,&para;<br>the need to redress an injury resulting from a specific&para;<br>dispute taught the efficacy of judicial resolution and gave&para;<br>legitimacy to judicial decrees. The importance of resolving&para;<br>specific cases was visible, for example, in the incremental&para;<br>approach of the common law and in equity’s consideration&para;<br>of exceptional circumstances. The Framers paid heed to&para;<br>these lessons. See U. S. Const., Art. III, § 2 (“The judicial&para;<br>Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity . . . ”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Reservists Comm. to Stop the&para;<br>War, 418 U. S. 208, 217 (1974).&para;<br>Continued adherence to the case-or-controversy re­&para;<br>quirement of Article III maintains the public’s confidence&para;<br>in an unelected but restrained Federal Judiciary. If the&para;<br>judicial power were “extended to every question under the&para;<br>constitution,” Chief Justice Marshall once explained,&para;<br>federal courts might take possession of “almost every&para;<br>subject proper for legislative discussion and decision.” 4&para;<br>Papers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984) (quoted in&para;<br>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 341 (2006)).&para;<br>The legislative and executive departments of the Federal&para;<br>Government, no less than the judicial department, have a&para;<br>duty to defend the Constitution. See U. S. Const., Art. VI,&para;<br>cl. 3. That shared obligation is incompatible with the&para;<br>suggestion that federal courts might wield an “uncondi­&para;<br>tioned authority to determine the constitutionality of&para;<br>legislative or executive acts.” Valley Forge Christian&para;<br>College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and&para;<br>State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). For the federal&para;<br>courts to decide questions of law arising outside of cases&para;<br>and controversies would be inimical to the Constitution’s&para;<br>democratic character. And the resulting conflict between&para;<br>the judicial and the political branches would not, “in the&para;<br>long run, be beneficial to either.” United States v.&para;<br>Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 188–189 (1974) (Powell, J.,&para;<br>concurring). Instructed by Chief Justice Marshall’s admo­&para;<br>nition, this Court takes care to observe the “role assigned&para;<br>to the judiciary” within the Constitution’s “tripartite&para;<br>allocation of power.” Valley Forge, supra, at 474 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>To state a case or controversy under Article III, a plain­&para;<br>tiff must establish standing. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.&para;<br>737, 751 (1984). The minimum constitutional require­&para;<br>ments for standing were explained in Lujan v. Defenders&para;<br>of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992).&para;<br>“First, the plaintiff must have suffered an ‘injury in&para;<br>fact’—an invasion of a legally protected interest which&para;<br>is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) ‘actual or&para;<br>imminent, not “conjectural” or “hypothetical.’ ” Sec­&para;<br>ond, there must be a causal connection between the&para;<br>injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has&para;<br>to be ‘fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of&para;<br>the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the inde­&para;<br>pendent action of some third party not before the&para;<br>court.’ Third, it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely&para;<br>‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a fa­&para;<br>vorable decision.’ ” Id., at 560–561 (citations and foot­&para;<br>note omitted).&para;<br>In requiring a particular injury, the Court meant “that the&para;<br>injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individ­&para;<br>ual way.” Id., at 560, n. 1. The question now before the&para;<br>Court is whether respondents, the plaintiffs in the trial&para;<br>court, satisfy the requisite elements of standing.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Respondents suggest that their status as Arizona tax­&para;<br>payers provides them with standing to challenge the STO&para;<br>tax credit. Absent special circumstances, however, stand­&para;<br>ing cannot be based on a plaintiff’s mere status as a tax­&para;<br>payer. This Court has rejected the general proposition&para;<br>that an individual who has paid taxes has a “continuing,&para;<br>legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds&para;<br>are not used by the Government in a way that violates the&para;<br>Constitution.” Hein v.

Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923) (decided with&para;<br>Massachusetts v. Mellon). There, a taxpayer-plaintiff had&para;<br>alleged that certain federal expenditures were in excess&para;<br>of congressional authority under the Constitution. The&para;<br>plaintiff argued that she had standing to raise her claim&para;<br>because she had an interest in the Government Treasury&para;<br>and because the allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of&para;<br>Government funds would affect her personal tax liability.&para;<br>The Court rejected those arguments. The “effect upon&para;<br>future taxation, of any payment out of funds,” was too&para;<br>“remote, fluctuating and uncertain” to give rise to a case&para;<br>or controversy. Id., at 487. And the taxpayer-plaintiff’s&para;<br>“interest in the moneys of the Treasury,” the Court recog­&para;<br>nized, was necessarily “shared with millions of others.”&para;<br>Ibid. As a consequence, Frothingham held that the tax­&para;<br>payer-plaintiff had not presented a “judicial controversy”&para;<br>appropriate for resolution in federal court but rather a&para;<br>“matter of public . . . concern” that could be pursued only&para;<br>through the political process. Id., at 487–489.&para;<br>In a second pertinent case, Doremus v. Board of Ed. of&para;<br>Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429 (1952), the Court considered&para;<br>Frothingham’s prohibition on taxpayer standing in con­&para;<br>nection with an alleged Establishment Clause violation. A&para;<br>New Jersey statute had provided that public school teach­&para;<br>ers would read Bible verses to their students at the start&para;<br>of each schoolday. A plaintiff sought to have the law&para;<br>enjoined, asserting standing based on her status as a&para;<br>taxpayer.

It&para;<br>would be “pure speculation” to conclude that an injunction&para;<br>against a government expenditure or tax benefit “would&para;<br>result in any actual tax relief” for a taxpayer-plaintiff.&para;<br>ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion&para;<br>of KENNEDY, J.).&para;<br>These well-established principles apply to the present&para;<br>cases. Respondents may be right that Arizona’s STO tax&para;<br>credits have an estimated annual value of over $50 mil­&para;<br>lion. See Brief for Respondent Winn et al. 42; see also&para;<br>Arizona Dept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona’s&para;<br>Tax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 48 (preliminary Nov. 15,&para;<br>2010) (reporting the total estimated “value” of STO tax&para;<br>credits claimed over a 1-year period). The education of its&para;<br>young people is, of course, one of the State’s principal&para;<br>missions and responsibilities; and the consequent costs&para;<br>will make up a significant portion of the state budget.&para;<br>That, however, is just the beginning of the analysis.&para;<br>By helping students obtain scholarships to private&para;<br>schools, both religious and secular, the STO program&para;<br>might relieve the burden placed on Arizona’s public&para;<br>schools. The result could be an immediate and permanent&para;<br>cost savings for the State. See Brief for Petitioner Arizona&para;<br>Christian School Tuition Organization 31 (discussing&para;<br>studies indicating that the STO program may on net save&para;<br>the State money); see also Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388,&para;<br>395 (1983) (“By educating a substantial number of stu­&para;<br>dents [private] schools relieve public schools of a corre­&para;<br>spondingly great burden—to the benefit of all taxpayers”).&para;<br>Underscoring the potential financial benefits of the STO&para;<br>program, the average value of an STO scholarship may be&para;<br>far less than the average cost of educating an Arizona&para;<br>public school student. See Brief for Petitioner Garriott 38.&para;<br>Because it encourages scholarships for attendance at&para;<br>private schools, the STO tax credit may not cause the&para;<br>&para;<br>10 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>State to incur any financial loss.&para;<br>Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect&para;<br>on Arizona’s annual budget, problems would remain. To&para;<br>conclude there is a particular injury in fact would require&para;<br>speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue&para;<br>shortfalls by increasing respondents’ tax liability. Daim&para;<br>lerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. A finding of causation&para;<br>would depend on the additional determination that any&para;<br>tax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credits, as&para;<br>distinct from other governmental expenditures or other&para;<br>tax benefits. Respondents have not established that an&para;<br>injunction against application of the STO tax credit would&para;<br>prompt Arizona legislators to “pass along the supposed&para;<br>increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.” Ibid.&para;<br>Those matters, too, are conjectural.&para;<br>Each of the inferential steps to show causation and&para;<br>redressability depends on premises as to which there&para;<br>remains considerable doubt. The taxpayers have not&para;<br>shown that any interest they have in protecting the State&para;<br>Treasury would be advanced. Even were they to show&para;<br>some closer link, that interest is still of a general charac­&para;<br>ter, not particular to certain persons. Nor have the tax­&para;<br>payers shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition&para;<br>credit scheme. The rule against taxpayer standing, a rule&para;<br>designed both to avoid speculation and to insist on par­&para;<br>ticular injury, applies to respondents’ lawsuit. The tax­&para;<br>payers, then, must rely on an exception to the rule, an&para;<br>exception next to be considered.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The primary contention of respondents, of course, is&para;<br>that, despite the general rule that taxpayers lack standing&para;<br>to object to expenditures alleged to be unconstitutional,&para;<br>their suit falls within the exception established by Flast v.&para;<br>Cohen, 392 U. S. 83. It must be noted at the outset that,&para;<br>as this Court has explained, Flast’s holding provides a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“narrow exception” to “the general rule against taxpayer&para;<br>standing.” Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988).&para;<br>At issue in Flast was the standing of federal taxpayers&para;<br>to object, on First Amendment grounds, to a congressional&para;<br>statute that allowed expenditures of federal funds from&para;<br>the General Treasury to support, among other programs,&para;<br>“instruction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in&para;<br>religious schools, and to purchase textbooks and other&para;<br>instructional materials for use in such schools.” 392 U. S.,&para;<br>at 85–86. Flast held that taxpayers have standing when&para;<br>two conditions are met.&para;<br>The first condition is that there must be a “logical link”&para;<br>between the plaintiff’s taxpayer status “and the type of&para;<br>legislative enactment attacked.” Id., at 102. This condi­&para;<br>tion was not satisfied in Doremus because the statute&para;<br>challenged in that case—providing for the recitation of&para;<br>Bible passages in public schools—involved at most an&para;<br>“incidental expenditure of tax funds.” Flast, 392 U. S., at&para;<br>102. In Flast, by contrast, the allegation was that the&para;<br>Federal Government violated the Establishment Clause in&para;<br>the exercise of its legislative authority both to collect and&para;<br>spend tax dollars. Id., at 103. In the decades since Flast,&para;<br>the Court has been careful to enforce this requirement.&para;<br>See Hein, 551 U. S. 587 (no standing under Flast to chal­&para;<br>lenge federal executive actions funded by general appro­&para;<br>priations); Valley Forge, 454 U. S. 464 (no standing under&para;<br>Flast to challenge an agency’s decision to transfer a parcel&para;<br>of federal property pursuant to the Property Clause).&para;<br>The second condition for standing under Flast is that&para;<br>there must be “a nexus” between the plaintiff’s taxpayer&para;<br>status and “the precise nature of the constitutional in­&para;<br>fringement alleged.” 392 U. S., at 102. This condition was&para;<br>deemed satisfied in Flast based on the allegation that&para;<br>Government funds had been spent on an outlay for relig­&para;<br>ion in contravention of the Establishment Clause. Id., at&para;<br>85–86. In Frothingham, by contrast, the claim was that&para;<br>&para;<br>12 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority with­&para;<br>out regard to any specific prohibition. 392 U. S., at 104–&para;<br>105. Confirming that Flast turned on the unique features&para;<br>of Establishment Clause violations, this Court has “de­&para;<br>clined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging&para;<br>violations of any constitutional provision apart from the&para;<br>Establishment Clause.” Hein, supra, at 609 (plurality&para;<br>opinion); see also Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (Statement&para;<br>and Account Clause); Schlesinger, 418 U. S. 208 (Incom­&para;<br>patibility Clause).&para;<br>After stating the two conditions for taxpayer standing,&para;<br>Flast considered them together, explaining that individu­&para;<br>als suffer a particular injury for standing purposes when,&para;<br>in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of&para;<br>“the taxing and spending power,” their property is trans­&para;<br>ferred through the Government’s Treasury to a sectarian&para;<br>entity. 392 U. S., at 105–106. As Flast put it: “The tax­&para;<br>payer’s allegation in such cases would be that his tax&para;<br>money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific&para;<br>constitutional protections against such abuses of legisla­&para;<br>tive power.” Id., at 106. Flast thus “understood the ‘in­&para;<br>jury’ alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal&para;<br>spending to be the very ‘extract[ion] and spen[ding]’ of ‘tax&para;<br>money’ in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.” DaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 348 (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at&para;<br>106)). “Such an injury,” Flast continued, is unlike “gener­&para;<br>alized grievances about the conduct of government” and so&para;<br>is “appropriate for judicial redress.” Id., at 106.&para;<br>Flast found support for its finding of personal injury in&para;<br>“the history of the Establishment Clause,” particularly&para;<br>James Madison’s Memorial and Remonstrance Against&para;<br>Religious Assessments. DaimlerChrysler, supra, at 348.&para;<br>In 1785, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of&para;<br>Virginia considered a “tax levy to support teachers of the&para;<br>Christian religion.” Flast, supra, at 104, n. 24; see A Bill&para;<br>Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Religion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,&para;<br>330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of&para;<br>Rutledge, J.). Under the proposed assessment bill, tax­&para;<br>payers would direct their payments to Christian societies&para;<br>of their choosing. Ibid. If a taxpayer made no such choice,&para;<br>the General Assembly was to divert his funds to “seminar­&para;<br>ies of learning,” at least some of which “undoubtedly would&para;<br>have been religious in character.” Rosenberger v. Rector&para;<br>and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 869, n. 1 (1995)&para;<br>(Souter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted);&para;<br>see also id., at 853, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring). How­&para;<br>ever the “seminaries” provision might have functioned in&para;<br>practice, critics took the position that the proposed bill&para;<br>threatened compulsory religious contributions. See, e.g.,&para;<br>T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia,&para;<br>1776–1787, pp. 133–134 (1977); H. Eckenrode, Separation&para;<br>of Church and State in Virginia 106–108 (1910).&para;<br>In the Memorial and Remonstrance, Madison objected to&para;<br>the proposed assessment on the ground that it would&para;<br>coerce a form of religious devotion in violation of con­&para;<br>science. In Madison’s view, government should not “ ‘force&para;<br>a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for&para;<br>the support of any one establishment.’ ” Flast, supra, at&para;<br>103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G.&para;<br>Hunt ed. 1901)). This Madisonian prohibition does not&para;<br>depend on the amount of property conscripted for sectar­&para;<br>ian ends. Any such taking, even one amounting to “three&para;<br>pence only,” violates conscience. 392 U. S., at 103; cf.&para;<br>supra, at 6–7. The proposed bill ultimately died in com­&para;<br>mittee; and the General Assembly instead enacted legisla­&para;<br>tion forbidding “compelled” support of religion. See A Bill&para;<br>for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers&para;<br>of Thomas Jefferson 545–546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950); see also&para;<br>Flast, 392 U. S., at 104, n. 24. Madison himself went on to&para;<br>become, as Flast put it, “the leading architect of the relig­&para;<br>ion clauses of the First Amendment.” Id., at 103. Flast&para;<br>&para;<br>14 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was thus informed by “the specific evils” identified in the&para;<br>public arguments of “those who drafted the Establishment&para;<br>Clause and fought for its adoption.” Id., at 103–104; see&para;<br>also Feldman, Intellectual Origins of the Establishment&para;<br>Clause, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 346, 351 (2002) (“[T]he Fram­&para;<br>ers’ generation worried that conscience would be violated&para;<br>if citizens were required to pay taxes to support religious&para;<br>institutions with whose beliefs they disagreed”); McCon­&para;<br>nell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment, 27&para;<br>Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 933, 936–939 (1986).&para;<br>Respondents contend that these principles demonstrate&para;<br>their standing to challenge the STO tax credit. In their&para;<br>view the tax credit is, for Flast purposes, best understood&para;<br>as a governmental expenditure. That is incorrect.&para;<br>It is easy to see that tax credits and governmental ex­&para;<br>penditures can have similar economic consequences, at&para;<br>least for beneficiaries whose tax liability is sufficiently&para;<br>large to take full advantage of the credit. Yet tax credits&para;<br>and governmental expenditures do not both implicate&para;<br>individual taxpayers in sectarian activities. A dissenter&para;<br>whose tax dollars are “extracted and spent” knows that he&para;<br>has in some small measure been made to contribute to an&para;<br>establishment in violation of conscience. Flast, supra, at&para;<br>106. In that instance the taxpayer’s direct and particular&para;<br>connection with the establishment does not depend on&para;<br>economic speculation or political conjecture. The connec­&para;<br>tion would exist even if the conscientious dissenter’s tax&para;<br>liability were unaffected or reduced. See DaimlerChrysler,&para;<br>supra, at 348–349. When the government declines to&para;<br>impose a tax, by contrast, there is no such connection&para;<br>between dissenting taxpayer and alleged establishment.&para;<br>Any financial injury remains speculative. See supra, at 6–&para;<br>10. And awarding some citizens a tax credit allows other&para;<br>citizens to retain control over their own funds in accor­&para;<br>dance with their own consciences.&para;<br>The distinction between governmental expenditures and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tax credits refutes respondents’ assertion of standing.&para;<br>When Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute to STOs,&para;<br>they spend their own money, not money the State has&para;<br>collected from respondents or from other taxpayers. Ari­&para;<br>zona’s §43–1089 does not “extrac[t] and spen[d]” a consci­&para;<br>entious dissenter’s funds in service of an establishment,&para;<br>Flast, 392 U. S., at 106, or “ ‘force a citizen to contribute&para;<br>three pence only of his property’ ” to a sectarian organiza­&para;<br>tion, id., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison,&para;<br>supra, at 186). On the contrary, respondents and other&para;<br>Arizona taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills,&para;<br>without contributing to an STO. Respondents are likewise&para;<br>able to contribute to an STO of their choice, either reli­&para;<br>gious or secular. And respondents also have the option of&para;<br>contributing to other charitable organizations, in which&para;<br>case respondents may become eligible for a tax deduction&para;<br>or a different tax credit. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§43–1088 (West Supp. 2010). The STO tax credit is not&para;<br>tantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not&para;<br>visit the injury identified in Flast. It follows that respon­&para;<br>dents have neither alleged an injury for standing purposes&para;<br>under general rules nor met the Flast exception. Finding&para;<br>standing under these circumstances would be more than&para;<br>the extension of Flast “to the limits of its logic.” Hein, 551&para;<br>U. S., at 615 (plurality opinion). It would be a departure&para;<br>from Flast’s stated rationale.&para;<br>Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the require­&para;<br>ments of causation and redressability. When the govern­&para;<br>ment collects and spends taxpayer money, governmental&para;<br>choices are responsible for the transfer of wealth. In that&para;<br>case a resulting subsidy of religious activity is, for pur­&para;<br>poses of Flast, traceable to the government’s expenditures.&para;<br>And an injunction against those expenditures would ad­&para;<br>dress the objections of conscience raised by taxpayer­&para;<br>plaintiffs. See DaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. Here,&para;<br>by contrast, contributions result from the decisions of&para;<br>&para;<br>16 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>private taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private&para;<br>citizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary&para;<br>schools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs. While the&para;<br>State, at the outset, affords the opportunity to create and&para;<br>contribute to an STO, the tax credit system is imple­&para;<br>mented by private action and with no state intervention.&para;<br>Objecting taxpayers know that their fellow citizens, not&para;<br>the State, decide to contribute and in fact make the con­&para;<br>tribution. These considerations prevent any injury the&para;<br>objectors may suffer from being fairly traceable to the&para;<br>government. And while an injunction against application&para;<br>of the tax credit most likely would reduce contributions to&para;<br>STOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing tax­&para;<br>payers or their tax payments. As a result, any injury&para;<br>suffered by respondents would not be remedied by an&para;<br>injunction limiting the tax credit’s operation.&para;<br>Resisting this conclusion, respondents suggest that&para;<br>Arizonans who benefit from §43–1089 tax credits in effect&para;<br>are paying their state income tax to STOs. In respon­&para;<br>dents’ view, tax credits give rise to standing even if tax&para;<br>deductions do not, since only the former yield a dollar-for­&para;<br>dollar reduction in final tax liability. See Brief for Re­&para;<br>spondent Winn et al. 5–6; Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–36. But&para;<br>what matters under Flast is whether sectarian STOs&para;<br>receive government funds drawn from general tax reve­&para;<br>nues, so that moneys have been extracted from a citizen&para;<br>and handed to a religious institution in violation of the&para;<br>citizen’s conscience. Under that inquiry, respondents’&para;<br>argument fails. Like contributions that lead to charitable&para;<br>tax deductions, contributions yielding STO tax credits are&para;<br>not owed to the State and, in fact, pass directly from tax­&para;<br>payers to private organizations. Respondents’ contrary&para;<br>position assumes that income should be treated as if it&para;<br>were government property even if it has not come into the&para;<br>tax collector’s hands. That premise finds no basis in&para;<br>standing jurisprudence. Private bank accounts cannot be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>equated with the Arizona State Treasury.&para;<br>The conclusion that the Flast exception is inapplicable&para;<br>at first may seem in tension with several earlier cases, all&para;<br>addressing Establishment Clause issues and all decided&para;<br>after Flast. See Mueller, 463 U. S. 388; Committee for&para;<br>Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756&para;<br>(1973); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973); Walz v. Tax&para;<br>Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970); cf.&para;<br>Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (reaching only threshold&para;<br>jurisdictional issues). But those cases do not mention&para;<br>standing and so are not contrary to the conclusion reached&para;<br>here. When a potential jurisdictional defect is neither&para;<br>noted nor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does&para;<br>not stand for the proposition that no defect existed. See,&para;<br>e.g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974)&para;<br>(“[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in&para;<br>prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings&para;<br>the jurisdictional issue before us”); United States v.

S. 33, 38 (1952) (“Even as&para;<br>to our own judicial power of jurisdiction, this Court has&para;<br>followed the lead of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall who held&para;<br>that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was&para;<br>passed sub silentio”); Frothingham, supra, at 486. The&para;<br>Court would risk error if it relied on assumptions that&para;<br>have gone unstated and unexamined.&para;<br>Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit,&para;<br>disadvantages a particular religious group or a particular&para;<br>nonreligious group, the disadvantaged party would not&para;<br>have to rely on Flast to obtain redress for a resulting&para;<br>injury. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S., at 8&para;<br>(plurality opinion) (finding standing where a general&para;<br>interest magazine sought to recover tax payments on the&para;<br>ground that religious periodicals were exempt from the&para;<br>tax). Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can&para;<br>be shown in various ways, it is far from clear that any&para;<br>&para;<br>18 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nonbinding sub silentio holdings in the cases respondents&para;<br>cite would have depended on Flast. See, e.g., Walz, supra,&para;<br>at 666–667 (explaining that the plaintiff was an “owner of&para;<br>real estate” in New York City who objected to the city’s&para;<br>issuance of “property tax exemptions to religious organiza­&para;<br>tions”). That the plaintiffs in those cases could have&para;<br>advanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of Flast&para;<br>makes it particularly inappropriate to determine whether&para;<br>or why standing should have been found where the issue&para;<br>was left unexplored.&para;<br>If an establishment of religion is alleged to cause real&para;<br>injury to particular individuals, the federal courts may&para;<br>adjudicate the matter. Like other constitutional provi­&para;<br>sions, the Establishment Clause acquires substance and&para;<br>meaning when explained, elaborated, and enforced in the&para;<br>context of actual disputes. That reality underlies the case­&para;<br>or-controversy requirement, a requirement that has not&para;<br>been satisfied here.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to&para;<br>undermine public confidence in the neutrality and integ­&para;<br>rity of the Judiciary than one which casts the Court in the&para;<br>role of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power&para;<br>to invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees&para;<br>with them. In an era of frequent litigation, class actions,&para;<br>sweeping injunctions with prospective effect, and continu­&para;<br>ing jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must&para;<br>be more careful to insist on the formal rules of standing,&para;<br>not less so.

The Arizona tax&para;<br>payers who instituted this suit (collectively, Plaintiffs)&para;<br>allege that the use of these funds to subsidize school tui&para;<br>tion organizations (STOs) breaches the Establishment&para;<br>Clause’s promise of religious neutrality. Many of these&para;<br>STOs, the Plaintiffs claim, discriminate on the basis of a&para;<br>child’s religion when awarding scholarships.&para;<br>For almost half a century, litigants like the Plaintiffs&para;<br>have obtained judicial review of claims that the govern&para;<br>ment has used its taxing and spending power in violation&para;<br>of the Establishment Clause. Beginning in Flast v. Cohen,&para;<br>392 U. S. 83 (1968), and continuing in case after case for&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>over four decades, this Court and others have exercised&para;<br>jurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not&para;<br>materially different from this one. Not every suit has&para;<br>succeeded on the merits, or should have. But every tax&para;<br>payer-plaintiff has had her day in court to contest the&para;<br>government’s financing of religious activity.&para;<br>Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing&para;<br>to hear taxpayers’ claims that the government has uncon&para;<br>stitutionally subsidized religion through its tax system.&para;<br>These litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because&para;<br>the funding of religion they challenge comes from a tax&para;<br>credit, rather than an appropriation. A tax credit, the&para;<br>Court asserts, does not injure objecting taxpayers, because&para;<br>it “does not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an&para;<br>establishment.” Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>alterations omitted).&para;<br>This novel distinction in standing law between appro&para;<br>priations and tax expenditures has as little basis in prin&para;<br>ciple as it has in our precedent. Cash grants and targeted&para;<br>tax breaks are means of accomplishing the same govern&para;<br>ment objective—to provide financial support to select&para;<br>individuals or organizations. Taxpayers who oppose state&para;<br>aid of religion have equal reason to protest whether that&para;<br>aid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other. Either&para;<br>way, the government has financed the religious activity.&para;<br>And so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge&para;<br>the subsidy.&para;<br>Still worse, the Court’s arbitrary distinction threatens to&para;<br>eliminate all occasions for a taxpayer to contest the gov&para;<br>ernment’s monetary support of religion. Precisely because&para;<br>appropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical objec&para;<br>tives, the government can easily substitute one for the&para;<br>other. Today’s opinion thus enables the government to&para;<br>end-run Flast’s guarantee of access to the Judiciary. From&para;<br>now on, the government need follow just one simple rule—&para;<br>subsidize through the tax system—to preclude taxpayer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>challenges to state funding of religion.&para;<br>And that result—the effective demise of taxpayer stand&para;<br>ing—will diminish the Establishment Clause’s force and&para;<br>meaning. Sometimes, no one other than taxpayers has&para;<br>suffered the injury necessary to challenge government&para;<br>sponsorship of religion. Today’s holding therefore will&para;<br>prevent federal courts from determining whether some&para;<br>subsidies to sectarian organizations comport with our&para;<br>Constitution’s guarantee of religious neutrality. Because I&para;<br>believe these challenges warrant consideration on the&para;<br>merits, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision.&para;<br>I&para;<br>As the majority recounts, this Court has held that pay&para;<br>ing taxes usually does not give an individual Article III&para;<br>standing to challenge government action. Ante, at 6–10.&para;<br>Taxpayers cannot demonstrate the requisite injury be&para;<br>cause each person’s “interest in the moneys of the Treas&para;<br>ury . . . is comparatively minute and indeterminable.”&para;<br>Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487 (1923) (decided&para;<br>with Massachusetts v. Mellon). Given the size and com&para;<br>plexity of government budgets, it is a “fiction” to contend&para;<br>that an unlawful expenditure causes an individual “any&para;<br>measurable economic harm.” Hein v. Freedom From&para;<br>Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 593 (2007) (plu&para;<br>rality opinion). Nor can taxpayers in the ordinary case&para;<br>establish causation (i.e., that the disputed government&para;<br>measure affects their tax burden) or redressability (i.e.,&para;<br>that a judicial remedy would result in tax reductions).&para;<br>Ante, at 8–9. On these points, all agree.&para;<br>The disagreement concerns their relevance here. This&para;<br>case is not about the general prohibition on taxpayer&para;<br>standing, and cannot be resolved on that basis. This case&para;<br>is instead about the exception to the rule—the principle&para;<br>established decades ago in Flast that taxpayers may chal&para;<br>lenge certain government actions alleged to violate the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Establishment Clause. The Plaintiffs have standing if&para;<br>their suit meets Flast’s requirements—and it does so&para;<br>under any fair reading of that decision.&para;<br>Taxpayers have standing, Flast held, when they allege&para;<br>that a statute enacted pursuant to the legislature’s taxing&para;<br>and spending power violates the Establishment Clause.&para;<br>392 U. S., at 105–106. In this situation, the Court ex&para;<br>plained, a plaintiff can establish a two-part nexus “be&para;<br>tween the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought&para;<br>to be adjudicated.” Id., at 102. First, by challenging&para;<br>legislative action taken under the taxing and spending&para;<br>clause, the taxpayer shows “a logical link between [her]&para;<br>status and the type of . . . enactment attacked.” Ibid.&para;<br>Second, by invoking the Establishment Clause—a specific&para;<br>limitation on the legislature’s taxing and spending&para;<br>power—the taxpayer demonstrates “a nexus between [her]&para;<br>status and the precise nature of the constitutional in&para;<br>fringement alleged.” Ibid. Because of these connections,&para;<br>Flast held, taxpayers alleging that the government is&para;<br>using tax proceeds to aid religion have “the necessary&para;<br>stake . . . in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article&para;<br>III.” Ibid. They are “proper and appropriate part[ies]”—&para;<br>indeed, often the only possible parties—to seek judicial&para;<br>enforcement of the Constitution’s guarantee of religious&para;<br>neutrality. Ibid.&para;<br>That simple restatement of the Flast standard should be&para;<br>enough to establish that the Plaintiffs have standing.&para;<br>They attack a provision of the Arizona tax code that the&para;<br>legislature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution’s&para;<br>taxing and spending clause (Flast nexus, part 1). And&para;<br>they allege that this provision violates the Establishment&para;<br>Clause (Flast nexus, part 2). By satisfying both of Flast’s&para;<br>conditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their “stake&para;<br>as taxpayers” in enforcing constitutional restraints on the&para;<br>provision of aid to STOs. Ibid. Indeed, the connection in&para;<br>this case between “the [taxpayer] status asserted and the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>claim sought to be adjudicated,” ibid., could not be any&para;<br>tighter: As noted when this Court previously addressed a&para;<br>different issue in this lawsuit, the Plaintiffs invoke the&para;<br>Establishment Clause to challenge “an integral part of the&para;<br>State’s tax statute” that “is reflected on state tax forms”&para;<br>and that “is part of the calculus necessary to determine&para;<br>tax liability.” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 119 (2004)&para;<br>(Winn I) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Finding standing here is merely a matter of applying&para;<br>Flast. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>determination (not questioned even by the eight judges&para;<br>who called for rehearing en banc on the merits) that the&para;<br>Plaintiffs can pursue their claim in federal court.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The majority reaches a contrary decision by distinguish&para;<br>ing between two methods of financing religion: A taxpayer&para;<br>has standing to challenge state subsidies to religion, the&para;<br>Court announces, when the mechanism used is an appro&para;<br>priation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax&para;<br>break, otherwise called a “tax expenditure.”1 In the for&para;<br>mer case, but not in the latter, the Court declares, the&para;<br>taxpayer suffers cognizable injury. Ante, at 14–15.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 “Tax expenditures” are monetary subsidies the government bestows&para;<br>on particular individuals or organizations by granting them preferen&para;<br>tial tax treatment. The co-chairmen of the National Commission on&para;<br>Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recently referred to these tax breaks&para;<br>as “the various deductions, credits and loopholes that are just spending&para;<br>by another name.” Washington Post, Feb. 20, 2011, p. A19, col. 3; see&para;<br>also 2 U. S. C. §622(3) (defining “tax expenditures,” for purposes of the&para;<br>Federal Government’s budgetary process, as “those revenue losses&para;<br>attributable to provisions of the . . . tax laws which allow a special&para;<br>exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide&para;<br>a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability”);&para;<br>S. Surrey &amp; P. McDaniel, Tax Expenditures 3 (1985) (explaining that&para;<br>tax expenditures “represent government spending for favored activities&para;<br>or groups, effected through the tax system rather than through direct&para;<br>grants, loans, or other forms of government assistance”).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>But this distinction finds no support in case law, and&para;<br>just as little in reason. In the decades since Flast, no&para;<br>court—not one—has differentiated between appropriations&para;<br>and tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants have&para;<br>standing. Over and over again, courts (including this one)&para;<br>have faced Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits,&para;<br>deductions, and exemptions; over and over again, these&para;<br>courts have reached the merits of these claims. And that&para;<br>is for a simple reason: Taxpayers experience the same&para;<br>injury for standing purposes whether government subsidi&para;<br>zation of religion takes the form of a cash grant or a tax&para;<br>measure. The only rationale the majority offers for its&para;<br>newfound distinction—that grants, but not tax expendi&para;<br>tures, somehow come from a complaining taxpayer’s own&para;<br>wallet—cannot bear the weight the Court places on it. If&para;<br>Flast is still good law—and the majority today says noth&para;<br>ing to the contrary—then the Plaintiffs should be able to&para;<br>pursue their claim on the merits.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Until today, this Court has never so much as hinted that&para;<br>litigants in the same shoes as the Plaintiffs lack standing&para;<br>under Flast. To the contrary: We have faced the identical&para;<br>situation five times—including in a prior incarnation of&para;<br>this very case!—and we have five times resolved the suit&para;<br>without questioning the plaintiffs’ standing. Lower fed&para;<br>eral courts have followed our example and handled the&para;<br>matter in the same way. I count 14 separate cases (involv&para;<br>ing 20 appellate and district courts) that adjudicated&para;<br>taxpayer challenges to tax expenditures alleged to violate&para;<br>the Establishment Clause.2 I suspect I have missed a few.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See Johnson v.

Pause on that for a&para;<br>moment: The very decisions the majority today so easily&para;<br>dismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of&para;<br>jurisdiction.

Or would&para;<br>most taxpayers respond by saying that a subsidy is a&para;<br>subsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether accomplished&para;<br>by the one means or by the other? Surely the latter; in&para;<br>&para;<br>12 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>deed, we would think the less of our countrymen if they&para;<br>failed to see through this cynical proposal.&para;<br>And what ordinary people would appreciate, this Court’s&para;<br>case law also recognizes—that targeted tax breaks are&para;<br>often “economically and functionally indistinguishable&para;<br>from a direct monetary subsidy.” Rosenberger v.

Our prior cases have often recognized the&para;<br>cost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers gener&para;<br>ally. “When the Government grants exemptions or allows&para;<br>deductions” to some, we have observed, “all taxpayers are&para;<br>affected; the very fact of the exemption or deduction . . .&para;<br>means that other taxpayers can be said to be indirect and&para;<br>&para;<br>14 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.&para;<br>WINN&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>vicarious ‘donors.’ ” Bob Jones Univ. v.

But the key is this: Whenever taxpayers&para;<br>have standing under Flast to challenge an appropriation,&para;<br>they should also have standing to contest a tax expendi&para;<br>ture. Their access to the federal courts should not depend&para;<br>on which type of financial subsidy the State has offered.&para;<br>Consider some further examples of the point, but this&para;<br>time concerning state funding of religion.

Regardless of which&para;<br>mechanism the State uses, taxpayers have an identical&para;<br>stake in ensuring that the State’s exercise of its taxing&para;<br>and spending power complies with the Constitution.7&para;<br>Here, the mechanism Arizona has selected is a dollar&para;<br>for-dollar tax credit to aid school tuition organizations.&para;<br>Each year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans: Either&para;<br>pay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or&para;<br>subtract up to $500 from your tax bill by contributing that&para;<br>sum to an STO. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 95.

And STOs capitalize on&para;<br>this aspect of the tax credit for all it is worth—which is&para;<br>quite a lot.

But this possibility&para;<br>does not detract from the point made here.

Arizona’s tuition&para;<br>tax-credit program in fact necessitates the direct expenditure of funds&para;<br>from the state treasury. After all, the statute establishing the initiative&para;<br>requires the Arizona Department of Revenue to certify STOs, maintain&para;<br>an STO registry, make the registry available to the public on request&para;<br>and post it on a website, collect annual reports filed by STOs, and send&para;<br>written notice to STOs that have failed to comply with statutory re&para;<br>quirements. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§43–1502(A)–(C), 43–1506 (West&para;<br>Supp. 2010). Presumably all these activities cost money, which comes&para;<br>from the state treasury.

(The majority, after all, makes clear&para;<br>that nothing in its analysis hinges on the size or proportion of the&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ contribution. Ante, at 13.)

Here is how Flast&para;<br>stated its holding: “[W]e hold that a taxpayer will have&para;<br>standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal&para;<br>judicial power when he alleges that congressional action&para;<br>under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of”&para;<br>the Establishment Clause. 392 U.

Noth&para;<br>ing in that straightforward sentence supports the idea&para;<br>that a taxpayer can challenge only legislative action that&para;<br>disburses his particular contribution to the state treasury.&para;<br>And here is how Flast primarily justified its holding:&para;<br>“[O]ne of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the&para;<br>Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that&para;<br>the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one&para;<br>religion over another or to support religion in general.”&para;<br>Id., at 103. That evil arises even if the specific dollars that&para;<br>the government uses do not come from citizens who object&para;<br>to the preference. Likewise, the two-part nexus test,&para;<br>which is the heart of Flast’s doctrinal analysis, contains no&para;<br>hint of an extraction requirement. See supra, at 4. And&para;<br>finally, James Madison provides no comfort to today’s&para;<br>majority. He referred to “three pence” exactly because it&para;<br>was, even in 1785, a meaningless sum of money; then, as&para;<br>today, the core injury of a religious establishment had&para;<br>naught to do with any given individual’s out-of-pocket loss.&para;<br>See infra, at 21–23 (further discussing Madison’s views).&para;<br>So the majority is left with nothing, save for three words&para;<br>Flast used to describe the particular facts in that case: In&para;<br>not a single non-trivial respect could the Flast Court&para;<br>recognize its handiwork in the majority’s depiction.&para;<br>The injury to taxpayers that Flast perceived arose&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

In that&para;<br>and subsequent cases (including the five in this Court&para;<br>involving tax expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the requi&para;<br>site harm by stating that public resources were funding&para;<br>religion; the tracing of particular dollars (whether by the&para;<br>Solicitor General’s “electronic tag” or other means) did not&para;<br>enter into the question. See DaimlerChrysler Corp., 547&para;<br>U.

So&para;<br>taxpayers have an interest in preventing the use of either&para;<br>mechanism to infringe religious neutrality.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 On&para;<br>&para;<br>this traditional view of the harm to taxpayers arising from state&para;<br>financing of religion, the Plaintiffs here can satisfy not only Article III’s&para;<br>injury requirement, but also its causation and redressability require&para;<br>ments. The majority’s contrary position, ante, at 15–16, stems from its&para;<br>miscasting of the injury involved; once that harm is stated correctly, all&para;<br>the rest follows. To wit: The Plaintiffs allege they suffer injury when&para;<br>the State funnels public resources to religious organizations through&para;<br>the tax credit. Arizona, they claim, has caused this injury by enacting&para;<br>legislation that establishes the credit. And an injunction limiting the&para;<br>credit’s operation would redress the harm by preventing the allegedly&para;<br>unlawful diversion of tax revenues. The Plaintiffs need not, as the&para;<br>majority insists, show that this remedy would “affect . . . their tax&para;<br>payments,” ante, at 16, any more than the taxpayer in Flast had to&para;<br>establish that her tax burden would decrease absent the Government’s&para;<br>funding of religious schools. As we have previously recognized, when&para;<br>taxpayers object to the spending of tax money in violation of the Estab&para;<br>lishment Clause (whether through tax credits or appropriations), “an&para;<br>injunction against the spending would . . . redress [their] injury, regard&para;<br>less of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that&para;<br>would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.” DaimlerChrysler&para;<br>Corp. v.

No taxpayer can point to an expenditure (by&para;<br>cash grant or otherwise) and say that her own tax dollars&para;<br>are in the mix; in fact, they almost surely are not. “[I]t is,”&para;<br>as we have noted, “a complete fiction to argue that an&para;<br>unconstitutional . . . expenditure causes an individual . . .&para;<br>taxpayer any measurable economic harm.” Hein, 551&para;<br>U.

Taxpayers have&para;<br>standing in these cases despite their foreseeable failure to&para;<br>show that the alleged constitutional violation involves&para;<br>their own tax dollars, not because the State has used their&para;<br>particular funds.&para;<br>And something still deeper is wrong with the majority’s&para;<br>“extract and spend” requirement: It does not measure&para;<br>what matters under the Establishment Clause.

But historians and legal scholars have uniformly understood&para;<br>the opt-out provision as a considered attempt to accommodate taxpay&para;<br>ers who did not want their tax dollars to go to religion. See Berg &amp;&para;<br>Laycock, supra, at 244, n. 113 (the “provision for payment to a school&para;<br>fund was not an effort to support religious schools as part of support for&para;<br>education overall,” but rather “was an effort to accommodate the&para;<br>possibility of non-Christian taxpayers”); T.

Although both funnel tax funds to&para;<br>religious organizations (and so saddle all taxpayers with&para;<br>the cost), neither forces any given taxpayer to pay for the&para;<br>subsidy out of her pocket.

By relying on the&para;<br>selfsame aspect of the Arizona scheme to deny the Plain&para;<br>tiffs’ claim of injury, the majority betrays Madison’s vision.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Today’s decision devastates taxpayer standing in Estab&para;<br>lishment Clause cases. The government, after all, often&para;<br>uses tax expenditures to subsidize favored persons and&para;<br>activities. Still more, the government almost always has&para;<br>this option. Appropriations and tax subsidies are readily&para;<br>interchangeable; what is a cash grant today can be a tax&para;<br>break tomorrow. The Court’s opinion thus offers a road&para;<br>map—more truly, just a one-step instruction—to any&para;<br>government that wishes to insulate its financing of reli&para;<br>gious activity from legal challenge. Structure the funding&para;<br>as a tax expenditure, and Flast will not stand in the way.&para;<br>No taxpayer will have standing to object. However bla&para;<br>tantly the government may violate the Establishment&para;<br>Clause, taxpayers cannot gain access to the federal courts.&para;<br>And by ravaging Flast in this way, today’s decision&para;<br>damages one of this Nation’s defining constitutional com&para;<br>mitments. “Congress shall make no law respecting an&para;<br>establishment of religion”—ten simple words that have&para;<br>stood for over 200 years as a foundation stone of American&para;<br>religious liberty.
