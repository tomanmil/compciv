O’BRIEN ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1569. Argued February 23, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>Respondents O’Brien and Burgess each carried a firearm during an&para;<br>attempted robbery. Count three of their indictment charged them&para;<br>with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, which car&para;<br>ries a mandatory minimum 5-year prison term.&para;<br>18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A)(i). Count four alleged use of a machinegun (here, a pis&para;<br>tol that authorities believed operated as a fully automatic firearm) in&para;<br>furtherance of that crime, which carries a 30-year mandatory mini&para;<br>mum term. §924(c)(1)(B)(ii). The Government moved to dismiss the&para;<br>fourth count on the basis that it could not establish the count beyond&para;<br>a reasonable doubt, but it maintained that §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)’s ma&para;<br>chinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined&para;<br>by the District Court upon a conviction on count three. The court&para;<br>dismissed count four and rejected the Government’s sentencing&para;<br>enhancement position. Respondents then pleaded guilty to the re&para;<br>maining counts. The court sentenced O’Brien to a 102-month term&para;<br>and Burgess to an 84-month term for their §924(c) convictions. In af&para;<br>firming the District Court’s §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) ruling, the First Circuit&para;<br>looked primarily to Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, which&para;<br>held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of §924(c)&para;<br>constituted an element of an offense, not a sentencing factor. The&para;<br>court found that Castillo was “close to binding,” absent clearer or&para;<br>more dramatic changes than those made by Congress’ 1998 amend&para;<br>ment of §924(c) or a clearer legislative history.&para;<br>Held: The fact that a firearm was a machinegun is an element to be&para;<br>proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not a sentencing factor&para;<br>to be proved to the judge at sentencing. Pp. 5–16.&para;<br>(a) Generally, a fact that “increase[s] the prescribed range of penal&para;<br>ties to which a criminal defendant is exposed” is an element of a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, to be charged in&para;<br>an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Ham&para;<br>ling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, rather than proved to a judge&para;<br>at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, McMillan v. Penn&para;<br>sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92. Subject to this constitutional con&para;<br>straint, Congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sen&para;<br>tencing factor. When Congress is not explicit, courts look to a&para;<br>statute’s provisions and framework for guidance. Analysis of the cur&para;<br>rent machinegun provision begins with Castillo, where the Court&para;<br>found the bare language of §924’s prior version “neutral,” 530 U. S.,&para;<br>at 124, but ruled that four factors—(1) language and structure, (2)&para;<br>tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, and (4) severity of the sentence—&para;<br>favored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an of&para;<br>fense, id., at 124−131; while a fifth factor—legislative history—did&para;<br>not favor either side, ibid. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) As relevant here, the 1998 amendment divided what was once a&para;<br>lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs. Thus, with&para;<br>regard to the first Castillo factor, the Court’s observation that “Con&para;<br>gress placed the element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma&para;<br>chinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or sepa&para;<br>rated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no longer holds true.&para;<br>However, the amendment did not affect the second through fifth Cas&para;<br>tillo factors. Each of them, except for legislative history (which re&para;<br>mains relatively silent), continues to favor treating the machinegun&para;<br>provision as an element. The amendment’s effect on the language&para;<br>and structure factor requires closer examination. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(c) Given the Court’s determination in Castillo that the machine&para;<br>gun provision in §924’s prior version is an element, a substantive&para;<br>change in the statute should not be inferred “[a]bsent a clear indica&para;<br>tion from Congress of a change in policy,” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S.&para;<br>279, 290. Nothing in the 1998 amendment indicates such a change.&para;<br>There are three principal differences between the previous and cur&para;<br>rent §924(c). The first, a substantive change, shifts what were once&para;<br>mandatory 5-year and 30-year sentences to mandatory minimum&para;<br>sentences. The second, also substantive—made in direct response to&para;<br>the holding in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, that “uses or&para;<br>carries” in §924’s preamendment version connotes “more than mere&para;<br>possession,” id., at 143—adds “possesses” to the “uses or carries” lan&para;<br>guage in §924(c)’s principal paragraph and provides sentencing en&para;<br>hancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,&para;<br>§§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v.&para;<br>United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552−556. Neither of these substantive&para;<br>changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun&para;<br>provision from an element into a sentencing factor. The third differ&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ence is the machinegun provision’s relocation from the principal&para;<br>paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate&para;<br>subsection, §924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change pro&para;<br>vides no “clear indication” that Congress meant to alter its treatment&para;<br>of machineguns as an offense element. A more logical explanation is&para;<br>that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal&para;<br>paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute,&para;<br>which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines. While&para;<br>this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections&para;<br>is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentenc&para;<br>ing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124−125, it has&para;<br>rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates&para;<br>even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at&para;<br>553. The current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to treating&para;<br>the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in&para;<br>Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now posi&para;<br>tioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and&para;<br>those in (C)(i) and (ii). This structural point is overcome by the sub&para;<br>stantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that&para;<br>Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear in&para;<br>dication of its purpose to do so.

MARTIN O’BRIEN &para;<br>&para;<br>AND ARTHUR BURGESS &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[May 24, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Court must interpret, once again, §924(c) of Title 18&para;<br>of the United States Code. This provision prohibits the&para;<br>use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of vio&para;<br>lence or drug trafficking crime, or the possession of a&para;<br>firearm in furtherance of such crimes. §924(c)(1)(A). A&para;<br>violation of the statute carries a mandatory minimum&para;<br>term of five years’ imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(A)(i); but if&para;<br>the firearm is a machinegun, the statute requires a 30&para;<br>year mandatory minimum sentence, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii).&para;<br>Whether a firearm was used, carried, or possessed is, as&para;<br>all concede, an element of the offense. At issue here is&para;<br>whether the fact that the firearm was a machinegun is an&para;<br>element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt or a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at&para;<br>sentencing.&para;<br>In an earlier case the Court determined that an analo&para;<br>gous machinegun provision in a previous version of §924&para;<br>constituted an element of an offense to be proved to the&para;<br>jury. Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120 (2000). The&para;<br>Castillo decision, however, addressed the statute as it&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>existed before congressional amendments made in 1998.&para;<br>And in a case after Castillo, the brandishing provision in&para;<br>the post-1998 version of §924 was held to provide a sen&para;<br>tencing factor, not an element of the offense. Harris v.&para;<br>United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002). In light of the 1998&para;<br>amendments and the Harris decision, the question of how&para;<br>to interpret §924’s machinegun provision is considered&para;<br>once more in the instant case.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On June 16, 2005, respondents Martin O’Brien and&para;<br>Arthur Burgess attempted to rob an armored car making a&para;<br>scheduled delivery of cash to a bank. Along with a third&para;<br>collaborator, respondents hid in a minivan and waited for&para;<br>the armored car to make its stop. Each of the men carried&para;<br>a firearm. Containing nearly $2 million and attended by&para;<br>two guards, the armored car arrived. A guard began to&para;<br>unload boxes of coins. The three men came out of the van&para;<br>and, while one of them brandished his weapon, they or&para;<br>dered the guards to get on the ground. One guard did so,&para;<br>but the other ran to a nearby restaurant. The respondents&para;<br>abandoned the robbery and fled without taking any&para;<br>money. No shots were fired, and no one was injured.&para;<br>Authorities apprehended respondents and recovered the&para;<br>three firearms used during the attempted robbery. The&para;<br>firearms were a semiautomatic Sig-Sauer pistol, an&para;<br>AK−47 semiautomatic rifle, and a Cobray pistol. The&para;<br>Cobray pistol had been manufactured as, and had the&para;<br>external appearance of, a semiautomatic firearm. Accord&para;<br>ing to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, though, it&para;<br>operated as a fully automatic weapon, apparently due to&para;<br>some alteration of its original firing mechanism. Respon&para;<br>dents dispute whether the Cobray in fact did operate as a&para;<br>fully automatic weapon.&para;<br>Respondents were indicted on multiple counts. Rele&para;<br>vant here are counts three and four, both of which charged&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>offenses under §924(c). Count three charged respondents&para;<br>with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,&para;<br>which carries a statutory minimum of five years’ impris&para;<br>onment. Count four charged respondents in more specific&para;<br>terms, alleging use of a machinegun (the Cobray) in fur&para;<br>therance of a crime of violence, as proscribed by&para;<br>§§924(c)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The latter provision mandates a&para;<br>minimum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment.&para;<br>The Government moved to dismiss count four on the&para;<br>basis that it would be unable to establish the count beyond&para;<br>a reasonable doubt. (The issues in the present case do not&para;<br>require the Court to consider any contention that a defen&para;<br>dant who uses, carries, or possesses a firearm must be&para;<br>aware of the weapon’s characteristics. This opinion ex&para;<br>presses no views on the point.)&para;<br>The Government then maintained that the machinegun&para;<br>provision in §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was a sentencing factor, so&para;<br>that, if respondents were convicted of carrying a firearm&para;<br>under count three, the court could determine at sentencing&para;<br>that the particular firearm was a machinegun, thus acti&para;<br>vating the 30-year mandatory minimum. The District&para;<br>Court dismissed count four, as the Government requested,&para;<br>but rejected the Government’s position that the machine&para;<br>gun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be deter&para;<br>mined by the court at sentencing once there was a convic&para;<br>tion on count three. It ruled that the machinegun&para;<br>provision states an element of a crime. Thus, to invoke&para;<br>the 30-year minimum sentence, the Government was&para;<br>required to charge in the indictment, and then prove to&para;<br>the jury, that the Cobray was a machinegun.&para;<br>At this point, after the District Court foreclosed the&para;<br>possibility of respondents’ facing a 30-year minimum,&para;<br>respondents pleaded guilty to the remaining counts, in&para;<br>cluding count three. The&para;<br>District&para;<br>Court&para;<br>sentenced&para;<br>O’Brien to a 102-month term for his §924(c) conviction, to&para;<br>run consecutively with his sentence on two other counts.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>It sentenced Burgess to an 84-month term for his §924(c)&para;<br>conviction, also to run consecutively to his sentence on the&para;<br>other charges. The Government appealed the District&para;<br>Court’s ruling that the §924 machinegun provision consti&para;<br>tutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing&para;<br>factor.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit&para;<br>affirmed. It looked primarily to Castillo, 530 U. S. 120,&para;<br>which held that the machinegun provision in an earlier&para;<br>version of §924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not&para;<br>a sentencing factor. The court noted that the statute&para;<br>under consideration in Castillo had been revised by Con&para;<br>gress, “break[ing] what was a single run-on sentence into&para;<br>subparagraphs,” and it acknowledged that the earlier&para;<br>repealed version of the statute was “slightly more favor&para;<br>able to the [respondents] than the current version[,] but&para;<br>not markedly so.” 542 F. 3d 921, 925 (2008). It found “no&para;<br>evidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the&para;<br>present subdivisions or recasting of language was any&para;<br>thing more than a current trend—probably for ease of&para;<br>reading—to convert lengthy sentences in criminal statutes&para;<br>into subsections in the fashion of the tax code.” Id., at&para;<br>926. The court concluded: “Absent a clearer or more dra&para;<br>matic change in language or legislative history expressing&para;<br>a specific intent to assign judge or jury functions, we think&para;<br>that Castillo is close to binding,” and any reconsideration&para;<br>of the issue should be left to this Court. Ibid.; see also&para;<br>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,&para;<br>490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has&para;<br>direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons&para;<br>rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals should follow the case which directly controls, leav&para;<br>ing to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own&para;<br>decisions”).&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 557 U.

Hamling&para;<br>v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974); Jones v. United&para;<br>States, 526 U. S. 227, 232 (1999). Sentencing factors, on&para;<br>the other hand, can be proved to a judge at sentencing by&para;<br>a preponderance of the evidence. See McMillan v. Penn&para;<br>sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92 (1986). Though one excep&para;<br>tion has been established, see Almendarez-Torres v.&para;<br>United States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998), “ ‘[i]t is unconsti&para;<br>tutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the&para;<br>assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of&para;<br>penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”&para;<br>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting&para;<br>Jones, supra, at 252−253 (STEVENS, J., concurring)). In&para;<br>other words, while sentencing factors may guide or confine&para;<br>a judge’s discretion in sentencing an offender “within the&para;<br>range prescribed by statute,” Apprendi, supra, at 481,&para;<br>judge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maxi&para;<br>mum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based&para;<br>purely on the facts found by the jury.&para;<br>Subject to this constitutional constraint, whether a&para;<br>given fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing&para;<br>factor is a question for Congress. When Congress is not&para;<br>explicit, as is often the case because it seldom directly&para;<br>addresses the distinction between sentencing factors and&para;<br>elements, courts look to the provisions and the framework&para;<br>of the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or&para;<br>a sentencing factor. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228. In&para;<br>examining whether the machinegun provision in §924 is&para;<br>an element or a sentencing factor, the analysis must begin&para;<br>with this Court’s previous examination of the question in&para;<br>Castillo.&para;<br>In Castillo, the Court considered a prior version of §924,&para;<br>which provided:&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crime&para;<br>of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or car&para;<br>ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment&para;<br>provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking&para;<br>crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,&para;<br>and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short&para;<br>barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if&para;<br>the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device,&para;<br>or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muf&para;<br>fler, to imprisonment for thirty years. . . .” 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V).&para;<br>In determining whether the machinegun provision in the&para;<br>just-quoted version of §924 constituted an element or a&para;<br>sentencing factor, the Court in Castillo observed that the&para;<br>bare statutory language was “neutral.” 530 U. S., at 124.&para;<br>It examined five factors directed at determining congres&para;<br>sional intent: (1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3)&para;<br>risk of unfairness, (4) severity of the sentence, and (5)&para;<br>legislative history. Id., at 124−131. The Court unani&para;<br>mously concluded that the machinegun provision provided&para;<br>an element of an offense, noting that the first four factors&para;<br>favored treating it as such while legislative history did not&para;<br>significantly favor either side. Ibid.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Section 924(c) was amended to its current form in 1998.&para;<br>The amendment had been enacted when the Court consid&para;<br>ered Castillo, supra, at 125, but the pre-1998 version of&para;<br>the statute was at issue there. The instant case concerns&para;<br>the post-1998 (and current) version of the statute, which&para;<br>provides:&para;<br>“(A) Except to the extent that a greater minimum&para;<br>sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or&para;<br>by any other provision of law, any person who, during&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §924(c)(1)&para;<br>(2006 ed.).&para;<br>The 1998 amendment did make substantive changes to&para;<br>the statute, to be discussed below; but for purposes of the&para;<br>present case the most apparent effect of the amendment&para;<br>was to divide what was once a lengthy principal sentence&para;<br>into separate subparagraphs. This Court’s observation in&para;<br>considering the first Castillo factor, that “Congress placed&para;<br>the element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma&para;<br>chinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes&para;<br>or separated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no&para;<br>longer holds true. Aside from this new structure, however,&para;<br>the 1998 amendment of §924 did nothing to affect the&para;<br>second through fifth Castillo factors. Each of the factors,&para;<br>except for legislative history (which, assuming its rele&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vance, remains relatively silent), continues to favor the&para;<br>conclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of&para;<br>an offense.&para;<br>Legal tradition and past congressional practice are the&para;<br>second Castillo factor. The factor is to be consulted when,&para;<br>as here, a statute’s text is unclear as to whether certain&para;<br>facts constitute elements or sentencing factors. Sentenc&para;<br>ing factors traditionally involve characteristics of the&para;<br>offender—such as recidivism, cooperation with law en&para;<br>forcement, or acceptance of responsibility. Id., at 126.&para;<br>Characteristics of the offense itself are traditionally&para;<br>treated as elements, and the use of a machinegun under&para;<br>§924(c) lies “closest to the heart of the crime at issue.” Id.,&para;<br>at 127. This is no less true today than it was 10 years ago&para;<br>in Castillo. Unsurprisingly, firearm type is treated as an&para;<br>element in a number of statutes, as “numerous gun crimes&para;<br>make substantive distinctions between weapons such as&para;<br>pistols and machineguns.” Ibid.; see, e.g., 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§922(a)(4), 922(b)(4), and 922(o)(1).&para;<br>The Government counters that this tradition or pattern&para;<br>has evolved since the version of §924(c) under review in&para;<br>Castillo was enacted. The Government contends that the&para;<br>Federal Sentencing Guidelines altered the tradition by&para;<br>treating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor.&para;<br>Brief for United States 23 (citing United States Sentenc&para;<br>ing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2K2.1(a)(5) (Nov.&para;<br>1998) (raising base offense level “if the offense involved a&para;<br>firearm”)).&para;<br>The argument is not persuasive. The Sentencing Re&para;<br>form Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, establishing the Federal&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines, was enacted four years before the&para;<br>version of §924 under review in Castillo, see Anti-Drug&para;<br>Abuse Act of 1988, §6460, 102 Stat. 4373. While the re&para;<br>sulting Guidelines were not effective until 1987, this was&para;<br>still before the 1988 enactment of the statute at issue in&para;<br>Castillo, and 13 years before this Court’s conclusion in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Castillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an&para;<br>offense element. The Government cannot claim the bene&para;<br>fit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm&para;<br>type from the Guidelines, for that supposed shift would&para;<br>have occurred before the 1988 version of §924 was en&para;<br>acted. The Guidelines were explicitly taken into account&para;<br>when this Court analyzed the traditions in Castillo. 530&para;<br>U. S., at 126 (discussing Federal Sentencing Guidelines in&para;<br>determining what traditionally qualifies as a sentencing&para;<br>factor).&para;<br>The third Castillo factor, potential unfairness, was&para;<br>unchanged by the restructuring of §924. The Court ex&para;<br>plained in Castillo that treating the machinegun provision&para;<br>as a sentencing factor “might unnecessarily produce a&para;<br>conflict between the judge and the jury” because “a jury&para;<br>may well have to decide which of several weapons” a&para;<br>defendant used. Id., at 128. The concern was that the&para;<br>judge may not know which weapon the jurors determined&para;<br>a defendant used, and “a judge’s later, sentencing-related&para;<br>decision that the defendant used the machinegun, rather&para;<br>than, say, the pistol, might conflict with the jury’s belief&para;<br>that he actively used the pistol.” Ibid. This same concern&para;<br>arises under the current version of §924, where jurors&para;<br>might have to determine which among several weapons a&para;<br>defendant used, carried, or possessed in furtherance of a&para;<br>crime.&para;<br>The Government’s response, that permitting a judge to&para;<br>make this finding would “streamlin[e] guilt-stage proceed&para;<br>ings, without interfering with the accuracy of fact-finding,”&para;<br>Brief for United States 33, is unconvincing. It does not&para;<br>address the particular unfairness concern expressed in&para;<br>Castillo, which was not alleviated by the restructuring of&para;<br>§924. And the Government does not suggest that it would&para;<br>be subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision&para;<br>continues to be treated as an element.&para;<br>The fourth Castillo factor, the severity of the sentence&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>accompanying a finding that a defendant carried a ma&para;<br>chinegun under §924, was also unaffected by the statute’s&para;<br>restructuring. A finding that a defendant carried a ma&para;<br>chinegun under §924, in contrast to some less dangerous&para;<br>firearm, vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen&para;<br>tence from 5 to 30 years, Castillo, supra, at 131, or from 7&para;<br>to 30 years if, as in this case, the firearm was brandished,&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A)(ii). This is not akin to the “incremental&para;<br>changes in the minimum” that one would “expect to see in&para;<br>provisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing&para;<br>judge’s consideration,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 554 (from 5&para;<br>years to 7 years); it is a drastic, sixfold increase that&para;<br>strongly suggests a separate substantive crime.&para;<br>There is one substantive difference between the old and&para;<br>new versions of §924 that might bear on this fourth factor.&para;<br>The previous version of §924 provided mandatory sen&para;<br>tences: 5 years for using or carrying a firearm and 30&para;<br>years if the firearm is a machinegun, for example. See&para;<br>§924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The current statute pro&para;<br>vides only mandatory minimums: not less than 5 years for&para;<br>using or possessing a firearm; not less than 7 for brandish&para;<br>ing it; and not less than 30 if the firearm is a machinegun.&para;<br>§§924(c)(1)(A)(i), (A)(ii), (B)(ii). The Government argues&para;<br>that this difference is critical because a 30-year sentence&para;<br>is conceivable under the statute even without a finding&para;<br>that the particular weapon is a machinegun. Brief for&para;<br>United States 25.&para;<br>This is a distinction in theory, perhaps, but not in prac&para;<br>tice. Neither the Government nor any party or amicus has&para;<br>identified a single defendant whose conviction under §924&para;<br>for possessing or brandishing a nonspecific firearm led to a&para;<br>sentence approaching the 30-year sentence that is re&para;<br>quired when the firearm is a machinegun. Respondents&para;<br>advise, without refutation, that most courts impose the&para;<br>mandatory minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment for bran&para;<br>dishing a nonspecific weapon and the longest sentence&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Indeed, in the instant case, Burgess received&para;<br>the statutory minimum 7-year sentence, and O’Brien&para;<br>received only 18 months more than that. Once the ma&para;<br>chinegun enhancement was off the table, the Government&para;<br>itself did not seek anything approaching 30-year terms,&para;<br>instead requesting 12-year terms for each respondent.&para;<br>The immense danger posed by machineguns, the moral&para;<br>depravity in choosing the weapon, and the substantial&para;<br>increase in the minimum sentence provided by the statute&para;<br>support the conclusion that this prohibition is an element&para;<br>of the crime, not a sentencing factor. It is not likely that&para;<br>Congress intended to remove the indictment and jury trial&para;<br>protections when it provided for such an extreme sentenc&para;<br>ing increase. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 233 (“It is at best&para;<br>questionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to&para;<br>increase a penalty range by two-thirds, let alone from 15&para;<br>years to life, was meant to carry none of the process safe&para;<br>guards that elements of an offense bring with them for a&para;<br>defendant’s benefit”). Perhaps Congress was not con&para;<br>cerned with parsing the distinction between elements and&para;<br>sentencing factors, a matter more often discussed by the&para;<br>courts when discussing the proper allocation of functions&para;<br>between judge and jury. Instead, it likely was more fo&para;<br>cused on deterring the crime by creating the mandatory&para;<br>minimum sentences. But the severity of the increase in&para;<br>this case counsels in favor of finding that the prohibition is&para;<br>an element, at least absent some clear congressional indi&para;<br>cation to the contrary.&para;<br>The fifth factor considered in Castillo was legislative&para;<br>history, and the Court there found it to be of little help.&para;<br>530 U.

O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The 1998 amendment has its own legislative record, dis&para;<br>cussed below, but the parties accurately observe that it is&para;<br>silent as to congressional consideration of the distinction&para;<br>between elements and sentencing factors. Brief for United&para;<br>States 29; Brief for Respondent O’Brien 28−29. This&para;<br>silence is not neutral, however, because as explained&para;<br>below, it tends to counsel against finding that Congress&para;<br>made a substantive change to this statutory provision.&para;<br>Four of the five factors the Court relied upon in Castillo&para;<br>point in the same direction they did 10 years ago. How&para;<br>the 1998 amendment affects the remaining factor—the&para;<br>provision’s language and structure—requires closer&para;<br>examination.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In Castillo, the Court interpreted §924(c) in its original&para;<br>version, though Congress had at that point already&para;<br>amended the provision. Here, the applicable principle is&para;<br>that Congress does not enact substantive changes sub&para;<br>silentio. See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB,&para;<br>531 U. S. 316, 323 (2001). In light of Castillo’s determina&para;<br>tion that the machinegun provision in the previous version&para;<br>of §924 is an element, a change should not be inferred&para;<br>“[a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in&para;<br>policy.” Grogan v.

But&para;<br>the better understanding, as the Government acknowl&para;<br>edged in its submission in Castillo, is that “there is noth&para;<br>ing to suggest that the 1998 amendments were intended to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>change, rather than simply reorganize and clarify, [§924]’s&para;<br>treatment of firearm type.” Brief for United States, O. T.&para;<br>1999, No. 99–658, p. 41. A closer review of the 1998&para;<br>amendment confirms this.&para;<br>There are three principal differences between the previ&para;<br>ous and current versions of §924(c): two substantive&para;<br>changes and a third regarding the stylistic structure of the&para;<br>statute. The first difference, as discussed above, supra, at&para;<br>10, is that the amendment changed what were once man&para;<br>datory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences. A&para;<br>person convicted of the primary offense of using or carry&para;<br>ing a firearm during a crime of violence was once to “be&para;<br>sentenced to imprisonment for five years,” but under the&para;<br>current version he or she is to “be sentenced to a term of&para;<br>imprisonment of not less than 5 years.”&para;<br>The second difference is that the amended version in&para;<br>cludes the word “possesses” in addition to “uses or carries”&para;<br>in its principal paragraph, and then adds the substantive&para;<br>provisions in §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which provide&para;<br>mandatory minimums for brandishing (7 years) and dis&para;<br>charging (10 years) the firearm. These provisions are new&para;<br>substantive additions to the text of the previous version,&para;<br>which provided a bare 5-year mandatory minimum for any&para;<br>offender who “use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm,” without con&para;<br>cern for how the firearm was used.&para;<br>The changes were a direct response to this Court’s deci&para;<br>sion in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), which&para;<br>held that the word “use” in the pre-amendment version of&para;<br>§924 “must connote more than mere possession of a fire&para;<br>arm by a person who commits a drug offense.” Id., at 143.&para;<br>The Court in Bailey went on to observe that, “[h]ad Con&para;<br>gress intended possession alone to trigger liability under&para;<br>§924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided” by using the&para;<br>word “possess,” as it had so frequently done in other statu&para;<br>tory provisions. Ibid. Three years later, Congress made&para;<br>the change and added the word “possesses” to the princi&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pal paragraph. Congress additionally provided mandatory&para;<br>sentences above the 5-year minimum depending on&para;<br>whether and how the firearm was used.&para;<br>Sections&para;<br>924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) provide sentencing enhancements&para;<br>for brandishing or discharging the firearm, and the Court&para;<br>has held that these enhancements are sentencing factors&para;<br>to be found by a judge. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 552−556;&para;<br>see also Dean v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 5) (referring to the brandishing and discharge&para;<br>provisions as “sentencing factors”). The 1998 amendment&para;<br>was colloquially known as the “Bailey Fix Act.” 144 Cong.&para;<br>Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine); see also&para;<br>Dean, supra, at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 3).&para;<br>Aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to manda&para;<br>tory minimums, and this so-called Bailey fix, Congress left&para;<br>the substance of the statute unchanged. Neither of these&para;<br>substantive changes suggests that Congress meant to&para;<br>transform the machinegun provision from an element into&para;<br>a sentencing factor.&para;<br>The Government stresses a third, structural, difference&para;<br>in the statute, pointing out that the machinegun provision&para;<br>now resides in a separate subsection, §924(c)(1)(B),&para;<br>whereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that&para;<br>unmistakably lists offense elements. This structural or&para;<br>stylistic change, though, does not provide a “clear indica&para;<br>tion” that Congress meant to alter its treatment of ma&para;<br>chineguns as an offense element. See Grogan, 498 U. S.,&para;<br>at 290. A more logical explanation for the restructuring is&para;<br>that it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph, which&para;<br>exceeded 250 words even before adding more to it for the&para;<br>Bailey fix, into a more readable statute. This is in step&para;<br>with current legislative drafting guidelines, which advise&para;<br>drafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into sepa&para;<br>rate subsections that can be read more easily.

S., at 124−125, Harris, 536&para;<br>U.

For instance, in Jones the Court found that&para;<br>the federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multi&para;<br>ple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at&para;<br>issue here. Id., at 232−239. And in Harris, the Court was&para;<br>careful to point out that, unlike the case at bar, the other&para;<br>Castillo factors “reinforce[d] the single-offense interpreta&para;<br>tion implied by the statute’s structure.” 536 U. S., at 553.&para;<br>In examining the amended version of §924(c)’s struc&para;<br>ture, there is an additional consideration that supports&para;<br>interpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense&para;<br>element. As explained above, the brandishing and dis&para;<br>charge provisions codified in §924(A)(ii) and (iii) do state&para;<br>sentencing factors. See Harris, supra, at 552−556; Dean,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). Had Congress intended to&para;<br>treat firearm type as a sentencing factor, it likely would&para;<br>have listed firearm types as clauses (iv) and (v) of sub&para;<br>paragraph (A), instead of as clauses (i) and (ii) of subpara&para;<br>graph (B). By listing firearm type in stand-alone subpara&para;<br>graph (B), Congress set it apart from the sentencing&para;<br>factors in (A)(ii) and (iii); this is consistent with preserving&para;<br>firearm type as an element of a separate offense.&para;<br>To be sure, there are some arguments in favor of treat&para;<br>ing the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor. The&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to that&para;<br>interpretation than was true in Castillo, particularly&para;<br>because the machinegun provision is now positioned be&para;<br>tween the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii),&para;<br>see Harris, supra, at 552−556, and the recidivist provi&para;<br>sions in (C)(i) and (ii), which are typically sentencing&para;<br>factors as well. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U.

We now under&para;<br>stand that “ ‘[i]t is unconstitutional [under the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment] for a legislature to remove from the jury the&para;<br>assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of&para;<br>penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”&para;<br>Apprendi v.

S., at 490 (emphasis added). In other&para;<br>words, we narrowed our holding to those facts that effec&para;<br>tively raised the ceiling on the offense, but did not then&para;<br>consider whether the logic of our holding applied also&para;<br>to those facts necessary to set the floor of a particular&para;<br>sentence.&para;<br>As JUSTICE THOMAS eloquently explained in his dissent&para;<br>in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 572 (2002), the&para;<br>reasoning in our decision in Apprendi applies with equal&para;<br>force in the context of mandatory minimums. There is,&para;<br>quite simply, no reason to distinguish between facts that&para;<br>trigger punishment in excess of the statutory maximum&para;<br>and facts that trigger a mandatory minimum. This case&para;<br>vividly illustrates the point. It is quite plain that there is&para;<br>a world of difference between the 81⁄2-year sentence and&para;<br>the 7-year sentence the judge imposed on the defendants&para;<br>in this case and the 30-year sentence mandated by the&para;<br>machinegun finding under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(B).&para;<br>Mandatory minimums may have a particularly acute&para;<br>practical effect in this type of statutory scheme which&para;<br>contains an implied statutory maximum of life, see ante,&para;<br>at 10. There is, in this type of case, no ceiling; there is&para;<br>only a floor below which a sentence cannot fall. Further&para;<br>more, absent a positive finding on one of §924(c)(1)’s enu&para;<br>merated factors, it is quite clear that no judge would&para;<br>impose a sentence as great as the sentences commanded&para;<br>by the provision at issue in this case. Indeed, it appears&para;<br>that, but for those subject to the 30-year mandatory mini&para;<br>mum, no defendant has ever been sentenced to a sentence&para;<br>anywhere near 30 years for a §924(c) offense.

But thanks to an unpersua&para;<br>sive attempt to distinguish Apprendi,5 and a reluctant&para;<br>Apprendi dissenter, McMillan survived over the protest of&para;<br>four Members of the Court. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 569–&para;<br>570 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in&para;<br>judgment) (“I cannot easily distinguish Apprendi . . . from&para;<br>this case in terms of logic. For that reason, I cannot agree&para;<br>with the plurality’s opinion insofar as it finds such a dis&para;<br>tinction. At the same time . . . I cannot yet accept [Ap&para;<br>prendi’s] rule”). It appears, however, that the reluctant&para;<br>Apprendi dissenter may no longer be reluctant.6&para;<br>I am therefore in full agreement with JUSTICE THOMAS’&para;<br>separate writing today, post, at 1–2, as I was with his&para;<br>Harris dissent. McMillan and Harris should be overruled,&para;<br>at least to the extent that they authorize judicial factfind&para;<br>ing on a preponderance of the evidence standard of facts&para;<br>that “expos[e] a defendant to [a] greater punishment than&para;<br>what is otherwise legally prescribed . . .” Harris, 536&para;<br>U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Any such fact is the&para;<br>functional equivalent of an element of the offense.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Consistent with the attempt in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.&para;<br>545 (2002), to distinguish Apprendi, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s fine opinion for&para;<br>the Court today employs some of the same acrobatics to distinguish&para;<br>Harris from the present case. Harris also involved §924(c)(1), though a&para;<br>different subsection; its reading of the mandatory minimum for “bran&para;<br>dishing” a firearm contained in 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) as a sentencing&para;<br>factor is not so easily distinguished from the nearly identical manda&para;<br>tory minimum for possessing a “machinegun” under §924(c)(1)(B).&para;<br>6 “But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory&para;<br>minimums, but I don’t accept Apprendi. Well, at some point I guess I&para;<br>have to accept Apprendi, because it’s the law and has been for some&para;<br>time. So if . . . if that should become an issue about whether mandatory&para;<br>minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes,&para;<br>should we reset the case for argument?” Tr. of Oral Arg. 20 (question&para;<br>by BREYER, J.).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), this&para;<br>Court held that “ ‘[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,&para;<br>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the&para;<br>prescribed statutory maximum,’ whether the statute calls&para;<br>it an element or a sentencing factor, ‘must be submitted to&para;<br>a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,’ ” id., at 550&para;<br>(quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490&para;<br>(2000)). I continue to believe that this constitutional&para;<br>requirement applies to sentencing facts that, like the&para;<br>machinegun enhancement at issue here, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(B)(ii), “alte[r] the [defendant’s] statutorily&para;<br>mandated sentencing range, by increasing the mandatory&para;<br>minimum sentence,” regardless of whether they alter the&para;<br>statutory maximum penalty, Harris, 536 U. S., at 577&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting); see id., at 577–578 (“As a matter&para;<br>of common sense, an increased mandatory minimum&para;<br>heightens the loss of liberty and represents the increased&para;<br>stigma society attaches to the offense. Consequently, facts&para;<br>that trigger an increased mandatory minimum sentence&para;<br>warrant constitutional safeguards”).&para;<br>In my view, it makes no difference whether the sentenc&para;<br>ing fact “vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen&para;<br>tence” by many years, ante, at 10, or only “ ‘incremental[ly]&para;<br>changes’ ” it by a few, ibid.

One question decides the matter: If a sentencing fact&para;<br>either “raises the floor or raises the ceiling” of the range of&para;<br>punishments to which a defendant is exposed, it is, “ ‘by&para;<br>definition [an] “elemen[t].” ’ ” Harris, supra, at 579&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483,&para;<br>n. 10).&para;<br>Without a finding that a defendant used a machinegun,&para;<br>the penalty range for a conviction under §924(c)(1)(A)(i) is&para;<br>five years to life imprisonment. But once that finding is&para;<br>added, the penalty range becomes harsher—30 years to&para;<br>life imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)—thus “expos[ing] a&para;<br>defendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise&para;<br>legally prescribed,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). As a consequence, “it is ultimately beside the&para;<br>point whether as a matter of statutory interpretation [the&para;<br>machinegun enhancement] is a sentencing factor.” Id., at&para;<br>576. “[A]s a constitutional matter,” because it establishes&para;<br>a harsher range of punishments, it must be treated as an&para;<br>element of a separate, aggravated offense that is submit&para;<br>ted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
