If the harassing employee is&para;<br>the victim’s co-worker, the employer is liable only if it was negligent&para;<br>in controlling working conditions. In cases in which the harasser is a&para;<br>“supervisor,” however, different rules apply. If the supervisor’s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action (i.e., “a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to&para;<br>promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or&para;<br>a decision causing a significant change in benefits,” Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 761), the employer is strictly&para;<br>liable. But if no tangible employment action is taken, the employer&para;<br>may escape liability by establishing, as an affirmative defense, that&para;<br>(1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any&para;<br>harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to&para;<br>take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities that the&para;<br>employer provided. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807;&para;<br>Ellerth, supra, at 765.&para;<br>Petitioner Vance, an African-American woman, sued her employer,&para;<br>Ball State University (BSU) alleging that a fellow employee, Saundra&para;<br>Davis, created a racially hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. The District Court granted summary judgment to BSU. It&para;<br>held that BSU was not vicariously liable for Davis’ alleged actions because Davis, who could not take tangible employment actions against&para;<br>Vance, was not a supervisor. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: An employee is a “supervisor” for purposes of vicarious liability&para;<br>under Title VII only if he or she is empowered by the employer to&para;<br>take tangible employment actions against the victim. Pp. 9–30.&para;<br>(a) Petitioner errs in relying on the meaning of “supervisor” in gen-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>eral usage and in other legal contexts because the term has varying&para;<br>meanings both in colloquial usage and in the law. In any event, Congress did not use the term “supervisor” in Title VII, and the way to&para;<br>understand the term’s meaning for present purposes is to consider&para;<br>the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured framework adopted in Faragher and Ellerth. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(b) Petitioner misreads Faragher and Ellerth in claiming that those&para;<br>cases support an expansive definition of “supervisor” because, in her&para;<br>view, at least some of the alleged harassers in those cases, whom the&para;<br>Court treated as supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit’s definition demands. In Ellerth, there was no question that&para;<br>the alleged harasser, who hired and promoted his victim, was a supervisor. And in Faragher, the parties never disputed the characterization of the alleged harassers as supervisors, so the question simply&para;<br>was not before the Court. Pp. 14–18.&para;<br>(c) The answer to the question presented in this case is implicit in&para;<br>the characteristics of the framework that the Court adopted in&para;<br>Ellerth and Faragher, which draws a sharp line between co-workers&para;<br>and supervisors and implies that the authority to take tangible employment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor.&para;<br>Ellerth, supra, at 762.&para;<br>The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor adopted today is&para;<br>one that can be readily applied. An alleged harasser’s supervisor status will often be capable of being discerned before (or soon after) litigation commences and is likely to be resolved as a matter of law before trial. By contrast, the vagueness of the EEOC’s standard would&para;<br>impede the resolution of the issue before trial, possibly requiring the&para;<br>jury to be instructed on two very different paths of analysis, depending on whether it finds the alleged harasser to be a supervisor or&para;<br>merely a co-worker.&para;<br>This approach will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess some authority to assign daily&para;<br>tasks. In such cases, a victim can prevail simply by showing that the&para;<br>employer was negligent in permitting the harassment to occur, and&para;<br>the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority&para;<br>wielded by the harasser is an important factor in determining negligence. Pp. 18–25.&para;<br>(d) The definition adopted today accounts for the fact that many&para;<br>modern organizations have abandoned a hierarchical management&para;<br>structure in favor of giving employees overlapping authority with respect to work assignments. Petitioner fears that employers will attempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment&para;<br>by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible employment actions, but a broad definition of “supervisor” is not neces-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998), namely, who&para;<br>qualifies as a “supervisor” in a case in which an employee&para;<br>asserts a Title VII claim for workplace harassment?&para;<br>Under Title VII, an employer’s liability for such har­&para;<br>assment may depend on the status of the harasser. If the&para;<br>harassing employee is the victim’s co-worker, the employer&para;<br>is liable only if it was negligent in controlling working&para;<br>conditions. In cases in which the harasser is a “supervisor,” however, different rules apply. If the supervisor’s&para;<br>harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,&para;<br>the employer is strictly liable. But if no tangible employ­&para;<br>ment action is taken, the employer may escape liability by&para;<br>establishing, as an affirmative defense, that (1) the em­&para;<br>ployer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct&para;<br>any harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unrea­&para;<br>sonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or&para;<br>corrective opportunities that the employer provided. Id.,&para;<br>at 807; Ellerth, supra, at 765. Under this framework,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>therefore, it matters whether a harasser is a “supervisor”&para;<br>or simply a co-worker.&para;<br>We hold that an employee is a “supervisor” for purposes&para;<br>of vicarious liability under Title VII if he or she is empow­&para;<br>ered by the employer to take tangible employment actions&para;<br>against the victim, and we therefore affirm the judgment&para;<br>of the Seventh Circuit.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Maetta Vance, an African-American woman, began&para;<br>working for Ball State University (BSU) in 1989 as a sub­&para;<br>stitute server in the University Banquet and Catering&para;<br>division of Dining Services. In 1991, BSU promoted Vance&para;<br>to a part-time catering assistant position, and in 2007 she&para;<br>applied and was selected for a position as a full-time cater­&para;<br>ing assistant.&para;<br>Over the course of her employment with BSU, Vance&para;<br>lodged numerous complaints of racial discrimination and&para;<br>retaliation, but most of those incidents are not at issue&para;<br>here. For present purposes, the only relevant incidents&para;<br>concern Vance’s interactions with a fellow BSU employee,&para;<br>Saundra Davis.&para;<br>During the time in question, Davis, a white woman, was&para;<br>employed as a catering specialist in the Banquet and&para;<br>Catering division. The parties vigorously dispute the&para;<br>precise nature and scope of Davis’ duties, but they agree&para;<br>that Davis did not have the power to hire, fire, demote,&para;<br>promote, transfer, or discipline Vance. See No. 1:06–cv–&para;<br>1452–SEB–JMS, 2008 WL 4247836, *12 (SD Ind., Sept.&para;<br>10, 2008) (“Vance makes no allegations that Ms. Davis&para;<br>possessed any such power”); Brief for Petitioner 9–11&para;<br>(describing Davis’ authority over Vance); Brief for Re­&para;<br>spondent 39 (“[A]ll agree that Davis lacked the authority to take tangible employments [sic] actions against&para;<br>petitioner”).&para;<br>In late 2005 and early 2006, Vance filed internal com­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>plaints with BSU and charges with the Equal Employ­&para;<br>ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging racial&para;<br>harassment and discrimination, and many of these com­&para;<br>plaints and charges pertained to Davis. 646 F. 3d 461, 467&para;<br>(CA7 2011). Vance complained that Davis “gave her a&para;<br>hard time at work by glaring at her, slamming pots and&para;<br>pans around her, and intimidating her.” Ibid. She alleged&para;<br>that she was “left alone in the kitchen with Davis, who&para;<br>smiled at her”; that Davis “blocked” her on an elevator and&para;<br>“stood there with her cart smiling”; and that Davis often&para;<br>gave her “weird” looks. Ibid. (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Vance’s workplace strife persisted despite BSU’s at­&para;<br>tempts to address the problem. As a result, Vance filed&para;<br>this lawsuit in 2006 in the United States District Court for&para;<br>the Southern District of Indiana, claiming, among other&para;<br>things, that she had been subjected to a racially hostile&para;<br>work environment in violation of Title VII. In her com­&para;<br>plaint, she alleged that Davis was her supervisor and that&para;<br>BSU was liable for Davis’ creation of a racially hostile&para;<br>work environment. Complaint in No. 1:06–cv–01452–&para;<br>SEB–TAB (SD Ind., Oct. 3, 2006), Dkt. No. 1, pp. 5–6.&para;<br>Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the&para;<br>District Court entered summary judgment in favor of&para;<br>BSU. 2008 WL 4247836, at *1. The court explained that&para;<br>BSU could not be held vicariously liable for Davis’ alleged&para;<br>racial harassment because Davis could not “ ‘hire, fire,&para;<br>demote, promote, transfer, or discipline’ ” Vance and, as a&para;<br>result, was not Vance’s supervisor under the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit’s interpretation of that concept. See id., at *12&para;<br>(quoting Hall v. Bodine Elect. Co., 276 F. 3d 345, 355 (CA7&para;<br>2002)). The court further held that BSU could not be&para;<br>liable in negligence because it responded reasonably to the&para;<br>incidents of which it was aware. 2008 WL 4247836, *15.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit affirmed. 646 F. 3d 461. It ex­&para;<br>plained that, under its settled precedent, supervisor status&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>requires “ ‘the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, trans­&para;<br>fer, or discipline an employee.’ ” Id., at 470 (quoting Hall,&para;<br>supra, at 355). The court concluded that Davis was not&para;<br>Vance’s supervisor and thus that Vance could not recover&para;<br>from BSU unless she could prove negligence. Finding that&para;<br>BSU was not negligent with respect to Davis’ conduct, the&para;<br>court affirmed. 646 F. 3d, at 470–473.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an&para;<br>unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to&para;<br>discriminate against any individual with respect to his&para;<br>compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ­&para;<br>ment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,&para;<br>or national origin.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). This pro­&para;<br>vision obviously prohibits discrimination with respect to&para;<br>employment decisions that have direct economic conse­&para;<br>quences, such as termination, demotion, and pay cuts.&para;<br>But not long after Title VII was enacted, the lower courts&para;<br>held that Title VII also reaches the creation or perpetua­&para;<br>tion of a discriminatory work environment.&para;<br>In the leading case of Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234&para;<br>(1971), the Fifth Circuit recognized a cause of action based&para;<br>on this theory. See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,&para;<br>477 U. S. 57, 65–66 (1986) (describing development of&para;<br>hostile environment claims based on race). The Rogers&para;<br>court reasoned that “the phrase ‘terms, conditions, or&para;<br>privileges of employment’ in [Title VII] is an expansive&para;<br>concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the&para;<br>practice of creating a working environment heavily&para;<br>charged with ethnic or racial discrimination.” 454 F. 2d,&para;<br>at 238. The court observed that “[o]ne can readily envision&para;<br>working environments so heavily polluted with discrimi­&para;<br>nation as to destroy completely the emotional and psy­&para;<br>chological stability of minority group workers.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Following this decision, the lower courts generally held that&para;<br>an employer was liable for a racially hostile work environment if the employer was negligent, i.e., if the employer&para;<br>knew or reasonably should have known about the harass­&para;<br>ment but failed to take remedial action. See Ellerth, 524&para;<br>U. S., at 768–769 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (citing cases).&para;<br>When the issue eventually reached this Court, we&para;<br>agreed that Title VII prohibits the creation of a hostile&para;<br>work environment. See Meritor, supra, at 64–67. In such&para;<br>cases, we have held, the plaintiff must show that the work&para;<br>environment was so pervaded by discrimination that the&para;<br>terms and conditions of employment were altered. See,&para;<br>e.g., Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21&para;<br>(1993).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Consistent with Rogers, we have held that an employer&para;<br>is directly liable for an employee’s unlawful harassment if&para;<br>the employer was negligent with respect to the offensive&para;<br>behavior. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 789. Courts have gen­&para;<br>erally applied this rule to evaluate employer liability when&para;<br>a co-worker harasses the plaintiff.1&para;<br>In Ellerth and Faragher, however, we held that different&para;<br>rules apply where the harassing employee is the plaintiff ’s “supervisor.” In those instances, an employer may be&para;<br>vicariously liable for its employees’ creation of a hostile&para;<br>work environment. And in identifying the situations in&para;<br>which such vicarious liability is appropriate, we looked to&para;<br>the Restatement of Agency for guidance. See, e.g., Meri——————&para;<br>1 See, e.g., Williams v. Waste Management of Ill., 361 F. 3d 1021, 1029&para;<br>(CA7 2004); McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F. 3d 1103, 1119 (CA9&para;<br>2004); Joens v. John Morrell &amp; Co., 354 F. 3d 938, 940 (CA8 2004);&para;<br>Noviello v. Boston, 398 F. 3d 76, 95 (CA1 2005); Duch v. Jakubek, 588&para;<br>F. 3d 757, 762 (CA2 2009); Huston v. Procter &amp; Gamble Paper Prods.&para;<br>Corp., 568 F. 3d 100, 104–105 (CA3 2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tor, supra, at 72; Ellerth, supra, at 755.&para;<br>Under the Restatement, “masters” are generally not&para;<br>liable for the torts of their “servants” when the torts are&para;<br>committed outside the scope of the servants’ employment.&para;<br>See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency §219(2), p. 481&para;<br>(1957) (Restatement). And because racial and sexual&para;<br>harassment are unlikely to fall within the scope of a serv­&para;<br>ant’s duties, application of this rule would generally pre­&para;<br>clude employer liability for employee harassment. See&para;<br>Faragher, supra, at 793–796; Ellerth, supra, at 757. But&para;<br>in Ellerth and Faragher, we held that a provision of the&para;<br>Restatement provided the basis for an exception. Section&para;<br>219(2)(d) of that Restatement recognizes an exception to&para;<br>the general rule just noted for situations in which the&para;<br>servant was “aided in accomplishing the tort by the exist­&para;<br>ence of the agency relation.”2 Restatement 481; see Faragher, supra, at 802–803; Ellerth, supra, at 760–763.&para;<br>Adapting this concept to the Title VII context, Ellerth&para;<br>and Faragher identified two situations in which the aided­&para;<br>in-the-accomplishment rule warrants employer liability&para;<br>even in the absence of negligence, and both of these situa­&para;<br>tions involve harassment by a “supervisor” as opposed to a&para;<br>co-worker. First, the Court held that an employer is vicar­&para;<br>iously liable “when a supervisor takes a tangible employ­&para;<br>ment action,” Ellerth, supra, at 762; Faragher, supra, at&para;<br>790—i.e., “a significant change in employment status, such&para;<br>as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Restatement (Third) of Agency disposed of this exception to&para;<br>liability, explaining that “[t]he purposes likely intended to be met by&para;<br>the ‘aided in accomplishing’ basis are satisfied by a more fully elaborat­&para;<br>ed treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care&para;<br>that a principal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through&para;<br>employees and other agents.” 2 Restatement (Third) §7.08, p. 228&para;<br>(2005). The parties do not argue that this change undermines our&para;<br>holdings in Faragher and Ellerth.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>significantly different responsibilities, or a decision caus­&para;<br>ing a significant change in benefits.” Ellerth, 524 U. S., at&para;<br>761. We explained the reason for this rule as follows:&para;<br>“When a supervisor makes a tangible employment deci­&para;<br>sion, there is assurance the injury could not have been&para;<br>inflicted absent the agency relation. . . . A tangible em­&para;<br>ployment decision requires an official act of the enterprise,&para;<br>a company act. The decision in most cases is documented&para;<br>in official company records, and may be subject to review&para;<br>by higher level supervisors.” Id., at 761–762. In those&para;<br>circumstances, we said, it is appropriate to hold the em­&para;<br>ployer strictly liable. See Faragher, supra, at 807; Ellerth,&para;<br>supra, at 765.&para;<br>Second, Ellerth and Faragher held that, even when&para;<br>a supervisor’s harassment does not culminate in a tangible&para;<br>employment action, the employer can be vicariously liable&para;<br>for the supervisor’s creation of a hostile work environment&para;<br>if the employer is unable to establish an affirmative de­&para;<br>fense.3 We began by noting that “a supervisor’s power&para;<br>and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with&para;<br>a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Faragher&para;<br>&para;<br>and Ellerth involved hostile environment claims premised&para;<br>on sexual harassment. Several federal courts of appeals have held that&para;<br>Faragher and Ellerth apply to other types of hostile environment&para;<br>claims, including race-based claims. See Spriggs v. Diamond Auto&para;<br>Glass, 242 F. 3d 179, 186, n. 9 (CA4 2001) (citing cases reflecting “the&para;<br>developing consensus . . . that the holdings [in Faragher and Ellerth]&para;<br>apply with equal force to other types of harassment claims under Title&para;<br>VII”). But see Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (stat­&para;<br>ing that, as a result of the Court’s decision in Ellerth, “employer liabil­&para;<br>ity under Title VII is judged by different standards depending upon&para;<br>whether a sexually or racially hostile work environment is alleged”).&para;<br>Neither party in this case challenges the application of Faragher and&para;<br>Ellerth to race-based hostile environment claims, and we assume that&para;<br>the framework announced in Faragher and Ellerth applies to cases such&para;<br>as this one.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>supervisor always is aided by the agency relation.” Ellerth, supra, at 763; see Faragher, 524 U. S., at 803–805.&para;<br>But it would go too far, we found, to make employers&para;<br>strictly liable whenever a “supervisor” engages in harass­&para;<br>ment that does not result in a tangible employment action,&para;<br>and we therefore held that in such cases the employer may&para;<br>raise an affirmative defense. Specifically, an employer can&para;<br>mitigate or avoid liability by showing (1) that it exercised&para;<br>reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any har­&para;<br>assing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably&para;<br>failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective&para;<br>opportunities that were provided. Faragher, supra, at 807;&para;<br>Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765. This compromise, we explained, “accommodate[s] the agency principles of vicari­&para;<br>ous liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory&para;<br>authority, as well as Title VII’s equally basic policies of&para;<br>encouraging forethought by employers and saving action&para;<br>by objecting employees.” Id., at 764.&para;<br>The dissenting Members of the Court in Ellerth and&para;<br>Faragher would not have created a special rule for cases&para;<br>involving harassment by “supervisors.” Instead, they&para;<br>would have held that an employer is liable for any em­&para;<br>ployee’s creation of a hostile work environment “if, and&para;<br>only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negli­&para;<br>gent in permitting the [offending] conduct to occur.”&para;<br>Ellerth, supra, at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Faragher,&para;<br>supra, at 810 (same).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Under Ellerth and Faragher, it is obviously important&para;<br>whether an alleged harasser is a “supervisor” or merely a&para;<br>co-worker, and the lower courts have disagreed about the&para;<br>meaning of the concept of a supervisor in this context.&para;<br>Some courts, including the Seventh Circuit below, have&para;<br>held that an employee is not a supervisor unless he or she&para;<br>has the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Other&para;<br>courts have substantially followed the more open-ended&para;<br>approach advocated by the EEOC’s Enforcement Guid­&para;<br>ance, which ties supervisor status to the ability to exercise&para;<br>significant direction over another’s daily work. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 126–127 (CA2&para;<br>2003); Whitten v.

Petitioner’s reliance on colloquial uses&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>United States urges us to defer to the EEOC Guidance. Brief&para;<br>for United States as Amicus Curiae 26–29 (citing Skidmore v. Swift &amp;&para;<br>Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)). But to do so would be proper only if the&para;<br>EEOC Guidance has the power to persuade, which “depend[s] upon the&para;<br>thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning,&para;<br>[and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.” Id., at&para;<br>140. For the reasons explained below, we do not find the EEOC Guid­&para;<br>ance persuasive.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of the term “supervisor” is misplaced, and her contention&para;<br>that our cases require the EEOC’s abstract definition is&para;<br>simply wrong.&para;<br>As we will explain, the framework set out in Ellerth and&para;<br>Faragher presupposes a clear distinction between supervi­&para;<br>sors and co-workers. Those decisions contemplate a uni­&para;<br>tary category of supervisors, i.e., those employees with the&para;<br>authority to make tangible employment decisions. There&para;<br>is no hint in either decision that the Court had in mind&para;<br>two categories of supervisors: first, those who have such&para;<br>authority and, second, those who, although lacking this&para;<br>power, nevertheless have the ability to direct a co-worker’s&para;<br>labor to some ill-defined degree. On the contrary, the&para;<br>Ellerth/Faragher framework is one under which supervi­&para;<br>sory status can usually be readily determined, generally&para;<br>by written documentation. The approach recommended by&para;<br>the EEOC Guidance, by contrast, would make the deter­&para;<br>mination of supervisor status depend on a highly case­&para;<br>specific evaluation of numerous factors.&para;<br>The Ellerth/Faragher framework represents what the&para;<br>Court saw as a workable compromise between the aided­&para;<br>in-the-accomplishment theory of vicarious liability and the&para;<br>legitimate interests of employers. The Seventh Circuit’s&para;<br>understanding of the concept of a “supervisor,” with which&para;<br>we agree, is easily workable; it can be applied without&para;<br>undue difficulty at both the summary judgment stage and&para;<br>at trial. The alternative, in many cases, would frustrate&para;<br>judges and confound jurors.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Petitioner contends that her expansive understanding of&para;<br>the concept of a “supervisor” is supported by the meaning&para;<br>of the word in general usage and in other legal contexts,&para;<br>see Brief for Petitioner 25–28, but this argument is both&para;<br>incorrect on its own terms and, in any event, misguided.&para;<br>In general usage, the term “supervisor” lacks a suffi­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ciently specific meaning to be helpful for present purposes.&para;<br>Petitioner is certainly right that the term is often used to&para;<br>refer to a person who has the authority to direct another’s&para;<br>work. See, e.g., 17 Oxford English Dictionary 245 (2d ed.&para;<br>1989) (defining the term as applying to “one who inspects&para;<br>and directs the work of others”). But the term is also&para;<br>often closely tied to the authority to take what Ellerth&para;<br>and Faragher referred to as a “tangible employment action.”&para;<br>See, e.g., Webster’s Third New International Dictionary&para;<br>2296, def. 1(a) (1976) (“a person having authority delegated by an employer to hire, transfer, suspend, recall,&para;<br>promote, assign, or discharge another employee or to recommend such action”).&para;<br>A comparison of the definitions provided by two collo­&para;<br>quial business authorities illustrates the term’s impreci­&para;<br>sion in general usage. One says that “[s]upervisors are&para;<br>usually authorized to recommend and/or effect hiring,&para;<br>disciplining, promoting, punishing, rewarding, and other&para;<br>associated activities regarding the employees in their&para;<br>departments.”5 Another says exactly the opposite: “A&para;<br>supervisor generally does not have the power to hire or&para;<br>fire employees or to promote them.”6 Compare Ellerth,&para;<br>524 U. S., at 762 (“Tangible employment actions fall with­&para;<br>in the special province of the supervisor”).&para;<br>If we look beyond general usage to the meaning of the&para;<br>term in other legal contexts, we find much the same situa­&para;<br>tion. Sometimes the term is reserved for those in the&para;<br>upper echelons of the management hierarchy. See, e.g., 25&para;<br>U. S. C. §2021(18) (defining the “supervisor” of a school&para;<br>within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/supervisor.html (all Internet materials as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of&para;<br>Court’s case file).&para;<br>6 http://management.about.com/od/policiesandprocedures/g/&para;<br>supervisor1.html&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v.

But sometimes the term is used to refer&para;<br>to lower ranking individuals.&para;<br>See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§152(11) (defining a supervisor to include “any individual&para;<br>having authority . . . to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off,&para;<br>recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline&para;<br>other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust&para;<br>their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action,&para;<br>if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such&para;<br>authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature,&para;<br>but requires the use of independent judgment”); 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1396n(j)(4)(A) (providing that an eligible Medicaid&para;<br>beneficiary who receives care through an approved self­&para;<br>directed services plan may “hire, fire, supervise, and man­&para;<br>age the individuals providing such services”).&para;<br>Although the meaning of the concept of a supervisor&para;<br>varies from one legal context to another, the law often&para;<br>contemplates that the ability to supervise includes the&para;<br>ability to take tangible employment actions.7 See, e.g., 5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 One outlier that petitioner points to is the National Labor Relations&para;<br>Act (NLRA), 29 U. S. C. §152(11). Petitioner argues that the NLRA’s&para;<br>definition supports her position in this case to the extent that it encom­&para;<br>passes employees who have the ability to direct or assign work to&para;<br>subordinates. Brief for Petitioner 27–28.&para;<br>The NLRA certainly appears to define “supervisor” in broad terms.&para;<br>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the lower courts,&para;<br>however, have consistently explained that supervisory authority is not&para;<br>trivial or insignificant: If the term “supervisor” is construed too broadly,&para;<br>then employees who are deemed to be supervisors will be denied rights&para;<br>that the NLRA was intended to protect. E.g., In re Connecticut Humane Society, 358 NLRB No. 31, *33 (Apr. 12, 2012); Frenchtown&para;<br>Acquisition Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 683 F. 3d 298, 305 (CA6 2012); Beverly&para;<br>Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F. 3d 960, 963 (CADC&para;<br>1999). Indeed, in defining a supervisor for purposes of the NLRA,&para;<br>Congress sought to distinguish “between straw bosses, leadmen, set-up&para;<br>men, and other minor supervisory employees, on the one hand, and the&para;<br>supervisor vested with such genuine management prerogatives as the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1947).&para;<br>Cf. NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.

See,&para;<br>e.g., Connecticut Humane Society, supra, at *39 (an employee who&para;<br>evaluates others is not a supervisor unless the evaluation “affect[s] the&para;<br>wages and the job status of the employee evaluated”); In re CGLM, Inc.,&para;<br>350 NLRB 974, 977 (2007) (“ ‘If any authority over someone else, no&para;<br>matter how insignificant or infrequent, made an employee a supervisor, our industrial composite would be predominantly supervisory.&para;<br>Every order-giver is not a supervisor.

The NLRA&para;<br>therefore does not define the term “supervisor” as broadly as petitioner&para;<br>suggests.&para;<br>To be sure, the NLRA may in some instances define “supervisor”&para;<br>more broadly than we define the term in this case. But those differ­&para;<br>ences reflect the NLRA’s unique purpose, which is to preserve the&para;<br>balance of power between labor and management, see HCRA, supra, at&para;<br>573 (explaining that Congress amended the NLRA to exclude supervi­&para;<br>sors in order to address the “imbalance between labor and manage­&para;<br>ment” that resulted when “supervisory employees could organize as&para;<br>part of bargaining units and negotiate with the employer”). That&para;<br>purpose is inapposite in the context of Title VII, which focuses on&para;<br>eradicating discrimination. An employee may have a sufficient degree&para;<br>of authority over subordinates such that Congress has decided that the&para;<br>employee should not participate with lower level employees in the same&para;<br>collective-bargaining unit (because, for example, a higher level employ­&para;<br>ee will pursue his own interests at the expense of lower level employees’&para;<br>interests), but that authority is not necessarily sufficient to merit&para;<br>heightened liability for the purposes of Title VII. The NLRA’s defini­&para;<br>tion of supervisor therefore is not controlling in this context.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v.

And for this&para;<br>reason, petitioner’s argument, taken on its own terms, is&para;<br>unsuccessful.&para;<br>More important, petitioner is misguided in suggesting&para;<br>that we should approach the question presented here as if&para;<br>“supervisor” were a statutory term. “Supervisor” is not a&para;<br>term used by Congress in Title VII. Rather, the term was&para;<br>adopted by this Court in Ellerth and Faragher as a label&para;<br>for the class of employees whose misconduct may give&para;<br>rise to vicarious employer liability. Accordingly, the way&para;<br>to understand the meaning of the term “supervisor” for&para;<br>present purposes is to consider the interpretation that&para;<br>best fits within the highly structured framework that&para;<br>those cases adopted.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In considering Ellerth and Faragher, we are met at the&para;<br>outset with petitioner’s contention that at least some of&para;<br>the alleged harassers in those cases, whom we treated as&para;<br>supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh Cir­&para;<br>cuit’s definition demands. This argument misreads our&para;<br>decisions.&para;<br>In Ellerth, it was clear that the alleged harasser was a&para;<br>supervisor under any definition of the term: He hired his&para;<br>victim, and he promoted her (subject only to the ministerial approval of his supervisor, who merely signed the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>paperwork). 524 U. S., at 747. Ellerth was a case from&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit, and at the time of its decision in that&para;<br>case, that court had already adopted its current definition&para;<br>of a supervisor. See Volk v. Coler, 845 F. 2d 1422, 1436&para;<br>(1988). See also Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc.,&para;<br>163 F. 3d 1027, 1033, n. 1 (CA7 1998) (discussing Circuit&para;<br>case law). Although the en banc Seventh Circuit in&para;<br>Ellerth issued eight separate opinions, there was no disa­&para;<br>greement about the harasser’s status as a supervisor.&para;<br>Jansen v. Packaging Corp. of America, 123 F. 3d 490&para;<br>(1997) (per curiam). Likewise, when the case reached this&para;<br>Court, no question about the harasser’s status was raised.&para;<br>The same is true with respect to Faragher. In that case,&para;<br>Faragher, a female lifeguard, sued her employer, the city&para;<br>of Boca Raton, for sexual harassment based on the conduct&para;<br>of two other lifeguards, Bill Terry and David Silverman,&para;<br>and we held that the city was vicariously liable for Terry’s&para;<br>and Silverman’s harassment. Although it is clear that&para;<br>Terry had authority to take tangible employment actions&para;<br>affecting the victim,8 see 524 U. S., at 781 (explaining that&para;<br>Terry could hire new lifeguards, supervise their work&para;<br>assignments, counsel, and discipline them), Silverman&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The dissent suggests that it is unclear whether Terry would qualify&para;<br>as a supervisor under the test we adopt because his hiring decisions&para;<br>were subject to approval by higher management. Post, at 7, n. 1 (opin­&para;<br>ion of GINSBURG, J.). See also Faragher, 524 U. S., at 781. But we have&para;<br>assumed that tangible employment actions can be subject to such&para;<br>approval. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. In any event, the record&para;<br>indicates that Terry possessed the power to make employment deci­&para;<br>sions having direct economic consequences for his victims. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner in Faragher v. Boca Raton, O. T. 1997, No. 97–282, p. 9 (“No&para;<br>one, during the twenty years that Terry was Marine Safety Chief, was&para;<br>hired without his recommendation.

Nevertheless, the city never disputed Far­&para;<br>agher’s characterization of both men as her “supervisors.”&para;<br>See App., O.

See Brief for Petitioner, O. T.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Moreover,&para;<br>&para;<br>it is by no means certain that Silverman lacked the au­&para;<br>thority to take tangible employment actions against Faragher. In her&para;<br>merits brief, Faragher stated that, as a lieutenant, Silverman “made&para;<br>supervisory and disciplinary decisions and had input on the evaluations&para;<br>as well.” Id., at 9–10. If that discipline had economic consequences&para;<br>(such as suspension without pay), then Silverman might qualify as a&para;<br>supervisor under the definition we adopt today.&para;<br>Silverman’s ability to assign Faragher significantly different work&para;<br>responsibilities also may have constituted a tangible employment&para;<br>action. Silverman told Faragher, “ ‘Date me or clean the toilets for a&para;<br>year.’ ” Faragher, supra, at 780. That threatened reassignment of&para;<br>duties likely would have constituted significantly different responsibili­&para;<br>ties for a lifeguard, whose job typically is to guard the beach. If that&para;<br>reassignment had economic consequences, such as foreclosing Faragher’s eligibility for promotion, then it might constitute a tangible&para;<br>employment action.&para;<br>10 The lower court did not even address this issue. See Faragher v.&para;<br>Boca Raton, 111 F. 3d 1530, 1547 (CA11 1997) (Anderson, J., concur­&para;<br>ring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that it was unnecessary to&para;<br>“decide the threshold level of authority which a supervisor must possess&para;<br>in order to impose liability on the employer”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The question in that case was “whether a&para;<br>constructive discharge brought about by supervisor harassment ranks&para;<br>as a tangible employment action and therefore precludes assertion of&para;<br>the affirmative defense articulated in Ellerth and Faragher.” Suders,&para;<br>supra, at 140. As the dissent implicitly acknowledges, the supervi­&para;<br>sor status of the harassing employees was not before us in that case.&para;<br>See post, at 8. Indeed, the employer conceded early in the litigation&para;<br>that the relevant employees were supervisors, App. in Pennsylvania&para;<br>State Police v. Suders, O. T. 2003, No. 03–95, p. 20 (Answer ¶29),&para;<br>and we therefore had no occasion to question that unchallenged&para;<br>characterization.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>simply not sufficient. Employees with such powers are&para;<br>certainly capable of creating intolerable work environ­&para;<br>ments, see post, at 9–11 (discussing examples), but so are&para;<br>many other co-workers. Negligence provides the better&para;<br>framework for evaluating an employer’s liability when a&para;<br>harassing employee lacks the power to take tangible em­&para;<br>ployment actions.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Although our holdings in Faragher and Ellerth do not&para;<br>resolve the question now before us, we believe that the&para;<br>answer to that question is implicit in the characteristics of&para;<br>the framework that we adopted.&para;<br>To begin, there is no hint in either Ellerth or Faragher&para;<br>that the Court contemplated anything other than a uni­&para;<br>tary category of supervisors, namely, those possessing the&para;<br>authority to effect a tangible change in a victim’s terms or&para;<br>conditions of employment. The Ellerth/Faragher framework&para;<br>draws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors.&para;<br>Co-workers, the Court noted, “can inflict psychological injuries” by creating a hostile work environment, but&para;<br>they “cannot dock another’s pay, nor can one co-worker&para;<br>demote another.” Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. Only a su­&para;<br>pervisor has the power to cause “direct economic harm” by&para;<br>taking a tangible employment action. Ibid. “Tangible&para;<br>employment actions fall within the special province of the&para;<br>supervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the&para;<br>company as a distinct class of agent to make economic&para;<br>decisions affecting other employees under his or her con­&para;<br>trol. . . . Tangible employment actions are the means by&para;<br>which the supervisor brings the official power of the en­&para;<br>terprise to bear on subordinates.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>The strong implication of this passage is that the authori­&para;<br>ty to take tangible employment actions is the defining&para;<br>characteristic of a supervisor, not simply a characteristic&para;<br>of a subset of an ill-defined class of employees who qualify&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>as supervisors.&para;<br>The way in which we framed the question presented&para;<br>in Ellerth supports this understanding. As noted, the&para;<br>Ellerth/Faragher framework sets out two circumstances&para;<br>in which an employer may be vicariously liable for a su­&para;<br>pervisor’s harassment. The first situation (which results&para;<br>in strict liability) exists when a supervisor actually takes&para;<br>a tangible employment action based on, for example, a&para;<br>subordinate’s refusal to accede to sexual demands. The&para;<br>second situation (which results in vicarious liability if the&para;<br>employer cannot make out the requisite affirmative de­&para;<br>fense) is present when no such tangible action is taken.&para;<br>Both Ellerth and Faragher fell into the second category,&para;<br>and in Ellerth, the Court couched the question at issue in&para;<br>the following terms: “whether an employer has vicarious&para;<br>liability when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment by making explicit threats to alter a subor­&para;<br>dinate’s terms or conditions of employment, based on sex,&para;<br>but does not fulfill the threat.” 524 U. S., at 754. This&para;<br>statement plainly ties the second situation to a supervi­&para;<br>sor’s authority to inflict direct economic injury. It is be­&para;<br>cause a supervisor has that authority—and its potential&para;<br>use hangs as a threat over the victim—that vicarious&para;<br>liability (subject to the affirmative defense) is justified.&para;<br>Finally, the Ellerth/Faragher Court sought a frame­&para;<br>work that would be workable and would appropriately&para;<br>take into account the legitimate interests of employers and&para;<br>employees. The Court looked to principles of agency law&para;<br>for guidance, but the Court concluded that the “malleable&para;<br>terminology” of the aided-in-the-commission principle&para;<br>counseled against the wholesale incorporation of that&para;<br>principle into Title VII case law. Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763.&para;<br>Instead, the Court also considered the objectives of Title&para;<br>VII, including “the limitation of employer liability in cer­&para;<br>tain circumstances.” Id., at 764.&para;<br>The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that we&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>adopt today is one that can be readily applied. In a great&para;<br>many cases, it will be known even before litigation is&para;<br>commenced whether an alleged harasser was a supervi­&para;<br>sor, and in others, the alleged harasser’s status will be­&para;<br>come clear to both sides after discovery. And once this is&para;<br>known, the parties will be in a position to assess the&para;<br>strength of a case and to explore the possibility of resolv­&para;<br>ing the dispute. Where this does not occur, supervisor&para;<br>status will generally be capable of resolution at summary&para;<br>judgment. By contrast, under the approach advocated by&para;<br>petitioner and the EEOC, supervisor status would very&para;<br>often be murky—as this case well illustrates.12&para;<br>According to petitioner, the record shows that Davis, her&para;<br>alleged harasser, wielded enough authority to qualify as a&para;<br>supervisor. Petitioner points in particular to Davis’ job&para;<br>description, which gave her leadership responsibilities,&para;<br>and to evidence that Davis at times led or directed Vance&para;<br>and other employees in the kitchen.

At least on the present record, the&para;<br>United States tells us, Davis fails to qualify as a supervi­&para;<br>sor.

In&para;<br>its Enforcement Guidance, the EEOC takes the position&para;<br>that an employee, in order to be classified as a supervisor,&para;<br>must wield authority “ ‘of sufficient magnitude so as to as­&para;<br>sist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out&para;<br>the harassment.’ ” Id., at 27 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>89a (EEOC Guidance)). But any authority over the work&para;<br>of another employee provides at least some assistance, see&para;<br>Ellerth, supra, at 763, and that is not what the United&para;<br>States interprets the Guidance to mean. Rather, it in­&para;<br>forms us, the authority must exceed both an ill-defined&para;<br>temporal requirement (it must be more than “occa­&para;<br>siona[l]”) and an ill-defined substantive requirement (“an&para;<br>employee who directs ‘only a limited number of tasks or&para;<br>assignments’ for another employee . . . would not have&para;<br>sufficient authority to qualify as a supervisor.” U. S. Brief&para;<br>28 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance));&para;<br>U. S. Brief 31.&para;<br>We read the EEOC Guidance as saying that the number&para;<br>(and perhaps the importance) of the tasks in question is a&para;<br>factor to be considered in determining whether an employ­&para;<br>ee qualifies as a supervisor. And if this is a correct inter­&para;<br>pretation of the EEOC’s position, what we are left with is&para;<br>a proposed standard of remarkable ambiguity.&para;<br>The vagueness of this standard was highlighted at oral&para;<br>argument when the attorney representing the United&para;<br>States was asked to apply that standard to the situation in&para;<br>Faragher, where the alleged harasser supposedly threat­&para;<br>ened to assign the plaintiff to clean the toilets in the life­&para;<br>guard station for a year if she did not date him. 524 U. S.,&para;<br>at 780. Since cleaning the toilets is just one task, albeit an&para;<br>unpleasant one, the authority to assign that job would not&para;<br>seem to meet the more-than-a-limited-number-of-tasks&para;<br>requirement in the EEOC Guidance. Nevertheless, the&para;<br>Government attorney’s first response was that the author­&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ity to make this assignment would be enough. Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 23. He later qualified that answer by saying that it&para;<br>would be necessary to “know how much of the day’s work&para;<br>[was] encompassed by cleaning the toilets.” Id., at 23–24.&para;<br>He did not explain what percentage of the day’s work&para;<br>(50%, 25%, 10%?) would suffice.&para;<br>The Government attorney’s inability to provide a definitive answer to this question was the inevitable consequence of the vague standard that the Government&para;<br>asks us to adopt. Key components of that standard—&para;<br>“sufficient” authority, authority to assign more than a&para;<br>“limited number of tasks,” and authority that is exercised&para;<br>more than “occasionally”—have no clear meaning. Apply­&para;<br>ing these standards would present daunting problems for&para;<br>the lower federal courts and for juries.&para;<br>Under the definition of “supervisor” that we adopt to­&para;<br>day, the question of supervisor status, when contested, can&para;<br>very often be resolved as a matter of law before trial. The&para;<br>elimination of this issue from the trial will focus the ef­&para;<br>forts of the parties, who will be able to present their cases&para;<br>in a way that conforms to the framework that the jury will&para;<br>apply. The plaintiff will know whether he or she must&para;<br>prove that the employer was negligent or whether the&para;<br>employer will have the burden of proving the elements of&para;<br>the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. Perhaps even&para;<br>more important, the work of the jury, which is inevitably&para;<br>complicated in employment discrimination cases, will be&para;<br>simplified. The jurors can be given preliminary instruc­&para;<br>tions that allow them to understand, as the evidence&para;<br>comes in, how each item of proof fits into the framework&para;<br>that they will ultimately be required to apply. And even&para;<br>where the issue of supervisor status cannot be eliminated&para;<br>from the trial (because there are genuine factual disputes&para;<br>about an alleged harasser’s authority to take tangible&para;<br>employment actions), this preliminary question is relatively straightforward.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The complexity of the standard they&para;<br>favor would impede the resolution of the issue before trial.&para;<br>With the issue still open when trial commences, the par­&para;<br>ties would be compelled to present evidence and argu­&para;<br>ment on supervisor status, the affirmative defense, and the&para;<br>question of negligence, and the jury would have to grapple&para;<br>with all those issues as well. In addition, it would often be&para;<br>necessary for the jury to be instructed about two very&para;<br>different paths of analysis, i.e., what to do if the alleged&para;<br>harasser was found to be a supervisor and what to do if&para;<br>the alleged harasser was found to be merely a co-worker.&para;<br>Courts and commentators alike have opined on the need&para;<br>for reasonably clear jury instructions in employment&para;<br>discrimination cases.13 And the danger of juror confusion&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Gross v.

The nature and degree of authority possessed by&para;<br>harassing employees varies greatly, see post, 9–11 (offer­&para;<br>ing examples), and as we explained above, the test pro­&para;<br>posed by petitioner and the United States is ill equipped to&para;<br>deal with the variety of situations that will inevitably&para;<br>arise. This variety presents no problem for the negligence&para;<br>standard, which is thought to provide adequate protection&para;<br>for tort plaintiffs in many other situations. There is no&para;<br>reason why this standard, if accompanied by proper in­&para;<br>structions, cannot provide the same service in the context&para;<br>at issue here.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The dissent argues that the definition of a supervisor&para;<br>that we now adopt is out of touch with the realities of&para;<br>the workplace, where individuals with the power to assign&para;<br>daily tasks are often regarded by other employees as&para;<br>supervisors. See post, at 5, 8–12. But in reality it is the&para;<br>alternative that is out of touch. Particularly in modern&para;<br>organizations that have abandoned a highly hierarchical&para;<br>management structure, it is common for employees to&para;<br>have overlapping authority with respect to the assignment&para;<br>of work tasks. Members of a team may each have the&para;<br>responsibility for taking the lead with respect to a particu­&para;<br>lar aspect of the work and thus may have the responsibil­&para;<br>ity to direct each other in that area of responsibility.&para;<br>Finally, petitioner argues that tying supervisor status to&para;<br>the authority to take tangible employment actions will&para;<br>encourage employers to attempt to insulate themselves&para;<br>from liability for workplace harassment by empowering&para;<br>only a handful of individuals to take tangible employment&para;<br>actions. But a broad definition of “supervisor” is not nec­&para;<br>essary to guard against this concern.&para;<br>As an initial matter, an employer will always be liable&para;<br>when its negligence leads to the creation or continuation of&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a hostile work environment. And even if an employer&para;<br>concentrates all decisionmaking authority in a few indi­&para;<br>viduals, it likely will not isolate itself from heightened&para;<br>liability under Faragher and Ellerth. If an employer does&para;<br>attempt to confine decisionmaking power to a small num­&para;<br>ber of individuals, those individuals will have a limited&para;<br>ability to exercise independent discretion when making&para;<br>decisions and will likely rely on other workers who actually interact with the affected employee. Cf. Rhodes v.&para;<br>Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F. 3d 498, 509 (CA7 2004)&para;<br>(Rovner, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg­&para;<br>ment) (“Although they did not have the power to take&para;<br>formal employment actions vis-à-vis [the victim], [the&para;<br>harassers] necessarily must have had substantial input&para;<br>into those decisions, as they would have been the people&para;<br>most familiar with her work—certainly more familiar with&para;<br>it than the off-site Department Administrative Services&para;<br>Manager”). Under those circumstances, the employer may&para;<br>be held to have effectively delegated the power to take&para;<br>tangible employment actions to the employees on whose&para;<br>recommendations it relies. See Ellerth, 524 U.

However,&para;<br>the dissent does not mention why the plaintiffs would lose&para;<br>in those cases. It is not clear in any of those examples&para;<br>that the legal outcome hinges on the definition of “super­&para;<br>visor.” For example, Clara Whitten ultimately did not&para;<br>prevail on her discrimination claims—notwithstanding the&para;<br>fact that the Fourth Circuit adopted the approach advo­&para;<br>cated by the dissent, see Whitten v. Fred’s, Inc., 601 F. 3d&para;<br>231, 243–247 (2010)—because the District Court subse­&para;<br>quently dismissed her claims for lack of jurisdiction. See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

And although the&para;<br>dissent suggests that Donna Rhodes’ employer would have&para;<br>been liable under the dissent’s definition of “supervisor,”&para;<br>that is pure speculation: It is not clear that Rhodes suf­&para;<br>fered any tangible employment action, see Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 243 F. Supp. 2d 810, 817 (ND Ill.&para;<br>2003), and no court had occasion to determine whether&para;<br>the employer could have established the affirmative defense&para;<br>(a prospect that is certainly feasible given that there&para;<br>was evidence that the employer had an “adequate anti­&para;<br>harassment policy in place,” that the employer promptly&para;<br>addressed the incidents about which Rhodes complained,&para;<br>and that “Rhodes failed to take advantage of the preventa­&para;<br>tive or corrective opportunities provided,” Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F. 3d, at 507).15 Finally, the&para;<br>dissent’s reliance on Monika Starke’s case is perplexing&para;<br>given that the EEOC ultimately did obtain relief (in the&para;<br>amount of $50,000) for the harassment of Starke,16 see&para;<br>Order of Dismissal in No. 1:07–cv–0095–LRR (ND Iowa,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 Similarly, it is unclear whether Yasharay Mack ultimately would&para;<br>have prevailed even under the dissent’s definition of “supervisor.” The&para;<br>Second Circuit (adopting a definition similar to that advocated by the&para;<br>dissent) remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether&para;<br>Mack “ ‘unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or&para;<br>corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm&para;<br>otherwise.’ ” Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 127–128 (2003)&para;<br>(quoting Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765). But before it had an opportunity to&para;<br>make any such determination, Mack withdrew her complaint and the&para;<br>District Court dismissed her claims with prejudice.

Evidence that an&para;<br>employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond&para;<br>to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering&para;<br>complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from&para;<br>being filed would be relevant. Thus, it is not true, as the&para;<br>dissent asserts, that our holding “relieves scores of em­&para;<br>ployers of responsibility” for the behavior of workers they&para;<br>employ. Post, at 14.&para;<br>The standard we adopt is not untested. It has been the&para;<br>law for quite some time in the First, Seventh, and Eighth&para;<br>Circuits, see, e.g., Noviello v.

Title VII imposes no&para;<br>“general civility code.” Oncale, 523 U. S., at 81. It does&para;<br>not reach “the ordinary tribulations of the workplace,” for&para;<br>example, “sporadic use of abusive language” or generally&para;<br>boorish conduct. B. Lindemann &amp; D.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>In Faragher and Ellerth, this Court established a&para;<br>framework for determining when an employer may be held&para;<br>liable for its employees’ creation of a hostile work environment. Recognizing that Title VII’s definition of “employer” includes an employer’s “agent[s],” 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000e(b), the Court looked to agency law for guidance in&para;<br>formulating liability standards. Faragher, 524 U. S., at&para;<br>791, 801; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 755–760. In particular, the&para;<br>Court drew upon §219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Agency (1957), which makes an employer liable for the&para;<br>conduct of an employee, even when that employee acts&para;<br>beyond the scope of her employment, if the employee is&para;<br>“aided in accomplishing” a tort “by the existence of the&para;<br>agency relation.” See Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801; Ellerth,&para;<br>524 U. S., at 758.&para;<br>Stemming from that guide, Faragher and Ellerth distinguished between harassment perpetrated by supervisors,&para;<br>which is often enabled by the supervisor’s agency relationship with the employer, and harassment perpetrated by&para;<br>co-workers, which is not similarly facilitated. Faragher,&para;<br>524 U. S., at 801–803; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763–765. If&para;<br>the harassing employee is a supervisor, the Court held,&para;<br>the employer is vicariously liable whenever the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807–808; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764–&para;<br>765. The term “tangible employment action,” Ellerth&para;<br>observed, “constitutes a significant change in employment&para;<br>status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a&para;<br>decision causing a significant change in benefits.” Id., at&para;<br>761. Such an action, the Court explained, provides “assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the&para;<br>agency relation.” Id., at 761–762.&para;<br>An employer may also be held vicariously liable for a&para;<br>supervisor’s harassment that does not culminate in a&para;<br>tangible employment action, the Court next determined.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>In such a case, however, the employer may avoid liability&para;<br>by showing that (1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassing behavior, and (2)&para;<br>the complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of&para;<br>preventative or corrective measures made available to her.&para;<br>Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765. The&para;<br>employer bears the burden of establishing this affirmative&para;<br>defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Faragher,&para;<br>524 U. S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765.&para;<br>In contrast, if the harassing employee is a co-worker, a&para;<br>negligence standard applies. To satisfy that standard, the&para;<br>complainant must show that the employer knew or should&para;<br>have known of the offensive conduct but failed to take&para;<br>appropriate corrective action. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at&para;<br>799; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 758–759. See also 29 CFR&para;<br>§1604.11(d) (2012); EEOC Guidance 405:7652.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The distinction Faragher and Ellerth drew between&para;<br>supervisors and co-workers corresponds to the realities of&para;<br>the workplace. Exposed to a fellow employee’s harassment, one can walk away or tell the offender to “buzz off.”&para;<br>A supervisor’s slings and arrows, however, are not so&para;<br>easily avoided. An employee who confronts her harassing&para;<br>supervisor risks, for example, receiving an undesirable or&para;<br>unsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer. She&para;<br>may be saddled with an excessive workload or with placement on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family&para;<br>life. And she may be demoted or fired. Facing such&para;<br>dangers, she may be reluctant to blow the whistle on her&para;<br>superior, whose “power and authority invests his or her&para;<br>harassing conduct with a particular threatening character.” Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763. See also Faragher, 524&para;<br>U. S., at 803; Brief for Respondent 23 (“The potential&para;<br>threat to one’s livelihood or working conditions will make&para;<br>the victim think twice before resisting harassment or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>fighting back.”). In short, as Faragher and Ellerth recognized, harassment by supervisors is more likely to cause&para;<br>palpable harm and to persist unabated than similar conduct by fellow employees.&para;<br>II&para;<br>While Faragher and Ellerth differentiated harassment&para;<br>by supervisors from harassment by co-workers, neither&para;<br>decision gave a definitive answer to the question: Who&para;<br>qualifies as a supervisor? Two views have emerged. One&para;<br>view, in line with the EEOC’s Guidance, counts as a&para;<br>supervisor anyone with authority to take tangible employment actions or to direct an employee’s daily work activities. E.g., Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 127&para;<br>(CA2 2003); Whitten v. Fred’s, Inc., 601 F. 3d 231, 246&para;<br>(CA4 2010); EEOC Guidance 405:7654. The other view&para;<br>ranks as supervisors only those authorized to take tangible employment actions. E.g., Noviello v. Boston, 398&para;<br>F. 3d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); Parkins v. Civil Constructors of&para;<br>Ill., Inc., 163 F. 3d 1027, 1034 (CA7 1998); Joens v. John&para;<br>Morrell &amp; Co., 354 F. 3d 938, 940–941 (CA8 2004).&para;<br>Notably, respondent Ball State University agreed with&para;<br>petitioner Vance and the United States, as amicus curiae,&para;<br>that the tangible-employment-action-only test “does not&para;<br>necessarily capture all employees who may qualify as&para;<br>supervisors.” Brief for Respondent 1. “[V]icarious liability,” Ball State acknowledged, “also may be triggered&para;<br>when the harassing employee has the authority to control&para;<br>the victim’s daily work activities in a way that materially&para;<br>enables the harassment.” Id., at 1–2.&para;<br>The different view taken by the Court today is out of&para;<br>accord with the agency principles that, Faragher and&para;<br>Ellerth affirmed, govern Title VII. See supra, at 3–4. It is&para;<br>blind to the realities of the workplace, and it discounts the&para;<br>guidance of the EEOC, the agency Congress established to&para;<br>interpret, and superintend the enforcement of, Title VII.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Under that guidance, the appropriate question is: Has&para;<br>the employer given the alleged harasser authority to take&para;<br>tangible employment actions or to control the conditions&para;<br>under which subordinates do their daily work? If the&para;<br>answer to either inquiry is yes, vicarious liability is in&para;<br>order, for the superior-subordinate working arrangement&para;<br>facilitating the harassment is of the employer’s making.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Until today, our decisions have assumed that employees&para;<br>who direct subordinates’ daily work are supervisors. In&para;<br>Faragher, the city of Boca Raton, Florida, employed Bill&para;<br>Terry and David Silverman to oversee the city’s corps of&para;<br>ocean lifeguards. 524 U. S., at 780. Terry and Silverman&para;<br>“repeatedly subject[ed] Faragher and other female lifeguards to uninvited and offensive touching,” and they&para;<br>regularly “ma[de] lewd remarks, and [spoke] of women in&para;<br>offensive terms.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Terry told a job applicant that “female lifeguards had sex&para;<br>with their male counterparts,” and then “asked whether&para;<br>she would do the same.” Id., at 782. Silverman threatened to assign Faragher to toilet-cleaning duties for a year&para;<br>if she refused to date him. Id., at 780. In words and&para;<br>conduct, Silverman and Terry made the beach a hostile&para;<br>place for women to work.&para;<br>As Chief of Boca Raton’s Marine Safety Division, Terry&para;<br>had authority to “hire new lifeguards (subject to the approval of higher management), to supervise all aspects of&para;<br>the lifeguards’ work assignments, to engage in counseling,&para;<br>to deliver oral reprimands, and to make a record of any&para;<br>such discipline.” Id., at 781. Silverman’s duties as a&para;<br>Marine Safety lieutenant included “making the lifeguards’&para;<br>daily assignments, and . . . supervising their work and&para;<br>fitness training.” Ibid. Both men “were granted virtually&para;<br>unchecked authority over their subordinates, directly&para;<br>controlling and supervising all aspects of Faragher’s day-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to-day activities.” Id., at 808 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>and brackets omitted).&para;<br>We may assume that Terry would fall within the definition of supervisor the Court adopts today. See ante, at 9.1&para;<br>But nothing in the Faragher record shows that Silverman would. Silverman had oversight and assignment&para;<br>responsibilities—he could punish lifeguards who would not&para;<br>date him with full-time toilet-cleaning duty—but there&para;<br>was no evidence that he had authority to take tangible&para;<br>employment actions. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at 780–781.&para;<br>Holding that Boca Raton was vicariously liable for Silverman’s harassment, id., at 808–809, the Court characterized&para;<br>him as Faragher’s supervisor, see id., at 780, and there&para;<br>was no dissent on that point, see id., at 810 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>Subsequent decisions reinforced Faragher’s use of the&para;<br>term “supervisor” to encompass employees with authority&para;<br>to direct the daily work of their victims. In Pennsylvania&para;<br>State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 140 (2004), for example, the Court considered whether a constructive discharge occasioned by supervisor harassment ranks as a&para;<br>tangible employment action. The harassing employees&para;<br>lacked authority to discharge or demote the complainant,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 It is not altogether evident that Terry would qualify under the&para;<br>Court’s test. His authority to hire was subject to approval by higher&para;<br>management, Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 781 (1998), and&para;<br>there is scant indication that he possessed other powers on the Court’s&para;<br>list. The Court observes that Terry was able to “recommen[d],” and&para;<br>“initiat[e]” tangible employment actions. Ante, at 15, n. 8 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Nothing in the Faragher record, however,&para;<br>shows that Terry had authority to take such actions himself. Faragher’s complaint alleged that Terry said he would never promote a&para;<br>female lifeguard to the rank of lieutenant, 524 U. S., at 780, but that&para;<br>statement hardly suffices to establish that he had ultimate promotional&para;<br>authority. Had Boca Raton anticipated the position the Court today&para;<br>announces, the city might have urged classification of Terry as Faragher’s superior, but not her “supervisor.”&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>but they were “responsible for the day-to-day supervision” of the workplace and for overseeing employee shifts.&para;<br>Suders v. Easton, 325 F. 3d 432, 450, n. 11 (CA3 2003).&para;<br>Describing the harassing employees as the complainant’s&para;<br>“supervisors,” the Court proceeded to evaluate the complainant’s constructive discharge claim under the Ellerth&para;<br>and Faragher framework. Suders, 542 U. S., at 134, 140–&para;<br>141.&para;<br>It is true, as the Court says, ante, at 15–17, and n. 11,&para;<br>that Faragher and later cases did not squarely resolve&para;<br>whether an employee without power to take tangible employment actions may nonetheless qualify as a supervisor.&para;<br>But in laboring to establish that Silverman’s supervisor status, undisputed in Faragher, is not dispositive here,&para;<br>the Court misses the forest for the trees. Faragher illustrates an all-too-plain reality: A supervisor with authority&para;<br>to control subordinates’ daily work is no less aided in his&para;<br>harassment than is a supervisor with authority to fire,&para;<br>demote, or transfer. That Silverman could threaten Faragher with toilet-cleaning duties while Terry could orally&para;<br>reprimand her was inconsequential in Faragher, and&para;<br>properly so. What mattered was that both men took advantage of the power vested in them as agents of Boca&para;<br>Raton to facilitate their abuse. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at&para;<br>801 (Silverman and Terry “implicitly threaten[ed] to misuse their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or&para;<br>complaint.”). And when, assisted by an agency relationship, in-charge superiors like Silverman perpetuate a&para;<br>discriminatory work environment, our decisions have&para;<br>appropriately held the employer vicariously liable, subject&para;<br>to the above-described affirmative defense. See supra, at&para;<br>3–4.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Workplace realities fortify my conclusion that harassment by an employee with power to direct subordinates’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>day-to-day work activities should trigger vicarious employer liability. The following illustrations, none of them&para;<br>hypothetical, involve in-charge employees of the kind the&para;<br>Court today excludes from supervisory status.2&para;<br>Yasharay Mack: Yasharay Mack, an African-American&para;<br>woman, worked for the Otis Elevator Company as an&para;<br>elevator mechanic’s helper at the Metropolitan Life Building in New York City. James Connolly, the “mechanic in&para;<br>charge” and the senior employee at the site, targeted Mack&para;<br>for abuse. He commented frequently on her “fantastic&para;<br>ass,” “luscious lips,” and “beautiful eyes,” and, using deplorable racial epithets, opined that minorities and women&para;<br>did not “belong in the business.” Once, he pulled her on&para;<br>his lap, touched her buttocks, and tried to kiss her while&para;<br>others looked on. Connolly lacked authority to take tangible employment actions against mechanic’s helpers, but he&para;<br>did assign their work, control their schedules, and direct&para;<br>the particulars of their workdays. When he became angry&para;<br>with Mack, for example, he denied her overtime hours.&para;<br>And when she complained about the mistreatment, he&para;<br>scoffed, “I get away with everything.” See Mack, 326&para;<br>F. 3d, at 120–121, 125–126 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Donna Rhodes: Donna Rhodes, a seasonal highway&para;<br>maintainer for the Illinois Department of Transportation,&para;<br>was responsible for plowing snow during winter months.&para;<br>Michael Poladian was a “Lead Lead Worker” and Matt&para;<br>Mara, a “Technician” at the maintenance yard where&para;<br>Rhodes worked. Both men assembled plow crews and&para;<br>managed the work assignments of employees in Rhodes’s&para;<br>position, but neither had authority to hire, fire, promote,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>illustrative cases reached the appellate level after grants of&para;<br>summary judgment in favor of the employer. Like the Courts of Appeals in each case, I recount the facts in the light most favorable to the&para;<br>employee, the nonmoving party.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>demote, transfer, or discipline employees. In her third&para;<br>season working at the yard, Rhodes was verbally assaulted&para;<br>with sex-based invectives and a pornographic image was&para;<br>taped to her locker. Poladian forced her to wash her&para;<br>truck in sub-zero temperatures, assigned her undesirable&para;<br>yard work instead of road crew work, and prohibited&para;<br>another employee from fixing the malfunctioning heating&para;<br>system in her truck. Conceding that Rhodes had been&para;<br>subjected to a sex-based hostile work environment, the&para;<br>Department of Transportation argued successfully in the&para;<br>District Court and Court of Appeals that Poladian and&para;<br>Mara were not Rhodes’s supervisors because they lacked&para;<br>authority to take tangible employment actions against&para;<br>her. See Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F. 3d 498,&para;<br>501–503, 506–507 (CA7 2004).&para;<br>Clara Whitten: Clara Whitten worked at a discount&para;<br>retail store in Belton, South Carolina. On Whitten’s first&para;<br>day of work, the manager, Matt Green, told her to “give&para;<br>[him] what [he] want[ed]” in order to obtain approval for&para;<br>long weekends off from work. Later, fearing what might&para;<br>transpire, Whitten ignored Green’s order to join him in an&para;<br>isolated storeroom. Angered, Green instructed Whitten to&para;<br>stay late and clean the store. He demanded that she work&para;<br>over the weekend despite her scheduled day off. Dismissing her as “dumb and stupid,” Green threatened to make&para;<br>her life a “living hell.” Green lacked authority to fire,&para;<br>promote, demote, or otherwise make decisions affecting&para;<br>Whitten’s pocketbook. But he directed her activities, gave&para;<br>her tasks to accomplish, burdened her with undesirable&para;<br>work assignments, and controlled her schedule. He was&para;<br>usually the highest ranking employee in the store, and&para;<br>both Whitten and Green considered him the supervisor.&para;<br>See Whitten, 601 F. 3d, at 236, 244–247 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Monika Starke: CRST Van Expedited, Inc., an interstate&para;<br>transit company, ran a training program for newly hired&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>truckdrivers requiring a 28-day on-the-road trip. Monika&para;<br>Starke participated in the program. Trainees like Starke&para;<br>were paired in a truck cabin with a single “lead driver”&para;<br>who lacked authority to hire, fire, promote, or demote, but&para;<br>who exercised control over the work environment for the&para;<br>duration of the trip. Lead drivers were responsible for&para;<br>providing instruction on CRST’s driving method, assigning&para;<br>specific tasks, and scheduling rest stops. At the end of the&para;<br>trip, lead drivers evaluated trainees’ performance with a&para;<br>nonbinding pass or fail recommendation that could lead to&para;<br>full driver status. Over the course of Starke’s training&para;<br>trip, her first lead driver, Bob Smith, filled the cabin with&para;<br>vulgar sexual remarks, commenting on her breast size and&para;<br>comparing the gear stick to genitalia. A second lead driver,&para;<br>David Goodman, later forced her into unwanted sex with&para;<br>him, an outrage to which she submitted, believing it&para;<br>necessary to gain a passing grade. See EEOC v. CRST&para;<br>Van Expedited, Inc., 679 F. 3d 657, 665–666, 684–685&para;<br>(CA8 2012).&para;<br>In each of these cases, a person vested with authority to&para;<br>control the conditions of a subordinate’s daily work life&para;<br>used his position to aid his harassment. But in none of&para;<br>them would the Court’s severely confined definition of supervisor yield vicarious liability for the employer. The&para;<br>senior elevator mechanic in charge, the Court today tells&para;<br>us, was Mack’s co-worker, not her supervisor. So was the&para;<br>store manager who punished Whitten with long hours for&para;<br>refusing to give him what he wanted. So were the lead&para;<br>drivers who controlled all aspects of Starke’s working&para;<br>environment, and the yard worker who kept other employees from helping Rhodes to control the heat in her truck.&para;<br>As anyone with work experience would immediately&para;<br>grasp, James Connolly, Michael Poladian, Matt Mara,&para;<br>Matt Green, Bob Smith, and David Goodman wielded&para;<br>employer-conferred supervisory authority over their victims. Each man’s discriminatory harassment derived&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>force from, and was facilitated by, the control reins he&para;<br>held. Cf. Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S.&para;<br>53, 70–71 (2006) (“Common sense suggests that one good&para;<br>way to discourage an employee . . . from bringing discrimination charges would be to insist that she spend more&para;<br>time performing the more arduous duties and less time&para;<br>performing those that are easier or more agreeable.”).&para;<br>Under any fair reading of Title VII, in each of the illustrative cases, the superior employee should have been classified a supervisor whose conduct would trigger vicarious&para;<br>liability.3&para;<br>C&para;<br>Within a year after the Court’s decisions in Faragher&para;<br>and Ellerth, the EEOC defined “supervisor” to include any&para;<br>employee with “authority to undertake or recommend&para;<br>tangible employment decisions,” or with “authority to direct [another] employee’s daily work activities.” EEOC&para;<br>Guidance 405:7654. That definition should garner “respect proportional to its ‘power to persuade.’ ” United&para;<br>States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 235 (2001) (quoting&para;<br>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.

See ante, at 26–28,&para;<br>and nn. 15–16. Even under a vicarious liability rule, the Court points&para;<br>out, employers might escape liability for reasons other than the harasser’s status as supervisor. For example, Rhodes might have avoided&para;<br>summary judgment in favor of her employer; even so, it would have&para;<br>been open to the employer to raise and prove to a jury the Faragher/&para;<br>Ellerth affirmative defense, see supra, at 3–4. No doubt other barriers also might impede an employee from prevailing, for example,&para;<br>Whitten’s and Starke’s intervening bankruptcies, see Whitten v. Fred’s&para;<br>Inc., No. 8:08–0218–HMH–BHH, 2010 WL 2757005 (D. SC, July 12,&para;<br>2010); EEOC v.

An employer is vicariously liable only when the&para;<br>authority it has delegated enables actionable harassment,&para;<br>the EEOC recognized. EEOC Guidance 405:7654. For&para;<br>that reason, a supervisor’s authority must be “of a sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser . . . in carrying out the harassment.” Ibid.

Thus, an employee with authority to increase&para;<br>another’s workload or assign undesirable tasks may rank&para;<br>as a supervisor, for those powers can enable harassment.&para;<br>Id., at 405:7654. On the other hand, an employee “who&para;<br>directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Respondent’s&para;<br>&para;<br>amici maintain that the EEOC Guidance is ineligible&para;<br>for deference under Skidmore v.

See Brief for&para;<br>Society for Human Resource Management et al. 11–16. They are&para;<br>mistaken. The EEOC Guidance rests on the employer liability framework set forth in Faragher and Ellerth, but both the framework and&para;<br>EEOC Guidance construe the term “agent” in 42 U. S.

BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ordinarily would not qualify as a supervisor, for her harassing conduct is not likely to be aided materially by the&para;<br>agency relationship. Id., at 405:7655.&para;<br>In my view, the EEOC’s definition, which the Court puts&para;<br>down as “a study in ambiguity,” ante, at 21, has the ring of&para;<br>truth and, therefore, powerfully persuasive force. As a&para;<br>precondition to vicarious employer liability, the EEOC&para;<br>explained, the harassing supervisor must wield authority&para;<br>of sufficient magnitude to enable the harassment. In&para;<br>other words, the aided-in-accomplishment standard requires “something more than the employment relation&para;<br>itself.” Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. Furthermore, as the&para;<br>EEOC perceived, in assessing an employee’s qualification&para;<br>as a supervisor, context is often key. See infra, at 16–17.&para;<br>I would accord the agency’s judgment due respect.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Exhibiting remarkable resistance to the thrust of our&para;<br>prior decisions, workplace realities, and the EEOC’s Guidance, the Court embraces a position that relieves scores of&para;<br>employers of responsibility for the behavior of the supervisors they employ. Trumpeting the virtues of simplicity&para;<br>and administrability, the Court restricts supervisor status&para;<br>to those with power to take tangible employment actions.&para;<br>In so restricting the definition of supervisor, the Court&para;<br>once again shuts from sight the “robust protection against&para;<br>workplace discrimination Congress intended Title VII to&para;<br>secure.” Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 550&para;<br>U. S. 618, 660 (2007) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court purports to rely on the Ellerth and Faragher&para;<br>framework to limit supervisor status to those capable of&para;<br>taking tangible employment actions. Ante, at 10, 18. That&para;<br>framework, we are told, presupposes “a sharp line between&para;<br>co-workers and supervisors.” Ante, at 18. The definition&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of supervisor decreed today, the Court insists, is “clear,”&para;<br>“readily applied,” and “easily workable,” ante, at 10, 20,&para;<br>when compared to the EEOC’s vague standard, ante, at&para;<br>22.&para;<br>There is reason to doubt just how “clear” and “workable”&para;<br>the Court’s definition is. A supervisor, the Court holds, is&para;<br>someone empowered to “take tangible employment actions&para;<br>against the victim, i.e., to effect a ‘significant change&para;<br>in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to&para;<br>promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 761).&para;<br>Whether reassignment authority makes someone a supervisor might depend on whether the reassignment carries&para;<br>economic consequences. Ante, at 16, n. 9. The power to&para;<br>discipline other employees, when the discipline has economic consequences, might count, too. Ibid. So might the&para;<br>power to initiate or make recommendations about tangible&para;<br>employment actions. Ante, at 15, n. 8. And when an&para;<br>employer “concentrates all decisionmaking authority in a&para;<br>few individuals” who rely on information from “other&para;<br>workers who actually interact with the affected employee,”&para;<br>the other workers may rank as supervisors (or maybe not;&para;<br>the Court does not commit one way or the other). Ante,&para;<br>at 26.&para;<br>Someone in search of a bright line might well ask, what&para;<br>counts as “significantly different responsibilities”? Can&para;<br>any economic consequence make a reassignment or&para;<br>disciplinary action “significant,” or is there a minimum&para;<br>threshold? How concentrated must the decisionmaking&para;<br>authority be to deem those not formally endowed with that&para;<br>authority nevertheless “supervisors”? The Court leaves&para;<br>these questions unanswered, and its liberal use of&para;<br>“mights” and “mays,” ante, at 15, n. 8, 16, n. 9, 26, dims&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the light it casts.5&para;<br>That the Court has adopted a standard, rather than a&para;<br>clear rule, is not surprising, for no crisp definition of supervisor could supply the unwavering line the Court desires. Supervisors, like the workplaces they manage, come&para;<br>in all shapes and sizes. Whether a pitching coach supervises his pitchers (can he demote them?), or an artistic&para;<br>director supervises her opera star (can she impose significantly different responsibilities?), or a law firm associate&para;<br>supervises the firm’s paralegals (can she fire them?) are&para;<br>matters not susceptible to mechanical rules and on-off&para;<br>switches. One cannot know whether an employer has&para;<br>vested supervisory authority in an employee, and whether&para;<br>harassment is aided by that authority, without looking to&para;<br>the particular working relationship between the harasser&para;<br>and the victim. That is why Faragher and Ellerth crafted&para;<br>an employer liability standard embracive of all whose&para;<br>authority significantly aids in the creation and perpetuation of harassment.&para;<br>The Court’s focus on finding a definition of supervisor&para;<br>capable of instant application is at odds with the Court’s&para;<br>ordinary emphasis on the importance of particular circumstances in Title VII cases. See, e.g., Burlington Northern,&para;<br>548 U. S., at 69 (“[T]he significance of any given act of&para;<br>retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.”); Harris, 510 U. S., at 23 (“[W]hether an environment is ‘hostile’ or ‘abusive’ can be determined only by&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Even the Seventh Circuit, whose definition of supervisor the Court&para;<br>adopts in large measure, has candidly acknowledged that, under its&para;<br>definition, supervisor status is not a clear and certain thing. See Doe v.&para;<br>Oberweis Dairy, 456 F. 3d 704, 717 (2006) (“The difficulty of classification in this case arises from the fact that Nayman, the shift supervisor,&para;<br>was in between the paradigmatic classes [of supervisor and co-worker].&para;<br>He had supervisory responsibility in the sense of authority to direct the&para;<br>work of the [ice-cream] scoopers, and he was even authorized to issue&para;<br>disciplinary write-ups, but he had no authority to fire them. He was&para;<br>either an elevated coworker or a diminished supervisor.”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

S., at 81–82. The EEOC’s&para;<br>Guidance so perceives.&para;<br>B&para;<br>As a consequence of the Court’s truncated conception of&para;<br>supervisory authority, the Faragher and Ellerth framework has shifted in a decidedly employer-friendly direction. This realignment will leave many harassment&para;<br>victims without an effective remedy and undermine Title&para;<br>VII’s capacity to prevent workplace harassment.&para;<br>The negligence standard allowed by the Court, see ante,&para;<br>at 24, scarcely affords the protection the Faragher and&para;<br>Ellerth framework gave victims harassed by those in&para;<br>control of their lives at work. Recall that an employer is&para;<br>negligent with regard to harassment only if it knew or&para;<br>should have known of the conduct but failed to take appropriate corrective action. See 29 CFR §1604.11(d);&para;<br>EEOC Guidance 405:7652 to 405:7653. It is not uncommon for employers to lack actual or constructive notice of a&para;<br>harassing employee’s conduct. See Lindemann &amp; Grossman 1378–1379. An employee may have a reputation as a&para;<br>harasser among those in his vicinity, but if no complaint&para;<br>makes its way up to management, the employer will escape liability under a negligence standard. Id., at 1378.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The Court worries that the EEOC’s definition of supervisor will&para;<br>confound jurors who must first determine whether the harasser is a&para;<br>supervisor and second apply the correct employer liability standard.&para;<br>Ante, at 22–24, and nn. 13, 14. But the Court can point to no evidence&para;<br>that jury instructions on supervisor status in jurisdictions following the&para;<br>EEOC Guidance have in fact proved unworkable or confusing to jurors.&para;<br>Moreover, under the Court’s definition of supervisor, jurors in many&para;<br>cases will be obliged to determine, as a threshold question, whether the&para;<br>alleged harasser possessed supervisory authority. See supra, at 15–16.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Faragher is illustrative. After enduring unrelenting&para;<br>harassment, Faragher reported Terry’s and Silverman’s&para;<br>conduct informally to Robert Gordon, another immediate&para;<br>supervisor. 524 U. S., at 782–783. But the lifeguards&para;<br>were “completely isolated from the City’s higher management,” and it did not occur to Faragher to pursue the&para;<br>matter with higher ranking city officials distant from the&para;<br>beach. Id., at 783, 808 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Applying a negligence standard, the Eleventh Circuit held&para;<br>that, despite the pervasiveness of the harassment, and&para;<br>despite Gordon’s awareness of it, Boca Raton lacked constructive notice and therefore escaped liability. Id., at&para;<br>784–785. Under the vicarious liability standard, however,&para;<br>Boca Raton could not make out the affirmative defense, for&para;<br>it had failed to disseminate a policy against sexual harassment. Id., at 808–809.&para;<br>On top of the substantive differences in the negligence&para;<br>and vicarious liability standards, harassment victims,&para;<br>under today’s decision, are saddled with the burden of&para;<br>proving the employer’s negligence whenever the harasser&para;<br>lacks the power to take tangible employment actions.&para;<br>Faragher and Ellerth, by contrast, placed the burden&para;<br>squarely on the employer to make out the affirmative&para;<br>defense. See Suders, 542 U. S., at 146 (citing Ellerth, 524&para;<br>U. S., at 765; Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807). This allocation&para;<br>of the burden was both sensible and deliberate: An employer has superior access to evidence bearing on whether&para;<br>it acted reasonably to prevent or correct harassing behavior, and superior resources to marshal that evidence. See&para;<br>542 U. S., at 146, n. 7 (“The employer is in the best position to know what remedial procedures it offers to employees and how those procedures operate.”).&para;<br>Faced with a steeper substantive and procedural hill to&para;<br>climb, victims like Yasharay Mack, Donna Rhodes, Clara&para;<br>Whitten, and Monika Starke likely will find it impossible&para;<br>to obtain redress. We can expect that, as a consequence of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>restricting the supervisor category to those formally empowered to take tangible employment actions, victims of&para;<br>workplace harassment with meritorious Title VII claims&para;<br>will find suit a hazardous endeavor.7&para;<br>Inevitably, the Court’s definition of supervisor will&para;<br>hinder efforts to stamp out discrimination in the workplace. Because supervisors are comparatively few, and&para;<br>employees are many, “the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by&para;<br>common workers,” and a greater incentive to “screen&para;<br>[supervisors], train them, and monitor their performance.”&para;<br>Faragher, 524 U. S., at 803. Vicarious liability for employers serves this end. When employers know they will&para;<br>be answerable for the injuries a harassing jobsite boss&para;<br>inflicts, their incentive to provide preventative instruction&para;<br>is heightened. If vicarious liability is confined to supervisors formally empowered to take tangible employment&para;<br>actions, however, employers will have a diminished incentive to train those who control their subordinates’ work&para;<br>activities and schedules, i.e., the supervisors who “actually&para;<br>interact” with employees. Ante, at 26.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>I turn now to the case before us. Maetta Vance worked&para;<br>as substitute server and part-time catering assistant for&para;<br>Ball State University’s Banquet and Catering Division.&para;<br>During the period in question, she alleged, Saundra Davis,&para;<br>a catering specialist, and other Ball State employees&para;<br>subjected her to a racially hostile work environment.&para;<br>Applying controlling Circuit precedent, the District Court&para;<br>and Seventh Circuit concluded that Davis was not Vance’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Nor is the Court’s confinement of supervisor status needed to deter&para;<br>insubstantial claims. Under the EEOC Guidance, a plaintiff must meet&para;<br>the threshold requirement of actionable harassment and then show&para;<br>that her supervisor’s authority was of “sufficient magnitude” to assist&para;<br>in the harassment. See EEOC Guidance 405:7652, 405:7654.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>supervisor, and reviewed Ball State’s liability for her&para;<br>conduct under a negligence standard. 646 F. 3d 461, 470–&para;<br>471 (2011); App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–55a, 59a–60a. Because&para;<br>I would hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in restricting supervisor status to employees formally empowered&para;<br>to take tangible employment actions, I would remand&para;<br>for application of the proper standard to Vance’s claim.&para;<br>On this record, however, there is cause to anticipate that&para;<br>Davis would not qualify as Vance’s supervisor.8&para;<br>Supervisor status is based on “job function rather than&para;<br>job title,” and depends on “specific facts” about the working relationship. EEOC Guidance 405:7654. See supra, at&para;<br>13. Vance has adduced scant evidence that Davis controlled the conditions of her daily work. Vance stated in&para;<br>an affidavit that the general manager of the Catering&para;<br>Division, Bill Kimes, was charged with “overall supervision in the kitchen,” including “reassign[ing] people to&para;<br>perform different tasks,” and “control[ling] the schedule.”&para;<br>App. 431. The chef, Shannon Fultz, assigned tasks by&para;<br>preparing “prep lists” of daily duties. Id., at 277–279, 427.&para;<br>There is no allegation that Davis had a hand in creating&para;<br>these prep lists, nor is there any indication that, in fact,&para;<br>Davis otherwise controlled the particulars of Vance’s&para;<br>workday. Vance herself testified that she did not know&para;<br>whether Davis was her supervisor. Id., at 198.&para;<br>True, Davis’ job description listed among her responsibilities “[l]ead[ing] and direct[ing] kitchen part-time,&para;<br>substitute, and student employee helpers via demonstra——————&para;<br>8 In&para;<br>&para;<br>addition to concluding that Davis was not Vance’s supervisor, the&para;<br>District Court held that the conduct Vance alleged was “neither sufficiently severe nor pervasive to be considered objectively hostile for the&para;<br>purposes of Title VII.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. The Seventh Circuit&para;<br>declined to address this issue. See 646 F. 3d 461, 471 (2011). If the&para;<br>case were remanded, the Court of Appeals could resolve the hostile&para;<br>environment issue first, and then, if necessary, Davis’ status as supervisor or co-worker.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion, coaching, and overseeing their work.” Id., at 13. And&para;<br>another employee testified to believing that Davis was “a&para;<br>supervisor.” Id., at 386. But because the supervisorstatus inquiry should focus on substance, not labels or&para;<br>paper descriptions, it is doubtful that this slim evidence&para;<br>would enable Vance to survive a motion for summary&para;<br>judgment. Nevertheless, I would leave it to the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit to decide, under the proper standard for supervisory status, what impact, if any, Davis’ job description&para;<br>and the co-worker’s statement should have on the determination of Davis’ status.9&para;<br>V&para;<br>Regrettably, the Court has seized upon Vance’s thin&para;<br>case to narrow the definition of supervisor, and thereby&para;<br>manifestly limit Title VII’s protections against workplace&para;<br>harassment. Not even Ball State, the defendant-employer&para;<br>in this case, has advanced the restrictive definition the&para;<br>Court adopts. See supra, at 5. Yet the Court, insistent on&para;<br>constructing artificial categories where context should be&para;<br>key, proceeds on an immoderate and unrestrained course&para;<br>to corral Title VII.&para;<br>Congress has, in the recent past, intervened to correct&para;<br>this Court’s wayward interpretations of Title VII. See&para;<br>Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 123 Stat. 5, superseding Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 550 U. S.&para;<br>618 (2007).
