LETT&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–338.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 29, 2010—Decided May 3, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>From jury selection to jury instructions in a Michigan court, respondent&para;<br>Lett’s first trial for, inter alia, first-degree murder took less than nine&para;<br>hours. During approximately four hours of deliberations, the jury&para;<br>sent the trial court seven notes, including one asking what would&para;<br>happen if the jury could not agree. The judge called the jury and the&para;<br>attorneys into the courtroom and questioned the foreperson, who said&para;<br>that the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The judge&para;<br>then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new&para;<br>trial. At Lett’s second trial, after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15&para;<br>minutes, a new jury found him guilty of second-degree murder. On&para;<br>appeal, Lett argued that because the judge in his first trial had an&para;<br>nounced a mistrial without any manifest necessity to do so, the Dou&para;<br>ble Jeopardy Clause barred the State from trying him a second time.&para;<br>Agreeing, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.&para;<br>The Michigan Supreme Court reversed. It concluded that, under&para;<br>United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, a defendant may be retried&para;<br>following the discharge of a deadlocked jury so long as the trial court&para;<br>exercised its “sound discretion” in concluding that the jury was dead&para;<br>locked and thus that there was a “manifest necessity” for a mistrial;&para;<br>and that, under Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 506–510, an&para;<br>appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge’s determination&para;<br>that a deadlock has been reached. It then found that the judge at&para;<br>Lett’s first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mis&para;<br>trial, observing that the jury had deliberated a sufficient amount of&para;<br>time following a short, noncomplex trial; that the jury had sent sev&para;<br>eral notes, including one appearing to indicate heated discussions;&para;<br>and that the foreperson had stated that the jury could not reach a&para;<br>verdict. In Lett’s federal habeas petition, he contended that the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court’s rejection of his double jeopardy claim was&para;<br>“an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law,&para;<br>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), and thus that he was not barred by the Antiter&para;<br>rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) from ob&para;<br>taining federal habeas relief. The District Court granted the writ,&para;<br>and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Because the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision in this case was&para;<br>not unreasonable under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting&para;<br>Lett habeas relief. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(a) The question under AEDPA is whether the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court’s determination was “an unreasonable application of . . . clearly&para;<br>established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1), not whether it was an incorrect&para;<br>application of that law, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410.&para;<br>AEDPA imposes a “highly deferential standard for evaluating state&para;<br>court rulings,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7, and “de&para;<br>mands that [they] be given the benefit of the doubt,” Woodford v. Vis&para;<br>ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (per curiam). Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) Here, the “clearly established Federal law” is largely undis&para;<br>puted. When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury&para;<br>cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a&para;<br>new trial for the defendant before a new jury, Perez, 9 Wheat., at&para;<br>579–580. Trial judges may declare a mistrial when, “in their opinion,&para;<br>taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest&para;<br>necessity” for doing so, id., at 580, i.e., a “high degree” of necessity,&para;<br>Washington, supra, at 506. The decision whether to grant a mistrial&para;<br>is reserved to the “broad discretion” of the trial judge, Illinois v.&para;<br>Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462, and the discretion “to declare a mis&para;<br>trial [for a deadlocked jury] is . . . accorded great deference by a re&para;<br>viewing court,” Washington, supra, at 510, although this deference is&para;<br>not absolute. This Court has expressly declined to require the “me&para;<br>chanical application” of any “rigid formula,” Wade v. Hunter, 336&para;<br>U. S. 684, 690–691, when a trial judge decides to declare a mistrial&para;<br>due to jury deadlock, and it has explicitly held that the judge is not&para;<br>required to make explicit findings of “manifest necessity” or “articu&para;<br>late on the record all the factors” informing his discretion, Washing&para;<br>ton, supra, at 517. The Court has never required a judge in these cir&para;<br>cumstances to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of&para;<br>time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with counsel, to&para;<br>issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means&para;<br>of breaking the impasse. Moreover, the legal standard applied by the&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court is a general one—whether there was an&para;<br>abuse of the “broad discretion” reserved to the trial judge, Somerville,&para;<br>supra, at 462. Because AEDPA authorizes a federal court to grant&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>relief only when a state court’s application of federal law was unrea&para;<br>sonable, it follows that “[t]he more general the rule” at issue—and&para;<br>thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among fair&para;<br>minded judges—“the more leeway [state] courts have in reaching out&para;<br>comes in case-by-case determinations.” Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541&para;<br>U. S. 652, 664. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(c) The Michigan Supreme Court’s adjudication involved a straight&para;<br>forward application of this Court’s longstanding precedents to the&para;<br>facts of Lett’s case. The state court cited this Court’s double jeopardy&para;<br>cases—from Perez to Washington—applying those precedents to the&para;<br>particular facts before it and finding no abuse of discretion in light of&para;<br>the length of deliberations following a short, uncomplicated trial, the&para;<br>jury’s notes to the judge, and the fact that the foreperson stated that&para;<br>the jury could not reach a verdict. It was thus reasonable for the&para;<br>court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion&para;<br>in declaring a mistrial. The Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise be&para;<br>cause it disagreed with the inferences that the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court had drawn from the facts. The Circuit Court’s interpretation is&para;<br>not implausible, but other reasonable interpretations of the record&para;<br>are also possible. It was not objectively unreasonable for the Michi&para;<br>gan Supreme Court to conclude that the trial judge’s exercise of dis&para;<br>cretion was sound, both in light of what happened at trial and the&para;<br>fact that the relevant legal standard is a general one, to which there&para;<br>is no “plainly correct or incorrect” answer in this case. Yarborough,&para;<br>supra, at 664. The Sixth Circuit failed to grant the Michigan courts&para;<br>the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA and this Court’s dou&para;<br>ble jeopardy precedents. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(d) The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on its own Fulton v.&para;<br>Moore decision for the proposition that Arizona v. Washington sets&para;<br>forth three specific factors that determine whether a judge has exer&para;<br>cised sound discretion. Because Fulton does not constitute “clearly&para;<br>established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,”&para;<br>§2254(d)(1), failure to apply it does not independently authorize ha&para;<br>beas relief under AEDPA. Nor can Fulton be understood merely to il&para;<br>luminate this Court’s decision in Washington, as Washington did not&para;<br>set forth any such test to determine whether a trial judge has exer&para;<br>cised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(e) The Court does not deny that the trial judge in this case could&para;<br>have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial. Nonetheless,&para;<br>the steps that the Sixth Circuit thought she should have taken were&para;<br>not required—either under this Court’s double jeopardy precedents&para;<br>or, by extension, under AEDPA.

S. C. §2254(d). The District Court in this case issued&para;<br>the writ to respondent Reginald Lett on the ground that&para;<br>his Michigan murder conviction violated the Double Jeop&para;<br>ardy Clause of the Constitution, and the U. S. Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. In doing so, how&para;<br>ever, these courts misapplied AEDPA’s deferential stan&para;<br>dard of review. Because we conclude that the Michigan&para;<br>Supreme Court’s application of federal law was not unrea&para;<br>sonable, we reverse.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On August 29, 1996, an argument broke out in a Detroit&para;<br>liquor store. The antagonists included Adesoji Latona, a&para;<br>taxi driver; Charles Jones, a passenger who claimed he&para;<br>had been wrongfully ejected from Latona’s cab; and&para;<br>Reginald Lett, a friend of Jones’s. After the argument&para;<br>began, Lett left the liquor store, retrieved a handgun from&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>another friend outside in the parking lot, and returned to&para;<br>the store. He shot Latona twice, once in the head and once&para;<br>in the chest. Latona died from his wounds shortly thereaf&para;<br>ter. See People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 208–209, 644 N. W.&para;<br>2d 743, 745 (2002).&para;<br>Michigan prosecutors charged Lett with first-degree&para;<br>murder and possession of a firearm during the commission&para;<br>of a felony. His trial took place in June 1997. From jury&para;<br>selection to jury instructions the trial took less than nine&para;<br>hours, spread over six different days. Id., at 209, 644&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 745.&para;<br>The jury’s deliberations began on June 12, 1997, at 3:24&para;<br>p.m., and ran that day until 4 p.m. Id., at 209, n. 1, 644&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 1. After resuming its work the next&para;<br>morning, the jury sent the trial court a note—one of seven&para;<br>it sent out in its two days of deliberations—stating that&para;<br>the jurors had “ ‘a concern about our voice levels disturb&para;<br>ing any other proceedings that might be going on.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>209, n. 2, 644 N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 2. Later, the jury sent&para;<br>out another note, asking “ ‘What if we can’t agree?&para;<br>[M]istrial? [R]etrial? [W]hat?’ ” Id., at 209, 644 N. W. 2d,&para;<br>at 745.&para;<br>The trial transcript does not reveal whether the judge&para;<br>discussed the jury’s query with counsel, off the record,&para;<br>upon receiving this last communication. Id., at 209, n. 3,&para;<br>644 N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 3. What is clear is that at 12:45&para;<br>p.m. the judge called the jury back into the courtroom,&para;<br>along with the prosecutor and defense counsel. Once the&para;<br>jury was seated, the following exchange took place:&para;<br>“THE COURT: I received your note asking me what&para;<br>if you can’t agree? And I have to conclude from that&para;<br>that that is your situation at this time. So, I’d like to&para;<br>ask the foreperson to identify themselves, please?&para;<br>“THE FOREPERSON: [Identified herself.] &para;<br>&para;<br>“THE COURT: Okay, thank you. All right.

Are you going to reach a unani&para;<br>mous verdict, or not?&para;<br>“THE FOREPERSON: (No response)&para;<br>“THE COURT: Yes or no?&para;<br>“THE FOREPERSON: No, Judge.” Tr. in No. 96–&para;<br>08252 (Recorder’s Court, Detroit, Mich.), pp. 319–320.&para;<br>The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury,&para;<br>and scheduled a new trial for later that year. Neither the&para;<br>prosecutor nor Lett’s attorney made any objection.&para;<br>Lett’s second trial was held before a different judge and&para;<br>jury in November 1997. This time, the jury was able to&para;<br>reach a unanimous verdict—that Lett was guilty of sec&para;<br>ond-degree murder—after deliberating for only 3 hours&para;<br>and 15 minutes. Lett, supra, at 210, and n. 4, 644 N. W.&para;<br>2d, at 746, and n. 4.&para;<br>Lett appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of&para;<br>Appeals. He argued that the judge in his first trial had&para;<br>announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for&para;<br>doing so. Because the mistrial was an error, Lett main&para;<br>tained, the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy&para;<br>Clause of the U. S. Constitution from trying him a second&para;<br>time. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with Lett&para;<br>and reversed his conviction.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The State appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court,&para;<br>which reversed the Court of Appeals. The court explained&para;<br>that under our decision in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat.&para;<br>579 (1824), a defendant may be retried following the dis&para;<br>charge of a deadlocked jury, even if the discharge occurs&para;<br>without the defendant’s consent. Lett, 466 Mich., at 216–&para;<br>217, 644 N. W. 2d, at 749. There is no Double Jeopardy&para;<br>Clause violation in such circumstances, it noted, so long as&para;<br>the trial court exercised its “ ‘sound discretion’ ” in conclud&para;<br>ing that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was&para;<br>a “ ‘manifest necessity’ ” for a mistrial. Ibid. (quoting&para;<br>Perez, supra, at 580; emphasis deleted). The court further&para;<br>observed that, under our decision in Arizona v. Washing&para;<br>ton, 434 U. S. 497, 506–510 (1978), an appellate court&para;<br>must generally defer to a trial judge’s determination that&para;<br>a deadlock has been reached. 466 Mich., at 218–222, 644&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 750–752.&para;<br>After setting forth the applicable law, the Michigan&para;<br>Supreme Court determined that the judge at Lett’s first&para;<br>trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mis&para;<br>trial. Id., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. The court cited the&para;<br>facts that the jury “had deliberated for at least four hours&para;<br>following a relatively short, and far from complex, trial,”&para;<br>that the jury had sent out several notes, “including one&para;<br>that appears to indicate that its discussions may have&para;<br>been particularly heated,” and—“[m]ost important”—“that&para;<br>the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not&para;<br>going to reach a verdict.” Ibid.&para;<br>Lett petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus.&para;<br>Again he argued that the trial court’s declaration of a&para;<br>mistrial constituted an abuse of discretion because there&para;<br>was no manifest necessity to cut short the jury’s delibera&para;<br>tions. He further contended that the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court’s rejection of his double jeopardy claim amounted to&para;<br>“an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established&para;<br>Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>United States,” and thus that he was not barred by&para;<br>AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), from obtaining federal&para;<br>habeas relief. The District Court agreed and granted the&para;<br>writ. 507 F. Supp. 2d 777 (ED Mich. 2007). On appeal, a&para;<br>divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed. 316 Fed. Appx. 421 (2009). The State&para;<br>petitioned for review in our Court, and we granted certio&para;<br>rari. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>It is important at the outset to define the question be&para;<br>fore us. That question is not whether the trial judge&para;<br>should have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it&para;<br>was an abuse of discretion for her to have done so—the&para;<br>applicable standard on direct review. The question under&para;<br>AEDPA is instead whether the determination of the&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse of dis&para;<br>cretion was “an unreasonable application of . . . clearly&para;<br>established Federal law.” §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>We have explained that “an unreasonable application of&para;<br>federal law is different from an incorrect application of&para;<br>federal law.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410&para;<br>(2000). Indeed, “a federal habeas court may not issue the&para;<br>writ simply because that court concludes in its independ&para;<br>ent judgment that the relevant state-court decision ap&para;<br>plied clearly established federal law erroneously or incor&para;<br>rectly.” Id., at 411. Rather, that application must be&para;<br>“objectively unreasonable.” Id., at 409. This distinction&para;<br>creates “a substantially higher threshold” for obtaining&para;<br>relief than de novo review. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550&para;<br>U. S. 465, 473 (2007). AEDPA thus imposes a “highly&para;<br>deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,”&para;<br>Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and&para;<br>“demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of&para;<br>the doubt,” Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002)&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(per curiam).1&para;<br>The “clearly established Federal law” in this area is&para;<br>largely undisputed. In Perez, we held that when a judge&para;<br>discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot&para;<br>reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a&para;<br>new trial for the defendant before a new jury. 9 Wheat., at&para;<br>579–580. We explained that trial judges may declare a&para;<br>mistrial “whenever, in their opinion, taking all the cir&para;<br>cumstances into consideration, there is a manifest neces&para;<br>sity” for doing so. Id., at 580. The decision to declare a&para;<br>mistrial is left to the “sound discretion” of the judge, but&para;<br>“the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,&para;<br>under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvi&para;<br>ous causes.” Ibid.&para;<br>Since Perez, we have clarified that the “manifest neces&para;<br>sity” standard “cannot be interpreted literally,” and that a&para;<br>mistrial is appropriate when there is a “ ‘high degree’ ” of&para;<br>necessity. Washington, supra, at 506. The decision&para;<br>whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the “broad dis&para;<br>cretion” of the trial judge, a point that “has been consis&para;<br>tently reiterated in decisions of this Court.” Illinois v.&para;<br>Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462 (1973). See also Gori v.&para;<br>United States, 367 U. S. 364, 368 (1961).&para;<br>In particular, “[t]he trial judge’s decision to declare a&para;<br>mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is . . .&para;<br>accorded great deference by a reviewing court.” Washing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent correctly points out that AEDPA itself “never uses the&para;<br>term ‘deference.’ ” Post, at 19 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But our cases&para;<br>have done so over and over again to describe the effect of the threshold&para;<br>restrictions in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) on granting federal habeas relief to&para;<br>state prisoners. See, e.g., Wellons v. Hall, 558 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2010)&para;<br>(per curiam) (slip op., at 5, n. 3); Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 2); McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per&para;<br>curiam) (slip op., at 13); Cone v. Bell, 556 U.

S., at 510. A “mistrial premised upon the trial&para;<br>judge’s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict [has&para;<br>been] long considered the classic basis for a proper mis&para;<br>trial.” Id., at 509; see also Downum v. United States, 372&para;<br>U. S. 734, 736 (1963) (deadlocked jury is the “classic ex&para;<br>ample” of when the State may try the same defendant&para;<br>twice).&para;<br>The reasons for “allowing the trial judge to exercise&para;<br>broad discretion” are “especially compelling” in cases&para;<br>involving a potentially deadlocked jury. Washington, 434&para;<br>U. S., at 509. There, the justification for deference is that&para;<br>“the trial court is in the best position to assess all the&para;<br>factors which must be considered in making a necessarily&para;<br>discretionary determination whether the jury will be able&para;<br>to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.” Id., at&para;<br>510, n. 28. In the absence of such deference, trial judges&para;<br>might otherwise “employ coercive means to break the&para;<br>apparent deadlock,” thereby creating a “significant risk&para;<br>that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the&para;<br>situation rather than the considered judgment of all the&para;<br>jurors.” Id., at 510, 509.&para;<br>This is not to say that we grant absolute deference to&para;<br>trial judges in this context. Perez itself noted that the&para;<br>judge’s exercise of discretion must be “sound,” 9 Wheat., at&para;<br>580, and we have made clear that “[i]f the record reveals&para;<br>that the trial judge has failed to exercise the ‘sound discre&para;<br>tion’ entrusted to him, the reason for such deference by an&para;<br>appellate court disappears.” Washington, 434 U. S., at&para;<br>510, n. 28. Thus “if the trial judge acts for reasons com&para;<br>pletely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be&para;<br>the basis for the mistrial ruling, close appellate scrutiny is&para;<br>appropriate.” Ibid. Similarly, “if a trial judge acts irra&para;<br>tionally or irresponsibly, . . . his action cannot be con&para;<br>doned.” Id., at 514 (citing United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S.&para;<br>470 (1971), and Somerville, supra, at 469).&para;<br>We have expressly declined to require the “mechanical&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>application” of any “rigid formula” when trial judges de&para;<br>cide whether jury deadlock warrants a mistrial. Wade v.&para;<br>Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 691, 690 (1949). We have also&para;<br>explicitly held that a trial judge declaring a mistrial is not&para;<br>required to make explicit findings of “ ‘manifest necessity’ ”&para;<br>nor to “articulate on the record all the factors which in&para;<br>formed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.” Washing&para;<br>ton, supra, at 517. And we have never required a trial&para;<br>judge, before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock,&para;<br>to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of&para;<br>time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with&para;<br>(or obtain the consent of) either the prosecutor or defense&para;<br>counsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to&para;<br>consider any other means of breaking the impasse. In&para;<br>1981, then-Justice Rehnquist noted that this Court had&para;<br>never “overturned a trial court’s declaration of a mistrial&para;<br>after a jury was unable to reach a verdict on the ground&para;<br>that the ‘manifest necessity’ standard had not been met.”&para;<br>Winston v.

The same remains true today,&para;<br>nearly 30 years later.&para;<br>The legal standard applied by the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court in this case was whether there was an abuse of the&para;<br>“broad discretion” reserved to the trial judge. Somerville,&para;<br>supra, at 462; Washington, supra, at 509. This type of&para;<br>general standard triggers another consideration under&para;<br>AEDPA. When assessing whether a state court’s applica&para;<br>tion of federal law is unreasonable, “the range of reason&para;<br>able judgment can depend in part on the nature of the&para;<br>relevant rule” that the state court must apply. Yarbor&para;<br>ough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). Because&para;<br>AEDPA authorizes federal courts to grant relief only when&para;<br>state courts act unreasonably, it follows that “[t]he more&para;<br>general the rule” at issue—and thus the greater the poten&para;<br>tial for reasoned disagreement among fair-minded&para;<br>judges—“the more leeway [state] courts have in reaching&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The court cited our own&para;<br>double jeopardy cases—from Perez to Washington—&para;<br>elaborating upon the “manifest necessity” standard for&para;<br>granting a mistrial and noting the broad deference that&para;<br>appellate courts must give trial judges in deciding whether&para;<br>that standard has been met in any given case. Lett, 466&para;<br>Mich., at 216–222, 644 N. W. 2d, at 749–752. It then&para;<br>applied those precedents to the particular facts before it&para;<br>and found no abuse of discretion, especially in light of the&para;<br>length of deliberations after a short and uncomplicated&para;<br>trial, the jury notes suggesting heated discussions and&para;<br>asking what would happen “if we can’t agree,” and—&para;<br>“[m]ost important”—“the fact that the jury foreperson&para;<br>expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a&para;<br>verdict.” Id., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. In these cir&para;<br>cumstances, it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court to determine that the trial judge had exercised&para;<br>sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded&para;<br>otherwise. It did not contest the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court’s description of the objective facts, but disagreed&para;<br>with the inferences to be drawn from them. For example,&para;<br>it speculated that the trial judge may have misinterpreted&para;<br>the jury’s notes as signs of discord and deadlock when,&para;<br>read literally, they expressly stated no such thing. 316&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Fed. Appx., at 427. It further determined that the judge’s&para;<br>brief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly&para;<br>implied a false equivalence between “mere disagreement”&para;<br>and “genuine deadlock,” and may have given rise to “inap&para;<br>propriate pressure” on her to say that the jury would be&para;<br>unable to reach a verdict. Id., at 426–427. The trial&para;<br>judge’s mistakes were so egregious, in the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals’ view, that the Michigan Supreme Court’s opinion&para;<br>finding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but&para;<br>objectively unreasonable. Id., at 427.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the trial record&para;<br>is not implausible. Nor, for that matter, is the more in&para;<br>ventive (surely not “crude”) speculation of the dissent.&para;<br>Post, at 10. After all, the jury only deliberated for four&para;<br>hours, its notes were arguably ambiguous, the trial judge’s&para;<br>initial question to the foreperson was imprecise, and the&para;<br>judge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson’s&para;<br>answers nor took any other measures to confirm the fore&para;<br>person’s prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be&para;<br>reached.2&para;<br>But other reasonable interpretations of the record are&para;<br>also possible. Lett’s trial was not complex, and there is no&para;<br>reason that the jury would necessarily have needed more&para;<br>than a few hours to deliberate over his guilt. The notes&para;<br>the jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as re&para;<br>flecting substantial disagreement, even if they did not say&para;<br>so outright. Most important, the foreperson expressly told&para;<br>the judge—in response to her unambiguous question “Are&para;<br>you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?”—that the&para;<br>jury would be unable to agree. Lett, supra, at 210, 644&para;<br>N. W. 2d, at 745.&para;<br>Given the foregoing facts, the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 We do not think it reasonable, however, to contend that “the fore&para;<br>person had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.”&para;<br>Post, at 12.

Yarborough, 541 U. S., at 664; see&para;<br>also Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ ruling in Lett’s favor failed to grant the Michigan&para;<br>courts the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA&para;<br>and our double jeopardy precedents.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also erred in a second respect. It&para;<br>relied upon its own decision in Fulton v. Moore, 520 F. 3d&para;<br>522 (CA6 2008), for the proposition “that Arizona v. Wash&para;<br>ington sets forth three factors that determine whether a&para;<br>judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mis&para;<br>trial: whether the judge (1) heard the opinions of the&para;<br>parties’ counsel about the propriety of the mistrial; (2)&para;<br>considered the alternatives to a mistrial; and (3) acted&para;<br>deliberately, instead of abruptly.” 316 Fed. Appx., at 426.&para;<br>It then cited Fulton’s interpretation of Washington to&para;<br>buttress its conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court&para;<br>erred in concluding that the trial judge had exercised&para;<br>sound discretion. 316 Fed.

As Lett points out, at a hearing before the Michigan Court of&para;<br>Appeals, the state prosecutor expressed the view that the judge had in&para;<br>fact erred in dismissing the jury and declaring a mistrial.

Ante, at 6–8. But the review&para;<br>ing court still has an important role to play; the applica&para;<br>tion of deference “does not, of course, end the inquiry.”&para;<br>Washington, 434 U. S., at 514. “In order to ensure that&para;<br>[the defendant’s constitutional] interest is adequately&para;<br>protected, reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy&para;<br>themselves that, in the words of Mr. Justice Story, the&para;<br>trial judge exercised ‘sound discretion’ in declaring a&para;<br>mistrial.” Ibid. “If the record reveals that the trial judge&para;<br>has failed to exercise the ‘sound discretion’ entrusted to&para;<br>him, the reason for . . . deference by an appellate court&para;<br>disappears.” Id., at 510, n. 28. And while trial judges&para;<br>need not follow any precise regimen to facilitate appellate&para;<br>review, they must at least take care to ensure that “[t]he&para;<br>basis for [a] mistrial order is adequately disclosed by the&para;<br>record.” Id., at 517.&para;<br>Our precedents contain examples of judicial action on&para;<br>both sides of the line. We have, for instance, allowed a&para;<br>second trial when the jurors in the first trial, after 40&para;<br>hours of deliberation, “announced in open court that they&para;<br>were unable to agree,” and no “specific and traversable&para;<br>fact[s]” called their deadlock into question. Logan v.&para;<br>United States, 144 U. S. 263, 298 (1892). We have like&para;<br>wise permitted reprosecution when the initial judge heard&para;<br>“extended argument” from both parties on the mistrial&para;<br>motion, acted with evident “concern for the possible double&para;<br>jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling,” and “ac&para;<br>corded careful consideration to [the defendant’s] interest&para;<br>in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.”&para;<br>Washington, 434 U. S., at 501, 515, 516.&para;<br>On the other hand, we have barred retrial when the first&para;<br>judge acted “abruptly,” cutting off the prosecutor “in mid&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>stream” and discharging the jury without giving the par&para;<br>ties an opportunity to object. Jorn, 400 U. S., at 487 (plu&para;<br>rality opinion); see also Somerville, 410 U. S., at 469&para;<br>(characterizing Jorn judge’s actions as “erratic”). And we&para;<br>have opined that, while trial judges have considerable&para;<br>leeway in deciding whether to discharge the jury, “[w]e&para;<br>resolve any doubt in favor of the liberty of the citizen,&para;<br>rather than exercise what would be an unlimited, uncer&para;<br>tain, and arbitrary judicial discretion.” Downum, 372&para;<br>U.

If the “manifest necessity” and “sound&para;<br>discretion” standards are to have any force, we must&para;<br>demand more from our trial courts.&para;<br>It is probably fair to say that this trial was not espe&para;<br>cially complex, ante, at 4, 10, but neither was it a trivial&para;<br>affair. Lett was charged with the most serious of crimes,&para;<br>first-degree murder, as well as possession of a firearm&para;<br>during the commission of a felony. He faced a potential&para;<br>sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. Seventeen&para;<br>witnesses provided testimony over the course of 10 calen&para;<br>dar days. See 507 F. Supp. 2d 777, 779, 785–786 (ED&para;<br>Mich. 2007); see also id., at 785 (discussing “piecemeal&para;<br>fashion” in which evidence was presented to the jury).&para;<br>The jury’s first period of deliberation on Thursday after&para;<br>noon lasted less than 40 minutes. “The jury likely spent”&para;<br>that brief session “doing little more than electing a fore&para;<br>person.” People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 227, 644 N. W. 2d&para;<br>743, 755 (2002) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). The jury de&para;<br>liberated a few more hours on Friday morning prior to&para;<br>discharge. During that time, it sent the trial court seven&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>notes. Most were inconsequential, routine queries. The&para;<br>first note on Friday morning raised “ ‘a concern about [the&para;<br>jurors’] voice levels,’ ” Letter from M. McCowan to Clerk of&para;<br>Court (Mar. 4, 2010), p. 2, but nothing in the record re&para;<br>lates this concern to the substance or tenor of their discus&para;<br>sion. At 12:27 p.m., the jury sent the fateful missive,&para;<br>asking: “ ‘What if we can’t agree? [M]istrial? [R]etrial?&para;<br>[W]hat?’ ” Ibid. Seconds later, still at 12:27 p.m., the jury&para;<br>sent another note: “ ‘What about lunch?’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>At 12:45 p.m., the trial judge initiated a colloquy with&para;<br>the foreperson that concluded in the mistrial declaration.&para;<br>See ante, at 2–3 (reproducing transcript of colloquy). Even&para;<br>accounting for the imprecision of oral communication, the&para;<br>judge made an inordinate number of logical and legal&para;<br>missteps during this short exchange. Cf. Somerville, 410&para;<br>U. S., at 469 (critiquing “erratic” mistrial inquiry). It does&para;<br>not take much exegetical skill to spot them.&para;<br>The judge began by stating: “ ‘I received your note ask&para;<br>ing me what if you can’t agree? And I have to conclude&para;<br>from that that that is your situation at this time.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>at 2. This “ ‘conclu[sion]’ ” was a non sequitur. The note&para;<br>asked what would happen if the jury could not agree; it&para;<br>gave no indication that the jury had already reached an&para;<br>irrevocable impasse. The judge ignored the request for&para;<br>information that the note actually contained. Instead, she&para;<br>announced that deadlock was the jury’s “ ‘situation at this&para;<br>time,’ ” thereby prejudging the question she had ostensibly&para;<br>summoned the foreperson to probe: namely, whether the&para;<br>jury was in fact deadlocked.&para;<br>The judge continued: “ ‘I need to ask you if the jury is&para;<br>deadlocked; in other words, is there a disagreement as to&para;<br>the verdict?’ ” Ante, at 2–3. As the Federal Court of Ap&para;<br>peals observed, this question “improperly conflated dead&para;<br>lock with mere disagreement.” 316 Fed. Appx. 421, 426&para;<br>(CA6 2009). Deadlock is a “condition or situation in which&para;<br>it is impossible to proceed or act; a complete standstill.” 4&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary 290 (2d ed. 1989). Disagree&para;<br>ment among jurors is perfectly normal and does not come&para;<br>close to approaching the “imperious necessity” we have&para;<br>required for their discharge. Downum, 372 U. S., at 736.&para;<br>The trial judge then modulated her inquiry: “ ‘Do you&para;<br>believe [the jury] is hopelessly deadlocked?’ ” Ante, at 3.&para;<br>The foreperson was in the midst of replying, “ ‘The major&para;<br>ity of us don’t believe that—,’ ” when the judge appears to&para;<br>have cut her off. Ibid. One cannot “fault the trial judge”&para;<br>for wanting “to preserve the secrecy of jury deliberations,”&para;<br>507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787, but two aspects of the foreperson’s&para;<br>truncated reply are notable. First, it “tends to show that&para;<br>the foreperson did not feel prepared to declare definitively&para;<br>that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.” Ibid. If she had&para;<br>been so prepared, then it is hard to see why she would&para;<br>begin her response with a descriptive account of the “ ‘ma&para;<br>jority’ ” viewpoint.&para;<br>Second, the foreperson’s reply suggests the jury may&para;<br>have been leaning toward acquittal. Admittedly, this is&para;<br>crude speculation, but it is entirely possible that the fore&para;<br>person was in the process of saying, “The majority of us&para;<br>don’t believe that he’s guilty.” Or: “The majority of us&para;<br>don’t believe that there is sufficient evidence to prove one&para;<br>of the counts.” (On retrial, Lett was convicted on both&para;<br>counts.) These possibilities are, I submit, linguistically&para;<br>more probable than something like the following: “The&para;<br>majority of us don’t believe that Lett is guilty, whereas a&para;<br>minority of us believe that he is—and we are hopelessly&para;<br>deadlocked on the matter.” And they are logically far more&para;<br>probable than something along the lines of, “The majority&para;<br>of us don’t believe that we will ever be able to reach a&para;<br>verdict,” as the foreperson had been given no opportunity&para;<br>to poll her colleagues on this point. Yet only such implau&para;<br>sible endings could have supported a conclusion that it&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was manifestly necessary to discharge the jury.14&para;<br>The judge then steered the conversation back to the&para;<br>issue of deadlock, asking: “ ‘Are you going to reach a unani&para;<br>mous verdict, or not?’ ” Ante, at 3. After the foreperson&para;<br>hesitated, the judge persisted: “ ‘Yes or no?’ ” Ibid. The&para;<br>foreperson replied: “ ‘No, Judge.’ ” Ibid. Two aspects of&para;<br>this interchange are also notable. First, the judge’s ques&para;<br>tion, though “very direct,” was “actually rather ambigu&para;<br>ous,” because it gave the foreperson no temporal or legal&para;<br>context within which to understand what was being asked.&para;<br>507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787. “The foreperson could have easily&para;<br>thought the judge meant, ‘Are you going to reach a&para;<br>unanimous verdict in the next hour?’ or ‘before the lunch&para;<br>recess?’ or ‘by the end of the day?’ ” Ibid. (emphasis de&para;<br>leted). Even if the foreperson assumed no time constraint,&para;<br>she could have easily thought the judge meant, “Are you,&para;<br>in your estimation, more likely than not to reach a unani&para;<br>mous verdict?” An affirmative answer to that question&para;<br>would likewise fall far short of manifest necessity.&para;<br>Second, the foreperson’s hesitation suggests a lack of&para;<br>confidence in her position. That alone ought to have called&para;<br>into question the propriety of a mistrial order. But the&para;<br>judge bore down and demanded an unqualified answer,&para;<br>“ ‘Yes or no.’ ” Most of the time when we worry about&para;<br>judicial coercion of juries, we worry about judges pressur&para;<br>ing them, in the common-law manner, to keep deliberating&para;<br>until they return a verdict they may not otherwise have&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 Another reading of the foreperson’s reply is available: Her state&para;<br>ment,“ ‘The majority of us don’t believe that,’ ” may have been a com&para;<br>plete sentence. In other words, she may have meant to convey, “The&para;<br>majority of us don’t believe that we are hopelessly deadlocked.” The&para;<br>trial-court transcript places an em dash rather than a period after the&para;<br>word “that,” but this is hardly dispositive evidence of intonation or&para;<br>intent. However, the trial judge’s contemporaneous reaction, the fact&para;<br>that the foreperson was not permitted to consult with the other jurors&para;<br>on the issue of deadlock, and respondent’s failure to advance this&para;<br>reading undercut its plausibility.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>chosen. This judge exerted pressure so as to prevent the&para;<br>jury from reaching any verdict at all. In so doing, she cut&para;<br>off deliberations well before the point when it was clear&para;<br>they would no longer be fruitful. Recall that prior to&para;<br>summoning the foreperson for their colloquy, the trial&para;<br>judge gave her no opportunity to consult with the other&para;<br>jurors on the matter that would be discussed. So, the&para;<br>foreperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood&para;<br>of deadlock. Recall, as well, that almost immediately after&para;<br>sending the judge a note asking what would happen if&para;<br>they disagreed, the jury sent a note asking about lunch.&para;<br>Plainly, this was a group that was prepared to go on with&para;<br>its work.&para;<br>The judge then declared a mistrial on the spot. Her&para;<br>entire exchange with the foreperson took three minutes,&para;<br>from 12:45 p.m. to 12:48 p.m. App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a–&para;<br>94a. The entire jury deliberations took roughly four&para;<br>hours. The judge gave the parties no opportunity to com&para;<br>ment on the foreperson’s remarks, much less on the ques&para;<br>tion of mistrial. Cf. Washington, 434 U.

Just as soon as the judge&para;<br>declared a mistrial, she set a new pretrial date, discharged&para;<br>the jury, and concluded proceedings.

Al&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 Like&para;<br>&para;<br>the trial court before it, the Michigan Supreme Court did not&para;<br>make any factual findings to bolster its unreasonable legal conclusion.&para;<br>As the State Court of Appeals noted, the trial judge declared a mistrial&para;<br>as soon as she extracted a suggestive answer from the foreperson. She&para;<br>“never even found on the record that the jury was genuinely dead&para;<br>locked.” People v.

See, e.g., id., at 220, 644 N. W. 2d,&para;<br>at 751 (“The issue is not whether this Court would have found manifest&para;<br>necessity”). Accordingly, even if 28 U. S.

The foregoing analysis shows why&para;<br>the Michigan Supreme Court’s ruling cannot be saved by&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), however construed. That ruling&para;<br>was not only incorrect but also unreasonable by any fair&para;<br>measure. Three particular facets of the Court’s AEDPA&para;<br>analysis require a brief comment.&para;<br>First, the fact that the substantive legal standard ap&para;<br>plied by the state court “is a general one” has no bearing&para;<br>on the standard of review. Ante, at 11. We have said that&para;<br>“[t]he more general the rule, the more leeway courts have&para;<br>in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.”&para;<br>Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). But&para;<br>this statement stands only for the unremarkable proposi&para;<br>tion that more broadly framed rules will tend to encom&para;<br>pass a broader set of conforming applications. Regardless&para;<br>of the nature of the legal principle at issue, the task of a&para;<br>federal court remains the same under §2254(d)(1): to&para;<br>determine whether the state court’s decision “was contrary&para;<br>to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly&para;<br>established Federal law.” General standards are no less&para;<br>binding law than discrete rules.18&para;<br>——————&para;<br>18 In recognition of this basic insight, our precedents “have made&para;<br>clear” that a state-court decision may be “unreasonable” within the&para;<br>meaning of §2254(d)(1) when the “state court has misapplied a ‘govern&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Second, I do not agree that the Federal Court of Appeals&para;<br>“erred” by “rel[ying] upon its own decision” applying Ari&para;<br>zona v. Washington. Ante, at 11. The Sixth Circuit was&para;<br>well aware that its own decision “does not constitute&para;<br>‘clearly established Federal law, as determined by the&para;<br>Supreme Court.’ ” Ante, at 11–12 (quoting §2254(d)(1)).&para;<br>The panel expressly stated that it “review[ed] the Michi&para;<br>gan Supreme Court’s decision to determine only whether&para;<br>it was objectively unreasonable in light of the holdings of&para;<br>the Supreme Court.” 316 Fed. Appx., at 425. The panel&para;<br>examined its own precedents not as the relevant “clearly&para;<br>established Federal law” under AEDPA, but as a tool for&para;<br>illuminating the precise contours of that law. Lower&para;<br>courts routinely look to circuit cases to “provide evidence&para;<br>that Supreme Court precedents ha[ve] clearly established&para;<br>a rule as of a particular time or [to] shed light on the&para;<br>‘reasonableness’ of the state courts’ application of existing&para;<br>Supreme Court precedents.” 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman,&para;<br>Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §32.3,&para;<br>p. 1585, n. 10 (5th ed. 2005) (hereinafter Hertz &amp; Lieb&para;<br>man). This is a healthy practice—indeed, a vital practice,&para;<br>considering how few cases this Court decides—and we&para;<br>have never disapproved it.&para;<br>Finally, I do not agree that AEDPA authorizes “the dual&para;<br>layers of deference” the Court has utilized in this case.&para;<br>Ante, at 11. There is little doubt that AEDPA “directs&para;<br>federal courts to attend to every state-court judgment with&para;<br>utmost care.” Williams, 529 U. S., at 389 (opinion of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ing legal principle’ to ‘a set of facts different from those of the case in&para;<br>which the principle was announced.’ ” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,&para;<br>520 (2003) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76 (2003)); see&para;<br>also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000). This is a critical&para;<br>feature of our AEDPA jurisprudence. Federal habeas review would be&para;<br>meaningless if, for relief to be granted, we required a perfect congru&para;<br>ence between the facts that gave rise to our governing precedents and&para;<br>the facts that confronted the state court in any particular case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J.). But the statute never uses the term “defer&para;<br>ence,” and the legislative history makes clear that Con&para;<br>gress meant to preserve robust federal-court review. Id.,&para;<br>at 386–387; see also Hertz &amp; Liebman §32.3, at 1587–&para;<br>1589, n. 13 (summarizing congressional record and noting&para;<br>that “[t]he aspect of prior practice that most troubled&para;<br>AEDPA’s supporters was the federal court’s inattention to,&para;<br>and lack of respect for, state court decisions that the fed&para;<br>eral court, if it only looked, would find to be legally cor&para;<br>rect”). Any attempt to prevent federal courts from exercis&para;<br>ing independent review of habeas applications would have&para;<br>been a radical reform of dubious constitutionality, and&para;<br>Congress “would have spoken with much greater clarity” if&para;<br>that had been its intent. Williams, 529 U. S., at 379 (opin&para;<br>ion of STEVENS, J.).&para;<br>So on two levels, it is absolutely “necessary for us to&para;<br>decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision . . .&para;<br>was right or wrong.” Ante, at 11, n. 3. If a federal judge&para;<br>were firmly convinced that such a decision were wrong,&para;<br>then in my view not only would he have no statutory duty&para;<br>to uphold it, but he might also have a constitutional obli&para;<br>gation to reverse it. And regardless of how one conceptu&para;<br>alizes the distinction between an incorrect and an “unrea&para;<br>sonable” state-court ruling under §2254(d)(1), one must&para;<br>always determine whether the ruling was wrong to be able&para;<br>to test the magnitude of any error. Substantive and meth&para;<br>odological considerations compel federal courts to give&para;<br>habeas claims a full, independent review—and then to&para;<br>decide for themselves. Even under AEDPA, there is no&para;<br>escaping the burden of judgment.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In this case, Reginald Lett’s constitutional rights were&para;<br>violated when the trial court terminated his first trial&para;<br>without adequate justification and he was subsequently&para;<br>prosecuted for the same offense. The majority does not&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>RENICO v. LETT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>appear to dispute this point, but it nevertheless denies&para;<br>Lett relief by applying a level of deference to the state&para;<br>court’s ruling that effectively effaces the role of the federal&para;<br>courts. Nothing one will find in the United States Code or&para;<br>the United States Reports requires us to turn a blind eye&para;<br>to this manifestly unlawful conviction.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
