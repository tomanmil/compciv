JACOBS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–815.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 5, 2013—Decided December 10, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Sprint Communications, Inc. (Sprint), a national telecommunications&para;<br>service provider, withheld payment of intercarrier access fees imposed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet&para;<br>Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications&para;<br>Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic. Windstream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls,&para;<br>which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin&para;<br>Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint. Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint. Concerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceedings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to&para;<br>intrastate regulation. Rejecting Sprint’s argument that this question&para;<br>was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.&para;<br>Sprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUB’s decision. As relief, Sprint&para;<br>sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUB’s order. Sprint&para;<br>also sought review of the IUB’s order in Iowa state court, reiterating&para;<br>the preemption argument made in Sprint’s federal-court complaint&para;<br>and asserting several other claims. Invoking Younger v. Harris, 401&para;<br>U. S. 37, the Federal District Court abstained from adjudicating&para;<br>Sprint’s complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding.&para;<br>The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s abstention decision,&para;<br>concluding that Younger abstention was required because the ongoing state-court review concerned Iowa’s important interest in regulating and enforcing state utility rates.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: This case does not fall within any of the three classes of exceptional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(a) The District Court had jurisdiction to decide whether federal&para;<br>law preempted the IUB’s decision, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public&para;<br>Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642, and thus had a “virtually&para;<br>unflagging obligation” to hear and decide the case, Colorado River&para;<br>Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 817. In&para;<br>Younger, this Court recognized an exception to that obligation for&para;<br>cases in which there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding.&para;<br>This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil&para;<br>proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v.&para;<br>Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592, or that implicate a State’s interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v.&para;<br>Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1, but has reaffirmed that “only exceptional circumstances justify a federal court’s refusal to decide a case in deference to the States,” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of&para;<br>City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 368 (NOPSI). NOPSI identified&para;<br>three such “exceptional circumstances.” First, Younger precludes&para;<br>federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions. See 491&para;<br>U. S., at 368. Second, certain “civil enforcement proceedings” warrant Younger abstention. Ibid. Finally, federal courts should refrain&para;<br>from interfering with pending “civil proceedings involving certain orders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to perform&para;<br>their judicial functions.” Ibid. This Court has not applied Younger&para;<br>outside these three “exceptional” categories, and rules, in accord with&para;<br>NOPSI, that they define Younger’s scope. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(b) The initial IUB proceeding does not fall within any of NOPSI’s&para;<br>three exceptional categories and therefore does not trigger Younger&para;<br>abstention. The first and third categories plainly do not accommodate the IUB’s proceeding, which was civil, not criminal in character,&para;<br>and which did not touch on a state court’s ability to perform its judicial function. Nor is the IUB’s order an act of civil enforcement of the&para;<br>kind to which Younger has been extended. The IUB proceeding is not&para;<br>“akin to a criminal prosecution.” Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604. Nor&para;<br>was it initiated by “the State in its sovereign capacity,” Trainor v.&para;<br>Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 444, to sanction Sprint for some wrongful&para;<br>act, see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar&para;<br>Assn., 457 U. S. 423, 433–434. Rather, the action was initiated by&para;<br>Sprint, a private corporation. No state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint’s activities or lodged a formal complaint against&para;<br>Sprint.&para;<br>Once Sprint withdrew the complaint that commenced administrative proceedings, the IUB argues, those proceedings became, essentially, a civil enforcement action. However, the IUB’s adjudicative&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>authority was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private&para;<br>parties, not to sanction Sprint for a wrongful act.&para;<br>In holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Circuit misinterpreted this Court’s decision in Middlesex to mean that&para;<br>Younger abstention is warranted whenever there is (1) “an ongoing&para;<br>state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests, and (3) . . . provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal]&para;<br>challenges.” In Middlesex, the Court invoked Younger to bar a federal court from entertaining a lawyer’s challenge to a state ethics committee’s pending investigation of the lawyer. Unlike the IUB’s proceeding, however, the state ethics committee’s hearing in Middlesex&para;<br>was plainly “akin to a criminal proceeding”: An investigation and&para;<br>formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State’s Supreme Court initiated the hearing, and the hearing’s purpose was to&para;<br>determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for failing to&para;<br>meet the State’s professional conduct standards. 457 U. S., at 433–&para;<br>435. The three Middlesex conditions invoked by the Court of Appeals&para;<br>were therefore not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors&para;<br>appropriately considered by the federal court before invoking Younger. Younger extends to the three “exceptional circumstances” identified in NOPSI, but no further.

Each seeks review of an&para;<br>Iowa Utilities Board (IUB or Board) order. And each&para;<br>presents the question whether Windstream Iowa Commu­&para;<br>nications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications&para;<br>carrier, may impose on Sprint Communications, Inc.&para;<br>(Sprint), intrastate access charges for telephone calls&para;<br>transported via the Internet. Federal-court jurisdiction&para;<br>over controversies of this kind was confirmed in Verizon&para;<br>Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635&para;<br>(2002). Invoking Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971),&para;<br>the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa&para;<br>abstained from adjudicating Sprint’s complaint in defer­&para;<br>ence to the parallel state-court proceeding, and the Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District&para;<br>Court’s abstention decision.&para;<br>We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. In the&para;<br>main, federal courts are obliged to decide cases within the&para;<br>scope of federal jurisdiction. Abstention is not in order&para;<br>simply because a pending state-court proceeding involves&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the same subject matter. New Orleans Public Service, Inc.&para;<br>v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 373&para;<br>(1989) (NOPSI) (“[T]here is no doctrine that . . . pendency&para;<br>of state judicial proceedings excludes the federal courts.”).&para;<br>This Court has recognized, however, certain instances in&para;<br>which the prospect of undue interference with state pro­&para;<br>ceedings counsels against federal relief. See id., at 368.&para;<br>Younger exemplifies one class of cases in which federal­&para;<br>court abstention is required: When there is a parallel,&para;<br>pending state criminal proceeding, federal courts must&para;<br>refrain from enjoining the state prosecution. This Court&para;<br>has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil&para;<br>proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see&para;<br>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592 (1975), or that&para;<br>implicate a State’s interest in enforcing the orders and&para;<br>judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc.,&para;<br>481 U. S. 1 (1987). We have cautioned, however, that&para;<br>federal courts ordinarily should entertain and resolve on&para;<br>the merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional&para;<br>grant, and should not “refus[e] to decide a case in defer­&para;<br>ence to the States.” NOPSI, 491 U. S., at 368.&para;<br>Circumstances fitting within the Younger doctrine, we&para;<br>have stressed, are “exceptional”; they include, as cata­&para;<br>logued in NOPSI, “state criminal prosecutions,” “civil&para;<br>enforcement proceedings,” and “civil proceedings involving&para;<br>certain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state&para;<br>courts’ ability to perform their judicial functions.” Id., at&para;<br>367–368. Because this case presents none of the circum­&para;<br>stances the Court has ranked as “exceptional,” the general&para;<br>rule governs: “[T]he pendency of an action in [a] state&para;<br>court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter&para;<br>in the Federal court having jurisdiction.” Colorado River&para;<br>Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800,&para;<br>817 (1976) (quoting McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268,&para;<br>282 (1910)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>Sprint, a national telecommunications service provider,&para;<br>has long paid intercarrier access fees to the Iowa commu­&para;<br>nications company Windstream (formerly Iowa Telecom)&para;<br>for certain long distance calls placed by Sprint customers&para;<br>to Windstream’s in-state customers. In 2009, however,&para;<br>Sprint decided to withhold payment for a subset of those&para;<br>calls, classified as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),&para;<br>after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996&para;<br>preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.1 In re­&para;<br>sponse, Windstream threatened to block all calls to and&para;<br>from Sprint customers.&para;<br>Sprint filed a complaint against Windstream with the&para;<br>IUB asking the Board to enjoin Windstream from discon­&para;<br>tinuing service to Sprint. In Sprint’s view, Iowa law enti­&para;<br>tled it to withhold payment while it contested the access&para;<br>charges and prohibited Windstream from carrying out its&para;<br>disconnection threat. In answer to Sprint’s complaint,&para;<br>Windstream retracted its threat to discontinue serving&para;<br>Sprint, and Sprint moved, successfully, to withdraw its&para;<br>complaint. Because the conflict between Sprint and Wind­&para;<br>stream over VoIP calls was “likely to recur,” however, the&para;<br>IUB decided to continue the proceedings to resolve the&para;<br>underlying legal question, i.e., whether VoIP calls are&para;<br>subject to intrastate regulation. Order in Sprint Commu­&para;<br>nications Co. v. Iowa Telecommunications Servs., Inc., No.&para;<br>FCU–2010–0001 (IUB, Feb. 1, 2010), p. 6 (IUB Order).&para;<br>The question retained by the IUB, Sprint argued, was&para;<br>governed by federal law, and was not within the IUB’s&para;<br>adjudicative jurisdiction. The IUB disagreed, ruling that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Federal Communications Commission has yet to provide its&para;<br>view on whether the Telecommunications Act categorically preempts&para;<br>intrastate access charges for VoIP calls. See In re Connect America&para;<br>Fund, 26 FCC Rcd. 17663, 18002, ¶934 (2011) (reserving the ques­&para;<br>tion whether all VoIP calls “must be subject exclusively to federal&para;<br>regulation”).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.2&para;<br>Seeking to overturn the Board’s ruling, Sprint com­&para;<br>menced two lawsuits. First, Sprint sued the members of&para;<br>the IUB (respondents here)3 in their official capacities in&para;<br>the United States District Court for the Southern District&para;<br>of Iowa. In its federal-court complaint, Sprint sought&para;<br>a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996&para;<br>preempted the IUB’s decision; as relief, Sprint requested&para;<br>an injunction against enforcement of the IUB’s order.&para;<br>Second, Sprint petitioned for review of the IUB’s order&para;<br>in Iowa state court. The state petition reiterated the&para;<br>preemption argument Sprint made in its federal-court&para;<br>complaint; in addition, Sprint asserted state law and&para;<br>procedural due process claims. Because Eighth Circuit&para;<br>precedent effectively required a plaintiff to exhaust state&para;<br>remedies before proceeding to federal court, see Alleghany&para;<br>Corp. v. McCartney, 896 F. 2d 1138 (1990), Sprint urges&para;<br>that it filed the state suit as a protective measure. Failing&para;<br>to do so, Sprint explains, risked losing the opportunity to&para;<br>obtain any review, federal or state, should the federal&para;<br>court decide to abstain after the expiration of the Iowa&para;<br>statute of limitations. See Brief for Petitioner 7–8.4&para;<br>As Sprint anticipated, the IUB filed a motion asking the&para;<br>Federal District Court to abstain in light of the state suit,&para;<br>citing Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971). The District&para;<br>Court granted the IUB’s motion and dismissed the suit.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 At&para;<br>&para;<br>the conclusion of the IUB proceedings, Sprint paid Windstream&para;<br>all contested fees.&para;<br>3 For convenience, we refer to respondents collectively as the IUB.&para;<br>4 Since we granted certiorari, the Iowa state court issued an opinion&para;<br>rejecting Sprint’s preemption claim on the merits. Sprint Communica­&para;<br>tions Co. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., No. CV–8638, App. to Joint Supp. Brief&para;<br>20a–36a (Iowa Dist. Ct., Sept. 16, 2013). The Iowa court decision does&para;<br>not, in the parties’ view, moot this case, see Joint Supp. Brief 1, and we&para;<br>agree. Because Sprint intends to appeal the state-court decision, the&para;<br>“controversy . . . remains live.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic&para;<br>Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 291, n. 7 (2005).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

On that&para;<br>ground, the court ruled, Younger abstention was in order.&para;<br>Sprint Communications Co. v. Berntsen, No. 4:11–cv–&para;<br>00183–JAJ (SD Iowa, Aug. 1, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>24a.&para;<br>For the most part, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the&para;<br>District Court’s judgment. The Court of Appeals rejected&para;<br>the argument, accepted by several of its sister courts, that&para;<br>Younger abstention is appropriate only when the parallel&para;<br>state proceedings are “coercive,” rather than “remedial,” in&para;<br>nature. 690 F. 3d 864, 868 (2012); cf. Guillemard-Ginorio&para;<br>v. Contreras-Gómez, 585 F. 3d 508, 522 (CA1 2009)&para;<br>(“[P]roceedings must be coercive, and in most cases, state­&para;<br>initiated, in order to warrant abstention.”). Instead, the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit read this Court’s precedent to require&para;<br>Younger abstention whenever “an ongoing state judicial&para;<br>proceeding . . . implicates important state interests, and&para;<br>. . . the state proceedings provide adequate opportunity to&para;<br>raise [federal] challenges.” 690 F. 3d, at 867 (citing Mid­&para;<br>dlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn.,&para;<br>457 U. S. 423, 432 (1982)). Those criteria were satisfied&para;<br>here, the appeals court held, because the ongoing state­&para;<br>court review of the IUB’s decision concerned Iowa’s “im­&para;<br>portant state interest in regulating and enforcing its&para;<br>intrastate utility rates.” 690 F. 3d, at 868. Recognizing&para;<br>the “possibility that the parties [might] return to federal&para;<br>court,” however, the Court of Appeals vacated the judg­&para;<br>ment dismissing Sprint’s complaint. In lieu of dismissal,&para;<br>the Eighth Circuit remanded the case, instructing the&para;<br>District Court to enter a stay during the pendency of the&para;<br>state-court action. Id., at 869.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with&para;<br>our delineation of cases encompassed by the Younger&para;<br>doctrine, abstention was appropriate here. 569 U.

In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public&para;<br>Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635 (2002), we reviewed a&para;<br>similar federal-court challenge to a state administrative&para;<br>adjudication. In that case, as here, the party seeking&para;<br>federal-court review of a state agency’s decision urged that&para;<br>the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the state&para;<br>action. We had “no doubt that federal courts ha[d federal&para;<br>question] jurisdiction under [28 U. S. C.] §1331 to enter­&para;<br>tain such a suit,” id., at 642, and nothing in the Telecom­&para;<br>munications Act detracted from that conclusion, see id.,&para;<br>at 643.&para;<br>Federal courts, it was early and famously said, have “no&para;<br>more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is&para;<br>given, than to usurp that which is not given.” Cohens v.&para;<br>Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Jurisdiction existing,&para;<br>this Court has cautioned, a federal court’s “obligation” to&para;<br>hear and decide a case is “virtually unflagging.” Colorado&para;<br>River Water Conservation Dist. v.

In those circumstances, we&para;<br>said, the federal court should decline to enjoin the prose­&para;<br>cution, absent bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid&para;<br>state statute. See 401 U. S., at 53–54. Abstention was in&para;<br>order, we explained, under “the basic doctrine of equity&para;<br>jurisprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . to&para;<br>restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party&para;<br>has an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irrepa­&para;<br>rably injury if denied equitable relief.” Id., at 43–44.&para;<br>“[R]estraining equity jurisdiction within narrow limits,”&para;<br>the Court observed, would “prevent erosion of the role of&para;<br>the jury and avoid a duplication of legal proceedings and&para;<br>legal sanctions.” Id., at 44. We explained as well that this&para;<br>doctrine was “reinforced” by the notion of “ ‘comity,’ that is,&para;<br>a proper respect for state functions.” Ibid.&para;<br>We have since applied Younger to bar federal relief in&para;<br>certain civil actions. Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S.&para;<br>592 (1975), is the pathmarking decision. There, Ohio&para;<br>officials brought a civil action in state court to abate the&para;<br>showing of obscene movies in Pursue’s theater. Because&para;<br>the State was a party and the proceeding was “in aid of&para;<br>and closely related to [the State’s] criminal statutes,” the&para;<br>Court held Younger abstention appropriate. Id., at 604.&para;<br>More recently, in NOPSI, 491 U. S., at 368, the Court&para;<br>had occasion to review and restate our Younger jurispru­&para;<br>dence. NOPSI addressed and rejected an argument that&para;<br>a federal court should refuse to exercise jurisdiction to&para;<br>review a state council’s ratemaking decision. “[O]nly ex­&para;<br>ceptional circumstances,” we reaffirmed, “justify a fed­&para;<br>eral court’s refusal to decide a case in deference to the&para;<br>States.” Ibid. Those “exceptional circumstances” exist,&para;<br>the Court determined after surveying prior decisions,&para;<br>in three types of proceedings. First, Younger precluded&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.&para;<br>See ibid. Second, certain “civil enforcement proceedings”&para;<br>warranted abstention. Ibid. (citing, e.g., Huffman, 420&para;<br>U. S., at 604). Finally, federal courts refrained from inter­&para;<br>fering with pending “civil proceedings involving certain&para;<br>orders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’&para;<br>ability to perform their judicial functions.” 491 U. S., at&para;<br>368 (citing Juidice v. Vail, 430 U. S. 327, 336, n. 12 (1977),&para;<br>and Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1, 13 (1987)).&para;<br>We have not applied Younger outside these three “excep­&para;<br>tional” categories, and today hold, in accord with NOPSI,&para;<br>that they define Younger’s scope.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The IUB does not assert that the Iowa state court’s&para;<br>review of the Board decision, considered alone, implicates&para;<br>Younger. Rather, the initial administrative proceeding&para;<br>justifies staying any action in federal court, the IUB con­&para;<br>tends, until the state review process has concluded. The&para;<br>same argument was advanced in NOPSI. 491 U. S., at&para;<br>368. We will assume without deciding, as the Court did in&para;<br>NOPSI, that an administrative adjudication and the&para;<br>subsequent state court’s review of it count as a “unitary&para;<br>process” for Younger purposes. Id., at 369. The question&para;<br>remains, however, whether the initial IUB proceeding is of&para;<br>the “sort . . . entitled to Younger treatment.” Ibid.&para;<br>The IUB proceeding, we conclude, does not fall within&para;<br>any of the three exceptional categories described in NOPSI&para;<br>and therefore does not trigger Younger abstention. The&para;<br>first and third categories plainly do not accommodate the&para;<br>IUB’s proceeding. That proceeding was civil, not criminal&para;<br>in character, and it did not touch on a state court’s ability&para;<br>to perform its judicial function. Cf. Juidice, 430 U.

S.,&para;<br>at 432 (Younger abstention appropriate where “noncrimi­&para;<br>nal proceedings bear a close relationship to proceedings&para;<br>criminal in nature”). Such enforcement actions are char­&para;<br>acteristically initiated to sanction the federal plaintiff, i.e.,&para;<br>the party challenging the state action, for some wrongful&para;<br>act. See, e.g., Middlesex, 457 U. S., at 433–434 (state­&para;<br>initiated disciplinary proceedings against lawyer for viola­&para;<br>tion of state ethics rules). In cases of this genre, a state&para;<br>actor is routinely a party to the state proceeding and often&para;<br>initiates the action. See, e.g., Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n v.&para;<br>Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S. 619 (1986) (state­&para;<br>initiated administrative proceedings to enforce state civil&para;<br>rights laws); Moore v. Sims, 442 U.

S., at 598 (state-initiated proceeding to&para;<br>enforce obscenity laws). Investigations are commonly&para;<br>involved, often culminating in the filing of a formal com­&para;<br>plaint or charges. See, e.g., Dayton, 477 U. S., at 624&para;<br>(noting preliminary investigation and complaint); Middle­&para;<br>sex, 457 U.

It is not “akin to a criminal prosecu­&para;<br>tion.” Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604. Nor was it initiated by&para;<br>“the State in its sovereign capacity.” Trainor, 431 U. S., at&para;<br>444. A private corporation, Sprint, initiated the action.&para;<br>No state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint’s&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>activities, and no state actor lodged a formal complaint&para;<br>against Sprint.&para;<br>In its brief, the IUB emphasizes Sprint’s decision to&para;<br>withdraw the complaint that commenced proceedings&para;<br>before the Board. At that point, the IUB argues, Sprint&para;<br>was no longer a willing participant, and the proceedings&para;<br>became, essentially, a civil enforcement action. See Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 31.6 The IUB’s adjudicative authority,&para;<br>however, was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two&para;<br>private parties, not to sanction Sprint for commission of a&para;<br>wrongful act. Although Sprint withdrew its complaint,&para;<br>administrative efficiency, not misconduct by Sprint,&para;<br>prompted the IUB to answer the underlying federal ques­&para;<br>tion. By determining the intercarrier compensation re­&para;<br>gime applicable to VoIP calls, the IUB sought to avoid&para;<br>renewed litigation of the parties’ dispute. Because the&para;<br>underlying legal question remained unsettled, the Board&para;<br>observed, the controversy was “likely to recur.” IUB Order&para;<br>6. Nothing here suggests that the IUB proceeding was&para;<br>“more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil&para;<br>cases.” Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604.&para;<br>In holding that abstention was the proper course, the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit relied heavily on this Court’s decision in&para;<br>Middlesex. Younger abstention was warranted, the Court&para;<br>of Appeals read Middlesex to say, whenever three condi­&para;<br>tions are met: There is (1) “an ongoing state judicial&para;<br>proceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests,&para;<br>and (3) . . . provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 To&para;<br>&para;<br>determine whether a state proceeding is an enforcement action&para;<br>under Younger, several Courts of Appeals, as noted, see supra, at 5,&para;<br>inquire whether the underlying state proceeding is “coercive” rather&para;<br>than “remedial.” See, e.g., Devlin v. Kalm, 594 F. 3d 893, 895 (CA6&para;<br>2010). Though we referenced this dichotomy once in a footnote, see&para;<br>Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S.&para;<br>619, 627, n. 2 (1986), we do not find the inquiry necessary or inevitably&para;<br>helpful, given the susceptibility of the designations to manipulation.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Brief for Respond­&para;<br>ents 13.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals and the IUB attribute to this&para;<br>Court’s decision in Middlesex extraordinary breadth. We&para;<br>invoked Younger in Middlesex to bar a federal court from&para;<br>entertaining a lawyer’s challenge to a New Jersey state&para;<br>ethics committee’s pending investigation of the lawyer.&para;<br>Unlike the IUB proceeding here, the state ethics commit­&para;<br>tee’s hearing in Middlesex was indeed “akin to a criminal&para;<br>proceeding.” As we noted, an investigation and formal&para;<br>complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State’s&para;<br>Supreme Court initiated the hearing, and the purpose of&para;<br>the hearing was to determine whether the lawyer should&para;<br>be disciplined for his failure to meet the State’s standards&para;<br>of professional conduct. 457 U. S., at 433–435. See also&para;<br>id., at 438 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (noting&para;<br>the “quasi-criminal nature of bar disciplinary proceed­&para;<br>ings”). The three Middlesex conditions recited above were&para;<br>not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors&para;<br>appropriately considered by the federal court before invok­&para;<br>ing Younger.&para;<br>Divorced from their quasi-criminal context, the three&para;<br>Middlesex conditions would extend Younger to virtually all&para;<br>parallel state and federal proceedings, at least where a&para;<br>party could identify a plausibly important state interest.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–36. That result is irreconcilable&para;<br>with our dominant instruction that, even in the presence&para;<br>of parallel state proceedings, abstention from the exercise&para;<br>of federal jurisdiction is the “exception, not the rule.”&para;<br>Hawaii Housing Authority v.
