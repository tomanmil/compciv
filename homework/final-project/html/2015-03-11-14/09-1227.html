UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1227. Argued February 22, 2011—Decided June 16, 2011&para;<br>When petitioner Bond discovered that her close friend was pregnant by&para;<br>Bond’s husband, she began harassing the woman. The woman suf&para;<br>fered a minor burn after Bond put caustic substances on objects the&para;<br>woman was likely to touch. Bond was indicted for violating 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §229, which forbids knowing possession or use, for nonpeace&para;<br>ful purposes, of a chemical that “can cause death, temporary inca&para;<br>pacitation or permanent harm to humans,” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8),&para;<br>and which is part of a federal Act implementing a chemical weapons&para;<br>treaty ratified by the United States. The District Court denied&para;<br>Bond’s motion to dismiss the §229 charges on the ground that the&para;<br>statute exceeded Congress’ constitutional authority to enact. She en&para;<br>tered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the rul&para;<br>ing on the statute’s validity. She did just that, renewing her Tenth&para;<br>Amendment claim. The Third Circuit, however, accepted the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s position that she lacked standing. The Government has&para;<br>since changed its view on Bond’s standing.&para;<br>Held: Bond has standing to challenge the federal statute on grounds&para;<br>that the measure interferes with the powers reserved to States.&para;<br>Pp. 3–14.&para;<br>(a) The Third Circuit relied on a single sentence in Tennessee Elec.&para;<br>Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118. Pp. 3–8.&para;<br>(1) The Court has disapproved of Tennessee Electric as authorita&para;<br>tive for purposes of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement. See&para;<br>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp,&para;<br>397 U. S. 150, 152–154. Here, Article III’s standing requirement had&para;<br>no bearing on Bond’s capacity to assert defenses in the District Court.&para;<br>And Article III’s prerequisites are met with regard to her standing to&para;<br>appeal. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(2) Tennessee Electric is also irrelevant with respect to prudential&para;<br>standing rules. There, the Court declined to reach the merits where&para;<br>private power companies sought to enjoin the federally chartered&para;<br>Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing and selling electric&para;<br>power, claiming that the statute creating the TVA exceeded the Na&para;<br>tional Government’s powers in violation of the Tenth Amendment. In&para;<br>doing so, the Court repeatedly stated that the problem with the&para;<br>power companies’ suit was a lack of “standing” or a “cause of action,”&para;<br>treating those concepts as interchangeable. E.g., 306 U. S., at 139.&para;<br>The question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief typically&para;<br>“goes to the merits” of a case, however, not to the dispute’s justiciabil&para;<br>ity, Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 92, and&para;<br>conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion. This happened&para;<br>with Tennessee Electric’s Tenth Amendment discussion. The state&para;<br>ment on which the Third Circuit relied here, see 306 U. S., at 144,&para;<br>should be read to refer to the absence of a cause of action for injury&para;<br>caused by economic competition. To the extent the statement might&para;<br>instead be read to suggest a private party does not have standing to&para;<br>raise a Tenth Amendment issue, it is inconsistent with this Court’s&para;<br>later precedents and should be deemed neither controlling nor in&para;<br>structive on the issue of standing as that term is now defined and ap&para;<br>plied. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) Amicus, appointed to defend the judgment, contends that for&para;<br>Bond to argue the National Government has interfered with state&para;<br>sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to assert only a&para;<br>State’s legal rights and interests. But in arguing that the Govern&para;<br>ment has acted in excess of the authority that federalism defines,&para;<br>Bond seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(1) Federalism has more than one dynamic. In allocating powers&para;<br>between the States and National Government, federalism “ ‘secures&para;<br>to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign&para;<br>power,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 181. It enables&para;<br>States to enact positive law in response to the initiative of those who&para;<br>seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times, and it protects&para;<br>the liberty of all persons within a State by ensuring that law enacted&para;<br>in excess of delegated governmental power cannot direct or control&para;<br>their actions. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458. Federal&para;<br>ism’s limitations are not therefore a matter of rights belonging only&para;<br>to the States. In a proper case, a litigant may challenge a law as en&para;<br>acted in contravention of federalism, just as injured individuals may&para;<br>challenge actions that transgress, e.g., separation-of-powers limita&para;<br>tions, see, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919. The claim need not de&para;<br>pend on the vicarious assertion of a State’s constitutional interests,&para;<br>even if those interests are also implicated. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(2) The Government errs in contending that Bond should be&para;<br>permitted to assert only that Congress could not enact the challenged&para;<br>statute under its enumerated powers but that standing should be de&para;<br>nied if she argues that the statute interferes with state sovereignty.&para;<br>Here, Bond asserts that the public policy of the Pennsylvania, en&para;<br>acted in its capacity as sovereign, has been displaced by that of the&para;<br>National Government. The law to which she is subject, the prosecu&para;<br>tion she seeks to counter, and the punishment she must face might&para;<br>not have come about had the matter been left for Pennsylvania to de&para;<br>cide. There is no support for the Government’s proposed distinction&para;<br>between different federalism arguments for purposes of prudential&para;<br>standing rules. The principles of limited national powers and state&para;<br>sovereignty are intertwined. Impermissible interference with state&para;<br>sovereignty is not within the National Government’s enumerated&para;<br>powers, and action exceeding the National Government’s enumerated&para;<br>powers undermines the States’ sovereign interests. Individuals seek&para;<br>ing to challenge such measures are subject to Article III and pruden&para;<br>tial standing rules applicable to all litigants and claims, but here,&para;<br>where the litigant is a party to an otherwise justiciable case or con&para;<br>troversy, she is not forbidden to object that her injury results from&para;<br>disregard of the federal structure of the Government. Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>(c) The Court expresses no view on the merits of Bond’s challenge&para;<br>to the statute’s validity.

She relied on the Tenth&para;<br>Amendment, and, by extension, on the premise that Con­&para;<br>gress exceeded its powers by enacting it in contravention&para;<br>of basic federalism principles. The statute, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§229, was enacted to comply with a treaty; but petitioner&para;<br>contends that, at least in the present instance, the treaty&para;<br>cannot be the source of congressional power to regulate or&para;<br>prohibit her conduct.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals held that because a State was not&para;<br>a party to the federal criminal proceeding, petitioner had&para;<br>no standing to challenge the statute as an infringement&para;<br>upon the powers reserved to the States. Having concluded&para;<br>that petitioner does have standing to challenge the federal&para;<br>statute on these grounds, this Court now reverses that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>determination. The merits of petitioner’s challenge to the&para;<br>statute’s validity are to be considered, in the first instance,&para;<br>by the Court of Appeals on remand and are not addressed&para;<br>in this opinion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case arises from a bitter personal dispute, leading&para;<br>to the criminal acts charged here. Petitioner Carol Anne&para;<br>Bond lived outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After dis­&para;<br>covering that her close friend was pregnant and that&para;<br>the father was Bond’s husband, Bond sought revenge.&para;<br>Bond subjected the woman to a campaign of harassing&para;<br>telephone calls and letters, acts that resulted in a crimi­&para;<br>nal conviction on a minor state charge. Bond persisted in&para;<br>her hostile acts, placing caustic substances on objects the&para;<br>woman was likely to touch, including her mailbox, car&para;<br>door handle, and front doorknob. Bond’s victim suffered a&para;<br>minor burn on her hand and contacted federal investiga­&para;<br>tors, who identified Bond as the perpetrator.&para;<br>Bond was indicted in the United States District Court&para;<br>for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for, among other&para;<br>offenses, two counts of violating §229. Section 229 forbids&para;<br>knowing possession or use of any chemical that “can cause&para;<br>death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to&para;<br>humans or animals” where not intended for a “peaceful&para;<br>purpose.” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8). The statute was en­&para;<br>acted as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention&para;<br>Implementation Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–856, 22&para;<br>U. S. C. §6701 et seq.; 18 U. S. C. §229 et seq. The Act&para;<br>implements provisions of the Convention on the Prohibi­&para;<br>tion of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use&para;<br>of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, a treaty&para;<br>the United States ratified in 1997.&para;<br>In the District Court, Bond moved to dismiss the §229&para;<br>charges, contending the statute was beyond Congress’&para;<br>constitutional authority to enact. The District Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>denied the motion. Bond entered a conditional plea of&para;<br>guilty, reserving the right to appeal the ruling on the&para;<br>validity of the statute. She was sentenced to six years in&para;<br>prison.&para;<br>In the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Bond&para;<br>renewed her challenge to the statute, citing, among other&para;<br>authorities, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals asked for supplemental briefs on the&para;<br>question whether Bond had standing to raise the Tenth&para;<br>Amendment as a ground for invalidating a federal statute&para;<br>in the absence of a State’s participation in the proceedings.&para;<br>In its supplemental brief in the Court of Appeals, the&para;<br>Government took the position that Bond did not have&para;<br>standing. The Court of Appeals agreed. 581 F. 3d 128&para;<br>(2009).&para;<br>When Bond sought certiorari, the Government advised&para;<br>this Court that it had changed its position and that, in its&para;<br>view, Bond does have standing to challenge the constitu­&para;<br>tionality of §229 on Tenth Amendment grounds. See Brief&para;<br>for United States (filed July 9, 2010). The Court granted&para;<br>certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), and appointed an amicus&para;<br>curiae to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>Stephen McAllister, a member of the bar of this Court,&para;<br>filed an amicus brief and presented an oral argument that&para;<br>have been of considerable assistance to the Court.&para;<br>II&para;<br>To conclude that petitioner lacks standing to challenge&para;<br>a federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes&para;<br>with the powers reserved to States, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>relied on a single sentence from this Court’s opinion in&para;<br>Tennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118 (1939).&para;<br>See 581 F. 3d, at 136–138. As the Court of Appeals noted&para;<br>here, other Courts of Appeals have taken a similar ap­&para;<br>proach. E.g., United States v. Hacker, 565 F.3d 522, 525–&para;<br>527 (CA8 2009); Oregon v. Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F. 3d&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>965, 971–972 (CA9 2009); Brooklyn Legal Servs. Corp. v.&para;<br>Legal Servs. Corp., 462 F. 3d 219, 234–235 (CA2 2006);&para;<br>Medeiros v. Vincent, 431 F. 3d 25, 33–36 (CA1 2005);&para;<br>United States v. Parker, 362 F. 3d 1279, 1284–1285 (CA10&para;<br>2004). That approach is in tension, if not conflict, with&para;<br>decisions of some other Courts of Appeals. See Gillespie v.&para;<br>Indianapolis, 185 F. 3d 693, 700–704 (CA7 1999); Metro&para;<br>lina Family Practice Group, P. A. v. Sullivan, 767 F. Supp.&para;<br>1314 (WDNC 1989), aff’d 929 F. 2d 693 (CA4 1991); At&para;<br>lanta Gas Light Co. v. United States Dept. of Energy, 666&para;<br>F. 2d 1359, 1368, n. 16 (CA11 1982); see also United States&para;<br>v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 918–921 (CA5 2011) (reserving&para;<br>issue); Lomont v. O’Neill, 285 F. 3d 9, 14, n. 5 (CADC&para;<br>2002) (same); Nance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 716 (CA9&para;<br>1981) (same).&para;<br>Tennessee Electric is the appropriate place to begin. It&para;<br>should be clear that Tennessee Electric does not cast doubt&para;<br>on Bond’s standing for purposes of Article III’s case-or­&para;<br>controversy requirement. This Court long ago disap­&para;<br>proved of the case as authoritative respecting Article III&para;<br>limitations. Association of Data Processing Service Or&para;<br>ganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 152–154 (1970).&para;<br>In the instant case, moreover, it is apparent—and in&para;<br>fact conceded not only by the Government but also by&para;<br>amicus—that Article III poses no barrier. One who seeks&para;<br>to initiate or continue proceedings in federal court must&para;<br>demonstrate, among other requirements, both standing to&para;<br>obtain the relief requested, see Lujan v. Defenders of&para;<br>Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561 (1992), and, in addition,&para;<br>an “ongoing interest in the dispute” on the part of the&para;<br>opposing party that is sufficient to establish “concrete&para;<br>adverseness.” Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). When&para;<br>those conditions are met, Article III does not restrict the&para;<br>opposing party’s ability to object to relief being sought at&para;<br>its expense. The requirement of Article III standing thus&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>had no bearing upon Bond’s capacity to assert defenses in&para;<br>the District Court. As for Bond’s standing to appeal, it is&para;<br>clear Article III’s prerequisites are met. Bond’s challenge&para;<br>to her conviction and sentence “satisfies the case-or­&para;<br>controversy requirement, because the incarceration . . .&para;<br>constitutes a concrete injury, caused by the conviction and&para;<br>redressable by invalidation of the conviction.” Spencer v.&para;<br>Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 7 (1998).&para;<br>To resolve the case, this Court must consider next&para;<br>whether Tennessee Electric is irrelevant with respect to&para;<br>prudential rules of standing as well. The question in&para;<br>Tennessee Electric was whether a group of private power&para;<br>companies could bring suit to enjoin the federally char­&para;<br>tered Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing&para;<br>and selling electric power. It was conceded that competi­&para;<br>tion from the TVA would “inflict substantial damage” upon&para;<br>the power companies. 306 U. S., at 137. According to the&para;<br>companies, the federal statute authorizing the creation&para;<br>and operation of the TVA was invalid because, among&para;<br>other reasons, it exceeded the powers of the National&para;<br>Government in violation of the Tenth Amendment.&para;<br>Declining to reach the merits, the Court concluded the&para;<br>power companies’ lawsuit should be dismissed. It ex­&para;<br>plained that the suit was premised on the principle that a&para;<br>person threatened with injury by conduct “which, but for&para;<br>statutory authority for its performance, would be a viola­&para;<br>tion of his legal rights” could request an injunction from a&para;<br>court of equity and by this means test the validity of the&para;<br>statute. Ibid. But the Court concluded that the TVA,&para;<br>even if it were shorn of congressional statutory authority,&para;<br>had done nothing more than compete as a supplier of&para;<br>electricity. Id., at 138. And since state law did not pur­&para;<br>port to grant any of the power companies a monopoly,&para;<br>there was no basis for a suit in which the TVA might be&para;<br>forced to invoke its congressional authorization. Id., at&para;<br>138–143.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In that part of its analysis, and throughout its opinion,&para;<br>the Tennessee Electric Court stated that the problem with&para;<br>the power companies’ suit was a lack of “standing” or a&para;<br>“cause of action.” It treated those concepts as inter­&para;<br>changeable. E.g., id., at 139 (no “standing” because no&para;<br>“legal cause of complaint”); id., at 139–140 (no “standing”&para;<br>without “a cause of action or a right to sue”); id., at 142&para;<br>(“no standing,” no “right to sue for an injunction”); id.,&para;<br>at 144 (no Tenth Amendment “standing” and no Ninth&para;<br>Amendment “cause of action” for same reasons); see also&para;<br>Bellia, Article III and the Cause of Action, 89 Iowa L. Rev.&para;<br>777, 826–830 (2004).&para;<br>Even though decisions since Tennessee Electric have&para;<br>been careful to use the terms “cause of action” and “stand­&para;<br>ing” with more precision, the distinct concepts can be&para;<br>difficult to keep separate. If, for instance, the person&para;<br>alleging injury is remote from the zone of interests a stat­&para;<br>ute protects, whether there is a legal injury at all and&para;<br>whether the particular litigant is one who may assert it&para;<br>can involve similar inquiries. Steel Co. v. Citizens for&para;<br>Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 96–97, and n. 2 (1998)&para;<br>(noting that statutory standing and the existence of a&para;<br>cause of action are “closely connected” and “sometimes&para;<br>identical” questions).&para;<br>Still, the question whether a plaintiff states a claim for&para;<br>relief “goes to the merits” in the typical case, not the justi­&para;<br>ciability of a dispute, id., at 92, and conflation of the two&para;<br>concepts can cause confusion. This is the case with the&para;<br>Tenth Amendment discussion in Tennessee Electric. The&para;<br>Tennessee Electric Court noted that “[a] distinct ground&para;<br>upon which standing to maintain the suit is said to rest is&para;<br>that the acts of the Authority cannot be upheld without&para;<br>permitting federal regulation of purely local matters re­&para;<br>served to the states or the people by the Tenth Amend­&para;<br>ment.” 306 U. S., at 143. The Court rejected the argu­&para;<br>ment, however, concluding the Tenth Amendment did not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>give one business a right to keep another from competing. Id., at 144. (“The sale of government property in&para;<br>competition with others is not a violation of the Tenth&para;<br>Amendment”).&para;<br>The Court then added the sentence upon which the&para;<br>Court of Appeals relied in the instant case, the sentence&para;<br>that has been the source of disagreement among Courts of&para;<br>Appeals:&para;<br>“As we have seen there is no objection to the Author­&para;<br>ity’s operations by the states, and, if this were not so,&para;<br>the appellants, absent the states or their officers, have&para;<br>no standing in this suit to raise any question under&para;<br>the amendment.” Ibid.&para;<br>The quoted statement was in the context of a decision&para;<br>which held that business competitors had no legal injury,&para;<br>and the word standing can be interpreted in that sense.&para;<br>On this reading, the statement reiterated an earlier point.&para;<br>The statement explained that the States in which the TVA&para;<br>operated exempted it from their public utilities regula­&para;<br>tions; and that even if the States had not done so and the&para;<br>TVA had violated those regulations, the regulations were&para;<br>for the States to enforce. See id., at 141–142. They con­&para;<br>ferred no private right of action on business competitors.&para;<br>This reading is consistent with the Tennessee Electric&para;<br>Court’s use of the term “standing” elsewhere in its opinion&para;<br>to refer to the existence of a state-law cause of action. A&para;<br>holding that state utilities regulations did not supply a&para;<br>cause of action against a competitor is of no relevance to&para;<br>the instant case, and we need not explore all of its implica­&para;<br>tions. See also Data Processing, 397 U. S., at 157–158&para;<br>(cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §702, permits suit based on injury from business&para;<br>competition).&para;<br>Yet the quoted statement also could be read to refer to&para;<br>standing in the sense of whether the power companies&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>were the proper litigants to raise a Tenth Amendment is­&para;<br>sue. To the extent that might have been the intention of&para;<br>the Tennessee Electric Court, it is, for reasons to be ex­&para;<br>plained, inconsistent with our later precedents. The sen­&para;<br>tence from Tennessee Electric that we have quoted and&para;<br>discussed should be deemed neither controlling nor in­&para;<br>structive on the issue of standing as that term is now&para;<br>defined and applied.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Amicus contends that federal courts should not adjudi­&para;<br>cate a claim like Bond’s because of the prudential rule that&para;<br>a party “generally must assert his own legal rights and&para;<br>interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal&para;<br>rights or interests of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422&para;<br>U. S. 490, 499, 500 (1975); see also Kowalski v. Tesmer,&para;<br>543 U. S. 125, 129–130 (2004). In amicus’ view, to argue&para;<br>that the National Government has interfered with state&para;<br>sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to&para;<br>assert the legal rights and interests of States and States&para;<br>alone. That, however, is not so. As explained below, Bond&para;<br>seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. The&para;<br>individual, in a proper case, can assert injury from gov­&para;<br>ernmental action taken in excess of the authority that&para;<br>federalism defines. Her rights in this regard do not belong&para;<br>to a State.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The federal system rests on what might at first seem a&para;<br>counterintuitive insight, that “freedom is enhanced by the&para;<br>creation of two governments, not one.” Alden v. Maine,&para;<br>527 U. S. 706, 758 (1999). The Framers concluded that&para;<br>allocation of powers between the National Government&para;<br>and the States enhances freedom, first by protecting the&para;<br>integrity of the governments themselves, and second by&para;<br>protecting the people, from whom all governmental powers&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>are derived.&para;<br>Federalism has more than one dynamic. It is true that&para;<br>the federal structure serves to grant and delimit the pre­&para;<br>rogatives and responsibilities of the States and the Na­&para;<br>tional Government vis-à-vis one another. The allocation&para;<br>of powers in our federal system preserves the integrity,&para;<br>dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States. The fed­&para;<br>eral balance is, in part, an end in itself, to ensure that&para;<br>States function as political entities in their own right.&para;<br>But that is not its exclusive sphere of operation. Feder­&para;<br>alism is more than an exercise in setting the boundary&para;<br>between different institutions of government for their own&para;<br>integrity. “State sovereignty is not just an end in itself:&para;<br>‘Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that&para;<br>derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.’ ” New York v.&para;<br>United States, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (quoting Coleman&para;<br>v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759 (1991) (Blackmun, J.,&para;<br>dissenting)).&para;<br>Some of these liberties are of a political character. The&para;<br>federal structure allows local policies “more sensitive to&para;<br>the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society,” permits&para;<br>“innovation and experimentation,” enables greater citizen&para;<br>“involvement in democratic processes,” and makes gov­&para;<br>ernment “more responsive by putting the States in com­&para;<br>petition for a mobile citizenry.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501&para;<br>U. S. 452, 458 (1991). Federalism secures the freedom of&para;<br>the individual. It allows States to respond, through the&para;<br>enactment of positive law, to the initiative of those who&para;<br>seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times&para;<br>without having to rely solely upon the political processes&para;<br>that control a remote central power. True, of course, these&para;<br>objects cannot be vindicated by the Judiciary in the ab­&para;<br>sence of a proper case or controversy; but the individual&para;<br>liberty secured by federalism is not simply derivative of&para;<br>the rights of the States.&para;<br>Federalism also protects the liberty of all persons within&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a State by ensuring that laws enacted in excess of dele­&para;<br>gated governmental power cannot direct or control their&para;<br>actions. See ibid. By denying any one government com­&para;<br>plete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, feder­&para;<br>alism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary&para;<br>power. When government acts in excess of its lawful&para;<br>powers, that liberty is at stake.&para;<br>The limitations that federalism entails are not therefore&para;<br>a matter of rights belonging only to the States. States are&para;<br>not the sole intended beneficiaries of federalism. See New&para;<br>York, supra, at 181. An individual has a direct interest in&para;<br>objecting to laws that upset the constitutional balance&para;<br>between the National Government and the States when&para;<br>the enforcement of those laws causes injury that is con­&para;<br>crete, particular, and redressable. Fidelity to principles of&para;<br>federalism is not for the States alone to vindicate.&para;<br>The recognition of an injured person’s standing to object&para;<br>to a violation of a constitutional principle that allocates&para;<br>power within government is illustrated, in an analogous&para;<br>context, by cases in which individuals sustain discrete,&para;<br>justiciable injury from actions that transgress separation­&para;<br>of-powers limitations. Separation-of-powers principles are&para;<br>intended, in part, to protect each branch of government&para;<br>from incursion by the others. Yet the dynamic between&para;<br>and among the branches is not the only object of the Con­&para;<br>stitution’s concern. The structural principles secured by&para;<br>the separation of powers protect the individual as well.&para;<br>In the precedents of this Court, the claims of individu­&para;<br>als—not of Government departments—have been the&para;<br>principal source of judicial decisions concerning separation&para;<br>of powers and checks and balances. For example, the re­&para;<br>quirement that a bill enacted by Congress be presented&para;<br>to the President for signature before it can become law&para;<br>gives the President a check over Congress’ exercise of&para;<br>legislative power. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §7. Yet indi­&para;<br>viduals, too, are protected by the operations of separation&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of powers and checks and balances; and they are not dis­&para;<br>abled from relying on those principles in otherwise justici­&para;<br>able cases and controversies. In INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.&para;<br>919 (1983), it was an individual who successfully chal­&para;<br>lenged the so-called legislative veto—a procedure that&para;<br>Congress used in an attempt to invalidate an executive&para;<br>determination without presenting the measure to the&para;<br>President. The procedure diminished the role of the Ex­&para;<br>ecutive, but the challenger sought to protect not the&para;<br>prerogatives of the Presidency as such but rather his&para;<br>own right to avoid deportation under an invalid order.&para;<br>Chadha’s challenge was sustained. A cardinal principle of&para;<br>separation of powers was vindicated at the insistence of an&para;<br>individual, indeed one who was not a citizen of the United&para;<br>States but who still was a person whose liberty was at&para;<br>risk.&para;<br>Chadha is not unique in this respect. Compare Clinton&para;<br>v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 433–436 (1998) (injured&para;<br>parties have standing to challenge Presidential line-item&para;<br>veto) with Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 829–830 (1997)&para;<br>(Congress Members do not); see also, e.g., Free Enterprise&para;<br>Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010); Plaut v.

If the constitutional&para;<br>structure of our Government that protects individual&para;<br>liberty is compromised, individuals who suffer otherwise&para;<br>justiciable injury may object.&para;<br>Just as it is appropriate for an individual, in a proper&para;<br>case, to invoke separation-of-powers or checks-and­&para;<br>balances constraints, so too may a litigant, in a proper&para;<br>case, challenge a law as enacted in contravention of consti­&para;<br>tutional principles of federalism. That claim need not&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>depend on the vicarious assertion of a State’s constitu­&para;<br>tional interests, even if a State’s constitutional interests&para;<br>are also implicated.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In this regard it is necessary to address a misconception&para;<br>in the position the Government now urges this Court to&para;<br>adopt. As noted, the Government agrees that petitioner&para;<br>has standing to challenge the validity of §229. That con­&para;<br>cession, however, depends on describing petitioner’s claim&para;<br>in a narrow way. The Government contends petitioner&para;<br>asserts only that Congress could not enact the challenged&para;<br>statute under its enumerated powers. Were she to argue,&para;<br>the Government insists, that the statute “interferes with a&para;<br>specific aspect of state sovereignty,” either instead of or in&para;<br>addition to her enumerated powers contention, the Court&para;<br>should deny her standing. Brief for United States 18 (filed&para;<br>Dec. 3, 2010).&para;<br>The premise that petitioner does or should avoid making&para;<br>an “interference-with-sovereignty” argument is flawed.&para;<br>Id., at 33. Here she asserts, for example, that the conduct&para;<br>with which she is charged is “local in nature” and “should&para;<br>be left to local authorities to prosecute” and that congres­&para;<br>sional regulation of that conduct “signals a massive and&para;<br>unjustifiable expansion of federal law enforcement into&para;<br>state-regulated domain.” Record in No. 2:07–cr–00528–&para;<br>JG–1 (ED Pa.), Doc. 27, pp. 6, 19. The public policy of the&para;<br>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, enacted in its capacity as&para;<br>sovereign, has been displaced by that of the National&para;<br>Government. The law to which petitioner is subject, the&para;<br>prosecution she seeks to counter, and the punishment she&para;<br>must face might not have come about if the matter were&para;<br>left for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to decide.&para;<br>Indeed, petitioner argues that under Pennsylvania law the&para;<br>expected maximum term of imprisonment she could have&para;<br>received for the same conduct was barely more than a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The principles of limited national powers and state sovereignty are&para;<br>intertwined. While neither originates in the Tenth Amend­&para;<br>ment, both are expressed by it. Impermissible interfer­&para;<br>ence with state sovereignty is not within the enumerated&para;<br>powers of the National Government, see New York, 505&para;<br>U. S., at 155–159, and action that exceeds the National&para;<br>Government’s enumerated powers undermines the sover­&para;<br>eign interests of States. See United States v. Lopez, 514&para;<br>U. S. 549, 564 (1995). The unconstitutional action can&para;<br>cause concomitant injury to persons in individual cases.&para;<br>An individual who challenges federal action on these&para;<br>grounds is, of course, subject to the Article III require­&para;<br>ments, as well as prudential rules, applicable to all liti­&para;<br>gants and claims. Individuals have “no standing to com­&para;<br>plain simply that their Government is violating the law.”&para;<br>Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984). It is not&para;<br>enough that a litigant “suffers in some indefinite way in&para;<br>common with people generally.” Frothingham v. Mellon,&para;<br>262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923) (decided with Massachusetts v.&para;<br>Mellon). If, in connection with the claim being asserted, a&para;<br>litigant who commences suit fails to show actual or immi­&para;<br>nent harm that is concrete and particular, fairly traceable&para;<br>to the conduct complained of, and likely to be redressed by&para;<br>a favorable decision, the Federal Judiciary cannot hear the&para;<br>claim. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561. These requirements&para;<br>must be satisfied before an individual may assert a consti­&para;<br>tutional claim; and in some instances, the result may be&para;<br>that a State is the only entity capable of demonstrating&para;<br>the requisite injury.&para;<br>In this case, however, where the litigant is a party to an&para;<br>otherwise justiciable case or controversy, she is not forbid­&para;<br>den to object that her injury results from disregard of the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal structure of our Government. Whether the Tenth&para;<br>Amendment is regarded as simply a “ ‘truism,’ ” New York,&para;<br>supra, at 156 (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U.

Bond, like any other defendant,&para;<br>has a personal right not to be convicted under a constitu&para;<br>tionally invalid law. See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial&para;<br>Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev.&para;<br>1321, 1331–1333 (2000); Monaghan, Overbreadth, 1981&para;<br>Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 3. See also North Carolina v. Pearce, 395&para;<br>U. S. 711, 739 (1969) (Black, J., concurring in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part) (“Due process . . . is a guarantee that a&para;<br>man should be tried and convicted only in accordance with&para;<br>valid laws of the land.”).&para;<br>In this case, Bond argues that the statute under which&para;<br>she was charged, 18 U. S. C. §229, exceeds Congress’&para;<br>enumerated powers and violates the Tenth Amendment.&para;<br>Other defendants might assert that a law exceeds Con&para;<br>gress’ power because it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,&para;<br>or the Establishment Clause, or the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>Whatever the claim, success on the merits would require&para;<br>reversal of the conviction. “An offence created by [an&para;<br>unconstitutional law],” the Court has held, “is not a&para;<br>crime.” Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 376 (1880). “A&para;<br>conviction under [such a law] is not merely erroneous, but&para;<br>is illegal and void, and cannot be a legal cause of impris&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>onment.” Id., at 376–377. If a law is invalid as applied to&para;<br>the criminal defendant’s conduct, the defendant is entitled&para;<br>to go free.&para;<br>For this reason, a court has no “prudential” license to&para;<br>decline to consider whether the statute under which the&para;<br>defendant has been charged lacks constitutional applica&para;<br>tion to her conduct. And that is so even where the consti&para;<br>tutional provision that would render the conviction void is&para;<br>directed at protecting a party not before the Court. Our&para;<br>decisions concerning criminal laws infected with discrimi&para;<br>nation are illustrative. The Court must entertain the&para;<br>objection—and reverse the conviction—even if the right to&para;<br>equal treatment resides in someone other than the de&para;<br>fendant. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 452–455&para;<br>(1972) (reversing conviction for distributing contraceptives&para;<br>because the law banning distribution violated the recipi&para;<br>ent’s right to equal protection); cf. Craig v. Boren, 429&para;<br>U. S. 190, 192, 210, and n. 24 (1976) (law penalizing sale&para;<br>of beer to males but not females aged 18 to 20 could not&para;<br>be enforced against vendor). See also Grayned v. City of&para;<br>Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 107, n. 2 (1972); Welsh v. United&para;<br>States, 398 U. S. 333, 361–362 (1970) (Harlan, J., concur&para;<br>ring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward,&para;<br>Congress would cure the unequal treatment by extending&para;<br>rather than invalidating the criminal proscription).&para;<br>In short, a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any&para;<br>reason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S.&para;<br>332, 341 (1928). The validity of Bond’s conviction depends&para;<br>upon whether the Constitution permits Congress to enact&para;<br>§229. Her claim that it does not must be considered and&para;<br>decided on the merits.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
