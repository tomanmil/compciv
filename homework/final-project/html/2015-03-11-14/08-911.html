S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). A regulation, amended&para;<br>just months before IIRIRA’s enactment, provides that “[t]he decision&para;<br>to grant or deny a motion to reopen . . . is within the discretion of the&para;<br>[Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)],” 8 CFR §1003.2(a). As adjudi&para;<br>cator in immigration cases, the BIA exercises authority delegated by&para;<br>the Attorney General.&para;<br>Petitioner Kucana moved to reopen his removal proceedings, as&para;<br>serting new evidence in support of his plea for asylum. An Immigra&para;<br>tion Judge denied the motion, and the BIA sustained that ruling.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review&para;<br>the administrative determination, holding that §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars&para;<br>judicial review not only of administrative decisions made discretion&para;<br>ary by statute, but also of those made discretionary by regulation.&para;<br>Held: Section 1252(a)(2)(B)’s proscription of judicial review applies only&para;<br>to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute,&para;<br>not to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General&para;<br>himself through regulation. Pp. 6–18.&para;<br>(a) The motion to reopen is an “important safeguard” intended “to&para;<br>ensure a proper and lawful disposition” of immigration proceedings.&para;<br>Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___. Federal-court review of adminis&para;<br>trative decisions denying motions to reopen removal proceedings&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KUCANA v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>dates back to at least 1916, with the courts employing a deferential&para;<br>abuse-of-discretion standard of review. While the Attorney General’s&para;<br>regulation in point, 8 CFR §1003.2(a), places the reopening decision&para;<br>within the BIA’s discretion, the statute does not codify that prescrip&para;<br>tion or otherwise “specif[y]” that such decisions are in the Attorney&para;<br>General’s discretion. Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>(b) Section 1252(a)(2)(B) does not proscribe judicial review of deni&para;<br>als of motions to reopen. Pp. 8–16.&para;<br>(1) The amicus defending the Seventh Circuit’s judgment urges&para;<br>that regulations suffice to trigger §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s proscription.&para;<br>She comprehends “under” in “authority . . . specified under this sub&para;<br>chapter” to mean, e.g., “pursuant to,” “subordinate to.” Administra&para;<br>tive regulations count for §1252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, be&para;<br>cause they are issued “pursuant to,” and are measures “subordinate&para;<br>to,” the legislation they serve to implement. On that reading,&para;<br>§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an&para;<br>executive regulation places within the BIA’s discretion, including the&para;<br>decision to deny a motion to reopen. The parties, on the other hand,&para;<br>read the statutory language to mean “specified in,” or “specified by,”&para;<br>the subchapter. On their reading, §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judi&para;<br>cial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary&para;<br>character of the Attorney General’s authority. Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>(2) The word “under” “has many dictionary definitions and must&para;<br>draw its meaning from its context.” Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129,&para;<br>135. Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the par&para;<br>ties’ position stands on firmer ground. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far&para;<br>from IIRIRA’s only jurisdictional limitation. It is sandwiched be&para;<br>tween two subsections, §1252(a)(2)(A) and §1252(a)(2)(C), both de&para;<br>pendent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define&para;<br>their scope. Given §1252(a)(2)(B)’s statutory placement, one would&para;<br>expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(3) Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review&para;<br>category “any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section&para;<br>1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.” Each of the referenced&para;<br>statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief&para;<br>from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is&para;<br>entrusted to the Attorney General’s discretion. Clause (i) does not re&para;<br>fer to any regulatory provision. The proximity of clause (i) and the&para;<br>clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking them—“any other deci&para;<br>sion”—suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same&para;<br>genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Read harmoni&para;<br>ously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of dis&para;<br>cretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney&para;<br>General’s discretionary authority in the statute. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(4) Also significant is the character of the decisions insulated&para;<br>from judicial review in §1252(a)(2)(B)(i). The listed determinations&para;<br>are substantive decisions the Executive makes involving whether or&para;<br>not aliens can stay in the country. Other decisions specified by stat&para;<br>ute “to be in the discretion of the Attorney General,” and therefore&para;<br>shielded from court oversight by §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.&para;<br>See, e.g., §1157(c)(1). Decisions on reopening motions made discre&para;<br>tionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings. A court deci&para;<br>sion reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the&para;<br>Executive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches&para;<br>and concerns only the question whether the alien’s claims have been&para;<br>accorded a reasonable hearing. Had Congress wanted the jurisdic&para;<br>tional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regu&para;<br>lation as well as by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have&para;<br>said so, as it did in provisions enacted simultaneously with&para;<br>§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). See, e.g., IIRIRA, §213, 110 Stat. 3009–572.&para;<br>Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>(5) The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates&para;<br>this determination. Attorney General regulations have long ad&para;<br>dressed reopening requests. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress simulta&para;<br>neously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to&para;<br>bar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding re&para;<br>moval. But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the&para;<br>BIA discretion to grant or deny reopening motions. This legislative&para;<br>silence indicates that Congress left the matter where it was preIIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney&para;<br>General, “to grant or deny a motion to reopen,” 8 CFR §1003.2(a), but&para;<br>courts retain jurisdiction to review the BIA’s decision. It is unsur&para;<br>prising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this&para;<br>“important [procedural] safeguard,” Dada, 554 U. S., at ___, where,&para;<br>as here, the alien’s underlying asylum claim would itself be review&para;<br>able. The REAL ID Act of 2005, which further amended the INA by&para;<br>adding or reformulating provisions on asylum, protection from re&para;<br>moval, and even judicial review, did not disturb the unbroken line of&para;<br>decisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions&para;<br>to reopen. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(c) Any lingering doubt about §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s proper interpreta&para;<br>tion would be dispelled by a familiar statutory construction principle:&para;<br>the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.&para;<br>When a statute is “reasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta&para;<br>tion,” this Court adopts the reading “that executive determinations&para;<br>generally are subject to judicial review.” Gutierrez de Martinez v.&para;<br>Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434. The Court has consistently applied&para;<br>this interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and par&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KUCANA v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ticularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court ju&para;<br>risdiction. See, e.g., Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S.&para;<br>43, 63–64. Because this presumption is “ ‘well-settled,’ ” ibid., the&para;<br>Court assumes that “Congress legislates with knowledge of” it,&para;<br>McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496. It there&para;<br>fore takes “ ‘ “clear and convincing evidence” ’ ” to dislodge the pre&para;<br>sumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 64. There is no&para;<br>such evidence here. Finally, reading §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to&para;<br>matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would&para;<br>ignore Congress’ design to retain for itself control over federal-court&para;<br>jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit’s construction would free the Ex&para;<br>ecutive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate&para;<br>court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions&para;<br>“discretionary.” Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can&para;<br>not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the motion,&para;<br>the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) sus&para;<br>tained the IJ’s ruling, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to&para;<br>review the administrative determination. For that conclu&para;<br>sion, the court relied on a provision added to the Immigra&para;<br>tion and Nationality Act (INA or Act), 66 Stat. 166, 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1101 et seq., by the Illegal Immigration Reform&para;<br>and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110&para;<br>Stat. 3009–546. The provision found dispositive by the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit, 8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B), states that no&para;<br>court shall have jurisdiction to review any action of the&para;<br>Attorney General “the authority for which is specified&para;<br>under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attor&para;<br>ney General,” §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).&para;<br>We granted certiorari to decide whether the proscription&para;<br>of judicial review stated in §1252(a)(2)(B) applies not only&para;<br>to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KUCANA v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>statute, but also to determinations declared discretionary&para;<br>by the Attorney General himself through regulation. We&para;<br>hold that the key words “specified under this subchapter”&para;<br>refer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications. We&para;<br>so rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial&para;<br>review of administrative rulings on reopening motions, the&para;<br>text and context of §1252(a)(2)(B), and the history of the&para;<br>relevant statutory provisions. We take account, as well, of&para;<br>the “presumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to]&para;<br>allow judicial review of administrative action.” Reno v.&para;<br>Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 63–64 (1993)&para;<br>(quoting McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S.&para;<br>479, 496 (1991)). Separation-of-powers concerns, more&para;<br>over, caution us against reading legislation, absent clear&para;<br>statement, to place in executive hands authority to remove&para;<br>cases from the Judiciary’s domain.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In IIRIRA, Congress for the first time codified certain&para;<br>rules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney General, govern&para;<br>ing the reopening process. The amended Act instructs&para;<br>that reopening motions “shall state the new facts that will&para;<br>be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,&para;<br>and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary&para;<br>material.” §1229a(c)(7)(B). Congress also prescribed that&para;<br>“the motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the&para;<br>date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.”&para;<br>§1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Among matters excepted from the 90&para;<br>day limitation are motions to reopen asylum applications&para;<br>because of changed conditions in the country of nationality&para;<br>or removal. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).&para;<br>Section 1252(a)(2), captioned “Matters not subject to&para;<br>judicial review,” contains the provision on which this case&para;<br>turns.

Some courts confronting that question have&para;<br>refused to consider petitions for review of a reopening denial that seeks&para;<br>to revisit the denial of the underlying claim; they have reasoned that&para;<br>hearing the petition would end-run the bar to review of the petitioner’s&para;<br>core claim.

If the Seventh Circuit’s&para;<br>construction of §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) were to prevail, the Ex&para;<br>ecutive would have a free hand to shelter its own decisions&para;<br>from abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by&para;<br>issuing a regulation declaring those decisions “discretion&para;<br>ary.” Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can&para;<br>not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.&para;<br>V&para;<br>A statute affecting federal jurisdiction “must be con&para;<br>strued both with precision and with fidelity to the terms&para;<br>by which Congress has expressed its wishes.” Cheng Fan&para;<br>Kwok v.

As we have noted,&para;<br>see supra, at 14, and as amicus emphasizes, “many provi&para;<br>sions of IIRIRA [we]re aimed at protecting [from court&para;<br>review exercises of] the Executive’s discretion.” AmericanArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.

The controlling statutory provision, 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), states that “no court shall have&para;<br>jurisdiction to review . . . any . . . decision . . . of the Attor&para;<br>ney General . . . the authority for which is specified under&para;<br>this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney&para;<br>General.” (Emphasis added.) The phrase “under this&para;<br>subchapter” refers to Subchapter II of Chapter 12 of Title&para;<br>8, 8 U. S. C. §§1151–1381, see ante, at 3, n. 3, and, as the&para;<br>Court notes, no provision of Subchapter II confers discre&para;<br>tionary authority on the Attorney General to decide mo&para;<br>tions to reopen. See ante, at 7–8, 14–15. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals, however, held that the Attorney General’s deci&para;<br>sion in this case was unreviewable because a regulation, 8&para;<br>CFR §1003.2(a) (2009), made that decision discretionary.&para;<br>If this regulation had been promulgated pursuant to&para;<br>authority conferred by a provision of Subchapter II, we&para;<br>would have to confront the question that the opinion of the&para;<br>Court addresses. But it seems clear that 8 CFR §1003.2,&para;<br>at least insofar as it gave the Attorney General the discre&para;<br>tionary authority that he exercised in this case, is&para;<br>grounded on authority conferred under Subchapter I of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KUCANA v. HOLDER&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Chapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S. C. §§1101–1107. See 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1103(a) (1994 ed.) (giving the Attorney General&para;<br>the authority to “establish such regulations . . . as he&para;<br>deems necessary for carrying out his authority under&para;<br>[Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the U. S. Code]”).&para;<br>The amicus curiae whom we appointed to defend the&para;<br>decision of the Court of Appeals has attempted to link 8&para;<br>CFR §1003.2 to Subchapter II. She notes that the Attor&para;<br>ney General, in promulgating that regulation, cited not&para;<br>only 8 U. S. C. §1103(a), but also a provision of Subchapter&para;<br>II, 8 U. S. C. §1252b (1994 ed.). See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900,&para;<br>18904 (1996).1 This latter statutory provision2 conferred&para;<br>the authority to reopen a narrow set of deportation orders,&para;<br>i.e., those issued after the alien failed to appear at the&para;<br>deportation hearing. Although this statutory provision&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Two&para;<br>&para;<br>other provisions in Subchapter II refer to motions to reopen,&para;<br>but both were enacted after the implementation of 8 CFR §1003.2&para;<br>(2009), and therefore that regulation cannot be said to implement these&para;<br>provisions. See ante 7, n. 9. Title 8 U. S. C. §1229a(c)(7), which ad&para;<br>dresses the procedural requirements for filing such a motion, and&para;<br>§1252(b)(6), which requires consolidation of a motion to reopen with the&para;<br>underlying removal order, were enacted as part of the Illegal Immigra&para;<br>tion Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) in&para;<br>September 1996 and made effective in April 1997. See 110 Stat. 3009–&para;<br>593, 3009–609. Prior to that time, the consolidation provision was&para;<br>found in Subchapter I. See 8 U. S. C. §1105(a)(6) (1994 ed.).&para;<br>2 This provision conferred the authority to rescind a deportation order&para;<br>“upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the&para;<br>order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear&para;<br>was because of exceptional circumstances . . . or upon a motion to&para;<br>reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not&para;<br>receive notice . . . or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in&para;<br>Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the&para;<br>alien.” 8 U. S. C. §1252b(c)(3) (1994 ed.).&para;<br>A similar provision, enacted as part of IIRIRA, is now contained in 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1229a(b)(5)(C) (2006 ed.). As the Government notes, this&para;<br>provision does not apply in this case because petitioner challenges the&para;<br>denial of his second motion to reopen, which the parties agree is gov&para;<br>erned by §1229a(c)(7).
