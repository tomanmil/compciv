SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–834.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 13, 2010—Decided March 22, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Kasten brought an antiretaliation suit against his former&para;<br>employer, respondent (Saint-Gobain), under the Fair Labor Stan&para;<br>dards Act of 1938 (Act), which provides minimum wage, maximum&para;<br>hour, and overtime pay rules; and which forbids employers “to dis&para;<br>charge . . . any employee because such employee has filed any com&para;<br>plaint” alleging a violation of the Act, 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3). In a re&para;<br>lated suit, the District Court found that Saint-Gobain violated the&para;<br>Act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from&para;<br>receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing work&para;<br>related protective gear. In this suit Kasten claims that he was dis&para;<br>charged because he orally complained to company officials about the&para;<br>timeclocks. The District Court granted Saint-Gobain summary&para;<br>judgment, concluding that the Act’s antiretaliation provision did not&para;<br>cover oral complaints. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The scope of statutory term “filed any complaint” includes oral, as&para;<br>well as written, complaints. Pp. 4–15.&para;<br>(a) The interpretation of the statutory phrase “depends upon read&para;<br>ing the whole statutory text, considering the [statute’s] purpose and&para;<br>context . . . , and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform&para;<br>the analysis.” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486. The text,&para;<br>taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer here. Some diction&para;<br>ary definitions of “filed” contemplate a writing while others permit&para;<br>using “file” in conjunction with oral material. In addition to diction&para;<br>ary definitions, state statutes and federal regulations sometimes con&para;<br>template oral filings, and contemporaneous judicial usage shows that&para;<br>oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the Act’s pas&para;<br>sage. Even if “filed,” considered alone, might suggest a narrow inter&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>pretation limited to writings, “any complaint” suggests a broad inter&para;<br>pretation that would include an oral complaint. Thus, the three-word&para;<br>phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question. The&para;<br>Act’s other references to “filed” also do not resolve the linguistic ques&para;<br>tion. Some of those provisions involve filed material that is virtually&para;<br>always in writing; others specifically require a writing, and the re&para;<br>mainder, like the provision here, leave the oral/written question un&para;<br>resolved. Since “filed any complaint” lends itself linguistically to the&para;<br>broader, “oral” interpretation, the use of broader language in other&para;<br>statutes’ antiretaliation provisions does not indicate whether Con&para;<br>gress did or did not intend to leave oral grievances unprotected here.&para;<br>Because the text, taken alone, might, or might not, encompass oral&para;<br>complaints, the Court must look further. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(b) Several functional considerations indicate that Congress in&para;<br>tended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written,&para;<br>complaints. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(1) A narrow interpretation would undermine the Act’s basic ob&para;<br>jective, which is to prohibit “labor conditions detrimental to the&para;<br>maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,&para;<br>efficiency, and general well-being of workers,” 29 U. S. C. §202(a).&para;<br>The Act relies for enforcement of its substantive standards on “infor&para;<br>mation and complaints received from employees,” Mitchell v. Robert&para;<br>DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288, 292, and its antiretaliation pro&para;<br>vision makes the enforcement scheme effective by preventing “fear of&para;<br>economic retaliation” from inducing workers “quietly to accept sub&para;<br>standard conditions,” ibid. Why would Congress want to limit the en&para;<br>forcement scheme’s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act’s com&para;<br>plaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their&para;<br>complaints to writing, particularly the illiterate, less educated, or&para;<br>overworked workers who were most in need of the Act’s help at the&para;<br>time of passage? Limiting the provision’s scope to written complaints&para;<br>could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews,&para;<br>and other oral methods to receive complaints. And insofar as the&para;<br>provision covers complaints made to employers, a limiting reading&para;<br>would discourage using informal workplace grievance procedures to&para;<br>secure compliance with the Act. The National Labor Relations Act’s&para;<br>antiretaliation provision has been broadly interpreted as protecting&para;<br>workers who simply “participate[d] in a [National Labor Relations]&para;<br>Board investigation.” NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123. The&para;<br>similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for a broad&para;<br>interpretation of “complaint.” The Act’s requirement that an em&para;<br>ployer receive fair notice of an employee’s complaint can be met by&para;<br>oral, as well as written, complaints. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(2) Given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal admin&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>istrative agencies, their views about the meaning of the phrase&para;<br>should be given a degree of weight. The Secretary of Labor has con&para;<br>sistently held the view that “filed any complaint” covers both oral and&para;<br>written complaints. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commis&para;<br>sion has set out a similar view in its Compliance Manual and in mul&para;<br>tiple briefs. These views are reasonable and consistent with the Act.&para;<br>And the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect&para;<br>careful consideration, not “post hoc rationalizatio[n].” Motor Vehicle&para;<br>Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.&para;<br>Co., 463 U. S. 29, 50. Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>(3) After engaging in traditional statutory interpretation meth&para;<br>ods, the statute does not remain sufficiently ambiguous to warrant&para;<br>application of the rule of lenity. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(c) This Court will not consider Saint-Gobain’s alternative claim&para;<br>that the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed&para;<br>with the Government, since that claim was not raised in the certio&para;<br>rari briefs and since its resolution is not a “ ‘predicate to an intelli&para;<br>gent resolution’ ” of the oral/written question at issue, Caterpillar&para;<br>Inc. v.

That location prevented&para;<br>workers from receiving credit for the time they spent&para;<br>putting on and taking off their work clothes—contrary to&para;<br>the Act’s requirements. In a related suit the District&para;<br>Court agreed with Kasten, finding that Saint-Gobain’s&para;<br>“practice of not compensating . . . for time spent donning&para;<br>and doffing certain required protective gear and walking&para;<br>to work areas” violated the Act. Kasten v. Saint-Gobain&para;<br>Performance Plastics Corp., 556 F. Supp. 2d 941, 954 (WD&para;<br>Wis. 2008). In this suit Kasten claims unlawful retalia­&para;<br>tion. He says that Saint-Gobain discharged him because&para;<br>he orally complained to Saint-Gobain officials about the&para;<br>timeclocks.&para;<br>In particular, Kasten says that he repeatedly called the&para;<br>unlawful timeclock location to Saint-Gobain’s attention—&para;<br>in accordance with Saint-Gobain’s internal grievance­&para;<br>resolution procedure. See Brief for Petitioner 4 (quoting&para;<br>Saint-Gobain’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct as&para;<br>imposing upon every employee “the responsibility to report&para;<br>. . . suspected violations of . . . any applicable law of which&para;<br>he or she becomes aware”); id., at 4–5 (quoting SaintGobain’s Employee Policy Handbook as instructing em­&para;<br>ployees with “questions, complaints, and problems” to&para;<br>“[c]ontact” their “supervisor[s] immediately” and if neces­&para;<br>sary “take the issue to the next level of management,”&para;<br>then to the “local Human Resources Manager,” then to&para;<br>“Human Resources” personnel at the “Regional” or “Head­&para;<br>quarters” level).&para;<br>Kasten adds that he “raised a concern” with his shift&para;<br>supervisor that “it was illegal for the time clocks to be&para;<br>where they were” because of Saint-Gobain’s exclusion of&para;<br>“the time you come in and start doing stuff”; he told a&para;<br>human resources employee that “if they were to get chal­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Record in No. 3:07–cv–00686–bbc (WD Wis.), Doc.&para;<br>87–3, pp. 31–34 (deposition of Kevin Kasten). This activ­&para;<br>ity, Kasten concludes, led the company to discipline him&para;<br>and, in December 2006, to dismiss him.&para;<br>Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events. It&para;<br>denies that Kasten made any significant complaint about&para;<br>the timeclock location. And it says that it dismissed Kas­&para;<br>ten simply because Kasten, after being repeatedly warned,&para;<br>failed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.&para;<br>For present purposes we accept Kasten’s version of&para;<br>these contested events as valid. See Scott v. Harris, 550&para;<br>U. S. 372, 380 (2007). That is because the District Court&para;<br>entered summary judgment in Saint-Gobain’s favor. 619&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 608, 610 (WD Wis. 2008). And it did so, not&para;<br>because it doubted Kasten’s ability to prove the facts he&para;<br>alleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect oral&para;<br>complaints. Id., at 611–613. On appeal, the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit agreed with the District Court that the Act’s an­&para;<br>tiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints. 570&para;<br>F. 3d 834, 838–840 (2009).&para;<br>Kasten sought certiorari. And in light of conflict among&para;<br>the Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected,&para;<br>we granted Kasten’s petition. Compare Hagan v. Echostar&para;<br>Satellite, L. L.

The Act protects employees who&para;<br>have “filed any complaint,” 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3), and&para;<br>interpretation of this phrase “depends upon reading the&para;<br>whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context&para;<br>of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori­&para;<br>ties that inform the analysis,” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546&para;<br>U. S. 481, 486 (2006). This analysis leads us to conclude&para;<br>that the language of the provision, considered in isolation,&para;<br>may be open to competing interpretations. But consider­&para;<br>ing the provision in conjunction with the purpose and&para;<br>context leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is&para;<br>permissible.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We begin with the text of the statute. The word “filed”&para;<br>has different relevant meanings in different contexts.&para;<br>Some dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a&para;<br>writing. See, e.g., Webster’s New International Dictionary&para;<br>945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to “deliver (a paper or&para;<br>instrument) to the proper officer so that it is received by&para;<br>him to be kept on file, or among the records of his office”&para;<br>(emphasis added)); Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dic­&para;<br>tionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of “file” is “to&para;<br>place among official records as prescribed by law”).&para;<br>But other dictionaries provide different definitions that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>permit the use of the word “file” in conjunction with oral&para;<br>material. One can, for example, file an oral statement&para;<br>that enters a matter “into the order of business.” 1 Funk&para;<br>&amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English&para;<br>Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to “present&para;<br>in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so&para;<br>that it shall go upon the records or into the order of busi­&para;<br>ness”). This possibility is significant because it means&para;<br>that dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not&para;<br>necessarily limit the scope of the statutory phrase to writ­&para;<br>ten complaints. Cf. Crawford v. Metropolitan Government&para;<br>of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 5) (looking for the “limits” of a linguistic&para;<br>phrase rather than what “exemplif[ies]” its application).&para;<br>In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found&para;<br>that legislators, administrators, and judges have all some­&para;<br>times used the word “file” in conjunction with oral state­&para;<br>ments. Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral&para;<br>filings. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. §47.32.090(a) (2008) (“file a&para;<br>verbal or written complaint”); Cal. Health &amp; Safety&para;<br>Code Ann. §17055(a) (West 2006) (“file an administrative complaint orally or in writing”); D. C.

Evans, 536 U. S. 452, 475 (2002), shows that oral&para;<br>filings were a known phenomenon when the Act was&para;<br>passed. See, e.g., Reed Oil Co. v. Cain, 169 Ark. 309, 312,&para;<br>275 S.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>App. 1925) (“filed oral pleadings”).&para;<br>Filings may more often be made in writing. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Ritter v. United States, 28 F. 2d 265, 267 (CA3 1928)&para;<br>(finding words “file a claim for refund” to require a written&para;<br>request in context of tax code). But we are interested in&para;<br>the filing of “any complaint.” So even if the word “filed,”&para;<br>considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation&para;<br>limited to writings, the phrase “any complaint” suggests a&para;<br>broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.&para;<br>See, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 7). The upshot is that the three-word&para;<br>phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive&para;<br>question.&para;<br>We can look further to other appearances of the word&para;<br>“filed” in the Act. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.&para;<br>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 226&para;<br>(1994) (examining “contextual indications” of the meaning&para;<br>of a term). That word (or a variant) appears in numerous&para;<br>other provisions. But its appearance elsewhere in the Act&para;<br>does not resolve the linguistic question before us. Some of&para;<br>those other provisions (1) involve filed material that,&para;<br>unlike a complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in&para;<br>writing. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §203(l) (employers must&para;<br>“have on file an unexpired certificate” (emphasis added));&para;<br>§210(a) (Secretary must “file in the court the record of&para;<br>the industry committee” (emphasis added)); ibid.

And the remainder (3) leave the oral/&para;<br>written question unresolved—just as does the provision&para;<br>before us. See, e.g., §210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless&para;<br>movant “file[s] in court an undertaking” (emphasis&para;<br>added)); §214(c)(5)(A) (employee “may file . . . a petition”&para;<br>for review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that&para;<br>contain antiretaliation provisions. Those statutes, how­&para;<br>ever, use somewhat different language.&para;<br>See, e.g.,&para;<br>§158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has “filed charges&para;<br>or given testimony”); §623(d) (protecting those who&para;<br>“opposed any [unlawful] practice” (emphasis added));&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §§2000e–3(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2615(a)(2) (similar). See also, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §2087(a)(1)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. III) (“provided . . . to the employer . . .&para;<br>information relating to any violation” (emphasis added));&para;<br>§2651(a) (similar); 30 U. S.

C.&para;<br>§42121(a)(1) (“provided . . . information” (emphasis&para;<br>added)); §60129(a)(1) (same). Some of this language is&para;<br>broader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that&para;<br>the phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the&para;<br>broader, “oral” interpretation, the use of broader language&para;<br>elsewhere may mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the&para;<br>scope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Con­&para;<br>gress did not believe the different phraseology made a&para;<br>significant difference in this respect. The language alone&para;<br>does not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect&para;<br>orally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not&para;<br>intend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.&para;<br>The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot&para;<br>provide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.&para;<br>The phrase “filed any complaint” might, or might not,&para;<br>encompass oral complaints. We must look further.&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>Several functional considerations indicate that Congress&para;<br>intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well&para;<br>as written, “complaint[s].” First, an interpretation that&para;<br>limited the provision’s coverage to written complaints&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would undermine the Act’s basic objectives. The Act seeks&para;<br>to prohibit “labor conditions detrimental to the mainte­&para;<br>nance of the minimum standard of living necessary for&para;<br>health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.” 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §202(a). It does so in part by setting forth sub­&para;<br>stantive wage, hour, and overtime standards. It relies for&para;<br>enforcement of these standards, not upon “continuing&para;<br>detailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,” but&para;<br>upon “information and complaints received from employ­&para;<br>ees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been de­&para;<br>nied.” Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S.&para;<br>288, 292 (1960). And its antiretaliation provision makes&para;<br>this enforcement scheme effective by preventing “fear of&para;<br>economic retaliation” from inducing workers “quietly to&para;<br>accept substandard conditions.” Ibid.&para;<br>Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement&para;<br>scheme’s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act’s com­&para;<br>plaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to&para;<br>reduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate,&para;<br>less educated, or overworked workers? President Franklin&para;<br>Roosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the&para;<br>workers most in need of the Act’s help. See Message to&para;<br>Congress, May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong.,&para;<br>1st Sess., 4 (seeking a bill to help the poorest of “those who&para;<br>toil in factory”).&para;<br>In the years prior to the passage of the Act, illiteracy&para;<br>rates were particularly high among the poor. See E.&para;<br>Gordon &amp; E. Gordon, Literacy in America 273 (2003) (one­&para;<br>quarter of World War I conscripts were illiterate); Dept. of&para;<br>Commerce, Bureau of Census, Sixteenth Census of the&para;<br>United States, 1940, Population: The Labor Force (Sample&para;<br>Statistics): Occupational Characteristics 60 (1943) (20.8%&para;<br>of manufacturing laborers in 1940 had less than five years&para;<br>of schooling). Those rates remained high in certain indus­&para;<br>tries for many years after the Act’s passage. In 1948, for&para;<br>example, the National War Labor Board wrote:&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>“In many plants where there is a high degree of illit­&para;<br>eracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a&para;<br>substantial hardship. In other plants where there is&para;<br>considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it&para;<br>is often not practicable to write up grievances during&para;<br>work hours.” 1 The Termination Report of the Na­&para;<br>tional War Labor Board, p. 122.&para;<br>To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the&para;<br>filing of written complaints would also take needed flexi­&para;<br>bility from those charged with the Act’s enforcement. It&para;<br>could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines,&para;<br>interviews, and other oral methods of receiving com­&para;<br>plaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision cov­&para;<br>ers complaints made to employers (a matter we need not&para;<br>decide, see infra, at 14–15), it would discourage the use of&para;<br>desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to&para;<br>secure compliance with the Act. Cf. Burlington Industries,&para;<br>Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998) (reading Title VII&para;<br>to encourage the development of effective grievance proce­&para;<br>dures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, &amp; K.&para;<br>Rogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38–40&para;<br>(1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten&para;<br>complaints).&para;<br>Given the need for effective enforcement of the National&para;<br>Labor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly inter­&para;<br>preted the language of the NLRA’s antiretaliation provi­&para;<br>sion—“filed charges or given testimony,” 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§158(a)(4)—as protecting workers who neither filed&para;<br>charges nor were “called formally to testify” but simply&para;<br>“participate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board&para;<br>investigation.” NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123&para;<br>(1972) (emphasis added). The similar enforcement needs&para;<br>of this related statute argue for an interpretation of the&para;<br>word “complaint” that would provide “broad rather than&para;<br>narrow protection to the employee,” id., at 122 (and would&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>do so here without pressing statutory language to its&para;<br>limit). See also Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. v. Muscoda&para;<br>Local No. 123, 321 U. S. 590, 597 (1944) (the Act’s “reme­&para;<br>dial and humanitarian . . . purpose” cautions against&para;<br>“narrow, grudging” interpretations of its language).&para;<br>Saint-Gobain replies that worker protection is not the&para;<br>only relevant statutory objective. The Act also seeks to&para;<br>establish an enforcement system that is fair to employers.&para;<br>To do so, the employer must have fair notice that an em­&para;<br>ployee is making a complaint that could subject the em­&para;<br>ployer to a later claim of retaliation. If oral complaints&para;<br>suffice, Saint-Gobain adds, employers too often will be left&para;<br>in a state of uncertainty about whether an employee (par­&para;<br>ticularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the&para;<br>moment) is in fact making a complaint about an Act viola­&para;<br>tion or just letting off steam.&para;<br>We agree with Saint-Gobain that the statute requires&para;<br>fair notice. Although the dictionary definitions, statutes,&para;<br>regulations, and judicial opinions we considered, see su&para;<br>pra, at 4–7, do not distinguish between writings and oral&para;<br>statements, they do suggest that a “filing” is a serious&para;<br>occasion, rather than a triviality. As such, the phrase&para;<br>“filed any complaint” contemplates some degree of formal­&para;<br>ity, certainly to the point where the recipient has been&para;<br>given fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and&para;<br>does, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part&para;<br>of its business concerns.&para;<br>Moreover, the statute prohibits employers from dis­&para;<br>criminating against an employee “because such employee&para;<br>has filed any complaint.” §215(a)(3) (emphasis added).&para;<br>And it is difficult to see how an employer who does not (or&para;<br>should not) know an employee has made a complaint could&para;<br>discriminate because of that complaint. But we also be­&para;<br>lieve that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily&para;<br>mean that notice must be in writing.&para;<br>At oral argument, the Government said that a complaint&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>is “filed” when “a reasonable, objective person would have&para;<br>understood the employee” to have “put the employer on&para;<br>notice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights&para;<br>under the [Act].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26. We agree. To&para;<br>fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a&para;<br>complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a&para;<br>reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both&para;<br>content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by&para;<br>the statute and a call for their protection. This standard&para;<br>can be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by&para;<br>written ones.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Second, given Congress’ delegation of enforcement pow­&para;<br>ers to federal administrative agencies, we also give a&para;<br>degree of weight to their views about the meaning of this&para;<br>enforcement language. See 29 U. S. C. §216(c) (vesting&para;<br>enforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization&para;<br>Plan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U. S. C. App. §1, p. 664 (transferring&para;<br>to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)&para;<br>enforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its&para;<br>Equal Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); Skidmore v.&para;<br>Swift &amp; Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944) (giving weight to a&para;<br>persuasive articulation of views within an agency’s area of&para;<br>expertise).&para;<br>The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view&para;<br>that the words “filed any complaint” cover oral, as well as&para;<br>written, complaints. The Department of Labor articulated&para;<br>that view in an enforcement action filed many years ago,&para;<br>Goldberg v. Zenger, 43 CCH LC ¶31,155, pp. 40,985,&para;<br>40,986 (D Utah 1961). It has subsequently reaffirmed&para;<br>that view in briefs. See, e.g., Brief for Secretary of Labor&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petition for Rehearing with&para;<br>Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley,&para;<br>No. 96–36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 6–7. And more recently it&para;<br>has acted in accordance with that view by creating a hot­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>line to receive oral complaints, see Dept. of Labor, Compli­&para;<br>ance Assistance By Law—The Fair Labor Standards Act&para;<br>(FLSA), http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-flsa.htm&para;<br>(as visited Mar. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s&para;<br>case file) (directing participants who wish to “file a com­&para;<br>plaint” to contact a local office “or call the Department’s&para;<br>Toll-Free Wage and Hour Help Line at 1–866–4–US–&para;<br>WAGE”).&para;<br>The EEOC has set forth a similar view in its Compli­&para;<br>ance Manual, Vol. 2, §8–II(B)(1), p. 8–3, and n. 12 (1998),&para;<br>and in multiple briefs, see, e.g., Brief for EEOC as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae in Support of Petition for Rehearing with Sugges­&para;<br>tion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley, No.&para;<br>96–36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 8–13; Brief for Appellee in EEOC&para;<br>v. White &amp; Son Enterprises, Inc., No. 88–7658 (CA11),&para;<br>pp. 29–30.&para;<br>These agency views are reasonable. They are consistent&para;<br>with the Act. The length of time the agencies have held&para;<br>them suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not&para;<br>“post hoc rationalizatio[n].” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of&para;<br>United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,&para;<br>463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983). And they consequently add force&para;<br>to our conclusion. Skidmore, supra, at 140; cf. United&para;<br>States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229, 234–235 (2001)&para;<br>(Court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in&para;<br>absence of rulemaking authority); Babbitt v.

It leads us to favor a more lenient interpre­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>tation of a criminal statute “when, after consulting tradi­&para;<br>tional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an&para;<br>ambiguous statute.” United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S.&para;<br>10, 17 (1994). We agree with Saint-Gobain that those who&para;<br>violate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject&para;<br>to criminal sanction, 29 U. S. C. §216(a). And we have&para;<br>said that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with&para;<br>criminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.&para;<br>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8 (2004). But&para;<br>after engaging in traditional methods of statutory inter­&para;<br>pretation, we cannot find that the statute remains suffi­&para;<br>ciently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of&para;<br>lenity here.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims that it should prevail&para;<br>because Kasten complained to a private employer, not to&para;<br>the Government; and, in Saint-Gobain’s view, the antire­&para;<br>taliation provision applies only to complaints filed with&para;<br>the Government. Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the&para;<br>lower courts, which held to the contrary. 570 F. 3d, at&para;<br>837–838; 619 F. Supp. 2d, at 613. But Saint-Gobain said&para;<br>nothing about it in response to Kasten’s petition for certio­&para;<br>rari. Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court&para;<br>until it filed its brief on the merits.&para;<br>We do not normally consider a separate legal question&para;<br>not raised in the certiorari briefs. See this Court’s Rule&para;<br>15.2; Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13&para;<br>(1996). We see no reason to make an exception here.&para;<br>Resolution of the Government/private employer question&para;<br>is not a “ ‘ “predicate to an intelligent resolution” ’ ” of the&para;<br>oral/written question that we granted certiorari to decide.&para;<br>See ibid. (quoting Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38&para;<br>(1996)). That is to say, we can decide the oral/written&para;<br>question separately—on its own. And we have done so.&para;<br>Thus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §215(a)(3), covers only written complaints to the&para;<br>employer. I would affirm the judgment on the ground that&para;<br>§215(a)(3) does not cover complaints to the employer at all.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The FLSA’s retaliation provision states that it shall be&para;<br>unlawful&para;<br>“to discharge or in any other manner discriminate&para;<br>against any employee because such employee has filed&para;<br>any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted&para;<br>any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has&para;<br>testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding,&para;<br>or has served or is about to serve on an industry com&para;<br>mittee.” Ibid.&para;<br>The phrase central to the outcome here is “filed any com&para;<br>plaint.” In the courts below, Kasten asserted a claim for&para;<br>retaliation based solely on allegations that he “filed” oral&para;<br>“complaints” with his employer; Saint-Gobain argued that&para;<br>the retaliation provision protects only complaints that are&para;<br>(1) in writing, and (2) made to judicial or administrative&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>bodies. I agree with at least the second part of SaintGobain’s contention. The plain meaning of the critical&para;<br>phrase and the context in which appears make clear that&para;<br>the retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance&para;<br>filed with a court or an agency, not oral complaints—or&para;<br>even formal, written complaints—from an employee to an&para;<br>employer.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In isolation, the word “complaint” could cover Kasten’s&para;<br>objection: It often has an expansive meaning, connoting&para;<br>any “[e]xpression of grief, regret, pain . . . or resentment.”&para;<br>Webster’s New International Dictionary 546 (2d ed. 1934)&para;<br>(hereinafter Webster’s). But at the time the FLSA was&para;<br>passed (and still today) the word when used in a legal&para;<br>context has borne a specialized meaning: “[a] formal alle&para;<br>gation or charge against a party, made or presented to the&para;<br>appropriate court or officer.” Ibid. See also Cambridge&para;<br>Dictionary of American English 172 (2000) (“a formal&para;<br>statement to a government authority that you have a legal&para;<br>cause to complain about the way you have been treated”);&para;<br>3 Oxford English Dictionary 608 (2d ed. 1989) (“[a] state&para;<br>ment or injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial&para;<br>authority . . . for purposes of prosecution or of redress”).&para;<br>There are several reasons to think that the word bears&para;<br>its specialized meaning here. First, every other use of the&para;<br>word “complaint” in the FLSA refers to an official filing&para;<br>with a governmental body. Sections 216(b) and (c) both&para;<br>state that the right to bring particular types of actions&para;<br>“shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint” by the&para;<br>Secretary of Labor, and §216(c) clarifies that the statute of&para;<br>limitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid&para;<br>wages “on the date when the complaint is filed.” These&para;<br>provisions unquestionably use “complaint” in the narrow&para;<br>legal sense. Identical words used in different parts of a&para;<br>statute are presumed to have the same meaning absent&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>contrary indication, IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34&para;<br>(2005); Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990). It&para;<br>is one thing to expand the meaning of “complaint” in&para;<br>§215(a)(3) to include complaints filed with an agency&para;<br>instead of a court; it is quite something else to wrench it&para;<br>from the legal context entirely, to include an employee’s&para;<br>objection to an employer.&para;<br>Second, the word “complaint” appears as part of the&para;<br>phrase “filed any complaint” and thus draws meaning&para;<br>from the verb with which it is connected. The choice of the&para;<br>word “filed” rather than a broader alternative like “made,”&para;<br>if it does not connote (as the Seventh Circuit believed,&para;<br>and as I need not consider) something in writing, at least&para;<br>suggests a degree of formality consistent with legal action&para;<br>and inconsistent (at least in the less regulated work envi&para;<br>ronment of 1938) with employee-to-employer complaints.&para;<br>It is noteworthy that every definition of the verb “filed”&para;<br>that the Court’s opinion provides, whether it supports the&para;<br>inclusion of oral content or not, envisions a formal, pre&para;<br>scribed process of delivery or submission. Ante, at 4–5&para;<br>(comparing, for example, Webster’s 945 (to file is to “de&para;<br>liver (a paper or instrument) to the proper officer”) with 1&para;<br>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English&para;<br>Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (to file is to “present in the&para;<br>regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body”)).&para;<br>Moreover, “[t]he law uses familiar legal expressions in&para;<br>their familiar legal sense,” Henry v. United States, 251&para;<br>U. S. 393, 395 (1920). It is, I suppose, possible to speak of&para;<br>“filing a complaint” with an employer, but that is assur&para;<br>edly not common usage. Thus, when the antiretaliation&para;<br>provision of the Mine Health and Safety Act used that&para;<br>phrase in a context that includes both complaints to an&para;<br>agency and complaints to the employer, it did not use&para;<br>“filed” alone, but supplemented that with “or made”—and&para;<br>to boot specified “including a complaint notifying the&para;<br>[mine] operator . . . of an alleged danger or safety or health&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE &para;<br>&para;<br>PLASTICS CORP.&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>violation . . . .” 30 U. S. C. §815(c)(1).1&para;<br>Third, the phrase “filed any complaint” appears along&para;<br>side three other protected activities: “institut[ing] or&para;<br>caus[ing] to be instituted any proceeding under or related&para;<br>to this chapter,” “testif[ying] in any such proceeding,” and&para;<br>“serv[ing] . . . on an industry committee.”2 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§215(a)(3). Since each of these three activities involves&para;<br>an interaction with governmental authority, we can fairly&para;<br>attribute this characteristic to the phrase “filed any com&para;<br>plaint” as well. “That several items in a list share an&para;<br>attribute counsel in favor of interpreting the other items&para;<br>as possessing that attribute as well.” Beecham v. United&para;<br>States, 511 U.

But no legislation pursues its ends at all costs. Rodri&para;<br>guez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per&para;<br>curiam). Congress may not have protected intracompany&para;<br>complaints for the same reason it did not provide a private&para;<br>cause of action for retaliation against complaints: because&para;<br>it was unwilling to expose employers to the litigation, or to&para;<br>the inability to dismiss unsatisfactory workers, which that&para;<br>additional step would entail. Limitation of the retaliation&para;<br>provision to agency complaints may have been an attempt&para;<br>“to achieve the benefits of regulation right up to the&para;<br>point where the costs of further benefits exceed the value&para;<br>of those benefits.” Easterbrook, Statutes’ Domains, 50&para;<br>U.

That is not so.

The only relevance of these provisions to&para;<br>whether the FLSA covers such complaints is that none of&para;<br>them achieves that result by use of the term “filed any&para;<br>complaint,” and all of them use language that unmistaka&para;<br>bly includes complaints to employers. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000e–3(a) (prohibiting retaliation against employees&para;<br>who “oppos[e] any [unlawful] practice”). Any suggestion&para;<br>that because more recent statutes cover intracompany&para;<br>complaints, a provision adopted in the 1938 Act should be&para;<br>deemed to do so is unacceptable. While the jurisprudence&para;<br>of this Court has sometimes sanctioned a “living Constitu&para;<br>tion,” it has never approved a living United States Code.&para;<br>What Congress enacted in 1938 must be applied according&para;<br>to its terms, and not according to what a modern Congress&para;<br>(or this Court) would deem desirable.4&para;<br>3&para;<br>Kasten argues that this Court should defer to the De&para;<br>partment of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity&para;<br>Commission’s (EEOC) interpretations of 29 U.

If we are to apply our new jurisprudence&para;<br>that deference is appropriate only when Congress has&para;<br>given the agency authority to make rules carrying the&para;<br>force of law, see Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 255–&para;<br>256 (2006), deference is improper here. The EEOC has&para;<br>no such authority. Although the Secretary of Labor and&para;<br>his subordinates have authority to issue regulations&para;<br>under various provisions of the FLSA, see, e.g., §203(l);&para;<br>§206(a)(2), they have no general authority to issue regula&para;<br>tions interpreting the Act, and no specific authority to&para;<br>issue regulations interpreting §215(a)(3).&para;<br>Presumably for this reason, the Court’s opinion seems to&para;<br>suggest that only so-called Skidmore deference is appro&para;<br>priate, see Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140&para;<br>(1944).5 This doctrine states that agencies’ views are&para;<br>“ ‘entitled to respect’ ” to the extent they have “ ‘the power&para;<br>to persuade.’ ” Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S.&para;<br>576, 587 (2000) (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140).6 For&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Or&para;<br>&para;<br>perhaps not. The actual quantum of deference measured out by&para;<br>the Court’s opinion is unclear—seemingly intentionally so. The Court&para;<br>says that it is giving “a degree of weight” to the Secretary and EEOC’s&para;<br>views “given Congress’ delegation of enforcement powers to federal&para;<br>administrative agencies.” Ante, at 12. But it never explicitly states the&para;<br>level of deference applied, and includes a mysterious citation of United&para;<br>States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), along with a parenthetical&para;<br>saying that “sometimes . . . judicial deference [is] intended even in [the]&para;<br>absence of rulemaking authority.” Ante, at 13. I say this is mysterious&para;<br>because Mead clearly held that rulemaking authority was necessary for&para;<br>full Chevron deference, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). I have chosen to interpret&para;<br>the Court as referring to Skidmore deference, rather than Chevron&para;<br>deference or something in-between, in order to minimize the Court’s&para;<br>ongoing obfuscation of this once-clear area of administrative law. See&para;<br>Mead, supra, at 245 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>6 In my view this doctrine (if it can be called that) is incoherent, both&para;<br>linguistically and practically. To defer is to subordinate one’s own&para;<br>judgment to another’s. If one has been persuaded by another, so that&para;<br>one’s judgment accords with the other’s, there is no room for deferral—&para;<br>only for agreement.

Citing this Court’s Rule&para;<br>15.2 and Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13&para;<br>(1996), the opinion says that this Court does “not normally&para;<br>consider a separate legal question not raised in the certio&para;<br>rari briefs.” Ante, at 15.&para;<br>It regularly does so, however, under the circumstances&para;<br>that obtain here. (Curiously enough, Caterpillar, the case&para;<br>cited by the Court, was one instance.) Rule 15.2 is per&para;<br>missive rather than mandatory: “Any objection to consid&para;<br>eration of a question presented based on what occurred in&para;<br>the proceedings below . . . may be deemed waived unless&para;<br>called to the Court’s attention in the brief in opposition.”&para;<br>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the Court has often per&para;<br>mitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised&para;<br>in the brief in opposition when doing so is “predicate to an&para;<br>intelligent resolution of the question presented, and there&para;<br>fore fairly included therein.” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S.&para;<br>33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also&para;<br>Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258–259, n. 5 (1980).&para;<br>Kasten’s petition for certiorari phrases the question&para;<br>presented as follows: “Is an oral complaint of a violation of&para;<br>the Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the&para;<br>anti-retaliation provision, 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3)?” Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. i. Surely the word “complaint” in this question must&para;<br>be assigned an implied addressee. It presumably does not&para;<br>include a complaint to Judge Judy. And the only plausible&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>agency position does nothing but confuse. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>addressee, given the facts of this case, is the employer.&para;<br>Saint-Gobain’s rewording of the question presented in its&para;<br>brief in opposition is even more specific: “Has an employee&para;<br>alleging solely that he orally asserted objections to his&para;<br>employer . . . ‘filed any complaint’ within the meaning of&para;<br>[§215(a)(3)].” Brief in Opposition i (emphasis added).&para;<br>Moreover, under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), the question&para;<br>presented is “deemed to comprise every subsidiary ques&para;<br>tion fairly included therein.” Whether intracompany&para;<br>complaints are protected is at least subsidiary to Kasten’s&para;<br>formulation (and explicitly included in Saint-Gobain’s).&para;<br>The question was also decided by the courts below and&para;<br>was briefed before this Court. It is not clear what benefit&para;<br>additional briefing would provide.&para;<br>Moreover, whether §215(a)(3) covers intracompany&para;<br>complaints is “predicate to an intelligent resolution of the&para;<br>question presented” in this case. The Court’s own opinion&para;<br>demonstrates the point. While claiming that it remains&para;<br>an open question whether intracompany complaints are&para;<br>covered, the opinion adopts a test for “filed any complaint”&para;<br>that assumes a “yes” answer—and that makes no sense&para;<br>otherwise. An employee, the Court says, is deemed to&para;<br>have “filed [a] complaint” only when “ ‘a reasonable, objec&para;<br>tive person would have understood the employee’ to have&para;<br>‘put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting&para;<br>statutory rights under the [Act].” Ante, at 12 (quoting Tr.&para;<br>of Oral Arg. 23, 26). This utterly atextual standard is&para;<br>obviously designed to counter the argument of SaintGobain, that if oral complaints are allowed, “employers too&para;<br>often will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether&para;<br>an employee . . . is in fact making a complaint . . . or just&para;<br>letting off steam.” Ante, at 11. Of course, if intracompany&para;<br>complaints were excluded, this concern would be nonexis&para;<br>tent: Filing a complaint with a judicial or administrative&para;<br>body is quite obviously an unambiguous assertion of&para;<br>one’s rights.
