Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185, “an application of a law of nature . . . to&para;<br>a known structure or process may [deserve] patent protection,” id., at&para;<br>187. But to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patenteligible application of such a law, a patent must do more than simply&para;<br>state the law of nature while adding the words “apply it.” See, e.g.,&para;<br>Gottschalk v.

(Prometheus), is the&para;<br>sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern&para;<br>the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases. When ingested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the&para;<br>bloodstream. Because patients metabolize these drugs differently,&para;<br>doctors have found it difficult to determine whether a particular patient’s dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so&para;<br>likely ineffective. The patent claims here set forth processes embodying researchers’ findings that identify correlations between metabolite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision. Each&para;<br>claim recites (1) an “administering” step—instructing a doctor to administer the drug to his patient—(2) a “determining” step—telling&para;<br>the doctor to measure the resulting metabolite levels in the patient’s&para;<br>blood—and (3) a “wherein” step—describing the metabolite concentrations above which there is a likelihood of harmful side-effects and&para;<br>below which it is likely that the drug dosage is ineffective, and informing the doctor that metabolite concentrations above or below&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and market its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test. Prometheus sued&para;<br>Mayo contending that Mayo’s test infringed its patents. The District&para;<br>Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary&para;<br>judgment to Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomena—namely,&para;<br>the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity&para;<br>and efficacy of thiopurine drugs—and therefore are not patentable.&para;<br>The Federal Circuit reversed, finding the processes to be patent eligible under the Circuit’s “machine or transformation test.” On remand&para;<br>from this Court for reconsideration in light of Bilski v. Kappos, 561&para;<br>U. S. ___, which clarified that the “machine or transformation test” is&para;<br>not a definitive test of patent eligibility, id., at ___–___, the Federal&para;<br>Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclusion.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Prometheus’ process is not patent eligible. Pp. 8–24.&para;<br>(a) Because the laws of nature recited by Prometheus’ patent&para;<br>claims—the relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a thiopurine drug dosage&para;<br>will prove ineffective or cause harm—are not themselves patentable,&para;<br>the claimed processes are not patentable unless they have additional&para;<br>features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genuine applications of those laws rather than drafting efforts designed to&para;<br>monopolize the correlations. The three additional steps in the&para;<br>claimed processes here are not themselves natural laws but neither&para;<br>are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claims. The “administering” step simply identifies a group of people who will be interested in the correlations, namely, doctors who used thiopurine&para;<br>drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. Doctors had been using these drugs for this purpose long before these patents existed. And a “prohibition against patenting abstract ideas&para;<br>‘cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula&para;<br>to a particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra, at ___.&para;<br>The “wherein” clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural&para;<br>laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test&para;<br>results when making their treatment decisions. The “determining”&para;<br>step tells a doctor to measure patients’ metabolite levels, through&para;<br>whatever process the doctor wishes to use. Because methods for&para;<br>making such determinations were well known in the art, this step&para;<br>simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field. Such&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>activity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law&para;<br>of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law. Parker v.&para;<br>Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 590. Finally, considering the three steps as an&para;<br>ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not&para;<br>already present when the steps are considered separately. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(b) A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents reinforces this conclusion. Pp. 11–19.&para;<br>(1) Diehr and Flook, the cases most directly on point, both addressed processes using mathematical formulas that, like laws of nature, are not themselves patentable. In Diehr, the overall process&para;<br>was patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole. 450 U. S., at&para;<br>187. These additional steps transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula. But in Flook, the additional steps&para;<br>of the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and&para;<br>the particular chemical processes at issue were all “well known,” to&para;<br>the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no “inventive concept” in the claimed application of the formula. 437 U. S.,&para;<br>at 594. Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is&para;<br>weaker than Diehr’s patent-eligible claim and no stronger than&para;<br>Flook’s unpatentable one. The three steps add nothing specific to the&para;<br>laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(2) Further support for the view that simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature,&para;<br>natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws,&para;<br>phenomena, and ideas patentable is provided in O’Reilly v. Morse, 15&para;<br>How. 62, 114–115; Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases 295,&para;<br>371; Bilski, supra, at ___–___; and Benson, supra, at 64, 65, 67.&para;<br>Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(3) This Court has repeatedly emphasized a concern that patent&para;<br>law not inhibit future discovery by improperly tying up the use of&para;<br>laws of nature and the like. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 67, 68.&para;<br>Rewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might encourage their discovery. But because those laws and principles are&para;<br>“the basic tools of scientific and technological work,” id., at 67, there&para;<br>is a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process is no more than a general instruction to “apply the natural law,”&para;<br>or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying&para;<br>discovery could reasonably justify. The patent claims at issue implicate this concern. In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels&para;<br>and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correlations they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision re-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS &para;<br>&para;<br>LABORATORIES, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>gardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the inference he draws using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit&para;<br>the development of more refined treatment recommendations that&para;<br>combine Prometheus’ correlations with later discoveries. This reinforces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>(c) Additional arguments supporting Prometheus’ position—that&para;<br>the process is patent eligible because it passes the “machine or transformation test”; that, because the particular laws of nature that the&para;<br>claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld;&para;<br>that the Court should not invalidate these patents under §101 because the Patent Act’s other validity requirements will screen out&para;<br>overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnostic laws of nature—do not lead to a different conclusion.

Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981); see also Bilski v.&para;<br>Kappos, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5); Diamond&para;<br>v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980); Le Roy v.

Harford, Webster’s&para;<br>Patent Cases 295, 371 (1841) (English case discussing&para;<br>same). Thus, the Court has written that “a new mineral&para;<br>discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is&para;<br>not patentable subject matter. Likewise, Einstein could&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S.&para;<br>127, 130 (1948)).&para;<br>“Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental&para;<br>processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not pa­&para;<br>tentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and tech­&para;<br>nological work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67&para;<br>(1972). And monopolization of those tools through the&para;<br>grant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more&para;<br>than it would tend to promote it.&para;<br>The Court has recognized, however, that too broad an&para;<br>interpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscer­&para;<br>ate patent law. For all inventions at some level embody,&para;<br>use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural&para;<br>phenomena, or abstract ideas. Thus, in Diehr the Court&para;<br>pointed out that “ ‘a process is not unpatentable simply&para;<br>because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical&para;<br>algorithm.’ ” 450 U. S., at 187 (quoting Parker v. Flook,&para;<br>437 U. S. 584, 590 (1978)). It added that “an application&para;<br>of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known&para;<br>structure or process may well be deserving of patent pro­&para;<br>tection.” Diehr, supra, at 187. And it emphasized Justice&para;<br>Stone’s similar observation in Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph&para;<br>Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86 (1939):&para;<br>“ ‘While a scientific truth, or the mathematical ex­&para;<br>pression of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel&para;<br>and useful structure created with the aid of&para;<br>knowledge of scientific truth may be.’ ” 450 U.

It concerns patent claims covering processes&para;<br>that help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat pa­&para;<br>tients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a&para;<br>given dosage level is too low or too high. The claims pur­&para;<br>port to apply natural laws describing the relationships&para;<br>between the concentration in the blood of certain thiopu­&para;<br>rine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage&para;<br>will be ineffective or induce harmful side-effects. We must&para;<br>determine whether the claimed processes have trans­&para;<br>formed these unpatentable natural laws into patent­&para;<br>eligible applications of those laws. We conclude that they&para;<br>have not done so and that therefore the processes are not&para;<br>patentable.&para;<br>Our conclusion rests upon an examination of the partic­&para;<br>ular claims before us in light of the Court’s precedents.&para;<br>Those cases warn us against interpreting patent statutes&para;<br>in ways that make patent eligibility “depend simply on the&para;<br>draftsman’s art” without reference to the “principles un­&para;<br>derlying the prohibition against patents for [natural&para;<br>laws].” Flook, supra, at 593. They warn us against up­&para;<br>holding patents that claim processes that too broadly&para;<br>preempt the use of a natural law. Morse, supra, at 112–&para;<br>120; Benson, supra, at 71–72. And they insist that a&para;<br>process that focuses upon the use of a natural law also&para;<br>contain other elements or a combination of elements,&para;<br>sometimes referred to as an “inventive concept,” sufficient&para;<br>to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to signifi­&para;<br>cantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself.&para;<br>Flook, supra, at 594; see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

In particular, the steps in the&para;<br>claimed processes (apart from the natural laws them­&para;<br>selves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional&para;<br>activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.&para;<br>At the same time, upholding the patents would risk dis­&para;<br>proportionately tying up the use of the underlying natural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further&para;<br>discoveries.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The patents before us concern the use of thiopurine&para;<br>drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as&para;<br>Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. When a patient&para;<br>ingests a thiopurine compound, his body metabolizes the&para;<br>drug, causing metabolites to form in his bloodstream.&para;<br>Because the way in which people metabolize thiopurine&para;<br>compounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug&para;<br>affects different people differently, and it has been difficult&para;<br>for doctors to determine whether for a particular patient a&para;<br>given dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too&para;<br>low, and so likely ineffective.&para;<br>At the time the discoveries embodied in the patents&para;<br>were made, scientists already understood that the levels&para;<br>in a patient’s blood of certain metabolites, including, in&para;<br>particular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6–TG) and&para;<br>6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6–MMP), were correlated with&para;<br>the likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine&para;<br>drug could cause harm or prove ineffective. See U. S.&para;<br>Patent No. 6,355,623, col. 8, ll. 37–40, 2 App. 10. (“Previ­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

But those in the field did not know&para;<br>the precise correlations between metabolite levels and&para;<br>likely harm or ineffectiveness. The patent claims at issue&para;<br>here set forth processes embodying researchers’ findings&para;<br>that identified these correlations with some precision.&para;<br>More specifically, the patents—U. S. Patent No.&para;<br>6,355,623 (’623 patent) and U. S. Patent No. 6,680,302&para;<br>(’302 patent)—embody findings that concentrations in a&para;<br>patient’s blood of 6–TG or of 6–MMP metabolite beyond a&para;<br>certain level (400 and 7000 picomoles per 8x108 red blood&para;<br>cells, respectively) indicate that the dosage is likely too&para;<br>high for the patient, while concentrations in the blood of&para;<br>6–TG metabolite lower than a certain level (about 230&para;<br>picomoles per 8x108 red blood cells) indicate that the&para;<br>dosage is likely too low to be effective.&para;<br>The patent claims seek to embody this research in a set&para;<br>of processes.

(Prome­&para;<br>theus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the ’623 and&para;<br>’302 patents. It sells diagnostic tests that embody the&para;<br>processes the patents describe. For some time petitioners,&para;<br>Mayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Collaborative Services&para;<br>(collectively Mayo), bought and used those tests. But in&para;<br>2004 Mayo announced that it intended to begin using and&para;<br>selling its own test—a test using somewhat higher metab­&para;<br>olite levels to determine toxicity (450 pmol per 8x108 for&para;<br>6–TG and 5700 pmol per 8x108 for 6–MMP). Prometheus&para;<br>then brought this action claiming patent infringement.&para;<br>The District Court found that Mayo’s test infringed&para;<br>claim 7 of the ’623 patent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a–&para;<br>115a. In interpreting the claim, the court accepted Prome­&para;<br>theus’ view that the toxicity-risk level numbers in Mayo’s&para;<br>test and the claim were too similar to render the tests&para;<br>significantly different. The number Mayo used (450) was&para;<br>too close to the number the claim used (400) to matter&para;<br>given appropriate margins of error. Id., at 98a–107a. The&para;<br>District Court also accepted Prometheus’ view that a&para;<br>doctor using Mayo’s test could violate the patent even if he&para;<br>did not actually alter his treatment decision in the light of&para;<br>the test. In doing so, the court construed the claim’s lan­&para;<br>guage, “indicates a need to decrease” (or “to increase”), as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not limited to instances in which the doctor actually de­&para;<br>creases (or increases) the dosage level where the test&para;<br>results suggest that such an adjustment is advisable. Id.,&para;<br>at 107a–109a; see also Brief for Respondent i (describing&para;<br>claimed processes as methods “for improving . . . treat­&para;<br>ment . . . by using individualized metabolite measure­&para;<br>ments to inform the calibration of . . . dosages of . . .&para;<br>thiopurines” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>Nonetheless the District Court ultimately granted&para;<br>summary judgment in Mayo’s favor. The court reasoned&para;<br>that the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural&para;<br>phenomena—namely the correlations between thiopurine&para;<br>metabolite levels and the toxicity and efficacy of thiopu­&para;<br>rine drug dosages—and so are not patentable. App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 50a–83a.&para;<br>On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed. It pointed out&para;<br>that in addition to these natural correlations, the claimed&para;<br>processes specify the steps of (1) “administering a [thiopu­&para;<br>rine] drug” to a patient and (2) “determining the [resulting&para;<br>metabolite] level.” These steps, it explained, involve the&para;<br>transformation of the human body or of blood taken from&para;<br>the body. Thus, the patents satisfied the Circuit’s “ma­&para;<br>chine or transformation test,” which the court thought&para;<br>sufficient to “confine the patent monopoly within rather&para;<br>definite bounds,” thereby bringing the claims into compli­&para;<br>ance with §101. 581 F. 3d 1336, 1345, 1346–1347 (2009)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Mayo filed a petition for certiorari. We granted the&para;<br>petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for&para;<br>reconsideration in light of Bilski, 561 U.

Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 7–8). On&para;<br>remand the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclu­&para;<br>sion.

Mayo again filed a petition for certiorari, which we&para;<br>granted.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Prometheus’ patents set forth laws of nature—namely,&para;<br>relationships between concentrations of certain metabo­&para;<br>lites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a&para;<br>thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm.&para;<br>Claim 1, for example, states that if the levels of 6–TG in&para;<br>the blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopu­&para;<br>rine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells,&para;<br>then the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side&para;<br>effects. While it takes a human action (the administration&para;<br>of a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this&para;<br>relation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in&para;<br>principle apart from any human action. The relation is a&para;<br>consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds&para;<br>are metabolized by the body—entirely natural processes.&para;<br>And so a patent that simply describes that relation sets&para;<br>forth a natural law.&para;<br>The question before us is whether the claims do signifi­&para;<br>cantly more than simply describe these natural relations.&para;<br>To put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add&para;<br>enough to their statements of the correlations to allow the&para;<br>processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible pro­&para;<br>cesses that apply natural laws? We believe that the an­&para;<br>swer to this question is no.&para;<br>A&para;<br>If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a&para;<br>process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has&para;<br>additional features that provide practical assurance that&para;<br>the process is more than a drafting effort designed to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>monopolize the law of nature itself. A patent, for example,&para;<br>could not simply recite a law of nature and then add the&para;<br>instruction “apply the law.” Einstein, we assume, could&para;<br>not have patented his famous law by claiming a process&para;<br>consisting of simply telling linear accelerator operators to&para;<br>refer to the law to determine how much energy an amount&para;<br>of mass has produced (or vice versa). Nor could Archime­&para;<br>des have secured a patent for his famous principle of&para;<br>flotation by claiming a process consisting of simply telling&para;<br>boat builders to refer to that principle in order to deter­&para;<br>mine whether an object will float.&para;<br>What else is there in the claims before us? The process&para;<br>that each claim recites tells doctors interested in the&para;<br>subject about the correlations that the researchers discov­&para;<br>ered. In doing so, it recites an “administering” step, a&para;<br>“determining” step, and a “wherein” step. These addition­&para;<br>al steps are not themselves natural laws but neither are&para;<br>they sufficient to transform the nature of the claim.&para;<br>First, the “administering” step simply refers to the&para;<br>relevant audience, namely doctors who treat patients with&para;<br>certain diseases with thiopurine drugs. That audience is&para;<br>a pre-existing audience; doctors used thiopurine drugs to&para;<br>treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders long&para;<br>before anyone asserted these claims. In any event, the&para;<br>“prohibition against patenting abstract ideas ‘cannot be&para;<br>circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula&para;<br>to a particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191–&para;<br>192).&para;<br>Second, the “wherein” clauses simply tell a doctor about&para;<br>the relevant natural laws, at most adding a suggestion&para;<br>that he should take those laws into account when treating&para;<br>his patient. That is to say, these clauses tell the relevant&para;<br>audience about the laws while trusting them to use those&para;<br>laws appropriately where they are relevant to their deci­&para;<br>sionmaking (rather like Einstein telling linear accelerator&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS&para;<br>LABORATORIES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>operators about his basic law and then trusting them to&para;<br>use it where relevant).&para;<br>Third, the “determining” step tells the doctor to deter­&para;<br>mine the level of the relevant metabolites in the blood,&para;<br>through whatever process the doctor or the laboratory&para;<br>wishes to use. As the patents state, methods for determin­&para;<br>ing metabolite levels were well known in the art. ’623&para;<br>patent, col. 9, ll. 12–65, 2 App. 11. Indeed, scientists&para;<br>routinely measured metabolites as part of their investiga­&para;<br>tions into the relationships between metabolite levels and&para;<br>efficacy and toxicity of thiopurine compounds. ’623 patent,&para;<br>col. 8, ll. 37–40, id., at 10. Thus, this step tells doctors&para;<br>to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity&para;<br>previously engaged in by scientists who work in the field.&para;<br>Purely “conventional or obvious” “[pre]-solution activity” is&para;<br>normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law&para;<br>of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.&para;<br>Flook, 437 U. S., at 590; see also Bilski, 561 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 14) (“[T]he prohibition against patenting ab­&para;<br>stract ideas ‘cannot be circumvented by’ . . . adding ‘insig­&para;<br>nificant post-solution activity’ ” (quoting Diehr, supra, at&para;<br>191–192)).&para;<br>Fourth, to consider the three steps as an ordered combi­&para;<br>nation adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not al­&para;<br>ready present when the steps are considered separately.&para;<br>See Diehr, supra, at 188 (“[A] new combination of steps in&para;<br>a process may be patentable even though all the constitu­&para;<br>ents of the combination were well known and in common&para;<br>use before the combination was made”). Anyone who&para;<br>wants to make use of these laws must first administer a&para;<br>thiopurine drug and measure the resulting metabolite&para;<br>concentrations, and so the combination amounts to noth­&para;<br>ing significantly more than an instruction to doctors to&para;<br>apply the applicable laws when treating their patients.&para;<br>The upshot is that the three steps simply tell doctors to&para;<br>gather data from which they may draw an inference in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>light of the correlations. To put the matter more suc­&para;<br>cinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about&para;<br>certain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well­&para;<br>understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged&para;<br>in by the scientific community; and those steps, when&para;<br>viewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum&para;<br>of their parts taken separately. For these reasons we&para;<br>believe that the steps are not sufficient to transform un­&para;<br>patentable natural correlations into patentable applica­&para;<br>tions of those regularities.&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>A more detailed consideration of the controlling prece­&para;<br>dents reinforces our conclusion. The cases most directly&para;<br>on point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court&para;<br>reached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of&para;<br>processes that embodied the equivalent of natural laws.&para;<br>The Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method&para;<br>for molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, mold­&para;<br>ed products. The process used a known mathematical&para;<br>equation, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when&para;<br>(depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the&para;<br>time the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of&para;<br>the rubber) to open the press. It consisted in effect of the&para;<br>steps of: (1) continuously monitoring the temperature on&para;<br>the inside of the mold, (2) feeding the resulting numbers&para;<br>into a computer, which would use the Arrhenius equation&para;<br>to continuously recalculate the mold-opening time, and (3)&para;<br>configuring the computer so that at the appropriate mo­&para;<br>ment it would signal “a device” to open the press. Diehr,&para;<br>450 U. S., at 177–179.&para;<br>The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical&para;<br>equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But&para;<br>it found the overall process patent eligible because of&para;<br>the way the additional steps of the process integrated the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS&para;<br>LABORATORIES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>equation into the process as a whole. Those steps included&para;<br>“installing rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly&para;<br>determining the temperature of the mold, constantly recalculating the appropriate cure time through the use of&para;<br>the formula and a digital computer, and automatically&para;<br>opening the press at the proper time.” Id., at 187. It&para;<br>nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the&para;<br>combination of those steps, were in context obvious, al­&para;<br>ready in use, or purely conventional. And so the patentees&para;<br>did not “seek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation,” but&para;<br>sought “only to foreclose from others the use of that equa­&para;<br>tion in conjunction with all of the other steps in their&para;<br>claimed process.” Ibid. These other steps apparently&para;<br>added to the formula something that in terms of patent&para;<br>law’s objectives had significance—they transformed the&para;<br>process into an inventive application of the formula.&para;<br>The process in Flook (held not patentable) provided a&para;<br>method for adjusting “alarm limits” in the catalytic con­&para;<br>version of hydrocarbons. Certain operating conditions&para;<br>(such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates), which are&para;<br>continuously monitored during the conversion process,&para;<br>signal inefficiency or danger when they exceed certain&para;<br>“alarm limits.” The claimed process amounted to an im­&para;<br>proved system for updating those alarm limits through the&para;<br>steps of: (1) measuring the current level of the variable,&para;<br>e.g., the temperature; (2) using an apparently novel math­&para;<br>ematical algorithm to calculate the current alarm limits;&para;<br>and (3) adjusting the system to reflect the new alarm-limit&para;<br>values. 437 U. S., at 585–587.&para;<br>The Court, as in Diehr, pointed out that the basic math­&para;<br>ematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patenta­&para;<br>ble. But it characterized the claimed process as doing&para;<br>nothing other than “provid[ing] a[n unpatentable] formula&para;<br>for computing an updated alarm limit.” Flook, supra, at&para;<br>586. Unlike the process in Diehr, it did not “explain how&para;<br>the variables used in the formula were to be selected, nor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>did the [claim] contain any disclosure relating to chemical&para;<br>processes at work or the means of setting off an alarm or&para;<br>adjusting the alarm limit.” Diehr, supra, at 192, n. 14; see&para;<br>also Flook, 437 U. S., at 586. And so the other steps in the&para;<br>process did not limit the claim to a particular application.&para;<br>Moreover, “[t]he chemical processes involved in catalytic&para;<br>conversion of hydrocarbons[,] . . . the practice of monitor­&para;<br>ing the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits&para;<br>to trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must&para;<br>be recomputed and readjusted, and the use of computers for ‘automatic monitoring-alarming’ ” were all “well&para;<br>known,” to the point where, putting the formula to the&para;<br>side, there was no “inventive concept” in the claimed&para;<br>application of the formula. Id., at 594. “[P]ost-solution&para;<br>activity” that is purely “conventional or obvious,” the&para;<br>Court wrote, “can[not] transform an unpatentable princi­&para;<br>ple into a patentable process.” Id., at 589, 590.&para;<br>The claim before us presents a case for patentability&para;<br>that is weaker than the (patent-eligible) claim in Diehr&para;<br>and no stronger than the (unpatentable) claim in Flook.&para;<br>Beyond picking out the relevant audience, namely those&para;<br>who administer doses of thiopurine drugs, the claim simply tells doctors to: (1) measure (somehow) the current level&para;<br>of the relevant metabolite, (2) use particular (unpatenta­&para;<br>ble) laws of nature (which the claim sets forth) to calculate&para;<br>the current toxicity/inefficacy limits, and (3) reconsider the&para;<br>drug dosage in light of the law. These instructions add&para;<br>nothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is&para;<br>well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously&para;<br>engaged in by those in the field. And since they are steps&para;<br>that must be taken in order to apply the laws in question,&para;<br>the effect is simply to tell doctors to apply the law some­&para;<br>how when treating their patients. The process in Diehr&para;<br>was not so characterized; that in Flook was characterized&para;<br>in roughly this way.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS&para;<br>LABORATORIES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>Other cases offer further support for the view that simp­&para;<br>ly appending conventional steps, specified at a high level&para;<br>of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and&para;<br>abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and&para;<br>ideas patentable. This Court has previously discussed in&para;<br>detail an English case, Neilson, which involved a patent&para;<br>claim that posed a legal problem very similar to the prob­&para;<br>lem now before us. The patent applicant there asserted a&para;<br>claim&para;<br>“for the improved application of air to produce heat in&para;<br>fires, forges, and furnaces, where a blowing apparatus&para;<br>is required. [The invention] was to be applied as&para;<br>follows: The blast or current of air produced by the&para;<br>blowing apparatus was to be passed from it into&para;<br>an air-vessel or receptacle made sufficiently strong to&para;<br>endure the blast; and through or from that vessel or&para;<br>receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into&para;<br>the fire, the receptacle be kept artificially heated to a&para;<br>considerable temperature by heat externally applied.”&para;<br>Morse, 15 How., at 114–115.&para;<br>The English court concluded that the claimed process did&para;<br>more than simply instruct users to use the principle that&para;<br>hot air promotes ignition better than cold air, since it&para;<br>explained how the principle could be implemented in an&para;<br>inventive way. Baron Parke wrote (for the court):&para;<br>“It is very difficult to distinguish [Neilson’s claim]&para;<br>from the specification of a patent for a principle, and&para;<br>this at first created in the minds of some of the court&para;<br>much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think&para;<br>that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle,&para;<br>but a machine embodying a principle, and a very val­&para;<br>uable one. We think the case must be considered as if&para;<br>the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical appa­&para;<br>ratus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in&para;<br>this—by interposing a receptacle for heated air be­&para;<br>tween the blowing apparatus and the furnace. In this&para;<br>receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the appli­&para;<br>cation of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he&para;<br>accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which&para;<br>was before of cold air, in a heated state to the fur­&para;<br>nace.” Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases, at&para;<br>371.&para;<br>Thus, the claimed process included not only a law of&para;<br>nature but also several unconventional steps (such as&para;<br>inserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle&para;<br>externally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that&para;<br>confined the claims to a particular, useful application of the&para;<br>principle.&para;<br>In Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process&para;<br>for hedging risks of price changes by, for example, con­&para;<br>tracting to purchase commodities from sellers at a fixed&para;<br>price, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a&para;<br>drop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a&para;<br>fixed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge&para;<br>against a price increase. One claim described the process;&para;<br>another reduced the process to a mathematical formula.&para;<br>561 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 2–3). The Court held&para;<br>that the described “concept of hedging” was “an unpatent­&para;<br>able abstract idea.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The fact&para;<br>that some of the claims limited hedging to use in commod­&para;<br>ities and energy markets and specified that “well-known&para;<br>random analysis techniques [could be used] to help estab­&para;<br>lish some of the inputs into the equation” did not under­&para;<br>mine this conclusion, for “Flook established that limiting&para;<br>an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postso­&para;<br>lution components did not make the concept patentable.”&para;<br>Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 15).&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS&para;<br>LABORATORIES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, in Benson the Court considered the patentabil­&para;<br>ity of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded&para;<br>decimal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general&para;<br>purpose digital computer. The claims “purported to cover&para;<br>any use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital&para;<br>computer of any type.” 409 U. S., at 64, 65. The Court&para;<br>recognized that “ ‘a novel and useful structure created with&para;<br>the aid of knowledge of scientific truth’ ” might be patent­&para;<br>able. Id., at 67 (quoting Mackay Radio, 306 U. S., at 94).&para;<br>But it held that simply implementing a mathematical&para;<br>principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, was&para;<br>not a patentable application of that principle. For the&para;<br>mathematical formula had “no substantial practical appli­&para;<br>cation except in connection with a digital computer.”&para;<br>Benson, supra, at 71. Hence the claim (like the claims&para;<br>before us) was overly broad; it did not differ significantly&para;<br>from a claim that just said “apply the algorithm.”&para;<br>3&para;<br>The Court has repeatedly emphasized this last men­&para;<br>tioned concern, a concern that patent law not inhibit&para;<br>further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of&para;<br>laws of nature. Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as&para;<br>unpatentable Samuel Morse’s general claim for “ ‘the use&para;<br>of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . .&para;<br>however developed, for making or printing intelligible&para;<br>characters, letters, or signs, at any distances,’ ” 15 How., at&para;<br>86. 	The Court explained:&para;<br>“For aught that we now know some future inventor, in&para;<br>the onward march of science, may discover a mode of&para;<br>writing or printing at a distance by means of the elec­&para;<br>tric or galvanic current, without using any part of the&para;<br>process or combination set forth in the plaintiff ’s spec­&para;<br>ification. His invention may be less complicated—less&para;<br>liable to get out of order—less expensive in construc­&para;<br>tion, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>this patent the inventor could not use it, nor the pub­&para;<br>lic have the benefit of it without the permission of this&para;<br>patentee.” Id., at 113.&para;<br>Similarly, in Benson the Court said that the claims&para;<br>before it were “so abstract and sweeping as to cover both&para;<br>known and unknown uses of the [mathematical formula].”&para;<br>409 U. S., at 67, 68. In Bilski the Court pointed out that&para;<br>to allow “petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre­&para;<br>empt use of this approach in all fields.” 561 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 15). And in Flook the Court expressed concern&para;<br>that the claimed process was simply “a formula for compu­&para;<br>ting an updated alarm limit,” which might “cover a broad&para;<br>range of potential uses.” 437 U. S., at 586.&para;<br>These statements reflect the fact that, even though&para;<br>rewarding with patents those who discover new laws of&para;<br>nature and the like might well encourage their discovery,&para;<br>those laws and principles, considered generally, are “the&para;<br>basic tools of scientific and technological work.” Benson,&para;<br>supra, at 67. And so there is a danger that the grant of&para;<br>patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation&para;<br>premised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a&para;<br>patented process amounts to no more than an instruction&para;<br>to “apply the natural law,” or otherwise forecloses more&para;<br>future invention than the underlying discovery could&para;<br>reasonably justify.

They&para;<br>tell a treating doctor to measure metabolite levels and to&para;<br>consider the resulting measurements in light of the statis­&para;<br>tical relationships they describe.

But they do not lead us to&para;<br>adopt a different conclusion. First, the Federal Circuit, in&para;<br>upholding the patent eligibility of the claims before us,&para;<br>relied on this Court’s determination that “[t]ransformation&para;<br>and reduction of an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is&para;<br>the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does&para;<br>not include particular machines.” Benson, supra, at 70–71&para;<br>(emphasis added); see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>6–7); Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184; Flook, supra, at 588, n. 9;&para;<br>Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877). It reasoned&para;<br>that the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible,&para;<br>since they involve transforming the human body by ad­&para;<br>ministering a thiopurine drug and transforming the blood&para;<br>by analyzing it to determine metabolite levels. 628 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1356–1357.&para;<br>The first of these transformations, however, is irrele­&para;<br>vant. As we have pointed out, the “administering” step&para;<br>simply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are&para;<br>likely interested in applying the law of nature. See supra,&para;<br>at 9. And the second step could be satisfied without trans­&para;<br>forming the blood, should science develop a totally differ­&para;<br>ent system for determining metabolite levels that did not&para;<br>involve such a transformation. See supra, at 18. Regard­&para;<br>less, in stating that the “machine-or-transformation” test&para;<br>is an “important and useful clue” to patentability, we have&para;<br>neither said nor implied that the test trumps the “law of&para;<br>nature” exclusion. Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6–7)&para;<br>(emphasis added). That being so, the test fails here.&para;<br>Second, Prometheus argues that, because the particular&para;<br>laws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow&para;<br>and specific, the patents should be upheld.

See, e.g.,&para;<br>Flook, 437 U. S. 584 (holding narrow mathematical formu­&para;<br>la unpatentable). And this is understandable. Courts and&para;<br>judges are not institutionally well suited to making the&para;<br>kinds of judgments needed to distinguish among different laws of nature. And so the cases have endorsed a&para;<br>bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature,&para;<br>mathematical formulas and the like, which serves as a&para;<br>somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying&para;<br>“building-block” concern.&para;<br>Third, the Government argues that virtually any step&para;<br>beyond a statement of a law of nature itself should trans­&para;<br>form an unpatentable law of nature into a potentially&para;<br>patentable application sufficient to satisfy §101’s de­&para;<br>mands. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae. The&para;<br>Government does not necessarily believe that claims that&para;<br>(like the claims before us) extend just minimally beyond a&para;<br>law of nature should receive patents. But in its view,&para;<br>other statutory provisions—those that insist that a&para;<br>claimed process be novel, 35 U. S. C. §102, that it not be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

In particular, it argues&para;<br>that these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under §102.&para;<br>This approach, however, would make the “law of nature”&para;<br>exception to §101 patentability a dead letter. The ap­&para;<br>proach is therefore not consistent with prior law. The&para;<br>relevant cases rest their holdings upon section 101, not&para;<br>later sections. Bilski, 561 U.

See Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 27.

That research, which includes&para;<br>research leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is&para;<br>expensive; it “ha[s] made the United States the world&para;<br>leader in this field”; and it requires protection.

Patent protection is, after all, a two-edged sword. On&para;<br>the one hand, the promise of exclusive rights provides&para;<br>monetary incentives that lead to creation, invention, and&para;<br>discovery. On the other hand, that very exclusivity can&para;<br>impede the flow of information that might permit, indeed&para;<br>spur, invention, by, for example, raising the price of using&para;<br>the patented ideas once created, requiring potential users&para;<br>to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing&para;<br>patents and pending patent applications, and requiring&para;<br>the negotiation of complex licensing arrangements. At the&para;<br>same time, patent law’s general rules must govern in­&para;<br>ventive activity in many different fields of human endeav­&para;<br>or, with the result that the practical effects of rules that&para;<br>reflect a general effort to balance these considerations&para;<br>may differ from one field to another.

And we must recognize the role of&para;<br>Congress in crafting more finely tailored rules where&para;<br>necessary. Cf. 35 U. S. C. §§161–164 (special rules for&para;<br>plant patents).
