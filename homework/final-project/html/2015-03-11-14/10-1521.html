ROBERT COCCHI ET AL.&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA, FOURTH DISTRICT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 10–1521. Decided November 7, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Agreements to arbitrate that fall within the scope and&para;<br>coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9 U. S. C. §1&para;<br>et seq., must be enforced in state and federal courts. State&para;<br>courts, then, “have a prominent role to play as enforcers&para;<br>of agreements to arbitrate.” Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556&para;<br>U. S. 49, 59 (2009).&para;<br>The Act has been interpreted to require that if a dispute&para;<br>presents multiple claims, some arbitrable and some not,&para;<br>the former must be sent to arbitration even if this will&para;<br>lead to piecemeal litigation. See Dean Witter Reynolds&para;<br>Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 217 (1985). From this it follows that state and federal courts must examine with care&para;<br>the complaints seeking to invoke their jurisdiction in order&para;<br>to separate arbitrable from nonarbitrable claims. A court&para;<br>may not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration&para;<br>merely on the grounds that some of the claims could be&para;<br>resolved by the court without arbitration. See ibid.&para;<br>In this case the Fourth District Court of Appeal of the&para;<br>State of Florida upheld a trial court’s refusal to compel&para;<br>arbitration of respondents’ claims after determining that&para;<br>two of the four claims in a complaint were nonarbitrable.&para;<br>Though the matter is not altogether free from doubt, a fair&para;<br>reading of the opinion indicates a likelihood that the Court&para;<br>of Appeal failed to determine whether the other two claims&para;<br>in the complaint were arbitrable. For this reason, the&para;<br>judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KPMG LLP v. COCCHI&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>* &para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents are 19 individuals and entities who bought&para;<br>limited partnership interests in one of three limited partnerships, all known as the Rye Funds. The Rye Funds&para;<br>were managed by Tremont Group Holding, Inc., and&para;<br>Tremont Partners, Inc., both of which were audited by&para;<br>KPMG. The Rye Funds were invested with financier&para;<br>Bernard Madoff and allegedly lost millions of dollars as a&para;<br>result of a scheme to defraud. Respondents sued the Rye&para;<br>Funds, the Tremont defendants, and Tremont’s auditing&para;<br>firm, KPMG.&para;<br>Only the claims against KPMG are at issue in this case.&para;<br>Against KPMG, respondents alleged four causes of action:&para;<br>negligent misrepresentation; violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Fla.&para;<br>Stat. 501.201 et seq. (2010); professional malpractice; and&para;<br>aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Respondents’ basic theory was that KPMG failed to use proper&para;<br>auditing standards with respect to the financial statements of the partnerships. These improper audits, respondents contend, led to “substantial misrepresentations”&para;<br>about the health of the funds and resulted in respondents’&para;<br>investment losses. 51 So. 3d 1165, 1168 (Fla. App. 2010).&para;<br>KPMG moved to compel arbitration based on the audit&para;<br>services agreement that existed between it and the Tremont defendants. That agreement provided that “[a]ny&para;<br>dispute or claim arising out of or relating to . . . the services provided [by KPMG] . . . (including any dispute or&para;<br>claim involving any person or entity for whose benefit the&para;<br>services in question are or were provided) shall be resolved” either by mediation or arbitration. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 63a. The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth&para;<br>Judicial Circuit Palm Beach County denied the motion.&para;<br>The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that “[n]one of the&para;<br>plaintiffs . . . expressly assented in any fashion to [the&para;<br>audit services agreement] or the arbitration provision.” 51&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>So. 3d, at 1168. Thus, the court found, the arbitration&para;<br>clause could only be enforced if respondents’ claims were&para;<br>derivative in that they arose from the services KPMG&para;<br>performed for the Tremont defendants pursuant to the&para;<br>audit services agreement. Applying Delaware law, which&para;<br>both parties agreed was applicable, the Court of Appeal&para;<br>concluded that the negligent misrepresentation and the&para;<br>violation of FDUTPA claims were direct rather than derivative. A fair reading of the opinion reveals nothing to&para;<br>suggest that the court came to the same conclusion about&para;<br>the professional malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty&para;<br>claims. Indeed, the court said nothing about those claims&para;<br>at all. Finding “the arbitral agreement upon which KPMG&para;<br>relied would not apply to the direct claims made by the&para;<br>individual plaintiffs,” id., at 1167, the Court of Appeal&para;<br>affirmed the trial court’s denial of the motion to arbitrate.&para;<br>Respondents have since amended their complaint to&para;<br>add a fifth claim. Citing the Court of Appeal’s decision,&para;<br>the trial court again denied KPMG’s motion to compel&para;<br>arbitration.&para;<br>The Federal Arbitration Act reflects an “emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.”&para;<br>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,&para;<br>473 U. S. 614, 631 (1985); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24–25 (1983)&para;<br>(noting that “questions of arbitrability [must]. . . be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration”). This policy, as contained within the Act,&para;<br>“requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to&para;<br>arbitrate,” Dean Witter, supra, at 217, and “cannot possibly require the disregard of state law permitting arbitration by or against nonparties to the written arbitration&para;<br>agreement,” Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U. S.&para;<br>624, 630, n. 5 (2009) (emphasis deleted). Both parties&para;<br>agree that whether the claims in the complaint are arbitrable turns on the question whether they must be deemed&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KPMG LLP v. COCCHI&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>direct or derivative under Delaware law. That question of&para;<br>state law is not at issue here. What is at issue is the&para;<br>Court of Appeal’s apparent refusal to compel arbitration&para;<br>on any of the four claims based solely on a finding that two&para;<br>of them, the claim of negligent misrepresentation and the&para;<br>alleged violation of the FDUTPA, were nonarbitrable.&para;<br>In Dean Witter, the Court noted that the Act “provides&para;<br>that written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising&para;<br>out of an existing contract ‘shall be valid, irrevocable, and&para;<br>enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in&para;<br>equity for the revocation of any contract.’ ” 470 U. S., at&para;<br>218 (quoting 9 U. S. C. §2). The Court found that by its&para;<br>terms, “the Act leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district&para;<br>courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on&para;<br>issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been&para;<br>signed.” 470 U. S., at 218 (emphasis in original). Thus,&para;<br>when a complaint contains both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims, the Act requires courts to “compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties&para;<br>files a motion to compel, even where the result would be&para;<br>the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.” Id., at 217. To implement this&para;<br>holding, courts must examine a complaint with care to&para;<br>assess whether any individual claim must be arbitrated.&para;<br>The failure to do so is subject to immediate review. See&para;<br>Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 6–7 (1984).&para;<br>The Court of Appeal listed all four claims, found that&para;<br>two were direct, and then refused to compel arbitration on&para;<br>the complaint as a whole because the arbitral agreement&para;<br>“would not apply to the direct claims.” 51 So. 3d, at 1167.&para;<br>By not addressing the other two claims in the complaint,&para;<br>the Court of Appeal failed to give effect to the plain meaning of the Act and to the holding of Dean Witter. The&para;<br>petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded. On&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>remand, the Court of Appeal should examine the remaining two claims to determine whether either requires&para;<br>arbitration.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
