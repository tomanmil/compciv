KNOWLES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(b) Knowles concedes that federal jurisdiction cannot be based on&para;<br>contingent future events. Yet, because a stipulation must be binding&para;<br>and a named plaintiff cannot bind precertification class members, the&para;<br>amount he stipulated is in effect contingent. CAFA does not forbid a&para;<br>federal court to consider the possibility that a nonbinding, amountlimiting, stipulation may not survive the class certification process.&para;<br>To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdictional purposes, treat a&para;<br>nonbinding stipulation as if it were binding, exalt form over substance, and run counter to CAFA’s objective: ensuring “Federal court&para;<br>consideration of interstate cases of national importance.” §2(b)(2),&para;<br>119 Stat. 5.&para;<br>It may be simpler for a federal district court to value the amount in&para;<br>controversy on the basis of a stipulation, but ignoring a nonbinding&para;<br>stipulation merely requires the federal judge to do what she must do&para;<br>in cases with no stipulation: aggregate the individual class members’&para;<br>claims. While individual plaintiffs may avoid removal to federal&para;<br>court by stipulating to amounts that fall below the federal jurisdictional threshold, the key characteristic of such stipulations—missing&para;<br>here—is that they are legally binding on all plaintiffs.

GREG KNOWLES &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[March 19, 2013]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) provides&para;<br>that the federal “district courts shall have original jurisdiction” over a civil “class action” if, among other things,&para;<br>the “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of&para;<br>$5,000,000.” 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), (5). The statute&para;<br>adds that “to determine whether the matter in controversy&para;<br>exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000,” the “claims of&para;<br>the individual class members shall be aggregated.”&para;<br>§1332(d)(6).&para;<br>The question presented concerns a class-action plaintiff&para;<br>who stipulates, prior to certification of the class, that he,&para;<br>and the class he seeks to represent, will not seek damages&para;<br>that exceed $5 million in total. Does that stipulation&para;<br>remove the case from CAFA’s scope? In our view, it does&para;<br>not.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In April 2011 respondent, Greg Knowles, filed this&para;<br>proposed class action in an Arkansas state court against&para;<br>petitioner, the Standard Fire Insurance Company.&para;<br>Knowles claimed that, when the company had made cer-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tain homeowner’s insurance loss payments, it had unlawfully failed to include a general contractor fee. And&para;<br>Knowles sought to certify a class of “hundreds, and possibly thousands” of similarly harmed Arkansas policyholders. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. In describing the relief&para;<br>sought, the complaint says that the “Plaintiff and Class&para;<br>stipulate they will seek to recover total aggregate damages&para;<br>of less than five million dollars.” Id., at 60. An attached&para;<br>affidavit stipulates that Knowles “will not at any time&para;<br>during this case . . . seek damages for the class . . . in&para;<br>excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate.” Id., at 75.&para;<br>On May 18, 2011, the company, pointing to CAFA’s&para;<br>jurisdictional provision, removed the case to Federal District Court. See 28 U. S. C. §1332(d); §1453. Knowles&para;<br>argued for remand on the ground that the District Court&para;<br>lacked jurisdiction. He claimed that the “sum or value” of&para;<br>the “amount in controversy” fell beneath the $5 million&para;<br>threshold. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. On the basis of evidence presented by the company, the District Court found&para;<br>that that the “sum or value” of the “amount in controversy” would, in the absence of the stipulation, have fallen&para;<br>just above the $5 million threshold. Id., at 2, 8. Nonetheless, in light of Knowles’ stipulation, the court concluded&para;<br>that the amount fell beneath the threshold. The court consequently ordered the case remanded to the state court.&para;<br>Id., at 15.&para;<br>The company appealed from the remand order, but the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit declined to hear the appeal. Id., at 1. See&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1453(c)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (providing&para;<br>discretion to hear an appeal from a remand order). The&para;<br>company petitioned for a writ of certiorari. And, in light of&para;<br>divergent views in the lower courts, we granted the writ.&para;<br>Compare Frederick v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 683&para;<br>F. 3d 1242, 1247 (CA10 2012) (a proposed class-action&para;<br>representative’s “attempt to limit damages in the complaint is not dispositive when determining the amount in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>controversy”); with Rolwing v. Nestle Holdings, Inc.,&para;<br>666 F. 3d 1069, 1072 (CA8 2012) (a precertification “binding stipulation limiting damages sought to an amount&para;<br>not exceeding $5 million can be used to defeat CAFA&para;<br>jurisdiction”).&para;<br>II&para;<br>CAFA provides the federal district courts with “original&para;<br>jurisdiction” to hear a “class action” if the class has more&para;<br>than 100 members, the parties are minimally diverse, and&para;<br>the “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of&para;<br>$5,000,000.” 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), (5)(B). To “determine whether the matter in controversy” exceeds that&para;<br>sum, “the claims of the individual class members shall&para;<br>be aggregated.” §1332(d)(6). And those “class members”&para;<br>include “persons (named or unnamed) who fall within the&para;<br>definition of the proposed or certified class.” §1332(d)&para;<br>(1)(D) (emphasis added).&para;<br>As applied here, the statute tells the District Court to&para;<br>determine whether it has jurisdiction by adding up the&para;<br>value of the claim of each person who falls within the&para;<br>definition of Knowles’ proposed class and determine&para;<br>whether the resulting sum exceeds $5 million. If so, there&para;<br>is jurisdiction and the court may proceed with the case.&para;<br>The District Court in this case found that resulting sum&para;<br>would have exceeded $5 million but for the stipulation.&para;<br>And we must decide whether the stipulation makes a&para;<br>critical difference.&para;<br>In our view, it does not. Our reason is a simple one:&para;<br>Stipulations must be binding. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence&para;<br>§2588, p. 821 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (defining a “judicial&para;<br>admission or stipulation” as an “express waiver made . . .&para;<br>by the party or his attorney conceding for the purposes of&para;<br>the trial the truth of some alleged fact” (emphasis deleted));&para;<br>Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(slip op., at 10) (describing a stipulation as “ ‘binding and&para;<br>conclusive’ ” and “ ‘not subject to subsequent variation’ ”&para;<br>(quoting 83 C. J. S., Stipulations §93 (2000))); 9 Wigmore,&para;<br>supra, §2590, at 822 (the “vital feature” of a judicial admission is “universally conceded to be its conclusiveness&para;<br>upon the party making it”). The stipulation Knowles proffered to the District Court, however, does not speak for&para;<br>those he purports to represent.&para;<br>That is because a plaintiff who files a proposed class&para;<br>action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class&para;<br>before the class is certified. See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15) (“Neither a proposed&para;<br>class action nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties”); id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (“ ‘[A] nonnamed class&para;<br>member is [not] a party to the class-action litigation before&para;<br>the class is certified’ ” (quoting Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536&para;<br>U. S. 1, 16, n. 1 (2002) (SCALIA, J., dissenting))); Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 12 (conceding that “a damages limitation . . .&para;<br>cannot have a binding effect on the merits of absent class&para;<br>members’ claims unless and until the class is certified”).&para;<br>Because his precertification stipulation does not bind&para;<br>anyone but himself, Knowles has not reduced the value&para;<br>of the putative class members’ claims. For jurisdictional&para;<br>purposes, our inquiry is limited to examining the case “as&para;<br>of the time it was filed in state court,” Wisconsin Dept.&para;<br>of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U. S. 381, 390 (1998). At&para;<br>that point, Knowles lacked the authority to concede the&para;<br>amount-in-controversy issue for the absent class members.&para;<br>The Federal District Court, therefore, wrongly concluded&para;<br>that Knowles’ precertification stipulation could overcome&para;<br>its finding that the CAFA jurisdictional threshold had&para;<br>been met.&para;<br>Knowles concedes that “[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be&para;<br>based on contingent future events.” Brief for Respondent&para;<br>20. Yet the two legal principles to which we have just&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>referred—that stipulations must be binding and that a&para;<br>named plaintiff cannot bind precertification class members—mean that the amount to which Knowles has stipulated is in effect contingent.&para;<br>If, for example, as Knowles’ complaint asserts, “hundreds, and possibly thousands” of persons in Arkansas&para;<br>have similar claims, App. to Pet. for Cert. 66, and if each&para;<br>of those claims places a significant sum in controversy, the&para;<br>state court might certify the class and permit the case to&para;<br>proceed, but only on the condition that the stipulation be&para;<br>excised. Or a court might find that Knowles is an inadequate representative due to the artificial cap he purports&para;<br>to impose on the class’ recovery. E.g., Back Doctors Ltd. v.&para;<br>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 637 F. 3d 827, 830–&para;<br>831 (CA7 2011) (noting a class representative’s fiduciary&para;<br>duty not to “throw away what could be a major component&para;<br>of the class’s recovery”). Similarly, another class member could intervene with an amended complaint (without&para;<br>a stipulation), and the District Court might permit the&para;<br>action to proceed with a new representative. See 5 A.&para;<br>Conte &amp; H. Newberg, Class Actions §16:7, p. 154 (4th ed.&para;<br>2002) (“[M]embers of a class have a right to intervene if&para;<br>their interests are not adequately represented by existing&para;<br>parties”). Even were these possibilities remote in Knowles’&para;<br>own case, there is no reason to think them farfetched in&para;<br>other cases where similar stipulations could have more&para;<br>dramatic amount-lowering effects.&para;<br>The strongest counterargument, we believe, takes a syllogistic form: First, this complaint contains a presently&para;<br>nonbinding stipulation that the class will seek damages&para;<br>that amount to less than $5 million. Second, if the state&para;<br>court eventually certifies that class, the stipulation will&para;<br>bind those who choose to remain as class members. Third,&para;<br>if the state court eventually insists upon modification of&para;<br>the stipulation (thereby permitting class members to&para;<br>obtain more than $5 million), it will have in effect created&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a new, different case. Fourth, CAFA, however, permits the&para;<br>federal court to consider only the complaint that the plaintiff has filed, i.e., this complaint, not a new, modified (or&para;<br>amended) complaint that might eventually emerge.&para;<br>Our problem with this argument lies in its conclusion.&para;<br>We do not agree that CAFA forbids the federal court to&para;<br>consider, for purposes of determining the amount in controversy, the very real possibility that a nonbinding,&para;<br>amount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class&para;<br>certification process. This potential outcome does not result in the creation of a new case not now before the&para;<br>federal court. To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdictional purposes, treat a nonbinding stipulation as if it&para;<br>were binding, exalt form over substance, and run directly&para;<br>counter to CAFA’s primary objective: ensuring “Federal&para;<br>court consideration of interstate cases of national importance.” §2(b)(2), 119 Stat. 5. It would also have the effect of allowing the subdivision of a $100 million action&para;<br>into 21 just-below-$5-million state-court actions simply by&para;<br>including nonbinding stipulations; such an outcome would&para;<br>squarely conflict with the statute’s objective.&para;<br>We agree with Knowles that a federal district court&para;<br>might find it simpler to value the amount in controversy&para;<br>on the basis of a stipulation than to aggregate the value of&para;<br>the individual claims of all who meet the class description.&para;<br>We also agree that, when judges must decide jurisdictional&para;<br>matters, simplicity is a virtue. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend,&para;<br>559 U. S. 77, 94 (2010). But to ignore a nonbinding stipulation does no more than require the federal judge to do&para;<br>what she must do in cases without a stipulation and what&para;<br>the statute requires, namely “aggregat[e]” the “claims of&para;<br>the individual class members.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6).&para;<br>Knowles also points out that federal courts permit individual plaintiffs, who are the masters of their complaints,&para;<br>to avoid removal to federal court, and to obtain a remand&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to state court, by stipulating to amounts at issue that fall&para;<br>below the federal jurisdictional requirement. That is so.&para;<br>See St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303&para;<br>U. S. 283, 294 (1938) (“If [a plaintiff] does not desire to try&para;<br>his case in the federal court he may resort to the expedient of suing for less than the jurisdictional amount, and&para;<br>though he would be justly entitled to more, the defendant&para;<br>cannot remove”). But the key characteristic about those&para;<br>stipulations is that they are legally binding on all plaintiffs. See 14AA C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3702.1, p. 335 (4th ed. 2011)&para;<br>(federal court, as condition for remand, can insist on a&para;<br>“binding affidavit or stipulation that the plaintiff will&para;<br>continue to claim less than the jurisdictional amount” (emphasis added)). That essential feature is missing here, as&para;<br>Knowles cannot yet bind the absent class.&para;<br>Knowles argues in the alternative that a stipulation is&para;<br>binding to the extent it limits attorney’s fees so that the&para;<br>amount in controversy remains below the CAFA threshold. We do not consider this issue because Knowles’ stipulation did not provide for that option.&para;<br>In sum, the stipulation at issue here can tie Knowles’&para;<br>hands, but it does not resolve the amount-in-controversy&para;<br>question in light of his inability to bind the rest of the&para;<br>class. For this reason, we believe the District Court, when&para;<br>following the statute to aggregate the proposed class&para;<br>members’ claims, should have ignored that stipulation.&para;<br>Because it did not, we vacate the judgment below and&para;<br>remand the case for further proceedings consistent with&para;<br>this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
