KENTUCKY&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY&para;<br>No. 08–651.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 13, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for&para;<br>over 40 years, faces deportation after pleading guilty to drug&para;<br>distribution charges in Kentucky. In postconviction proceedings, he&para;<br>claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this conse&para;<br>quence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry&para;<br>about deportation since he had lived in this country so long. He al&para;<br>leges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incor&para;<br>rect advice. The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconvic&para;<br>tion relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendment’s effective&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from er&para;<br>roneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a “collat&para;<br>eral” consequence of a conviction.&para;<br>Held: Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a&para;<br>risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel&para;<br>was constitutionally deficient. Whether he is entitled to relief de&para;<br>pends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter not addressed&para;<br>here. Pp. 2–18.&para;<br>(a) Changes to immigration law have dramatically raised the&para;<br>stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal conviction. While once there was&para;<br>only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad&para;<br>discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms&para;<br>have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited judges’&para;<br>authority to alleviate deportation’s harsh consequences. Because the&para;<br>drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable&para;<br>for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes, the importance&para;<br>of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never&para;<br>been more important. Thus, as a matter of federal law, deportation is&para;<br>an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen de&para;<br>fendants who plead guilty to specified crimes. Pp. 2–6.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(b) Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, applies to Padilla’s&para;<br>claim. Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is enti&para;<br>tled to “the effective assistance of competent counsel.” McMann v.&para;<br>Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771. The Supreme Court of Kentucky re&para;<br>jected Padilla’s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he&para;<br>sought about deportation concerned only collateral matters. How&para;<br>ever, this Court has never distinguished between direct and collat&para;<br>eral consequences in defining the scope of constitutionally “reason&para;<br>able professional assistance” required under Strickland, 466 U. S., at&para;<br>689. The question whether that distinction is appropriate need not&para;<br>be considered in this case because of the unique nature of deporta&para;<br>tion. Although removal proceedings are civil, deportation is inti&para;<br>mately related to the criminal process, which makes it uniquely diffi&para;<br>cult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence. Because&para;<br>that distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a Strickland claim&para;<br>concerning the specific risk of deportation, advice regarding deporta&para;<br>tion is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment right to counsel. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(c) To satisfy Strickland’s two-prong inquiry, counsel’s representa&para;<br>tion must fall “below an objective standard of reasonableness,” 466&para;<br>U. S., at 688, and there must be “a reasonable probability that, but&para;<br>for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would&para;<br>have been different,” id., at 694. The first, constitutional deficiency,&para;<br>is necessarily linked to the legal community’s practice and expecta&para;<br>tions. Id., at 688. The weight of prevailing professional norms sup&para;<br>ports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the de&para;<br>portation risk. And this Court has recognized the importance to the&para;<br>client of “ ‘[p]reserving the . . . right to remain in the United States’ ”&para;<br>and “preserving the possibility of” discretionary relief from deporta&para;<br>tion. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 323. Thus, this is not a hard case&para;<br>in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla’s plea could&para;<br>easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deporta&para;<br>tion was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel’s advice was in&para;<br>correct. There will, however, undoubtedly be numerous situations in&para;<br>which the deportation consequences of a plea are unclear. In those&para;<br>cases, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a&para;<br>noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry adverse&para;<br>immigration consequences. But when the deportation consequence is&para;<br>truly clear, as it was here, the duty to give correct advice is equally&para;<br>clear. Accepting Padilla’s allegations as true, he has sufficiently al&para;<br>leged constitutional deficiency to satisfy Strickland’s first prong.&para;<br>Whether he can satisfy the second prong, prejudice, is left for the&para;<br>Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>(d) The Solicitor General’s proposed rule—that Strickland should&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>be applied to Padilla’s claim only to the extent that he has alleged af&para;<br>firmative misadvice—is unpersuasive. And though this Court must&para;<br>be careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of&para;<br>guilty pleas, the 25 years since Strickland was first applied to inef&para;<br>fective-assistance claims at the plea stage have shown that pleas are&para;<br>less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions&para;<br>after a trial. Also, informed consideration of possible deportation can&para;<br>benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants, who may be able to&para;<br>reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.&para;<br>This decision will not open the floodgates to challenges of convictions&para;<br>obtained through plea bargains.

Padilla served this Nation with honor as a&para;<br>member of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam&para;<br>War. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the&para;<br>transportation of a large amount of marijuana in his&para;<br>tractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.1&para;<br>In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his&para;<br>counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence&para;<br>prior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he&para;<br>“ ‘did not have to worry about immigration status since he&para;<br>had been in the country so long.’ ” 253 S. W. 3d 482, 483&para;<br>(Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel’s erroneous ad&para;<br>vice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made&para;<br>his deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he&para;<br>would have insisted on going to trial if he had not received&para;<br>incorrect advice from his attorney.&para;<br>Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Padilla’s crime, like virtually every drug offense except for only the&para;<br>most insignificant marijuana offenses, is a deportable offense under 8&para;<br>U.

KENTUCKY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief&para;<br>without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court&para;<br>held that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of effective&para;<br>assistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant&para;<br>from erroneous advice about deportation because it is&para;<br>merely a “collateral” consequence of his conviction. Id., at&para;<br>485. In its view, neither counsel’s failure to advise peti&para;<br>tioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel’s incor&para;<br>rect advice, could provide a basis for relief.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to decide&para;<br>whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla’s counsel had&para;<br>an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he&para;<br>was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this&para;<br>country. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally&para;<br>competent counsel would have advised him that his con&para;<br>viction for drug distribution made him subject to auto&para;<br>matic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief de&para;<br>pends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that&para;<br>we do not address.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The landscape of federal immigration law has changed&para;<br>dramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was&para;<br>only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges&para;<br>wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deporta&para;<br>tion, immigration reforms over time have expanded the&para;<br>class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of&para;<br>judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.&para;<br>The “drastic measure” of deportation or removal, Fong&para;<br>Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.

Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration&para;<br>Law and Procedure §1.(2)(a), p. 5 (1959). An early effort to&para;<br>empower the President to order the deportation of those&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Gordon §1.2, at 5. It&para;<br>was not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute&para;<br>barring convicts and prostitutes from entering the coun&para;<br>try, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477. Gordon&para;<br>§1.2b, at 6. In 1891, Congress added to the list of exclud&para;<br>able persons those “who have been convicted of a felony or&para;<br>other infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral&para;<br>turpitude.” Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.2&para;<br>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1917 (1917 Act)&para;<br>brought “radical changes” to our law. S. Rep. No. 1515,&para;<br>81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 54–55 (1950). For the first time&para;<br>in our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens de&para;<br>portable based on conduct committed on American soil.&para;<br>Id., at 55. Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the de&para;<br>portation of “any alien who is hereafter sentenced to im&para;<br>prisonment for a term of one year or more because of&para;<br>conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpi&para;<br>tude, committed within five years after the entry of the&para;<br>alien to the United States . . . .” 39 Stat. 889. And §19&para;<br>also rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who com&para;<br>mit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time&para;<br>after entry. Ibid. Congress did not, however, define the&para;<br>term “moral turpitude.”&para;<br>While the 1917 Act was “radical” because it authorized&para;<br>deportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the&para;<br>Act also included a critically important procedural protec&para;<br>tion to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the&para;<br>time of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sen&para;<br>tencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had&para;<br>the power to make a recommendation “that such alien&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In 1907, Congress expanded the class of excluded persons to include&para;<br>individuals who “admit” to having committed a crime of moral turpi&para;<br>tude. Act of Feb. 20, 1907, ch. 1134, 34 Stat. 899.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>shall not be deported.” Id., at 890.3 This procedure,&para;<br>known as a judicial recommendation against deportation,&para;<br>or JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to pre&para;<br>vent deportation; the statute was “consistently . . . inter&para;<br>preted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority&para;<br>to decide whether a particular conviction should be disre&para;<br>garded as a basis for deportation,” Janvier v. United&para;<br>States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917&para;<br>forward, there was no such creature as an automatically&para;<br>deportable offense. Even as the class of deportable of&para;<br>fenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate&para;<br>unjust results on a case-by-case basis.&para;<br>Although narcotics offenses—such as the offense at&para;<br>issue in this case—provided a distinct basis for deporta&para;<br>tion as early as 1922,4 the JRAD procedure was generally&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 As&para;<br>&para;<br>enacted, the statute provided:&para;<br>“That the provision of this section respecting the deportation of aliens&para;<br>convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude shall not apply to one&para;<br>who has been pardoned, nor shall such deportation be made or directed&para;<br>if the court, or judge thereof, sentencing such alien for such crime shall,&para;<br>at the time of imposing judgment or passing sentence or within thirty&para;<br>days thereafter, . . . make a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor&para;<br>that such alien shall not be deported in pursuance of this Act.” 1917&para;<br>Act, 39 Stat. 889–890.&para;<br>This provision was codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.) (transferred&para;<br>to §1227 (2006 ed. )). The judge’s nondeportation recommendation was&para;<br>binding on the Secretary of Labor and, later, the Attorney General after&para;<br>control of immigration removal matters was transferred from the&para;<br>former to the latter. See Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452&para;<br>(CA2 1986).&para;<br>4 Congress first identified narcotics offenses as a special category of&para;<br>crimes triggering deportation in the 1922 Narcotic Drug Act. Act of&para;<br>May 26, 1922, ch. 202, 42 Stat. 596. After the 1922 Act took effect,&para;<br>there was some initial confusion over whether a narcotics offense also&para;<br>had to be a crime of moral turpitude for an individual to be deportable.&para;<br>See Weedin v. Moy Fat, 8 F. 2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an&para;<br>individual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because&para;<br>offense did not involve moral turpitude). However, lower courts even&para;<br>tually agreed that the narcotics offense provision was “special,” Chung&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>available to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions.&para;<br>See United States v. O’Rourke, 213 F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8&para;<br>1954). Except for “technical, inadvertent and insignificant&para;<br>violations of the laws relating to narcotics,” ibid., it ap&para;<br>pears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes&para;<br>involving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act’s&para;<br>broad JRAD provision. See ibid. (recognizing that until&para;<br>1952 a JRAD in a narcotics case “was effective to prevent&para;<br>deportation” (citing Dang Nam v. Bryan, 74 F. 2d 379,&para;<br>380–381 (CA9 1934))).&para;<br>In light of both the steady expansion of deportable&para;<br>offenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD,&para;<br>it is unsurprising that, in the wake of Strickland v. Wash&para;<br>ington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the Second Circuit held that&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of&para;<br>counsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see&para;<br>Janvier, 793 F. 2d 449. See also United States v. Castro,&para;<br>26 F. 3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was&para;<br>“part of the sentencing” process, Janvier, 793 F. 2d, at 452,&para;<br>even if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Sec&para;<br>ond Circuit’s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a&para;<br>noncitizen’s ability to remain in the country was a central&para;<br>issue to be resolved during the sentencing process—not&para;<br>merely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel’s&para;<br>duty to provide effective representation.&para;<br>However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our&para;<br>law. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in&para;<br>the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),5 and in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Que Fong v. Nagle, 15 F. 2d 789, 790 (CA9 1926); thus, a narcotics&para;<br>offense did not need also to be a crime of moral turpitude (or to satisfy&para;<br>other requirements of the 1917 Act) to trigger deportation. See United&para;<br>States ex rel. Grimaldi v. Ebey, 12 F. 2d 922, 923 (CA7 1926); Todaro v.&para;<br>Munster, 62 F. 2d 963, 964 (CA10 1933).&para;<br>5 The Act separately codified the moral turpitude offense provision&para;<br>and the narcotics offense provision within 8 U. S. C. §1251(a) (1994 ed.)&para;<br>under subsections (a)(4) and (a)(11), respectively. See 66 Stat. 201, 204,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In&para;<br>1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General’s&para;<br>authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation,&para;<br>110 Stat. 3009–596, an authority that had been exercised&para;<br>to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens&para;<br>during the 5-year period prior to 1996, INS v. St. Cyr, 533&para;<br>U. S. 289, 296 (2001). Under contemporary law, if a non&para;<br>citizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996&para;<br>effective date of these amendments, his removal is practi&para;<br>cally inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited&para;<br>remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney&para;<br>General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of&para;<br>particular classes of offenses.6 See 8 U. S. C. §1229b.&para;<br>Subject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is&para;<br>not available for an offense related to trafficking in a&para;<br>controlled substance. See §1101(a)(43)(B); §1228.&para;<br>These changes to our immigration law have dramati&para;<br>cally raised the stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal convic&para;<br>tion. The importance of accurate legal advice for nonciti&para;<br>zens accused of crimes has never been more important.&para;<br>These changes confirm our view that, as a matter of fed&para;<br>eral law, deportation is an integral part—indeed, some&para;<br>times the most important part 7—of the penalty that may&para;<br>be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to&para;<br>specified crimes.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>206. The JRAD procedure, codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.),&para;<br>applied only to the “provisions of subsection (a)(4),” the crimes-of-moral&para;<br>turpitude provision. 66 Stat. 208; see United States v. O’Rourke, 213&para;<br>F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954) (recognizing that, under the 1952 Act,&para;<br>narcotics offenses were no longer eligible for JRADs).&para;<br>6 The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in&para;<br>nomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term “removal” rather&para;<br>than “deportation.” See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U. S. 348, 350,&para;<br>n. 1 (2001).&para;<br>7 See Brief for Asian American Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae&para;<br>12–27 (providing real-world examples).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

W. 3d, at 483–484 (citing Commonwealth v. Fuar&para;<br>tado, 170 S. W. 3d 384 (2005)). In its view, “collateral&para;<br>consequences are outside the scope of representation&para;<br>required by the Sixth Amendment,” and, therefore, the&para;<br>“failure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of&para;<br>possible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a&para;<br>claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.” 253 S. W. 3d,&para;<br>at 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this&para;<br>view.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 There is some disagreement among the courts over how to distin&para;<br>guish between direct and collateral consequences. See Roberts, Igno&para;<br>rance is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misin&para;<br>formation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa L. Rev. 119, 124, n. 15&para;<br>(2009). The disagreement over how to apply the direct/collateral&para;<br>distinction has no bearing on the disposition of this case because, as&para;<br>even JUSTICE ALITO agrees, counsel must, at the very least, advise a&para;<br>noncitizen “defendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse&para;<br>immigration consequences,” post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).&para;<br>See also post, at 14 (“I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinforma&para;<br>tion”). In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO has thus departed from&para;<br>the strict rule applied by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and in the&para;<br>two federal cases that he cites, post, at 2.&para;<br>9 See, e.g., United States v.

Whether&para;<br>that distinction is appropriate is a question we need not&para;<br>consider in this case because of the unique nature of&para;<br>deportation.&para;<br>We have long recognized that deportation is a particu&para;<br>larly severe “penalty,” Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149&para;<br>U. S. 698, 740 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a&para;<br>criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil&para;<br>in nature, see INS v.

This is not a hard&para;<br>case in which to find deficiency: The consequences of&para;<br>Padilla’s plea could easily be determined from reading the&para;<br>removal statute, his deportation was presumptively man&para;<br>datory, and his counsel’s advice was incorrect.&para;<br>Immigration law can be complex, and it is a legal spe&para;<br>cialty of its own.

It is quintessentially the&para;<br>duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice&para;<br>about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so&para;<br>“clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analy&para;<br>sis.” Hill v.

We con&para;<br>fronted a similar “floodgates” concern in Hill, see id., at&para;<br>58, but nevertheless applied Strickland to a claim that&para;<br>counsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole&para;<br>eligibility before he pleaded guilty.12&para;<br>A flood did not follow in that decision’s wake.

Moreover, to obtain relief on this type of&para;<br>claim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision&para;<br>to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under&para;<br>the circumstances. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S.&para;<br>470, 480, 486 (2000).

For at least the past 15 years,&para;<br>professional norms have generally imposed an obligation&para;<br>on counsel to provide advice on the deportation conse&para;<br>quences of a client’s plea. See, supra, at 11–13. We&para;<br>should, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their&para;<br>obligation to render competent advice at the time their&para;<br>clients considered pleading guilty. Strickland, 466 U.

Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal&para;<br>convictions.13 But they account for only approximately&para;<br>30% of the habeas petitions filed.14 The nature of relief&para;<br>secured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty&para;<br>plea—an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to&para;<br>trial—imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those&para;<br>who collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of&para;<br>the bargain obtained as a result of the plea.

By bringing deporta&para;<br>tion consequences into this process, the defense and prose&para;<br>cution may well be able to reach agreements that better&para;<br>satisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a&para;<br>criminal episode may provide the basis for multiple&para;<br>charges, of which only a subset mandate deportation&para;<br>following conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudi&para;<br>mentary understanding of the deportation consequences of&para;<br>a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain&para;<br>creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction&para;<br>and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as&para;<br>by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically&para;<br>triggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the&para;<br>threat of deportation may provide the defendant with a&para;<br>powerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does&para;<br>not mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a&para;<br>charge that does.&para;<br>In sum, we have long recognized that the negotiation of&para;<br>a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes&para;<br>of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of&para;<br>counsel.

The Court nevertheless holds&para;<br>that a criminal defense attorney must provide advice in&para;<br>this specialized area in those cases in which the law is&para;<br>“succinct and straightforward”—but not, perhaps, in other&para;<br>situations. Ante, at 11–12. This vague, halfway test will&para;<br>lead to much confusion and needless litigation.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Under Strickland, an attorney provides ineffective&para;<br>assistance if the attorney’s representation does not meet&para;<br>reasonable professional standards. 466 U. S., at 688.&para;<br>Until today, the longstanding and unanimous position of&para;<br>the federal courts was that reasonable defense counsel&para;<br>generally need only advise a client about the direct conse&para;<br>quences of a criminal conviction. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Gonzalez, 202 F. 3d 20, 28 (CA1 2000) (ineffective&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim fails if “based on an attorney’s&para;<br>failure to advise a client of his plea’s immigration conse&para;<br>quences”); United States v. Banda, 1 F. 3d 354, 355 (CA5&para;<br>1993) (holding that “an attorney’s failure to advise a client&para;<br>that deportation is a possible consequence of a guilty plea&para;<br>does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel”); see&para;<br>generally Chin &amp; Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel&para;<br>and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev.&para;<br>697, 699 (2002) (hereinafter Chin &amp; Holmes) (noting that&para;<br>“virtually all jurisdictions”—including “eleven federal&para;<br>circuits, more than thirty states, and the District of Co&para;<br>lumbia”—“hold that defense counsel need not discuss with&para;<br>their clients the collateral consequences of a conviction,”&para;<br>including deportation). While the line between “direct”&para;<br>and “collateral” consequences is not always clear, see ante,&para;<br>at 7, n. 8, the collateral-consequences rule expresses an&para;<br>important truth: Criminal defense attorneys have exper&para;<br>tise regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings. They&para;<br>are not expected to possess—and very often do not pos&para;<br>sess—expertise in other areas of the law, and it is unreal&para;<br>istic to expect them to provide expert advice on matters&para;<br>that lie outside their area of training and experience.&para;<br>This case happens to involve removal, but criminal&para;<br>convictions can carry a wide variety of consequences other&para;<br>than conviction and sentencing, including civil commit&para;<br>ment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disquali&para;<br>fication from public benefits, ineligibility to possess fire&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Chin &amp; Holmes&para;<br>705–706. A criminal conviction may also severely damage&para;<br>a defendant’s reputation and thus impair the defendant’s&para;<br>ability to obtain future employment or business opportuni&para;<br>ties. All of those consequences are “seriou[s],” see ante, at&para;<br>17, but this Court has never held that a criminal defense&para;<br>attorney’s Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing&para;<br>advice about such matters.&para;<br>The Court tries to justify its dramatic departure from&para;<br>precedent by pointing to the views of various professional&para;<br>organizations. See ante, at 9 (“The weight of prevailing&para;<br>professional norms supports the view that counsel must&para;<br>advise her client regarding the risk of deportation”).&para;<br>However, ascertaining the level of professional competence&para;<br>required by the Sixth Amendment is ultimately a task for&para;<br>the courts. E.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 477&para;<br>(2000). Although we may appropriately consult standards&para;<br>promulgated by private bar groups, we cannot delegate to&para;<br>these groups our task of determining what the Constitu&para;<br>tion commands. See Strickland, supra, at 688 (explaining&para;<br>that “[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in Ameri&para;<br>can Bar Association standards . . . are guides to determin&para;<br>ing what is reasonable, but they are only guides”). And we&para;<br>must recognize that such standards may represent only&para;<br>the aspirations of a bar group rather than an empirical&para;<br>assessment of actual practice.&para;<br>Even if the only relevant consideration were “prevailing&para;<br>professional norms,” it is hard to see how those norms can&para;<br>support the duty the Court today imposes on defense&para;<br>counsel. Because many criminal defense attorneys have&para;<br>little understanding of immigration law, see ante, at 11, it&para;<br>should follow that a criminal defense attorney who re&para;<br>frains from providing immigration advice does not violate&para;<br>prevailing professional norms. But the Court’s opinion&para;<br>would not just require defense counsel to warn the client&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>of a general risk of removal; it would also require counsel&para;<br>in at least some cases, to specify what the removal conse&para;<br>quences of a conviction would be. See ante, at 11–12.&para;<br>The Court’s new approach is particularly problematic&para;<br>because providing advice on whether a conviction for a&para;<br>particular offense will make an alien removable is often&para;<br>quite complex. “Most crimes affecting immigration status&para;<br>are not specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and&para;<br>Nationality Act (INA)], but instead fall under a broad&para;<br>category of crimes, such as crimes involving moral turpi&para;<br>tude or aggravated felonies.” M. Garcia &amp; L. Eig, CRS&para;<br>Report for Congress, Immigration Consequences of Crimi&para;<br>nal Activity (Sept. 20, 2006) (summary) (emphasis in&para;<br>original). As has been widely acknowledged, determining&para;<br>whether a particular crime is an “aggravated felony” or a&para;<br>“crime involving moral turpitude [(CIMT)]” is not an easy&para;<br>task. See R. McWhirter, ABA, The Criminal Lawyer’s&para;<br>Guide to Immigration Law: Questions and Answers 128&para;<br>(2d ed. 2006) (hereinafter ABA Guidebook) (“Because of&para;<br>the increased complexity of aggravated felony law, this&para;<br>edition devotes a new [30-page] chapter to the subject”);&para;<br>id., §5.2, at 146 (stating that the aggravated felony list at&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43) is not clear with respect to several&para;<br>of the listed categories, that “the term ‘aggravated felonies’&para;<br>can include misdemeanors,” and that the determination of&para;<br>whether a crime is an “aggravated felony” is made “even&para;<br>more difficult” because “several agencies and courts inter&para;<br>pret the statute,” including Immigration and Customs&para;<br>Enforcement, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),&para;<br>and Federal Circuit and district courts considering immi&para;<br>gration-law and criminal-law issues); ABA Guidebook&para;<br>§4.65, at 130 (“Because nothing is ever simple with immi&para;<br>gration law, the terms ‘conviction,’ ‘moral turpitude,’ and&para;<br>‘single scheme of criminal misconduct’ are terms of art”);&para;<br>id., §4.67, at 130 (“[T]he term ‘moral turpitude’ evades&para;<br>precise definition”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

After a dizzying paragraph that attempts to&para;<br>explain the evolution of the Ninth Circuit’s view, the ABA&para;<br>Guidebook continues: “Adding to the confusion, however,&para;<br>is that the Ninth Circuit has conflicting opinions depend&para;<br>ing on the context on whether simple drug possession&para;<br>constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1101(a)(43).” Id., §5.35, at 161 (citing cases distinguish&para;<br>ing between whether a simple possession offense is an&para;<br>aggravated felony “for immigration purposes” or for “sen&para;<br>tencing purposes”). The ABA Guidebook then proceeds to&para;<br>explain that “attempted possession,” id., §5.36, at 161&para;<br>(emphasis added), of a controlled substance is an aggra&para;<br>vated felony, while “[c]onviction under the federal acces&para;<br>sory after the fact statute is probably not an aggravated&para;<br>felony, but a conviction for accessory after the fact to the&para;<br>manufacture of methamphetamine is an aggravated fel&para;<br>ony,” id., §537, at 161 (emphasis added). Conspiracy or&para;<br>attempt to commit drug trafficking are aggravated felo&para;<br>nies, but “[s]olicitation is not a drug-trafficking offense&para;<br>because a generic solicitation offense is not an offense&para;<br>related to a controlled substance and therefore not an&para;<br>aggravated felony.” Id., §5.41, at 162.&para;<br>Determining whether a particular crime is one involving&para;<br>moral turpitude is no easier. See id., at 134 (“Writing bad&para;<br>checks may or may not be a CIMT” (emphasis added));&para;<br>ibid.

To take just a few examples, it&para;<br>may be hard, in some cases, for defense counsel even to&para;<br>determine whether a client is an alien,1 or whether a&para;<br>particular state disposition will result in a “conviction” for&para;<br>purposes of federal immigration law.2 The task of offering&para;<br>advice about the immigration consequences of a criminal&para;<br>conviction is further complicated by other problems, in&para;<br>cluding significant variations among Circuit interpreta&para;<br>tions of federal immigration statutes; the frequency with&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Citizens&para;<br>&para;<br>are not deportable, but “[q]uestions of citizenship are not&para;<br>always simple.” ABA Guidebook §4.20, at 113 (explaining that U.S.&para;<br>citizenship conferred by blood is “ ‘derivative,’ ” and that “[d]erivative&para;<br>citizenship depends on a number of confusing factors, including&para;<br>whether the citizen parent was the mother or father, the immigration&para;<br>laws in effect at the time of the parents’ and/or defendant’s birth, and&para;<br>the parents’ marital status”).&para;<br>2 “A disposition that is not a ‘conviction,’ under state law may still be&para;<br>a ‘conviction’ for immigration purposes.” Id., §4.32, at 117 (citing&para;<br>Matter of Salazar, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 223, 231 (BIA 2002) (en banc)). For&para;<br>example, state law may define the term “conviction” not to include a&para;<br>deferred adjudication, but such an adjudication would be deemed a&para;<br>conviction for purposes of federal immigration law. See ABA Guide&para;<br>book §4.37; accord, D. Kesselbrenner &amp; L.

ABA Guidebook §4.65, at&para;<br>130; Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1. I therefore can&para;<br>not agree with the Court’s apparent view that the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment requires criminal defense attorneys to pro&para;<br>vide immigration advice.&para;<br>The Court tries to downplay the severity of the burden it&para;<br>imposes on defense counsel by suggesting that the scope of&para;<br>counsel’s duty to offer advice concerning deportation con&para;<br>sequences may turn on how hard it is to determine those&para;<br>consequences. Where “the terms of the relevant immigra&para;<br>tion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the&para;<br>removal consequence[s]” of a conviction, the Court says,&para;<br>counsel has an affirmative duty to advise the client that&para;<br>he will be subject to deportation as a result of the plea.&para;<br>Ante, at 11. But “[w]hen the law is not succinct and&para;<br>straightforward . . . , a criminal defense attorney need do&para;<br>no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending&para;<br>criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration&para;<br>consequences.” Ante, at 11–12. This approach is problem&para;<br>atic for at least four reasons.&para;<br>First, it will not always be easy to tell whether a par&para;<br>ticular statutory provision is “succinct, clear, and explicit.”&para;<br>How can an attorney who lacks general immigration law&para;<br>expertise be sure that a seemingly clear statutory provi&para;<br>sion actually means what it seems to say when read in&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>isolation? What if the application of the provision to a&para;<br>particular case is not clear but a cursory examination of&para;<br>case law or administrative decisions would provide a&para;<br>definitive answer? See Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1,&para;<br>at 2–2 (“Unfortunately, a practitioner or respondent can&para;<br>not tell easily whether a conviction is for a removable&para;<br>offense. . . . [T]he cautious practitioner or apprehensive&para;<br>respondent will not know conclusively the future immigra&para;<br>tion consequences of a guilty plea”).&para;<br>Second, if defense counsel must provide advice regard&para;<br>ing only one of the many collateral consequences of a&para;<br>criminal conviction, many defendants are likely to be&para;<br>misled. To take just one example, a conviction for a par&para;<br>ticular offense may render an alien excludable but not&para;<br>removable. If an alien charged with such an offense is&para;<br>advised only that pleading guilty to such an offense will&para;<br>not result in removal, the alien may be induced to enter a&para;<br>guilty plea without realizing that a consequence of the&para;<br>plea is that the alien will be unable to reenter the United&para;<br>States if the alien returns to his or her home country for&para;<br>any reason, such as to visit an elderly parent or to attend&para;<br>a funeral. See ABA Guidebook §4.14, at 111 (“Often the&para;<br>alien is both excludable and removable. At times, how&para;<br>ever, the lists are different. Thus, the oddity of an alien&para;<br>that is inadmissible but not deportable. This alien should&para;<br>not leave the United States because the government will&para;<br>not let him back in” (emphasis in original)). Incomplete&para;<br>legal advice may be worse than no advice at all because it&para;<br>may mislead and may dissuade the client from seeking&para;<br>advice from a more knowledgeable source.&para;<br>Third, the Court’s rigid constitutional rule could inad&para;<br>vertently head off more promising ways of addressing the&para;<br>underlying problem—such as statutory or administrative&para;<br>reforms requiring trial judges to inform a defendant on the&para;<br>record that a guilty plea may carry adverse immigration&para;<br>consequences. As amici point out, “28 states and the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>District of Columbia have already adopted rules, plea&para;<br>forms, or statutes requiring courts to advise criminal&para;<br>defendants of the possible immigration consequences of&para;<br>their pleas.” Brief for State of Louisiana et al. 25; accord,&para;<br>Chin &amp; Holmes 708 (“A growing number of states require&para;<br>advice about deportation by statute or court rule”). A&para;<br>nonconstitutional rule requiring trial judges to inform&para;<br>defendants on the record of the risk of adverse immigra&para;<br>tion consequences can ensure that a defendant receives&para;<br>needed information without putting a large number of&para;<br>criminal convictions at risk; and because such a warning&para;<br>would be given on the record, courts would not later have&para;<br>to determine whether the defendant was misrepresenting&para;<br>the advice of counsel. Likewise, flexible statutory proce&para;<br>dures for withdrawing guilty pleas might give courts&para;<br>appropriate discretion to determine whether the interests&para;<br>of justice would be served by allowing a particular defen&para;<br>dant to withdraw a plea entered into on the basis of in&para;<br>complete information. Cf. United States v. Russell, 686&para;<br>F. 2d 35, 39–40 (CADC 1982) (explaining that a district&para;<br>court’s discretion to set aside a guilty plea under the Fed&para;<br>eral Rules of Criminal Procedure should be guided by,&para;<br>among other considerations, “the possible existence of&para;<br>prejudice to the government’s case as a result of the de&para;<br>fendant’s untimely request to stand trial” and “the&para;<br>strength of the defendant’s reason for withdrawing the&para;<br>plea, including whether the defendant asserts his inno&para;<br>cence of the charge”).&para;<br>Fourth, the Court’s decision marks a major upheaval in&para;<br>Sixth Amendment law. This Court decided Strickland in&para;<br>1984, but the majority does not cite a single case, from this&para;<br>or any other federal court, holding that criminal defense&para;<br>counsel’s failure to provide advice concerning the removal&para;<br>consequences of a criminal conviction violates a defen&para;<br>dant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As noted above,&para;<br>the Court’s view has been rejected by every Federal Court&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>of Appeals to have considered the issue thus far. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Gonzalez, 202 F. 3d, at 28; Banda, 1 F. 3d, at 355; Chin &amp;&para;<br>Holmes 697, 699. The majority appropriately acknowl&para;<br>edges that the lower courts are “now quite experienced&para;<br>with applying Strickland,” ante, at 14, but it casually&para;<br>dismisses the longstanding and unanimous position of&para;<br>the lower federal courts with respect to the scope of&para;<br>criminal defense counsel’s duty to advise on collateral&para;<br>consequences.&para;<br>The majority seeks to downplay its dramatic expansion&para;<br>of the scope of criminal defense counsel’s duties under the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment by claiming that this Court in Hill v.&para;<br>Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), similarly “applied Strick&para;<br>land to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client&para;<br>regarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.”&para;<br>Ante, at 14. That characterization of Hill obscures much&para;<br>more than it reveals. The issue in Hill was whether a&para;<br>criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel&para;<br>was violated where counsel misinformed the client about&para;<br>his eligibility for parole. The Court found it “unnecessary&para;<br>to determine whether there may be circumstances under&para;<br>which erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility&para;<br>may be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of&para;<br>counsel, because in the present case we conclude that&para;<br>petitioner’s allegations are insufficient to satisfy the&para;<br>Strickland v. Washington requirement of ‘prejudice.’ ” 474&para;<br>U. S., at 60. Given that Hill expressly and unambiguously&para;<br>refused to decide whether criminal defense counsel must&para;<br>avoid misinforming his or her client as to one consequence&para;<br>of a criminal conviction (parole eligibility), that case&para;<br>plainly provides no support whatsoever for the proposition&para;<br>that counsel must affirmatively advise his or her client as&para;<br>to another collateral consequence (removal).&para;<br>By the&para;<br>Court’s strange logic, Hill would support its decision here&para;<br>even if the Court had held that misadvice concerning&para;<br>parole eligibility does not make counsel’s performance&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>objectively unreasonable. After all, the Court still would&para;<br>have “applied Strickland” to the facts of the case at hand.&para;<br>II&para;<br>While mastery of immigration law is not required by&para;<br>Strickland, several considerations support the conclu&para;<br>sion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal&para;<br>consequences of a conviction may constitute ineffective&para;<br>assistance.&para;<br>First, a rule prohibiting affirmative misadvice regarding&para;<br>a matter as crucial to the defendant’s plea decision as&para;<br>deportation appears faithful to the scope and nature of the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment duty this Court has recognized in its&para;<br>past cases. In particular, we have explained that “a guilty&para;<br>plea cannot be attacked as based on inadequate legal&para;<br>advice unless counsel was not ‘a reasonably competent&para;<br>attorney’ and the advice was not ‘within the range of&para;<br>competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.’ ”&para;<br>Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann v. Richard&para;<br>son, 397 U. S. 759, 770, 771 (1970); emphasis added). As&para;<br>the Court appears to acknowledge, thorough understand&para;<br>ing of the intricacies of immigration law is not “within the&para;<br>range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal&para;<br>cases.” See ante, at 11 (“Immigration law can be complex,&para;<br>and it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the&para;<br>bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in&para;<br>either state or federal court or both, may not be well&para;<br>versed in it”). By contrast, reasonably competent attor&para;<br>neys should know that it is not appropriate or responsible&para;<br>to hold themselves out as authorities on a difficult and&para;<br>complicated subject matter with which they are not famil&para;<br>iar. Candor concerning the limits of one’s professional&para;<br>expertise, in other words, is within the range of duties&para;<br>reasonably expected of defense attorneys in criminal cases.&para;<br>As the dissenting judge on the Kentucky Supreme Court&para;<br>put it, “I do not believe it is too much of a burden to place&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>on our defense bar the duty to say, ‘I do not know.’ ” 253&para;<br>S. W. 3d 482, 485 (2008).&para;<br>Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant’s&para;<br>decisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and&para;<br>integrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question.&para;<br>See Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686 (“In giving meaning to&para;<br>the requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we&para;<br>must take its purpose—to ensure a fair trial—as the&para;<br>guide”). When a defendant opts to plead guilty without&para;<br>definitive information concerning the likely effects of the&para;<br>plea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk&para;<br>that the conviction may carry indirect consequences of&para;<br>which he or she is not aware. That is not the case when a&para;<br>defendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel’s&para;<br>express misrepresentation that the defendant will not be&para;<br>removable. In the latter case, it seems hard to say that&para;<br>the plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally&para;<br>competent counsel—or that it embodies a voluntary and&para;<br>intelligent decision to forsake constitutional rights. See&para;<br>ibid. (“The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffec&para;<br>tiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct so under&para;<br>mined the proper functioning of the adversarial process&para;<br>that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just&para;<br>result”).&para;<br>Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice re&para;<br>garding exceptionally important collateral matters would&para;<br>not deter or interfere with ongoing political and adminis&para;<br>trative efforts to devise fair and reasonable solutions to&para;<br>the difficult problem posed by defendants who plead&para;<br>guilty without knowing of certain important collateral&para;<br>consequences.&para;<br>Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice re&para;<br>garding the removal consequences of a conviction can give&para;<br>rise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court’s&para;<br>approach, not require any upheaval in the law. As the&para;<br>Solicitor General points out, “[t]he vast majority of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>lower courts considering claims of ineffective assistance in&para;<br>the plea context have [distinguished] between defense&para;<br>counsel who remain silent and defense counsel who give&para;<br>affirmative misadvice.” Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 8 (citing cases). At least three Courts of Appeals&para;<br>have held that affirmative misadvice on immigration&para;<br>matters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel,&para;<br>at least in some circumstances.3 And several other Circuits have held that affirmative misadvice concerning&para;<br>nonimmigration consequences of a conviction can violate&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment even if those consequences might be&para;<br>deemed “collateral.”4 By contrast, it appears that no court&para;<br>of appeals holds that affirmative misadvice concerning&para;<br>collateral consequences in general and removal in particular can never give rise to ineffective assistance. In short,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See&para;<br>&para;<br>United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005);&para;<br>United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan&para;<br>v. United States, 765 F. 2d 1534, 1540–1541 (CA11 1985) (limiting&para;<br>holding to the facts of the case); see also Santos-Sanchez v. United&para;<br>States, 548 F. 3d 327, 333–334 (CA5 2008) (concluding that counsel’s&para;<br>advice was not objectively unreasonable where counsel did not purport&para;<br>to answer questions about immigration law, did not claim any expertise&para;<br>in immigration law, and simply warned of “possible” deportation&para;<br>consequence; use of the word “possible” was not an affirmative misrepresentation, even though it could indicate that deportation was not a&para;<br>certain consequence).&para;<br>4 See Hill v. Lockhart, 894 F. 2d 1009, 1010 (CA8 1990) (en banc)&para;<br>(“[T]he erroneous parole-eligibility advice given to Mr. Hill was ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington”); Sparks v.&para;<br>Sowders, 852 F. 2d 882, 885 (CA6 1988) (“[G]ross misadvice concerning&para;<br>parole eligibility can amount to ineffective assistance of counsel”); id.,&para;<br>at 886 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“When the maximum possible exposure is overstated, the defendant might well be influenced to accept a&para;<br>plea agreement he would otherwise reject”); Strader v. Garrison, 611&para;<br>F. 2d 61, 65 (CA4 1979) (“[T]hough parole eligibility dates are collateral&para;<br>consequences of the entry of a guilty plea of which a defendant need not&para;<br>be informed if he does not inquire, when he is grossly misinformed&para;<br>about it by his lawyer, and relies upon that misinformation, he is&para;<br>deprived of his constitutional right to counsel”).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>the considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower&para;<br>federal courts charged with administering Strickland&para;<br>clearly supports the conclusion that that Kentucky Su&para;<br>preme Court’s position goes too far.&para;<br>In concluding that affirmative misadvice regarding the&para;<br>removal consequences of a criminal conviction may consti&para;<br>tute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense&para;<br>counsel to avoid misinformation. When a criminal defense&para;<br>attorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney&para;<br>should advise the client that a criminal conviction may&para;<br>have adverse consequences under the immigration laws&para;<br>and that the client should consult an immigration special&para;<br>ist if the client wants advice on that subject. By putting&para;<br>the client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice&para;<br>would significantly reduce the chance that the client&para;<br>would plead guilty under a mistaken premise.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be re&para;<br>quired to provide advice on immigration law, a complex&para;<br>specialty that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal&para;<br>defense attorney’s expertise. On the other hand, any&para;<br>competent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the&para;<br>extraordinary importance that the risk of removal might&para;<br>have in the client’s determination whether to enter a&para;<br>guilty plea.&para;<br>Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect&para;<br>information concerning the risk of removal can give rise to&para;<br>an ineffectiveness claim. In addition, silence alone is not&para;<br>enough to satisfy counsel’s duty to assist the client. In&para;<br>stead, an alien defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to&para;<br>counsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client&para;<br>that a conviction may have immigration consequences,&para;<br>that immigration law is a specialized field, that the attor&para;<br>ney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client&para;<br>should consult an immigration specialist if the client&para;<br>wants advice on that subject.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

KENTUCKY&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>KENTUCKY&para;<br>&para;<br>[March 31, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,&para;<br>dissenting.&para;<br>In the best of all possible worlds, criminal defendants&para;<br>contemplating a guilty plea ought to be advised of all&para;<br>serious collateral consequences of conviction, and surely&para;<br>ought not to be misadvised. The Constitution, however, is&para;<br>not an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect&para;<br>world; and when we ignore its text in order to make it&para;<br>that, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a&para;<br>tack hammer is needed.&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a lawyer&para;<br>“for his defense” against a “criminal prosecutio[n]”—not&para;<br>for sound advice about the collateral consequences of&para;<br>conviction. For that reason, and for the practical reasons&para;<br>set forth in Part I of JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence, I dis&para;<br>sent from the Court’s conclusion that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment requires counsel to provide accurate advice concern&para;<br>ing the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.&para;<br>For the same reasons, but unlike the concurrence, I do not&para;<br>believe that affirmative misadvice about those conse&para;<br>quences renders an attorney’s assistance in defending&para;<br>against the prosecution constitutionally inadequate; or&para;<br>that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to warn im&para;<br>migrant defendants that a conviction may render them&para;<br>removable. Statutory provisions can remedy these con&para;<br>cerns in a more targeted fashion, and without producing&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>permanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and&para;<br>ratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ&para;<br>counsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel. See,&para;<br>United States v. Van Duzee, 140 U. S. 169, 173 (1891); W.&para;<br>Beaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28–29&para;<br>(1955). We have held, however, that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defen&para;<br>dants at government expense, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372&para;<br>U. S. 335, 344–345 (1963), and that the right to “the assis&para;<br>tance of counsel” includes the right to effective assistance,&para;<br>Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984). Even&para;<br>assuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the sig&para;<br>nificant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser&para;<br>extent the concurrence, would create. We have until today&para;<br>at least retained the Sixth Amendment’s textual limita&para;<br>tion to criminal prosecutions. “[W]e have held that ‘de&para;<br>fence’ means defense at trial, not defense in relation to&para;<br>other objectives that may be important to the accused.”&para;<br>Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)&para;<br>(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (summarizing cases).&para;<br>We have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice&para;<br>directly related to defense against prosecution of the&para;<br>charged offense—advice at trial, of course, but also advice&para;<br>at postindictment interrogations and lineups, Massiah v.&para;<br>United States, 377 U. S. 201, 205–206 (1964); United&para;<br>States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 236–238 (1967), and in&para;<br>general advice at all phases of the prosecution where the&para;<br>defendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone&para;<br>against the legally trained agents of the state, see Moran&para;<br>v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430 (1986). Not only have we&para;<br>not required advice of counsel regarding consequences&para;<br>collateral to prosecution, we have not even required coun&para;<br>sel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001).&para;<br>There is no basis in text or in principle to extend the&para;<br>constitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas&para;<br>beyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution&para;<br>at hand—to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce,&para;<br>the higher sentence that conviction after trial might en&para;<br>tail, and the chances of such a conviction. Such matters&para;<br>fall within “the range of competence demanded of attor&para;<br>neys in criminal cases,” McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S.&para;<br>759, 771 (1970). See id., at 769–770 (describing the mat&para;<br>ters counsel and client must consider in connection with a&para;<br>contemplated guilty plea). We have never held, as the&para;<br>logic of the Court’s opinion assumes, that once counsel is&para;<br>appointed all professional responsibilities of counsel—even&para;<br>those extending beyond defense against the prosecution—&para;<br>become constitutional commands. Cf. Cobb, supra, at 171,&para;<br>n. 2; Moran, supra, at 430. Because the subject of the&para;<br>misadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose&para;<br>Padilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment has no application.&para;<br>Adding to counsel’s duties an obligation to advise about&para;<br>a conviction’s collateral consequences has no logical stop&para;<br>ping-point. As the concurrence observes,&para;<br>“[A] criminal convictio[n] can carry a wide variety of&para;<br>consequences other than conviction and sentencing,&para;<br>including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of&para;<br>the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits,&para;<br>ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable dis&para;<br>charge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or&para;<br>professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are&para;<br>‘serious,’ . . . .” Ante, at 2–3 (ALITO, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment).&para;<br>But it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PADILLA v. KENTUCKY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>same defect. The same indeterminacy, the same inability&para;<br>to know what areas of advice are relevant, attaches to&para;<br>misadvice. And the concurrence’s suggestion that counsel&para;<br>must warn defendants of potential removal consequences,&para;<br>see ante, at 14–15—what would come to be known as the&para;<br>“Padilla warning”—cannot be limited to those conse&para;<br>quences except by judicial caprice. It is difficult to believe&para;<br>that the warning requirement would not be extended, for&para;<br>example, to the risk of heightened sentences in later fed&para;<br>eral prosecutions pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal&para;<br>Act, 18 U. S. C. §924(e). We could expect years of elabora&para;<br>tion upon these new issues in the lower courts, prompted&para;<br>by the defense bar’s devising of ever-expanding categories&para;<br>of plea-invalidating misadvice and failures to warn—not to&para;<br>mention innumerable evidentiary hearings to determine&para;<br>whether misadvice really occurred or whether the warning&para;<br>was really given.&para;<br>The concurrence’s treatment of misadvice seems driven&para;<br>by concern about the voluntariness of Padilla’s guilty plea.&para;<br>See ante, at 12. But that concern properly relates to the&para;<br>Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ments, not to the Sixth Amendment. See McCarthy v.&para;<br>United States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969); Brady v. United&para;<br>States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Padilla has not argued&para;<br>before us that his guilty plea was not knowing and volun&para;<br>tary. If that is, however, the true substance of his claim&para;<br>(and if he has properly preserved it) the state court can&para;<br>address it on remand.1 But we should not smuggle the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1I&para;<br>&para;<br>do not mean to suggest that the Due Process Clause would surely&para;<br>provide relief. We have indicated that awareness of “direct conse&para;<br>quences” suffices for the validity of a guilty plea. See Brady, 397 U. S.,&para;<br>at 755 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the required colloquy&para;<br>between a federal district court and a defendant required by Federal&para;<br>Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) (formerly Rule 11(c)), which we have&para;<br>said approximates the due process requirements for a valid plea, see&para;<br>Libretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 49–50 (1995), does not mention&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>claim into the Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>The Court’s holding prevents legislation that could solve&para;<br>the problems addressed by today’s opinions in a more&para;<br>precise and targeted fashion. If the subject had not been&para;<br>constitutionalized, legislation could specify which catego&para;<br>ries of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecu&para;<br>tion invalidate plea agreements, what collateral conse&para;<br>quences counsel must bring to a defendant’s attention, and&para;<br>what warnings must be given.2 Moreover, legislation&para;<br>could provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice,&para;<br>or failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal&para;<br>conviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for&para;<br>retrial have disappeared. Federal immigration law might&para;<br>provide, for example, that the near-automatic removal&para;<br>which follows from certain criminal convictions will not&para;<br>apply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea in&para;<br>duced by counsel’s misadvice regarding removal conse&para;<br>quences. Or legislation might put the government to a&para;<br>choice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant&para;<br>or forgo the removal. But all that has been precluded in&para;<br>favor of today’s sledge hammer.&para;<br>In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate&para;<br>assistance of counsel in defending against a pending&para;<br>criminal prosecution. We should limit both the constitu&para;<br>tional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of&para;<br>bad advice to that well defined area.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>collateral consequences. Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of&para;<br>misadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty&para;<br>plea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>2 As the Court’s opinion notes, ante, at 16–17, n. 15, many States—&para;<br>including Kentucky—already require that criminal defendants be&para;<br>warned of potential removal consequences.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
