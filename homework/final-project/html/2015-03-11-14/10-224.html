S. C. §601 et seq., regulates a broad range of activities at slaughterhouses to ensure the&para;<br>safety of meat and the humane handling of animals. The Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS),&para;<br>which administers the FMIA, has issued extensive regulations to&para;<br>govern the inspection of animals and meat, as well as other aspects of&para;<br>slaughterhouses’ operations and facilities. See 9 CFR §300.1 et seq.&para;<br>The FSIS inspection procedure begins with an “ante-mortem” inspection of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse. If, at that inspection, a nonambulatory animal is found to suffer from a particularly&para;<br>severe disease or condition, it must be classified as “U. S. Condemned” and killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food&para;<br>is produced. §§309.3, 311.1 et seq. Nonambulatory animals that are&para;<br>not condemned are classified as “U. S. Suspect.” §309.2(b). They are&para;<br>set apart, specially monitored, and “slaughtered separately from other livestock.” §309.2(n). Following slaughter, an inspector decides at&para;<br>a “post-mortem” examination which parts, if any, of the suspect animal’s carcass may be processed into food for humans. See 9 CFR pts.&para;<br>310, 311. FSIS regulations additionally prescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process, 9&para;<br>CFR pt. 313, including specific provisions for the humane treatment&para;<br>of nonambulatory animals, 9 CFR 313.2(d).&para;<br>The FMIA’s preemption clause, §678, precludes states from imposing requirements that are “within the scope” of the FMIA, relate to&para;<br>slaughterhouse “premises, facilities and operations,” and are “in addition to, or different than those made under” the FMIA. In 2008,&para;<br>California amended its penal code to provide that no slaughterhouse&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>shall “buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal”; “process, butcher, or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human&para;<br>consumption”; or “hold a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.” §§599f(a)–(c).&para;<br>Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA), a trade association representing meatpackers and processors, sued to enjoin enforcement of&para;<br>§599f against swine slaughterhouses, arguing that the FMIA&para;<br>preempts application of the state law. The District Court agreed, and&para;<br>granted the NMA a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that §599f is not preempted because it regulates only&para;<br>“the kind of animal that may be slaughtered,” not the inspection or&para;<br>slaughtering process itself.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The FMIA expressly preempts §599f’s application against federally inspected swine slaughterhouses. Pp. 6−14.&para;<br>(a) The FMIA’s preemption clause sweeps widely, and so blocks the&para;<br>applications of §599f challenged here. The clause prevents a State&para;<br>from imposing any additional or different―even if nonconflicting―requirements that fall within the FMIA’s scope and concern&para;<br>slaughterhouse facilities or operations. Section 599f imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses: Where&para;<br>under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in&para;<br>handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse&para;<br>must take another. For example, when a pig becomes injured and&para;<br>thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to a slaughterhouse,&para;<br>§599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from “hold[ing]” the pig without&para;<br>immediately euthanizing it; and §599f(b) prohibits the slaughterhouse from “process[ing]” or “butcher[ing]” the animal to make food.&para;<br>By contrast, the FMIA and its regulations allow a slaughterhouse to&para;<br>hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory animal that has not&para;<br>been condemned, and to process and butcher such an animal’s meat,&para;<br>subject to an FSIS official’s approval at post-mortem inspection. Similarly, when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, §599f(a)&para;<br>prohibits a slaughterhouse from “receiv[ing]” or “buy[ing]” the pig.&para;<br>But the FMIA and its regulations expressly allow slaughterhouses to&para;<br>purchase nonambulatory pigs. See 21 U. S. C. §644; 9 CFR&para;<br>§325.20(c). And the FSIS inspection regime clearly contemplates&para;<br>that slaughterhouses will receive nonambulatory animals. So §599f&para;<br>substitutes a new regulatory regime for the one the FMIA prescribes.&para;<br>Respondent Humane Society argues that §599f(a)’s ban on purchasing nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because it would&para;<br>not be preempted if applied to purchases occurring off slaughterhouse&para;<br>premises. But the record does not disclose whether §599f(a) ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application&para;<br>of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse’s operations. Moreover,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>even if the State could regulate off-site purchases, it does not follow&para;<br>that on-site purchases would escape preemption, because the FMIA’s&para;<br>preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse “premises, facilities and operations.” And while the Humane Society is correct&para;<br>that the FMIA does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activities, §599f’s sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must&para;<br>handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises. Its effect is to make&para;<br>sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process. It is therefore preempted by the FMIA. Pp. 6−10.&para;<br>(b) Also rejected is the broad argument that §599f’s challenged provisions fall outside the FMIA’s scope because they exclude a class of&para;<br>animals from the slaughtering process, while the FMIA extends only&para;<br>to “animals that are going to be turned into meat.” In fact, the FMIA&para;<br>regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be&para;<br>turned into meat. For example, the Act’s implementing regulations&para;<br>exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process, e.g.,&para;<br>swine with hog cholera, 9 CFR §309.5(a). The argument that §599f’s&para;<br>exclusion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to ensure&para;<br>the humane treatment of pigs, rather than meat safety, misunderstands the FMIA’s scope. The FMIA addresses not just food safety,&para;<br>but humane treatment, as well. See, e.g., 21 U. S.

And at every turn §599f&para;<br>imposes additional or different requirements on swine&para;<br>slaughterhouses: It compels them to deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal Act&para;<br>and regulations do not.

See McGlone,&para;<br>Fatigued Pigs: The Final Link, Pork Magazine 14 (Mar. 2006). About&para;<br>100 million pigs are slaughtered each year in the United States, see&para;<br>Dept. of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Livestock&para;<br>Slaughter 13 (Jan. 2011), so those percentages work out to between&para;<br>100,000 and 1,000,000 pigs.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

See ibid.&para;<br>The State’s proscriptions thus exceed the FMIA’s. To be&para;<br>sure, nothing in the federal Act requires what the state&para;<br>law forbids (or forbids what the state law requires); California is right to note that “[t]he FMIA does not mandate&para;<br>that ‘U. S. Suspect’ [nonambulatory] animals . . . be placed&para;<br>into the human food production process.” Brief for State&para;<br>Respondents 31. But that is irrelevant, because the&para;<br>FMIA’s preemption clause covers not just conflicting, but&para;<br>also different or additional state requirements. It therefore precludes California’s effort in §§599f(b) and (c) to impose new rules, beyond any the FSIS has chosen to adopt,&para;<br>on what a slaughterhouse must do with a pig that becomes nonambulatory during the production process.&para;<br>Similarly, consider how the state and federal laws address what a slaughterhouse should do when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, usually because of&para;<br>harsh transportation conditions.6 Section 599f(a) of the&para;<br>California law bars a slaughterhouse from “receiv[ing]” or&para;<br>“buy[ing]” such a pig, thus obligating the slaughterhouse&para;<br>to refuse delivery of the animal.7 But that directive, too,&para;<br>deviates from any imposed by federal law. A regulation&para;<br>issued under the FMIA specifically authorizes slaughterhouses to buy disabled or diseased animals (including&para;<br>nonambulatory swine), by exempting them from a general&para;<br>prohibition on such purchases. See 9 CFR §325.20(c).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 According to one estimate, almost half of one percent of the pigs&para;<br>slaughtered annually in the United States become nonambulatory&para;<br>during the trip from farm to slaughterhouse. See National Pork Board,&para;<br>Transport Quality Assurance Handbook 25 (Version 4, 2010). About&para;<br>half that many die during transport. See ibid.&para;<br>7 Section 599f(a) also bans “sell[ing]” nonambulatory animals. But&para;<br>because slaughterhouses (unlike other entities referenced in the provision) do not typically sell live animals, that prohibition is not at issue in&para;<br>this case. The statute’s distinct ban on selling meat from nonambulatory animals that have been slaughtered is discussed infra, at 9–10.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>And other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses&para;<br>will in fact take, rather than refuse, receipt of nonambulatory swine. Recall that the FMIA’s regulations provide for&para;<br>the inspection of all pigs at delivery, see supra, at 2—in&para;<br>the case of nonambulatory pigs, often right on the truck,&para;<br>see Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS&para;<br>Directive 6900.2, ch. II(I). They further instruct slaughterhouses to kill and dispose of any nonambulatory pigs&para;<br>labeled “condemned,” and to slaughter separately those&para;<br>marked “suspect.” See supra, at 3. In short, federal law&para;<br>establishes rules for handling and slaughtering nonambulatory pigs brought to a slaughterhouse, rather than&para;<br>ordering them returned to sender. So §599f(a) and the&para;<br>FMIA require different things of a slaughterhouse confronted with a delivery truck containing nonambulatory swine. The former says “do not receive or buy them”;&para;<br>the latter does not.&para;<br>The Humane Society counters that at least §599f(a)’s&para;<br>ban on buying nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because that provision applies no matter when or&para;<br>where a purchase takes place. The argument proceeds in&para;<br>three steps: (1) §599f(a)’s ban covers purchases of nonambulatory pigs made prior to delivery, away from the&para;<br>slaughterhouse itself (say, at a farm or auction); (2) the&para;<br>State may regulate such offsite purchases because they do&para;<br>not involve a slaughterhouse’s “premises, facilities and&para;<br>operations,” which is a condition of preemption under the&para;<br>FMIA; and (3) no different result should obtain just because a slaughterhouse structures its swine purchases to&para;<br>occur at delivery, on its own property. See Brief for NonState Respondents 43–45.&para;<br>But this argument fails on two grounds. First, its preliminary steps have no foundation in the record. Until a&para;<br>stray comment at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50,&para;<br>neither the State nor the Humane Society had disputed&para;<br>the NMA’s assertion that slaughterhouses buy pigs at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>delivery (or still later, upon successful ante-mortem inspection). See Brief for Petitioner 46, n. 18; Brief for NonState Respondents 44; Brief for State Respondents 16,&para;<br>n. 5. Nor had the parties presented evidence that a significant number of pigs become nonambulatory before shipment, when any offsite purchases would occur. The record&para;<br>therefore does not disclose whether §599f(a)’s ban on&para;<br>purchase ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate,&para;<br>much less how an application of that kind would affect&para;<br>a slaughterhouse’s operations. And because that is so,&para;<br>we have no basis for deciding whether the FMIA would&para;<br>preempt it. Second, even assuming that a State could&para;<br>regulate offsite purchases, the concluding step of the&para;<br>Humane Society’s argument would not follow. The FMIA’s&para;<br>preemption clause expressly focuses on “premises, facilities and operations”—at bottom, the slaughtering and&para;<br>processing of animals at a given location. So the distinction between a slaughterhouse’s site-based activities and&para;<br>its more far-flung commercial dealings is not, as the Humane Society contends, an anomaly that courts should&para;<br>strain to avoid. It is instead a fundamental feature of the&para;<br>FMIA’s preemption clause.&para;<br>For that reason, the Humane Society’s stronger argument concerns California’s effort to regulate the last stage&para;<br>of a slaughterhouse’s business—the ban in §599f(b) on&para;<br>“sell[ing] meat or products of nonambulatory animals for&para;<br>human consumption.” The Government acknowledges&para;<br>that the FMIA’s preemption clause does not usually foreclose “state regulation of the commercial sales activities of&para;<br>slaughterhouses.” Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 17. And the Humane Society asserts, in line with&para;<br>that general rule, that §599f(b)’s ban on sales does not&para;<br>regulate a slaughterhouse’s “operations” because it kicks&para;<br>in only after they have ended: Once meat from a slaughtered pig has passed a post-mortem inspection, the Act&para;<br>“is not concerned with whether or how it is ever actually&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sold.” Brief for Non-State Respondents 45. At most, the&para;<br>Humane Society claims, §599f(b)’s ban on sales offers&para;<br>an “incentiv[e]” to a slaughterhouse to take nonambulatory&para;<br>pigs out of the meat production process. Id., at 46. And&para;<br>California may so “motivate[]” an operational choice without running afoul of the FMIA’s preemption provision.&para;<br>Ibid. (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S.&para;<br>431, 443 (2005)).&para;<br>But this argument mistakes how the prohibition on&para;<br>sales operates within §599f as a whole. The sales ban is&para;<br>a criminal proscription calculated to help implement and&para;<br>enforce each of the section’s other regulations—its prohibition of receipt and purchase, its bar on butchering and&para;<br>processing, and its mandate of immediate euthanasia.&para;<br>The idea—and the inevitable effect—of the provision is to&para;<br>make sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory&para;<br>pigs from the production process (or keep them out of the&para;<br>process from the beginning) by criminalizing the sale of&para;<br>their meat. That, we think, is something more than an&para;<br>“incentive” or “motivat[or]”; the sales ban instead functions as a command to slaughterhouses to structure their&para;<br>operations in the exact way the remainder of §599f mandates. And indeed, if the sales ban were to avoid the&para;<br>FMIA’s preemption clause, then any State could impose&para;<br>any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as&para;<br>a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the&para;<br>State disapproved. That would make a mockery of the&para;<br>FMIA’s preemption provision. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v.&para;<br>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246,&para;<br>255 (2004) (stating that it “would make no sense” to allow&para;<br>state regulations to escape preemption because they addressed the purchase, rather than manufacture, of a federally regulated product). Like the rest of §599f, the sales&para;<br>ban regulates how slaughterhouses must deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises. The FMIA therefore&para;<br>preempts it for all the same reasons.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>California’s and the Humane Society’s broadest argument against preemption maintains that all of §599f ’s&para;<br>challenged provisions fall outside the “scope” of the FMIA&para;<br>because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process. See 21 U. S. C. §678 (preempting certain&para;<br>requirements “within the scope of this [Act]”). According&para;<br>to this view, the Act (and the FSIS’s authority under it)&para;<br>extends only to “animals that are going to be turned into&para;<br>meat,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28—or to use another phrase,&para;<br>animals that will “be slaughtered . . . for purposes of&para;<br>human food production,” Brief for State Respondents 19&para;<br>(emphasis deleted). Section 599f avoids the scope of the&para;<br>Act, respondents claim, by altogether removing nonambulatory pigs from the slaughtering process.8 The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit accepted this argument, analogizing §599f to state&para;<br>laws upheld in two other Circuits banning the slaughter of&para;<br>horses for human consumption. 599 F. 3d, at 1098 (discussing Cavel Int’l., Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F. 3d 551 (CA7&para;<br>2007), and Empacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S. A. de&para;<br>C.V. v. Curry, 476 F. 3d 326 (CA5 2007)). According to the&para;<br>Court of Appeals, “states are free to decide which animals&para;<br>may be turned into meat.” 599 F. 3d, at 1098, 1099.&para;<br>We think not. The FMIA’s scope includes not only&para;<br>“animals that are going to be turned into meat,” but ani——————&para;<br>8 California’s&para;<br>&para;<br>brief sometimes casts its argument in terms of the “operations” language of the FMIA’s preemption clause (although the State&para;<br>appeared to abandon this phrasing at oral argument). In this version of&para;<br>the claim, California contends that the “operations” of a slaughterhouse&para;<br>are only those “of federal concern,” and that excluding a class of animals from the slaughtering process does not impinge on such operations. Brief for State Respondents 20, n. 9; see also id., at 20–21. We&para;<br>see no real difference between saying that a categorical exclusion of&para;<br>animals does not implicate “operations of federal concern” and saying&para;<br>that it does not fall within the scope of the Act. Accordingly, our&para;<br>answer to both forms of the argument is the same.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mals on a slaughterhouse’s premises that will never suffer&para;<br>that fate. The Act’s implementing regulations themselves&para;<br>exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering&para;<br>process. Swine with hog cholera, for example, are disqualified, see 9 CFR §309.5(a); so too are swine and other&para;<br>livestock “affected with anthrax,” §309.7(a). Indeed, the&para;<br>federal regulations prohibit the slaughter of any nonambulatory cattle for human consumption. See §309.3(e). As&para;<br>these examples demonstrate, one vital function of the Act&para;<br>and its regulations is to ensure that some kinds of livestock delivered to a slaughterhouse’s gates will not be&para;<br>turned into meat. Under federal law, nonambulatory pigs&para;<br>are not among those excluded animals. But that is to&para;<br>say only that §599f ’s requirements differ from those of&para;<br>the FMIA—not that §599f ’s requirements fall outside the&para;<br>FMIA’s scope.&para;<br>Nor are respondents right to suggest that §599f ’s exclusion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to&para;<br>ensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than the&para;<br>safety of meat. See, e.g., Brief for State Respondents 29;&para;<br>Brief for Non-State Respondents 39–40. That view misunderstands the authority—and indeed responsibility—&para;<br>that the FMIA gives to federal officials. Since 1978, when&para;<br>Congress incorporated the HMSA’s standards, the FMIA&para;<br>has required slaughterhouses to follow prescribed methods&para;<br>of humane handling, so as to minimize animals’ pain and&para;<br>suffering. See 21 U. S. C. §§603(b), 610(b); supra, at 2–4.&para;<br>A violation of those standards is a crime, see §676, and the&para;<br>Secretary of Agriculture can suspend inspections at—and&para;<br>thus effectively shut down—a slaughterhouse that disobeys them, see §§603(b), 610(c). To implement the Act’s&para;<br>humane-handling provisions, the FSIS has issued detailed&para;<br>regulations, see 9 CFR pt. 313, including some specifically&para;<br>addressing animals that cannot walk, see §§313.2(d),&para;<br>313.1(c). Those rules, as earlier noted, apply throughout&para;<br>the time an animal is on a slaughterhouse’s premises,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from the moment a delivery truck pulls up to the gate.&para;<br>See supra, at 3–4. So the FMIA addresses not just food&para;<br>safety, but humane treatment as well. Even California&para;<br>conceded at oral argument that the FSIS could issue&para;<br>regulations under the FMIA, similar to §599f, mandating&para;<br>the euthanasia of nonambulatory swine.9 See Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 46–47. If that is so—and it is, because of the FSIS’s&para;<br>authority over humane-handling methods—then §599f ’s&para;<br>requirements must fall within the FMIA’s scope.&para;<br>The Circuit decisions upholding state bans on slaughtering horses, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, do not demand any different conclusion. We express no view on&para;<br>those decisions, except to say that the laws sustained&para;<br>there differ from §599f in a significant respect. A ban on&para;<br>butchering horses for human consumption works at a&para;<br>remove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most&para;<br>directly governs. When such a ban is in effect, no horses&para;<br>will be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaughterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase&para;<br>in the first instance. But §599f does not and cannot work&para;<br>in that way. As earlier noted, many nonambulatory pigs&para;<br>become disabled either in transit to or after arrival at a&para;<br>slaughterhouse. See supra, at 6–9, and nn. 5–6. So even&para;<br>with §599f in effect, a swine slaughterhouse will encounter&para;<br>nonambulatory pigs. In that circumstance, §599f tells the&para;<br>slaughterhouse what to do with those animals. Unlike a&para;<br>horse slaughtering ban, the statute thus reaches into the&para;<br>slaughterhouse’s facilities and affects its daily activities.&para;<br>And in so doing, the California law runs smack into the&para;<br>FMIA’s regulations. So whatever might be said of other&para;<br>bans on slaughter, §599f imposes requirements within—&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Indeed,&para;<br>&para;<br>the FSIS recently solicited comment on a rulemaking petition that would require all nonambulatory disabled livestock, including&para;<br>swine, to be humanely euthanized. See 76 Fed. Reg. 6572 (2011). The&para;<br>FSIS has taken no further action on that petition.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and indeed at the very heart of—the FMIA’s scope.10&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The FMIA regulates slaughterhouses’ handling and&para;<br>treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their&para;<br>delivery through the end of the meat production process.&para;<br>California’s §599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at&para;<br>the same time, in the same place—except by imposing&para;<br>different requirements. The FMIA expressly preempts&para;<br>such a state law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 We&para;<br>&para;<br>finally reject California’s argument, see Brief for State Respondents 20, that our reading of the FMIA’s preemption provision&para;<br>renders its saving clause insignificant. That clause provides that&para;<br>States may regulate slaughterhouses as to “other matters,” not addressed in the express preemption clause, as long as those laws are&para;<br>“consistent with” the FMIA. 21 U. S. C. §678. So, for example, the&para;<br>Government acknowledges that state laws of general application&para;<br>(workplace safety regulations, building codes, etc.) will usually apply to&para;<br>slaughterhouses. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Moreover, because the&para;<br>FMIA’s express preemption provision prevents States from imposing&para;<br>only “addition[al]” or “different” requirements, §678, States may exact&para;<br>civil or criminal penalties for animal cruelty or other conduct that also&para;<br>violates the FMIA. See §678; cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC, 544&para;<br>U. S. 431, 447 (2005) (holding that a preemption clause barring state&para;<br>laws “in addition to or different” from a federal Act does not interfere&para;<br>with an “equivalent” state provision). Although the FMIA preempts&para;<br>much state law involving slaughterhouses, it thus leaves some room for&para;<br>the States to regulate.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
