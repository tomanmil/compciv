Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 270, but&para;<br>that the law school admission plan’s more limited use did not, Grutter&para;<br>v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 343, Michigan voters adopted Proposal 2,&para;<br>now Art. I, §26, of the State Constitution, which, as relevant here,&para;<br>prohibits the use of race-based preferences as part of the admissions&para;<br>process for state universities. In consolidated challenges, the District&para;<br>Court granted summary judgment to Michigan, thus upholding Proposal 2, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the proposal&para;<br>violated the principles of Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,&para;<br>458 U. S. 457.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed.&para;<br>701 F. 3d 466, reversed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,&para;<br>concluded that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in&para;<br>this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws&para;<br>that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular&para;<br>with respect to school admissions. Pp. 4–18.&para;<br>(a) This case is not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of&para;<br>race-conscious admissions policies in higher education. Here, the&para;<br>principle that the consideration of race in admissions is permissible&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>when certain conditions are met is not being challenged. Rather, the&para;<br>question concerns whether, and in what manner, voters in the States&para;<br>may choose to prohibit the consideration of such racial preferences.&para;<br>Where States have prohibited race-conscious admissions policies,&para;<br>universities have responded by experimenting “with a wide variety of&para;<br>alternative approaches.” Grutter, supra, at 342. The decision by&para;<br>Michigan voters reflects the ongoing national dialogue about such&para;<br>practices. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The Sixth Circuit’s determination that Seattle controlled here&para;<br>extends Seattle’s holding in a case presenting quite different issues to&para;<br>reach a mistaken conclusion. Pp. 5–18.&para;<br>(1) It is necessary to consider first the relevant cases preceding&para;<br>Seattle and the background against which Seattle arose. Both Reit­&para;<br>man v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369, and Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385,&para;<br>involved demonstrated injuries on the basis of race that, by reasons&para;<br>of state encouragement or participation, became more aggravated. In&para;<br>Mulkey, a voter-enacted amendment to the California Constitution&para;<br>prohibiting state legislative interference with an owner’s prerogative&para;<br>to decline to sell or rent residential property on any basis barred the&para;<br>challenging parties, on account of race, from invoking the protection&para;<br>of California’s statutes, thus preventing them from leasing residential property. In Hunter, voters overturned an Akron ordinance that&para;<br>was enacted to address widespread racial discrimination in housing&para;<br>sales and rentals had forced many to live in “ ‘unhealthful, unsafe,&para;<br>unsanitary and overcrowded’ ” segregated housing, 393 U. S., at 391.&para;<br>In Seattle, after the school board adopted a mandatory busing program to alleviate racial isolation of minority students in local schools,&para;<br>voters passed a state initiative that barred busing to desegregate.&para;<br>This Court found that the state initiative had the “practical effect” of&para;<br>removing “the authority to address a racial problem . . . from the existing decisionmaking body, in such a way as to burden minority interests” of busing advocates who must now “seek relief from the state&para;<br>legislature, or from the statewide electorate.” 458 U. S., at 474.&para;<br>Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(2) Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state action&para;<br>had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on account of race as had been the case in Mulkey and Hunter. While&para;<br>there had been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect&para;<br>to Seattle’s school district, a finding that would be required today, see&para;<br>Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,&para;<br>551 U. S. 701, 720–721, Seattle must be understood as Seattle understood itself, as a case in which neither the State nor the United&para;<br>States “challenge[d] the propriety of race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of achieving integration, even absent a finding&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of prior de jure segregation.” 458 U. S. at 472, n. 15.&para;<br>Seattle’s broad language, however, went well beyond the analysis&para;<br>needed to resolve the case. Seizing upon the statement in Justice&para;<br>Harlan’s concurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that&para;<br>case had “the clear purpose of making it more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest,” 385 U. S., at 395, the Seattle Court established a new and farreaching rationale: Where a government policy “inures primarily to&para;<br>the benefit of the minority” and “minorities . . . consider” the policy to&para;<br>be “ ‘in their interest,’ ” then any state action that “place[s] effective&para;<br>decisionmaking authority over” that policy “at a different level of&para;<br>government” is subject to strict scrutiny. 458 U. S., at 472, 474.&para;<br>Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(3) To the extent Seattle is read to require the Court to determine&para;<br>and declare which political policies serve the “interest” of a group defined in racial terms, that rationale was unnecessary to the decision&para;<br>in Seattle; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious equal&para;<br>protection concerns. In cautioning against “impermissible racial stereotypes,” this Court has rejected the assumption that all individuals&para;<br>of the same race think alike, see Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 647,&para;<br>but that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the&para;<br>Seattle formulation to control. And if it were deemed necessary to&para;<br>probe how some races define their own interest in political matters,&para;<br>still another beginning point would be to define individuals according&para;<br>to race. Such a venture would be undertaken with no clear legal&para;<br>standards or accepted sources to guide judicial decision. It would also result in, or impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable&para;<br>constitutionality on their own terms. Assuming these steps could be&para;<br>taken, the court would next be required to determine the policy&para;<br>realms in which groups defined by race had a political interest. That&para;<br>undertaking, again without guidance from accepted legal standards,&para;<br>would risk the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose&para;<br>certain policies to cast the debate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Adoption of the Seattle formulation could affect any&para;<br>number of laws or decisions, involving, e.g., tax policy or housing subsidies. And racial division would be validated, not discouraged.&para;<br>It can be argued that objections to the larger consequences of the&para;<br>Seattle formulation need not be confronted here, for race was an undoubted subject of the ballot issue. But other problems raised by Se­&para;<br>attle, such as racial definitions, still apply. And the principal flaw in&para;<br>the Sixth Circuit’s decision remains: Here there was no infliction of a&para;<br>specific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter and in the&para;<br>history of the Seattle schools, and there is no precedent for extending&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>these cases to restrict the right of Michigan voters to determine that&para;<br>race-based preferences granted by state entities should be ended.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit’s judgment also calls into question other States’&para;<br>long-settled rulings on policies similar to Michigan’s.&para;<br>Unlike the injuries in Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle, the question&para;<br>here is not how to address or prevent injury caused on account of race&para;<br>but whether voters may determine whether a policy of race-based&para;<br>preferences should be continued. By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding §26 to their State Constitution, Michigan voters exercised&para;<br>their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic&para;<br>power, bypassing public officials they deemed not responsive to their&para;<br>concerns about a policy of granting race-based preferences. The&para;<br>mandate for segregated schools, Brown v. Board of Education, 347&para;<br>U. S. 483, and scores of other examples teach that individual liberty&para;<br>has constitutional protection. But this Nation’s constitutional system&para;<br>also embraces the right of citizens to speak and debate and learn and&para;<br>then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral&para;<br>process, as Michigan voters have done here. These precepts are not&para;<br>inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted on racial minorities by the encouragement or command of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress&para;<br>by the courts. Such circumstances were present in Mulkey, Hunter,&para;<br>and Seattle, but they are not present here. Pp. 11–18.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, agreed that §26 rightly&para;<br>stands, though not because it passes muster under the politicalprocess doctrine. It likely does not, but the cases establishing that&para;<br>doctrine should be overruled. They are patently atextual, unadministrable, and contrary to this Court’s traditional equal protection jurisprudence. The question here, as in every case in which neutral&para;<br>state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is&para;<br>whether the challenged action reflects a racially discriminatory purpose. It plainly does not. Pp. 1–18.&para;<br>(a) The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held §26 unconstitutional under the so-called political-process doctrine, derived from&para;<br>Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, and Hunter v.&para;<br>Erickson, 393 U. S. 385. In those cases, one level of government exercised borrowed authority over an apparently “racial issue” until a&para;<br>higher level of government called the loan. This Court deemed each&para;<br>revocation an equal-protection violation, without regard to whether&para;<br>there was evidence of an invidious purpose to discriminate. The relentless, radical logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to a similar&para;<br>conclusion here, as in so many other cases. Pp. 3–7.&para;<br>(b) The problems with the political-process doctrine begin with its&para;<br>triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task of determining&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>whether a law that reallocates policymaking authority concerns a&para;<br>“racial issue,” Seattle, 458 U. S., at 473, i.e., whether adopting one&para;<br>position on the question would “at bottom inur[e] primarily to the&para;<br>benefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose,” id., at 472.&para;<br>Such freeform judicial musing into ethnic and racial “interests” involves judges in the dirty business of dividing the Nation “into racial&para;<br>blocs,” Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603, 610&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., dissenting), and promotes racial stereotyping, see&para;<br>Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 647. More fundamentally, the analysis&para;<br>misreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect particular groups, a&para;<br>construction that has been repudiated in a “long line of cases understanding equal protection as a personal right.” Adarand Construc­&para;<br>tors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 224, 230. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(c) The second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis directs a court to&para;<br>determine whether the challenged act “place[s] effective decisionmaking authority over [the] racial issue at a different level of government,” Seattle, supra, at 474; but, in another line of cases, the Court&para;<br>has emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design&para;<br>its governing structure as it sees fit, see, e.g., Holt Civic Club v. Tus­&para;<br>caloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71. Taken to the limits of its logic, HunterSeattle is the gaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of structural state sovereignty, which would seem to permit a State to give&para;<br>certain powers to cities, later assign the same powers to counties, and&para;<br>even reclaim them for itself. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(d) Hunter and Seattle also endorse a version of the proposition&para;<br>that a facially neutral law may deny equal protection solely because&para;<br>it has a disparate racial impact. That equal-protection theory has&para;<br>been squarely and soundly rejected by an “unwavering line of cases”&para;<br>holding “that a violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires&para;<br>state action motivated by discriminatory intent,” Hernandez v. New&para;<br>York, 500 U. S. 352, 372–373 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment),&para;<br>and that “official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact,” Arlington&para;<br>Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252,&para;<br>264–265. Respondents cannot prove that the action here reflects a&para;<br>racially discriminatory purpose, for any law expressly requiring state&para;<br>actors to afford all persons equal protection of the laws does not—&para;<br>cannot—deny “to any person . . . equal protection of the laws,” U. S.&para;<br>Const., Amdt. 14, §1. Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER agreed that the amendment is consistent with the&para;<br>Equal Protection Clause, but for different reasons. First, this case&para;<br>addresses the amendment only as it applies to, and forbids, raceconscious admissions programs that consider race solely in order to&para;<br>obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Second, the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Constitution permits, but does not require, the use of the kind of&para;<br>race-conscious programs now barred by the Michigan Constitution.&para;<br>It foresees the ballot box, not the courts, as the normal instrument&para;<br>for resolving debates about the merits of these programs. Third,&para;<br>Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, and Washington v. Seattle School&para;<br>Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, which reflect the important principle that&para;<br>an individual’s ability to participate meaningfully in the political process should be independent of his race, do not apply here. Those cases involved a restructuring of the political process that changed the&para;<br>political level at which policies were enacted, while this case involves&para;<br>an amendment that took decisionmaking authority away from unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters. Hence, this&para;<br>case does not involve a diminution of the minority’s ability to participate in the political process. Extending the holding of Hunter and&para;<br>Seattle to situations where decisionmaking authority is moved from&para;<br>an administrative body to a political one would also create significant&para;<br>difficulties, given the nature of the administrative process. Furthermore, the principle underlying Hunter and Seattle runs up against a&para;<br>competing principle favoring decisionmaking through the democratic&para;<br>process.

The&para;<br>undergraduate admissions plan was addressed in Gratz v.&para;<br>Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244. The law school admission plan&para;<br>was addressed in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306. Each&para;<br>admissions process permitted the explicit consideration of&para;<br>an applicant’s race. In Gratz, the Court invalidated the&para;<br>undergraduate plan as a violation of the Equal Protection&para;<br>Clause. 539 U. S., at 270. In Grutter, the Court found no&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>constitutional flaw in the law school admission plan’s&para;<br>more limited use of race-based preferences. 539 U. S., at&para;<br>343.&para;<br>In response to the Court’s decision in Gratz, the university revised its undergraduate admissions process, but the&para;<br>revision still allowed limited use of race-based preferences.&para;<br>After a statewide debate on the question of racial preferences in the context of governmental decisionmaking, the&para;<br>voters, in 2006, adopted an amendment to the State Constitution prohibiting state and other governmental entities&para;<br>in Michigan from granting certain preferences, including&para;<br>race-based preferences, in a wide range of actions and&para;<br>decisions. Under the terms of the amendment, race-based&para;<br>preferences cannot be part of the admissions process for&para;<br>state universities. That particular prohibition is central to&para;<br>the instant case.&para;<br>The ballot proposal was called Proposal 2 and, after it&para;<br>passed by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent, the resulting enactment became Article I, §26, of the Michigan&para;<br>Constitution. As noted, the amendment is in broad terms.&para;<br>Section 26 states, in relevant part, as follows:&para;<br>“(1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State&para;<br>University, Wayne State University, and any other&para;<br>public college or university, community college, or&para;<br>school district shall not discriminate against, or grant&para;<br>preferential treatment to, any individual or group on&para;<br>the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national&para;<br>origin in the operation of public employment, public&para;<br>education, or public contracting.&para;<br>“(2) The state shall not discriminate against, or&para;<br>grant preferential treatment to, any individual or&para;<br>group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment,&para;<br>public education, or public contracting.&para;<br>“(3) For the purposes of this section ‘state’ includes,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Among the&para;<br>plaintiffs in the suits were the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight&para;<br>for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN); students;&para;<br>faculty; and prospective applicants to Michigan public&para;<br>universities.&para;<br>The named defendants included thenGovernor Jennifer Granholm, the Board of Regents of the&para;<br>University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan&para;<br>State University, and the Board of Governors of Wayne&para;<br>State University. The Michigan Attorney General was&para;<br>granted leave to intervene as a defendant. The United&para;<br>States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan&para;<br>consolidated the cases.&para;<br>In 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment&para;<br>to Michigan, thus upholding Proposal 2. BAMN v. Regents&para;<br>of Univ. of Mich., 539 F. Supp. 2d 924. The District Court&para;<br>denied a motion to reconsider the grant of summary judgment. 592 F. Supp. 2d 948. A panel of the United States&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the grant&para;<br>of summary judgment. 652 F. 3d 607 (2011). Judge Gibbons dissented from that holding. Id., at 633–646. The&para;<br>panel majority held that Proposal 2 had violated the principles elaborated by this Court in Washington v. Seattle&para;<br>School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982), and in the cases&para;<br>that Seattle relied upon.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, agreed with the&para;<br>panel decision. 701 F. 3d 466 (CA6 2012). The majority&para;<br>opinion determined that Seattle “mirrors the [case] before&para;<br>us.” Id., at 475. Seven judges dissented in a number of&para;<br>opinions.

BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>(2013).&para;<br>Before the Court addresses the question presented, it is&para;<br>important to note what this case is not about. It is not&para;<br>about the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious&para;<br>admissions policies in higher education. The consideration of race in admissions presents complex questions, in&para;<br>part addressed last Term in Fisher v. University of Texas&para;<br>at Austin, 570 U. S. ––– (2013). In Fisher, the Court did&para;<br>not disturb the principle that the consideration of race in&para;<br>admissions is permissible, provided that certain conditions&para;<br>are met. In this case, as in Fisher, that principle is not&para;<br>challenged. The question here concerns not the permissibility of race-conscious admissions policies under the&para;<br>Constitution but whether, and in what manner, voters in&para;<br>the States may choose to prohibit the consideration of&para;<br>racial preferences in governmental decisions, in particular&para;<br>with respect to school admissions.&para;<br>This Court has noted that some States have decided to&para;<br>prohibit race-conscious admissions policies. In Grutter,&para;<br>the Court noted: “Universities in California, Florida, and&para;<br>Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions&para;<br>are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in&para;<br>experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches. Universities in other States can and should&para;<br>draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral&para;<br>alternatives as they develop.” 539 U. S., at 342 (citing&para;<br>United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995)&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“[T]he States may perform&para;<br>their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise&para;<br>various solutions where the best solution is far from&para;<br>clear”)). In this way, Grutter acknowledged the significance of a dialogue regarding this contested and complex&para;<br>policy question among and within States. There was&para;<br>recognition that our federal structure “permits ‘ innovation&para;<br>and experimentation’ ” and “enables greater citizen ‘ involvement in democratic processes.’ ” Bond v. United&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>States, 564 U. S. –––, ––– (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting&para;<br>Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458 (1991)). While this&para;<br>case arises in Michigan, the decision by the State’s voters&para;<br>reflects in part the national dialogue regarding the wisdom and practicality of race-conscious admissions policies&para;<br>in higher education. See, e.g., Coalition for Economic&para;<br>Equity v. Wilson, 122 F. 3d 692 (CA9 1997).&para;<br>In Michigan, the State Constitution invests independent&para;<br>boards of trustees with plenary authority over public&para;<br>universities, including admissions policies. Mich. Const.,&para;<br>Art. VIII, §5; see also Federated Publications, Inc. v. Board&para;<br>of Trustees of Mich. State Univ., 460 Mich. 75, 86–87, 594&para;<br>N. W. 2d 491, 497 (1999). Although the members of the&para;<br>boards are elected, some evidence in the record suggests&para;<br>they delegated authority over admissions policy to the&para;<br>faculty. But whether the boards or the faculty set the&para;<br>specific policy, Michigan’s public universities did consider&para;<br>race as a factor in admissions decisions before 2006.&para;<br>In holding §26 invalid in the context of student admissions at state universities, the Court of Appeals relied in&para;<br>primary part on Seattle, supra, which it deemed to control&para;<br>the case. But that determination extends Seattle’s holding&para;<br>in a case presenting quite different issues to reach a conclusion that is mistaken here. Before explaining this&para;<br>further, it is necessary to consider the relevant cases that&para;<br>preceded Seattle and the background against which Seattle itself arose.&para;<br>Though it has not been prominent in the arguments of&para;<br>the parties, this Court’s decision in Reitman v. Mulkey,&para;<br>387 U. S. 369 (1967), is a proper beginning point for discussing the controlling decisions.&para;<br>In Mulkey, voters&para;<br>amended the California Constitution to prohibit any state&para;<br>legislative interference with an owner’s prerogative to&para;<br>decline to sell or rent residential property on any basis.&para;<br>Two different cases gave rise to Mulkey. In one a couple&para;<br>could not rent an apartment, and in the other a couple&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>were evicted from their apartment. Those adverse actions&para;<br>were on account of race. In both cases the complaining&para;<br>parties were barred, on account of race, from invoking the&para;<br>protection of California’s statutes; and, as a result, they&para;<br>were unable to lease residential property. This Court&para;<br>concluded that the state constitutional provision was a&para;<br>denial of equal protection. The Court agreed with the&para;<br>California Supreme Court that the amendment operated&para;<br>to insinuate the State into the decision to discriminate by&para;<br>encouraging that practice. The Court noted the “immediate design and intent” of the amendment was to “establis[h] a purported constitutional right to privately discriminate.” Id., at 374 (internal quotation marks omitted and&para;<br>emphasis deleted). The Court agreed that the amendment&para;<br>“expressly authorized and constitutionalized the private&para;<br>right to discriminate.” Id., at 376. The effect of the state&para;<br>constitutional amendment was to “significantly encourage&para;<br>and involve the State in private racial discriminations.”&para;<br>Id., at 381. In a dissent joined by three other Justices,&para;<br>Justice Harlan disagreed with the majority’s holding. Id.,&para;<br>at 387. The dissent reasoned that California, by the action&para;<br>of its voters, simply wanted the State to remain neutral in&para;<br>this area, so that the State was not a party to discrimination. Id., at 389. That dissenting voice did not prevail&para;<br>against the majority’s conclusion that the state action in&para;<br>question encouraged discrimination, causing real and&para;<br>specific injury.&para;<br>The next precedent of relevance, Hunter v. Erickson, 393&para;<br>U. S. 385 (1969), is central to the arguments the respondents make in the instant case. In Hunter, the Court for&para;<br>the first time elaborated what the Court of Appeals here&para;<br>styled the “political process” doctrine. There, the Akron&para;<br>City Council found that the citizens of Akron consisted of&para;<br>“ ‘people of different race[s], . . . many of whom live in&para;<br>circumscribed and segregated areas, under sub-standard&para;<br>unhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded condi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>tions, because of discrimination in the sale, lease, rental&para;<br>and financing of housing.’ ” Id., at 391. To address the&para;<br>problem, Akron enacted a fair housing ordinance to prohibit that sort of discrimination. In response, voters&para;<br>amended the city charter to overturn the ordinance and to&para;<br>require that any additional antidiscrimination housing&para;<br>ordinance be approved by referendum. But most other&para;<br>ordinances “regulating the real property market” were not&para;<br>subject to those threshold requirements. Id., at 390. The&para;<br>plaintiff, a black woman in Akron, Ohio, alleged that her&para;<br>real estate agent could not show her certain residences&para;<br>because the owners had specified they would not sell to&para;<br>black persons.&para;<br>Central to the Court’s reasoning in Hunter was that the&para;<br>charter amendment was enacted in circumstances where&para;<br>widespread racial discrimination in the sale and rental of&para;<br>housing led to segregated housing, forcing many to live in&para;<br>“ ‘unhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.’ ” Id., at 391. The Court stated: “It is against this&para;<br>background that the referendum required by [the charter&para;<br>amendment] must be assessed.” Ibid. Akron attempted to&para;<br>characterize the charter amendment “simply as a public&para;<br>decision to move slowly in the delicate area of race relations” and as a means “to allow the people of Akron to&para;<br>participate” in the decision. Id., at 392. The Court rejected&para;<br>Akron’s flawed “justifications for its discrimination,”&para;<br>justifications that by their own terms had the effect of&para;<br>acknowledging the targeted nature of the charter amendment. Ibid. The Court noted, furthermore, that the charter amendment was unnecessary as a general means of&para;<br>public control over the city council; for the people of Akron&para;<br>already were empowered to overturn ordinances by referendum. Id., at 390, n. 6. The Court found that the city&para;<br>charter amendment, by singling out antidiscrimination&para;<br>ordinances, “places special burden on racial minorities&para;<br>within the governmental process,” thus becoming as im-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>permissible as any other government action taken with&para;<br>the invidious intent to injure a racial minority. Id., at 391.&para;<br>Justice Harlan filed a concurrence. He argued the city&para;<br>charter amendment “has the clear purpose of making it&para;<br>more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities to&para;<br>achieve legislation that is in their interest.” Id., at 395.&para;<br>But without regard to the sentence just quoted, Hunter&para;<br>rests on the unremarkable principle that the State may&para;<br>not alter the procedures of government to target racial&para;<br>minorities. The facts in Hunter established that invidious&para;<br>discrimination would be the necessary result of the procedural restructuring. Thus, in Mulkey and Hunter, there&para;<br>was a demonstrated injury on the basis of race that, by&para;<br>reasons of state encouragement or participation, became&para;<br>more aggravated.&para;<br>Seattle is the third case of principal relevance here.&para;<br>There, the school board adopted a mandatory busing&para;<br>program to alleviate racial isolation of minority students&para;<br>in local schools. Voters who opposed the school board’s&para;<br>busing plan passed a state initiative that barred busing to&para;<br>desegregate. The Court first determined that, although&para;<br>“white as well as Negro children benefit from” diversity,&para;<br>the school board’s plan “inures primarily to the benefit of&para;<br>the minority.” 458 U. S., at 472. The Court next found&para;<br>that “the practical effect” of the state initiative was to&para;<br>“remov[e] the authority to address a racial problem—and&para;<br>only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking&para;<br>body, in such a way as to burden minority interests” because advocates of busing “now must seek relief from the&para;<br>state legislature, or from the statewide electorate.” Id., at&para;<br>474. The Court therefore found that the initiative had&para;<br>“explicitly us[ed] the racial nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process.” Id., at 470 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted).&para;<br>Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state&para;<br>action in question (the bar on busing enacted by the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>State’s voters) had the serious risk, if not purpose, of&para;<br>causing specific injuries on account of race, just as had&para;<br>been the case in Mulkey and Hunter. Although there had&para;<br>been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect&para;<br>to Seattle’s school district, it appears as though school&para;<br>segregation in the district in the 1940’s and 1950’s may&para;<br>have been the partial result of school board policies that&para;<br>“permitted white students to transfer out of black schools&para;<br>while restricting the transfer of black students into white&para;<br>schools.” Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 807–808 (2007)&para;<br>(BREYER, J., dissenting). In 1977, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed&para;<br>a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights, a federal&para;<br>agency. The NAACP alleged that the school board had&para;<br>maintained a system of de jure segregation. Specifically,&para;<br>the complaint alleged “that the Seattle School Board had&para;<br>created or perpetuated unlawful racial segregation&para;<br>through, e.g., certain school-transfer criteria, a construction program that needlessly built new schools in white&para;<br>areas, district line-drawing criteria, the maintenance of&para;<br>inferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit racial&para;<br>criteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and&para;<br>a general pattern of delay in respect to the implementation of promised desegregation efforts.” Id., at 810. As&para;<br>part of a settlement with the Office for Civil Rights, the&para;<br>school board implemented the “Seattle Plan,” which used&para;<br>busing and mandatory reassignments between elementary&para;<br>schools to reduce racial imbalance and which was the&para;<br>subject of the state initiative at issue in Seattle. See 551&para;<br>U. S., at 807–812.&para;<br>As this Court held in Parents Involved, the school&para;<br>board’s purported remedial action would not be permissible today absent a showing of de jure segregation. Id., at&para;<br>720–721. That holding prompted JUSTICE BREYER to&para;<br>observe in dissent, as noted above, that one permissible&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>reading of the record was that the school board had maintained policies to perpetuate racial segregation in the&para;<br>schools. In all events we must understand Seattle as&para;<br>Seattle understood itself, as a case in which neither the&para;<br>State nor the United States “challenge[d] the propriety of&para;<br>race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of&para;<br>achieving integration, even absent a finding of prior&para;<br>de jure segregation.” 458 U. S. at 472, n. 15. In other&para;<br>words the legitimacy and constitutionality of the remedy&para;<br>in question (busing for desegregation) was assumed, and&para;<br>Seattle must be understood on that basis. Ibid. Seattle&para;<br>involved a state initiative that “was carefully tailored to&para;<br>interfere only with desegregative busing.” Id., at 471. The&para;<br>Seattle Court, accepting the validity of the school board’s&para;<br>busing remedy as a predicate to its analysis of the constitutional question, found that the State’s disapproval of the&para;<br>school board’s busing remedy was an aggravation of the&para;<br>very racial injury in which the State itself was complicit.&para;<br>The broad language used in Seattle, however, went well&para;<br>beyond the analysis needed to resolve the case. The Court&para;<br>there seized upon the statement in Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that case&para;<br>had “the clear purpose of making it more difficult for&para;<br>certain racial and religious minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest.” 385 U. S., at 395. That&para;<br>language, taken in the context of the facts in Hunter, is&para;<br>best read simply to describe the necessity for finding an&para;<br>equal protection violation where specific injuries from&para;<br>hostile discrimination were at issue. The Seattle Court,&para;<br>however, used the language from the Hunter concurrence&para;<br>to establish a new and far-reaching rationale. Seattle&para;<br>stated that where a government policy “inures primarily&para;<br>to the benefit of the minority” and “minorities . . . consider” the policy to be “ ‘in their interest,’ ” then any state&para;<br>action that “place[s] effective decisionmaking authority&para;<br>over” that policy “at a different level of government” must&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>be reviewed under strict scrutiny. 458 U. S., at 472, 474.&para;<br>In essence, according to the broad reading of Seattle, any&para;<br>state action with a “racial focus” that makes it “more&para;<br>difficult for certain racial minorities than for other groups”&para;<br>to “achieve legislation that is in their interest” is subject to&para;<br>strict scrutiny. It is this reading of Seattle that the Court&para;<br>of Appeals found to be controlling here. And that reading&para;<br>must be rejected.&para;<br>The broad rationale that the Court of Appeals adopted&para;<br>goes beyond the necessary holding and the meaning of the&para;<br>precedents said to support it; and in the instant case&para;<br>neither the formulation of the general rule just set forth&para;<br>nor the precedents cited to authenticate it suffice to invalidate Proposal 2. The expansive reading of Seattle has no&para;<br>principled limitation and raises serious questions of compatibility with the Court’s settled equal protection jurisprudence. To the extent Seattle is read to require the&para;<br>Court to determine and declare which political policies&para;<br>serve the “interest” of a group defined in racial terms, that&para;<br>rationale was unnecessary to the decision in Seattle; it has&para;<br>no support in precedent; and it raises serious constitutional concerns. That expansive language does not provide&para;<br>a proper guide for decisions and should not be deemed&para;<br>authoritative or controlling. The rule that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals elaborated and respondents seek to establish here&para;<br>would contradict central equal protection principles.&para;<br>In cautioning against “impermissible racial stereotypes,”&para;<br>this Court has rejected the assumption that “members of&para;<br>the same racial group—regardless of their age, education,&para;<br>economic status, or the community in which they live—&para;<br>think alike, share the same political interests, and will&para;<br>prefer the same candidates at the polls.” Shaw v. Reno,&para;<br>509 U. S. 630, 647 (1993); see also Metro Broadcasting,&para;<br>Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 636 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (rejecting the “demeaning notion that members of&para;<br>. . . defined racial groups ascribe to certain ‘minority views’&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that must be different from those of other citizens”). It&para;<br>cannot be entertained as a serious proposition that all&para;<br>individuals of the same race think alike. Yet that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the Seattle&para;<br>formulation to control, as the Court of Appeals held it did&para;<br>in this case. And if it were deemed necessary to probe how&para;<br>some races define their own interest in political matters,&para;<br>still another beginning point would be to define individuals according to race. But in a society in which those lines&para;<br>are becoming more blurred, the attempt to define racebased categories also raises serious questions of its own.&para;<br>Government action that classifies individuals on the basis&para;<br>of race is inherently suspect and carries the danger of&para;<br>perpetuating the very racial divisions the polity seeks to&para;<br>transcend. Cf. Ho v. San Francisco Unified School Dist.,&para;<br>147 F. 3d 854, 858 (CA9 1998) (school district delineating&para;<br>13 racial categories for purposes of racial balancing).&para;<br>Were courts to embark upon this venture not only would it&para;<br>be undertaken with no clear legal standards or accepted&para;<br>sources to guide judicial decision but also it would result&para;<br>in, or at least impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable constitutionality on their own terms.&para;<br>Even assuming these initial steps could be taken in a&para;<br>manner consistent with a sound analytic and judicial&para;<br>framework, the court would next be required to determine&para;<br>the policy realms in which certain groups—groups defined&para;<br>by race—have a political interest. That undertaking,&para;<br>again without guidance from any accepted legal standards, would risk, in turn, the creation of incentives for&para;<br>those who support or oppose certain policies to cast the&para;<br>debate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Thus&para;<br>could racial antagonisms and conflict tend to arise in the&para;<br>context of judicial decisions as courts undertook to announce what particular issues of public policy should be&para;<br>classified as advantageous to some group defined by race.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>This risk is inherent in adopting the Seattle formulation.&para;<br>There would be no apparent limiting standards defining&para;<br>what public policies should be included in what Seattle&para;<br>called policies that “inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the&para;<br>minority” and that “minorities . . . consider” to be “ ‘in&para;<br>their interest.’ ” 458 U. S., at 472, 474. Those who seek to&para;<br>represent the interests of particular racial groups could&para;<br>attempt to advance those aims by demanding an equal&para;<br>protection ruling that any number of matters be foreclosed&para;<br>from voter review or participation. In a nation in which&para;<br>governmental policies are wide ranging, those who seek to&para;<br>limit voter participation might be tempted, were this&para;<br>Court to adopt the Seattle formulation, to urge that a&para;<br>group they choose to define by race or racial stereotypes&para;<br>are advantaged or disadvantaged by any number of laws&para;<br>or decisions. Tax policy, housing subsidies, wage regulations, and even the naming of public schools, highways,&para;<br>and monuments are just a few examples of what could&para;<br>become a list of subjects that some organizations could&para;<br>insist should be beyond the power of voters to decide, or&para;<br>beyond the power of a legislature to decide when enacting&para;<br>limits on the power of local authorities or other governmental entities to address certain subjects. Racial division&para;<br>would be validated, not discouraged, were the Seattle&para;<br>formulation, and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in&para;<br>this case, to remain in force.&para;<br>Perhaps, when enacting policies as an exercise of democratic self-government, voters will determine that racebased preferences should be adopted. The constitutional&para;<br>validity of some of those choices regarding racial preferences is not at issue here. The holding in the instant case&para;<br>is simply that the courts may not disempower the voters&para;<br>from choosing which path to follow. In the realm of policy&para;<br>discussions the regular give-and-take of debate ought to be&para;<br>a context in which rancor or discord based on race are&para;<br>avoided, not invited. And if these factors are to be inter-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>jected, surely it ought not to be at the invitation or insistence of the courts.&para;<br>One response to these concerns may be that objections&para;<br>to the larger consequences of the Seattle formulation need&para;<br>not be confronted in this case, for here race was an undoubted subject of the ballot issue. But a number of problems raised by Seattle, such as racial definitions, still&para;<br>apply. And this principal flaw in the ruling of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals does remain: Here there was no infliction of a&para;<br>specific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter&para;<br>and in the history of the Seattle schools. Here there is no&para;<br>precedent for extending these cases to restrict the right of&para;<br>Michigan voters to determine that race-based preferences&para;<br>granted by Michigan governmental entities should be&para;<br>ended.&para;<br>It should also be noted that the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals in this case of necessity calls into question other&para;<br>long-settled rulings on similar state policies. The California Supreme Court has held that a California constitutional amendment prohibiting racial preferences in public&para;<br>contracting does not violate the rule set down by Seattle.&para;<br>Coral Constr., Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 50&para;<br>Cal. 4th 315, 235 P. 3d 947 (2010). The Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Ninth Circuit has held that the same amendment,&para;<br>which also barred racial preferences in public education,&para;<br>does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Wilson, 122&para;<br>F. 3d 692 (1997). If the Court were to affirm the essential&para;<br>rationale of the Court of Appeals in the instant case, those&para;<br>holdings would be invalidated, or at least would be put in&para;<br>serious question. The Court, by affirming the judgment&para;<br>now before it, in essence would announce a finding that&para;<br>the past 15 years of state public debate on this issue have&para;<br>been improper. And were the argument made that Coral&para;<br>might still stand because it involved racial preferences in&para;<br>public contracting while this case concerns racial preferences in university admissions, the implication would be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that the constitutionality of laws forbidding racial preferences depends on the policy interest at stake, the concern&para;<br>that, as already explained, the voters deem it wise to avoid&para;<br>because of its divisive potential. The instant case presents&para;<br>the question involved in Coral and Wilson but not involved&para;<br>in Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle. That question is not how&para;<br>to address or prevent injury caused on account of race but&para;<br>whether voters may determine whether a policy of racebased preferences should be continued.&para;<br>By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding §26 to their&para;<br>State Constitution, the Michigan voters exercised their&para;<br>privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power. In the federal system States “respond,&para;<br>through the enactment of positive law, to the initiative of&para;<br>those who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own&para;<br>times.” Bond, 564 U. S., at ––– (slip op., at 9). Michigan&para;<br>voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials&para;<br>who were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a&para;<br>majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting&para;<br>race-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate&para;<br>issues.&para;<br>The freedom secured by the Constitution consists, in one&para;<br>of its essential dimensions, of the right of the individual&para;<br>not to be injured by the unlawful exercise of governmental&para;<br>power. The mandate for segregated schools, Brown v.&para;<br>Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); a wrongful&para;<br>invasion of the home, Silverman v. United States, 365&para;<br>U. S. 505 (1961); or punishing a protester whose views&para;<br>offend others, Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); and&para;<br>scores of other examples teach that individual liberty has&para;<br>constitutional protection, and that liberty’s full extent and&para;<br>meaning may remain yet to be discovered and affirmed.&para;<br>Yet freedom does not stop with individual rights. Our&para;<br>constitutional system embraces, too, the right of citizens to&para;<br>debate so they can learn and decide and then, through the&para;<br>political process, act in concert to try to shape the course&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>of their own times and the course of a nation that must&para;<br>strive always to make freedom ever greater and more&para;<br>secure.&para;<br>Here Michigan voters acted in concert and&para;<br>statewide to seek consensus and adopt a policy on a difficult subject against a historical background of race in&para;<br>America that has been a source of tragedy and persisting&para;<br>injustice. That history demands that we continue to learn,&para;<br>to listen, and to remain open to new approaches if we are&para;<br>to aspire always to a constitutional order in which all&para;<br>persons are treated with fairness and equal dignity. Were&para;<br>the Court to rule that the question addressed by Michigan&para;<br>voters is too sensitive or complex to be within the grasp of&para;<br>the electorate; or that the policies at issue remain too&para;<br>delicate to be resolved save by university officials or faculties, acting at some remove from immediate public scrutiny and control; or that these matters are so arcane that&para;<br>the electorate’s power must be limited because the people&para;<br>cannot prudently exercise that power even after a full&para;<br>debate, that holding would be an unprecedented restriction on the exercise of a fundamental right held not&para;<br>just by one person but by all in common. It is the right to&para;<br>speak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral process.&para;<br>The respondents in this case insist that a difficult question of public policy must be taken from the reach of the&para;<br>voters, and thus removed from the realm of public discussion, dialogue, and debate in an election campaign. Quite&para;<br>in addition to the serious First Amendment implications of&para;<br>that position with respect to any particular election, it is&para;<br>inconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning democracy. One of those premises is that&para;<br>a democracy has the capacity—and the duty—to learn&para;<br>from its past mistakes; to discover and confront persisting&para;<br>biases; and by respectful, rationale deliberation to rise&para;<br>above those flaws and injustices. That process is impeded,&para;<br>not advanced, by court decrees based on the proposition&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that the public cannot have the requisite repose to discuss&para;<br>certain issues. It is demeaning to the democratic process&para;<br>to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an&para;<br>issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.&para;<br>The process of public discourse and political debate should&para;<br>not be foreclosed even if there is a risk that during a public campaign there will be those, on both sides, who seek to&para;<br>use racial division and discord to their own political advantage. An informed public can, and must, rise above&para;<br>this. The idea of democracy is that it can, and must,&para;<br>mature. Freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to&para;<br>engage in a rational, civic discourse in order to determine&para;<br>how best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the&para;<br>Nation and its people. These First Amendment dynamics&para;<br>would be disserved if this Court were to say that the question here at issue is beyond the capacity of the voters to&para;<br>debate and then to determine.&para;<br>These precepts are not inconsistent with the wellestablished principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted&para;<br>on racial minorities by the encouragement or command of&para;<br>laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress by the courts. Cf. Johnson v. California, 543 U. S.&para;<br>499, 511–512 (2005) (“[S]earching judicial review . . . is&para;<br>necessary to guard against invidious discrimination”);&para;<br>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 619&para;<br>(1991) (“Racial discrimination” is “invidious in all contexts”). As already noted, those were the circumstances&para;<br>that the Court found present in Mulkey, Hunter, and&para;<br>Seattle. But those circumstances are not present here.&para;<br>For reasons already discussed, Mulkey, Hunter, and&para;<br>Seattle are not precedents that stand for the conclusion&para;<br>that Michigan’s voters must be disempowered from acting.&para;<br>Those cases were ones in which the political restriction in&para;<br>question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,&para;<br>to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race. What is&para;<br>at stake here is not whether injury will be inflicted but&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>whether government can be instructed not to follow a&para;<br>course that entails, first, the definition of racial categories&para;<br>and, second, the grant of favored status to persons in some&para;<br>racial categories and not others. The electorate’s instruction to governmental entities not to embark upon the&para;<br>course of race-defined and race-based preferences was&para;<br>adopted, we must assume, because the voters deemed a&para;<br>preference system to be unwise, on account of what voters&para;<br>may deem its latent potential to become itself a source of&para;<br>the very resentments and hostilities based on race that&para;<br>this Nation seeks to put behind it. Whether those adverse&para;<br>results would follow is, and should be, the subject of debate. Voters might likewise consider, after debate and&para;<br>reflection, that programs designed to increase diversity—&para;<br>consistent with the Constitution—are a necessary part of&para;<br>progress to transcend the stigma of past racism.&para;<br>This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it.&para;<br>There is no authority in the Constitution of the United&para;<br>States or in this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set&para;<br>aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination&para;<br>to the voters. See Sailors v. Board of Ed. of County of&para;<br>Kent, 387 U.

Called upon to explore the jurisprudential twilight zone between two errant lines of precedent, we confront a frighteningly bizarre question: Does&para;<br>the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbid what its text plainly requires? Needless to say&para;<br>(except that this case obliges us to say it), the question&para;<br>answers itself. “The Constitution proscribes government&para;<br>discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided&para;<br>education is no exception.” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.&para;<br>306, 349 (2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is precisely this understanding—the&para;<br>correct understanding—of the federal Equal Protection&para;<br>Clause that the people of the State of Michigan have&para;<br>adopted for their own fundamental law. By adopting it,&para;<br>they did not simultaneously offend it.&para;<br>Even taking this Court’s sorry line of race-basedadmissions cases as a given, I find the question presented&para;<br>only slightly less strange: Does the Equal Protection&para;<br>Clause forbid a State from banning a practice that the&para;<br>Clause barely—and only provisionally—permits? React-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ing to those race-based-admissions decisions, some&para;<br>States—whether deterred by the prospect of costly litigation; aware that Grutter’s bell may soon toll, see 539 U. S.,&para;<br>at 343; or simply opposed in principle to the notion of&para;<br>“benign” racial discrimination—have gotten out of the&para;<br>racial-preferences business altogether. And with our&para;<br>express encouragement: “Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in&para;<br>admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently&para;<br>engaging in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches. Universities in other States can and&para;<br>should draw on the most promising aspects of these raceneutral alternatives as they develop.” Id., at 342 (emphasis added). Respondents seem to think this admonition&para;<br>was merely in jest.1 The experiment, they maintain, is not&para;<br>only over; it never rightly began. Neither the people of the&para;<br>States nor their legislatures ever had the option of directing subordinate public-university officials to cease considering the race of applicants, since that would deny members of those minority groups the option of enacting a&para;<br>policy designed to further their interest, thus denying&para;<br>them the equal protection of the laws. Never mind that it&para;<br>is hotly disputed whether the practice of race-based admissions is ever in a racial minority’s interest. Cf. id., at&para;<br>371–373 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in&para;<br>part). And never mind that, were a public university to&para;<br>stake its defense of a race-based-admissions policy on the&para;<br>ground that it was designed to benefit primarily minorities&para;<br>(as opposed to all students, regardless of color, by enhancing diversity), we would hold the policy unconstitutional.&para;<br>See id., at 322–325.&para;<br>But the battleground for this case is not the constitu——————&para;<br>1 For simplicity’s sake, I use “respondent” or “respondents” throughout the opinion to describe only those parties who are adverse to&para;<br>petitioner, not Eric Russell, a respondent who supports petitioner.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Seattle&para;<br>School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982), and Hunter v.&para;<br>Erickson, 393 U. S. 385 (1969). I agree with those parts of&para;<br>the plurality opinion that repudiate this doctrine. But I do&para;<br>not agree with its reinterpretation of Seattle and Hunter,&para;<br>which makes them stand in part for the cloudy and doctrinally anomalous proposition that whenever state action&para;<br>poses “the serious risk . . . of causing specific injuries on&para;<br>account of race,” it denies equal protection. Ante, at 9. I&para;<br>would instead reaffirm that the “ordinary principles of our&para;<br>law [and] of our democratic heritage” require “plaintiffs&para;<br>alleging equal protection violations” stemming from facially neutral acts to “prove intent and causation and not&para;<br>merely the existence of racial disparity.” Freeman v. Pitts,&para;<br>503 U. S. 467, 506 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing&para;<br>Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976)). I would further hold that a law directing state actors to provide equal&para;<br>protection is (to say the least) facially neutral, and cannot&para;<br>violate the Constitution. Section 26 of the Michigan Constitution (formerly Proposal 2) rightly stands.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The political-process doctrine has its roots in two of our&para;<br>cases. The first is Hunter. In 1964, the Akron City Council passed a fair-housing ordinance “ ‘assur[ing] equal&para;<br>opportunity to all persons to live in decent housing facilities regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry or national&para;<br>origin.’ ” 393 U. S., at 386. Soon after, the city’s voters&para;<br>passed an amendment to the Akron City Charter stating&para;<br>that any ordinance enacted by the council that “ ‘regulates’ ” commercial transactions in real property “ ‘on the&para;<br>basis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry’ ”—&para;<br>including the already enacted 1964 ordinance—“must first&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>be approved by a majority of the electors voting on the&para;<br>question” at a later referendum. Id., at 387. The question&para;<br>was whether the charter amendment denied equal protection. Answering yes, the Court explained that “although&para;<br>the law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile&para;<br>in an identical manner, the reality is that the law’s impact&para;<br>falls on the minority. The majority needs no protection&para;<br>against discrimination.” Id., at 391. By placing a “special&para;<br>burden on racial minorities within the governmental&para;<br>processes,” the amendment “disadvantage[d]” a racial&para;<br>minority “by making it more difficult to enact legislation&para;<br>in its behalf.” Id., at 391, 393.&para;<br>The reasoning in Seattle is of a piece. Resolving to&para;<br>“eliminate all [racial] imbalance from the Seattle public&para;<br>schools,” the city school board passed a mandatory busing&para;<br>and pupil-reassignment plan of the sort typically imposed&para;<br>on districts guilty of de jure segregation. 458 U. S., at&para;<br>460–461. A year later, the citizens of the State of Washington passed Initiative 350, which directed (with exceptions) that “ ‘no school . . . shall directly or indirectly require any student to attend a school other than the school&para;<br>which is geographically nearest or next nearest the student’s place of residence . . . and which offers the course of&para;<br>study pursued by such student,’ ” permitting only courtordered race-based busing. Id., at 462. The lower courts&para;<br>held Initiative 350 unconstitutional, and we affirmed,&para;<br>announcing in the prelude of our analysis—as though it&para;<br>were beyond debate—that the Equal Protection Clause&para;<br>forbade laws that “subtly distor[t] governmental processes&para;<br>in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of&para;<br>minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” Id., at&para;<br>467.&para;<br>The first question in Seattle was whether the subject&para;<br>matter of Initiative 350 was a “ ‘racial’ issue,” triggering&para;<br>Hunter and its process doctrine. 458 U. S., at 471–472. It&para;<br>was “undoubtedly. . . true” that whites and blacks were&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>“counted among both the supporters and the opponents of&para;<br>Initiative 350.” Id., at 472. It was “equally clear” that&para;<br>both white and black children benefited from desegregated schools. Ibid. Nonetheless, we concluded that desegregation “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and&para;<br>is designed for that purpose.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In&para;<br>any event, it was “enough that minorities may consider&para;<br>busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their&para;<br>interest.’ ” Id., at 474 (quoting Hunter, supra, at 395&para;<br>(Harlan, J., concurring)).&para;<br>So we proceeded to the heart of the political-process&para;<br>analysis. We held Initiative 350 unconstitutional, since it&para;<br>removed “the authority to address a racial problem—and&para;<br>only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking&para;<br>body, in such a way as to burden minority interests.”&para;<br>Seattle, 458 U. S., at 474. Although school boards in&para;<br>Washington retained authority over other studentassignment issues and over most matters of educational&para;<br>policy generally, under Initiative 350, minorities favoring&para;<br>race-based busing would have to “surmount a considerably&para;<br>higher hurdle” than the mere petitioning of a local assembly: They “now must seek relief from the state legislature,&para;<br>or from the statewide electorate,” a “different level of&para;<br>government.” Ibid.&para;<br>The relentless logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to&para;<br>a similar conclusion in this case. In those cases, one level&para;<br>of government exercised borrowed authority over an apparently “racial issue,” until a higher level of government&para;<br>called the loan. So too here. In those cases, we deemed&para;<br>the revocation an equal-protection violation regardless of&para;<br>whether it facially classified according to race or reflected&para;<br>an invidious purpose to discriminate. Here, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals did the same.&para;<br>The plurality sees it differently. Though it, too, disavows the political-process-doctrine basis on which Hunter&para;<br>and Seattle were decided, ante, at 10–14, it does not take&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>the next step of overruling those cases. Rather, it reinterprets them beyond recognition. Hunter, the plurality&para;<br>suggests, was a case in which the challenged act had&para;<br>“target[ed] racial minorities.” Ante, at 8. Maybe, but the&para;<br>Hunter Court neither found that to be so nor considered it&para;<br>relevant, bypassing the question of intent entirely, satisfied that its newly minted political-process theory sufficed&para;<br>to invalidate the charter amendment.&para;<br>As for Seattle, what was really going on, according to the&para;<br>plurality, was that Initiative 350 had the consequence (if&para;<br>not the purpose) of preserving the harms effected by prior&para;<br>de jure segregation. Thus, “the political restriction in&para;<br>question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,&para;<br>to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.” Ante,&para;<br>at 17. That conclusion is derived not from the opinion but&para;<br>from recently discovered evidence that the city of Seattle&para;<br>had been a cause of its schools’ racial imbalance all along:&para;<br>“Although there had been no judicial finding of de jure&para;<br>segregation with respect to Seattle’s school district, it&para;<br>appears as though school segregation in the district in the&para;<br>1940’s and 1950’s may have been the partial result of&para;<br>school board policies.” Ante, at 9.2 That the district’s&para;<br>effort to end racial imbalance had been stymied by Initiative 350 meant that the people, by passing it, somehow&para;<br>had become complicit in Seattle’s equal-protection-denying&para;<br>status quo, whether they knew it or not. Hence, there&para;<br>was in Seattle a government-furthered “infliction of a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The plurality cites evidence from JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent in Par­&para;<br>ents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551&para;<br>U. S. 701 (2007), to suggest that the city had been a “partial” cause of&para;<br>its segregation problem. Ante, at 9. The plurality in Parents Involved&para;<br>criticized that dissent for relying on irrelevant evidence, for “elid[ing&para;<br>the] distinction between de jure and de facto segregation,” and for&para;<br>“casually intimat[ing] that Seattle’s school attendance patterns reflect[ed] illegal segregation.” 551 U.

The&para;<br>opinion assumes throughout that Seattle’s schools suffered&para;<br>at most from de facto segregation, see, e.g., 458 U. S., at&para;<br>474, 475—that is, segregation not the “product . . . of state&para;<br>action but of private choices,” having no “constitutional&para;<br>implications,” Freeman, 503 U. S., at 495–496. Nor did it&para;<br>anywhere state that the current racial imbalance was the&para;<br>(judicially remediable) effect of prior de jure segregation.&para;<br>Absence of de jure segregation or the effects of de jure&para;<br>segregation was a necessary premise of the Seattle opinion. That is what made the issue of busing and pupil&para;<br>reassignment a matter of political choice rather than&para;<br>judicial mandate.3 And precisely because it was a question&para;<br>for the political branches to decide, the manner—which is&para;<br>to say, the process—of its resolution implicated the Court’s&para;<br>new process theory. The opinion itself says this: “[I]n the&para;<br>absence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and&para;<br>efficacy of school desegregation are matters to be resolved&para;<br>through the political process. For present purposes, it is&para;<br>enough [to hold reallocation of that political decision to a&para;<br>higher level unconstitutional] that minorities may consider&para;<br>busing for integration to be legislation that is in their&para;<br>interest.” 458 U.

BAMN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Seattle should be overruled.&para;<br>The problems with the political-process doctrine begin&para;<br>with its triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task&para;<br>of determining whether a law that reallocates policymaking authority concerns a “racial issue.” Seattle, 458 U. S.,&para;<br>at 473. Seattle takes a couple of dissatisfying cracks at&para;<br>defining this crucial term. It suggests that an issue is&para;<br>racial if adopting one position on the question would “at&para;<br>bottom inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority, and&para;<br>is designed for that purpose.” Id., at 472. It is irrelevant&para;<br>that, as in Hunter and Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472, both the&para;<br>racial minority and the racial majority benefit from the&para;<br>policy in question, and members of both groups favor it.&para;<br>Judges should instead focus their guesswork on their own&para;<br>juridical sense of what is primarily for the benefit of minorities. Cf. ibid. (regarding as dispositive what “our&para;<br>cases” suggest is beneficial to minorities). On second&para;<br>thought, maybe judges need only ask this question: Is it&para;<br>possible “that minorities may consider” the policy in question to be “in their interest”? Id., at 474. If so, you can be&para;<br>sure that you are dealing with a “racial issue.”4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The dissent’s version of this test is just as scattershot. Since, according to the dissent, the doctrine forbids “reconfigur[ing] the political&para;<br>process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,” post, at 5&para;<br>(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (emphasis added), it must be that the reason&para;<br>the underlying issue (that is, the issue concerning which the process&para;<br>has been reconfigured) is “racial” is that the policy in question benefits&para;<br>only a racial minority (if it also benefited persons not belonging to a&para;<br>racial majority, then the political-process reconfiguration would burden&para;<br>them as well). On second thought: The issue is “racial” if the policy&para;<br>benefits primarily a racial minority and “ ‘[is] designed for that purpose,’ ” post, at 44. This is the standard Seattle purported to apply. But&para;<br>under that standard, §26 does not affect a “racial issue,” because under&para;<br>Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003), race-based admissions&para;<br>policies may not constitutionally be “designed for [the] purpose,”&para;<br>Seattle, supra, at 472, of benefiting primarily racial minorities, but&para;<br>must be designed for the purpose of achieving educational benefits for&para;<br>students of all races, Grutter, supra, at 322–325. So the dissent must&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

(Does a half-Latino, half–American Indian have&para;<br>Latino interests, American-Indian interests, both, half of&para;<br>both?5) What is worse, the exercise promotes the noxious&para;<br>fiction that, knowing only a person’s color or ethnicity, we&para;<br>can be sure that he has a predetermined set of policy&para;<br>“interests,” thus “reinforc[ing] the perception that members of the same racial group—regardless of their age,&para;<br>education, economic status, or the community in which&para;<br>they live—think alike, [and] share the same political&para;<br>interests.”6 Shaw v.

Of course discrimination against a group constitutes discrimination against each member of&para;<br>that group.

By contrast, voting in a favorable&para;<br>board (each of which has eight members) at the three&para;<br>major public universities requires electing by majority&para;<br>vote at least 15 different candidates, several of whom&para;<br>would be running during different election cycles.

So if Michigan voters,&para;<br>instead of amending their Constitution, had pursued the&para;<br>dissent’s preferred path of electing board members promising to “abolish race-sensitive admissions policies,” post, at&para;<br>3, it would have been harder, not easier, for racial minorities favoring affirmative action to overturn that decision.&para;<br>But the more important point is that we should not design&para;<br>our jurisprudence to conform to dictum in a footnote in a&para;<br>four-Justice opinion.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Moving from the appalling to the absurd, I turn now to&para;<br>the second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis—which is&para;<br>apparently no more administrable than the first, compare&para;<br>post, at 4–6 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (“This&para;<br>case . . . does not involve a reordering of the political&para;<br>process”), with post, at 25–29 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(yes, it does). This part of the inquiry directs a court to&para;<br>determine whether the challenged act “place[s] effective&para;<br>decisionmaking authority over [the] racial issue at a different level of government.” Seattle, 458 U. S., at 474.&para;<br>The laws in both Hunter and Seattle were thought to fail&para;<br>this test. In both cases, “the effect of the challenged&para;<br>action was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial&para;<br>matters—and only over racial matters—in such a way as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>to place comparative burdens on minorities.” 458 U. S., at&para;<br>475, n. 17. This, we said, a State may not do.&para;<br>By contrast, in another line of cases, we have emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design&para;<br>its governing structure as it sees fit. Generally, “a State is&para;<br>afforded wide leeway when experimenting with the appropriate allocation of state legislative power” and may create&para;<br>“political subdivisions such as cities and counties . . . ‘as&para;<br>convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the state as may be entrusted to them.’ ”&para;<br>Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71 (1978)&para;<br>(quoting Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, 178 (1907)).&para;<br>Accordingly, States have “absolute discretion” to determine the “number, nature and duration of the powers&para;<br>conferred upon [municipal] corporations and the territory&para;<br>over which they shall be exercised.” Holt Civic Club,&para;<br>supra, at 71. So it would seem to go without saying that a&para;<br>State may give certain powers to cities, later assign the&para;<br>same powers to counties, and even reclaim them for itself.&para;<br>Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-Seattle is the&para;<br>gaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of structural state sovereignty. If indeed the Fourteenth Amendment forbids States to “place effective decisionmaking&para;<br>authority over” racial issues at “different level[s] of government,” then it must be true that the Amendment’s&para;<br>ratification in 1868 worked a partial ossification of each&para;<br>State’s governing structure, rendering basically irrevocable the power of any subordinate state official who, the&para;<br>day before the Fourteenth Amendment’s passage, happened to enjoy legislatively conferred authority over a&para;<br>“racial issue.” Under the Fourteenth Amendment, that&para;<br>subordinate entity (suppose it is a city council) could itself&para;<br>take action on the issue, action either favorable or unfavorable to minorities. It could even reverse itself later.&para;<br>What it could not do, however, is redelegate its power to&para;<br>an even lower level of state government (such as a city-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>council committee) without forfeiting it, since the necessary effect of wresting it back would be to put an additional&para;<br>obstacle in the path of minorities. Likewise, no entity&para;<br>or official higher up the state chain (e.g., a county board)&para;<br>could exercise authority over the issue. Nor, even, could&para;<br>the state legislature, or the people by constitutional&para;<br>amendment, revoke the legislative conferral of power to&para;<br>the subordinate, whether the city council, its subcommittee, or the county board. Seattle’s logic would create&para;<br>affirmative-action safe havens wherever subordinate officials in public universities (1) traditionally have enjoyed&para;<br>“effective decisionmaking authority” over admissions&para;<br>policy but (2) have not yet used that authority to prohibit&para;<br>race-conscious admissions decisions. The mere existence&para;<br>of a subordinate’s discretion over the matter would work a&para;<br>kind of reverse pre-emption. It is “a strange notion—alien&para;<br>to our system—that local governmental bodies can forever&para;<br>pre-empt the ability of a State—the sovereign power—to&para;<br>address a matter of compelling concern to the State.” 458&para;<br>U. S., at 495 (Powell, J., dissenting). But that is precisely&para;<br>what the political-process doctrine contemplates.&para;<br>Perhaps the spirit of Seattle is especially disquieted by&para;<br>enactments of constitutional amendments. That appears&para;<br>to be the dissent’s position. The problem with §26, it&para;<br>suggests, is that amending Michigan’s Constitution is&para;<br>simply not a part of that State’s “existing” political process. E.g., post, at 4, 41. What a peculiar notion: that a&para;<br>revision of a State’s fundamental law, made in precisely&para;<br>the manner that law prescribes, by the very people who&para;<br>are the source of that law’s authority, is not part of the&para;<br>“political process” which, but for those people and that&para;<br>law, would not exist. This will surely come as news to the&para;<br>people of Michigan, who, since 1914, have amended their&para;<br>Constitution 20 times. Brief for Gary Segura et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 12. Even so, the dissent concludes that the&para;<br>amendment attacked here worked an illicit “chang[ing]&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429&para;<br>U. S. 252, 264–265 (1977). Indeed, we affirmed this principle the same day we decided Seattle: “[E]ven when a&para;<br>neutral law has a disproportionately adverse effect on a&para;<br>racial minority, the Fourteenth Amendment is violated&para;<br>only if a discriminatory purpose can be shown.” Crawford&para;<br>v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U. S. 527, 537–538&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The dissent thinks I do not understand its argument. Only when&para;<br>amending Michigan’s Constitution violates Hunter-Seattle, it says, is&para;<br>that constitutionally prescribed activity necessarily not part of the&para;<br>State’s existing political process. Post, at 21, n. 7. I understand the&para;<br>argument quite well; and see quite well that it begs the question. Why&para;<br>is Michigan’s action here unconstitutional? Because it violates HunterSeattle. And why does it violate Hunter-Seattle? Because it is not part&para;<br>of the State’s existing political process.

But this is just&para;<br>the political-process theory bedecked in different doctrinal&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 According to the dissent, Hunter-Seattle fills an important doctrinal&para;<br>gap left open by Washington v.

Although the boards&para;<br>unquestionably retained the power to set policy regarding&para;<br>race-conscious&para;<br>admissions,&para;<br>see&para;<br>post,&para;<br>at&para;<br>25–29&para;<br>(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), in fact faculty members and&para;<br>administrators set the race-conscious admissions policies&para;<br>in question.&para;<br>(It is often true that elected bodies—&para;<br>including, for example, school boards, city councils, and&para;<br>state legislatures—have the power to enact policies, but in&para;<br>fact delegate that power to administrators.) Although at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>limited times the university boards were advised of the&para;<br>content of their race-conscious admissions policies, see 701&para;<br>F. 3d 466, 481–482 (CA6 2012), to my knowledge no board&para;<br>voted to accept or reject any of those policies. Thus, unelected faculty members and administrators, not voters or&para;<br>their elected representatives, adopted the race-conscious&para;<br>admissions programs affected by Michigan’s constitutional&para;<br>amendment. The amendment took decisionmaking authority away from these unelected actors and placed it in&para;<br>the hands of the voters.&para;<br>Why does this matter? For one thing, considered conceptually, the doctrine set forth in Hunter and Seattle does&para;<br>not easily fit this case. In those cases minorities had&para;<br>participated in the political process and they had won.&para;<br>The majority’s subsequent reordering of the political&para;<br>process repealed the minority’s successes and made it&para;<br>more difficult for the minority to succeed in the future.&para;<br>The majority thereby diminished the minority’s ability to&para;<br>participate meaningfully in the electoral process. But one&para;<br>cannot as easily characterize the movement of the decisionmaking mechanism at issue here—from an administrative process to an electoral process—as diminishing the&para;<br>minority’s ability to participate meaningfully in the political process. There is no prior electoral process in which&para;<br>the minority participated.&para;<br>For another thing, to extend the holding of Hunter and&para;<br>Seattle to reach situations in which decisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative body to a political&para;<br>one would pose significant difficulties. The administrative&para;<br>process encompasses vast numbers of decisionmakers&para;<br>answering numerous policy questions in hosts of different&para;<br>fields. See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, ___ (2010) (BREYER,&para;<br>J., dissenting). Administrative bodies modify programs in&para;<br>detail, and decisionmaking authority within the administrative process frequently moves around—due to amend-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ments to statutes, new administrative rules, and evolving&para;<br>agency practice. It is thus particularly difficult in this&para;<br>context for judges to determine when a change in the locus&para;<br>of decisionmaking authority places a comparative structural burden on a racial minority. And to apply Hunter&para;<br>and Seattle to the administrative process would, by tending to hinder change, risk discouraging experimentation,&para;<br>interfering with efforts to see when and how raceconscious policies work.&para;<br>Finally, the principle that underlies Hunter and Seattle&para;<br>runs up against a competing principle, discussed above.&para;<br>This competing principle favors decisionmaking through&para;<br>the democratic process. Just as this principle strongly&para;<br>supports the right of the people, or their elected representatives, to adopt race-conscious policies for reasons of&para;<br>inclusion, so must it give them the right to vote not to do&para;<br>so.&para;<br>As I have said, my discussion here is limited to circumstances in which decisionmaking is moved from an unelected administrative body to a politically responsive one,&para;<br>and in which the targeted race-conscious admissions&para;<br>programs consider race solely in order to obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body. We need now&para;<br>decide no more than whether the Federal Constitution&para;<br>permits Michigan to apply its constitutional amendment&para;<br>in those circumstances. I would hold that it does. Therefore, I concur in the judgment of the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

But&para;<br>without checks, democratically approved legislation can&para;<br>oppress minority groups. For that reason, our Constitution places limits on what a majority of the people may do.&para;<br>This case implicates one such limit: the guarantee of equal&para;<br>protection of the laws. Although that guarantee is traditionally understood to prohibit intentional discrimination&para;<br>under existing laws, equal protection does not end there.&para;<br>Another fundamental strand of our equal protection jurisprudence focuses on process, securing to all citizens the&para;<br>right to participate meaningfully and equally in selfgovernment. That right is the bedrock of our democracy,&para;<br>for it preserves all other rights.&para;<br>Yet to know the history of our Nation is to understand&para;<br>its long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of&para;<br>racial minorities to participate in the political process. At&para;<br>first, the majority acted with an open, invidious purpose.&para;<br>Notwithstanding the command of the Fifteenth Amendment, certain States shut racial minorities out of the&para;<br>political process altogether by withholding the right to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>vote. This Court intervened to preserve that right. The&para;<br>majority tried again, replacing outright bans on voting&para;<br>with literacy tests, good character requirements, poll&para;<br>taxes, and gerrymandering. The Court was not fooled; it&para;<br>invalidated those measures, too. The majority persisted.&para;<br>This time, although it allowed the minority access to the&para;<br>political process, the majority changed the ground rules of&para;<br>the process so as to make it more difficult for the minority,&para;<br>and the minority alone, to obtain policies designed to&para;<br>foster racial integration. Although these political restructurings may not have been discriminatory in purpose, the&para;<br>Court reaffirmed the right of minority members of our&para;<br>society to participate meaningfully and equally in the&para;<br>political process.&para;<br>This case involves this last chapter of discrimination: A&para;<br>majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic&para;<br>rules of the political process in that State in a manner that&para;<br>uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.1 Prior to the&para;<br>enactment of the constitutional initiative at issue here,&para;<br>all of the admissions policies of Michigan’s public colleges&para;<br>and universities—including race-sensitive admissions policies2—were in the hands of each institution’s governing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 I of course do not mean to suggest that Michigan’s voters acted with&para;<br>anything like the invidious intent, see n. 8, infra, of those who historically stymied the rights of racial minorities. Contra, ante, at 18, n. 11&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). But like earlier chapters of&para;<br>political restructuring, the Michigan amendment at issue in this case&para;<br>changed the rules of the political process to the disadvantage of minority members of our society.&para;<br>2 Although the term “affirmative action” is commonly used to describe&para;<br>colleges’ and universities’ use of race in crafting admissions policies, I&para;<br>instead use the term “race-sensitive admissions policies.” Some comprehend the term “affirmative action” as connoting intentional preferential treatment based on race alone—for example, the use of a quota&para;<br>system, whereby a certain proportion of seats in an institution’s incoming class must be set aside for racial minorities; the use of a “points”&para;<br>system, whereby an institution accords a fixed numerical advantage to&para;<br>an applicant because of her race; or the admission of otherwise unquali-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>board. The members of those boards are nominated by&para;<br>political parties and elected by the citizenry in statewide&para;<br>elections. After over a century of being shut out of Michigan’s institutions of higher education, racial minorities in&para;<br>Michigan had succeeded in persuading the elected board&para;<br>representatives to adopt admissions policies that took into&para;<br>account the benefits of racial diversity. And this Court&para;<br>twice blessed such efforts—first in Regents of Univ. of Cal.&para;<br>v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), and again in Grutter v.&para;<br>Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003), a case that itself concerned&para;<br>a Michigan admissions policy.&para;<br>In the wake of Grutter, some voters in Michigan set out&para;<br>to eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies.&para;<br>Those voters were of course free to pursue this end in any&para;<br>number of ways. For example, they could have persuaded&para;<br>existing board members to change their minds through&para;<br>individual or grassroots lobbying efforts, or through general public awareness campaigns. Or they could have&para;<br>mobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out&para;<br>of office, replacing them with members who would share&para;<br>their desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies.&para;<br>When this Court holds that the Constitution permits a&para;<br>particular policy, nothing prevents a majority of a State’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>fied students to an institution solely on account of their race. None of&para;<br>this is an accurate description of the practices that public universities&para;<br>are permitted to adopt after this Court’s decision in Grutter v. Bol­&para;<br>linger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003). There, we instructed that institutions of&para;<br>higher education could consider race in admissions in only a very&para;<br>limited way in an effort to create a diverse student body. To comport&para;<br>with Grutter, colleges and universities must use race flexibly, id., at&para;<br>334, and must not maintain a quota, ibid. And even this limited&para;<br>sensitivity to race must be limited in time, id., at 341–343, and must be&para;<br>employed only after “serious, good faith consideration of workable raceneutral alternatives,” id., at 339. Grutter-compliant admissions plans,&para;<br>like the ones in place at Michigan’s institutions, are thus a far cry from&para;<br>affirmative action plans that confer preferential treatment intentionally and solely on the basis of race.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>voters from choosing not to adopt that policy. Our system&para;<br>of government encourages—and indeed, depends on—that&para;<br>type of democratic action.&para;<br>But instead, the majority of Michigan voters changed&para;<br>the rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the&para;<br>existing political process in Michigan in a manner that&para;<br>burdened racial minorities. They did so in the 2006 election by amending the Michigan Constitution to enact Art.&para;<br>I, §26, which provides in relevant part that Michigan’s&para;<br>public universities “shall not discriminate against, or&para;<br>grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on&para;<br>the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in&para;<br>the operation of public employment, public education, or&para;<br>public contracting.”&para;<br>As a result of §26, there are now two very different&para;<br>processes through which a Michigan citizen is permitted to&para;<br>influence the admissions policies of the State’s universities: one for persons interested in race-sensitive admissions policies and one for everyone else. A citizen who is a&para;<br>University of Michigan alumnus, for instance, can advocate for an admissions policy that considers an applicant’s&para;<br>legacy status by meeting individually with members of the&para;<br>Board of Regents to convince them of her views, by joining&para;<br>with other legacy parents to lobby the Board, or by voting&para;<br>for and supporting Board candidates who share her position. The same options are available to a citizen who&para;<br>wants the Board to adopt admissions policies that consider&para;<br>athleticism, geography, area of study, and so on. The one&para;<br>and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through&para;<br>this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions&para;<br>policy that considers race in an individualized manner&para;<br>when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not&para;<br>adequate to achieve diversity. For that policy alone, the&para;<br>citizens of Michigan must undertake the daunting task of&para;<br>amending the State Constitution.&para;<br>Our precedents do not permit political restructurings&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that create one process for racial minorities and a separate, less burdensome process for everyone else. This&para;<br>Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not&para;<br>tolerate “a political structure that treats all individuals as&para;<br>equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in&para;<br>such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of&para;<br>minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” Wash­&para;<br>ington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, 467&para;<br>(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such restructuring, the Court explained, “is no more permissible than&para;<br>denying [the minority] the [right to] vote, on an equal&para;<br>basis with others.” Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, 391&para;<br>(1969). In those cases—Hunter and Seattle—the Court&para;<br>recognized what is now known as the “political-process&para;<br>doctrine”: When the majority reconfigures the political&para;<br>process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,&para;<br>that alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny.&para;<br>Today, disregarding stare decisis, a majority of the&para;<br>Court effectively discards those precedents. The plurality&para;<br>does so, it tells us, because the freedom actually secured&para;<br>by the Constitution is the freedom of self-government—&para;<br>because the majority of Michigan citizens “exercised their&para;<br>privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power.” Ante, at 15. It would be “demeaning to the&para;<br>democratic process,” the plurality concludes, to disturb&para;<br>that decision in any way. Ante, at 17. This logic embraces&para;<br>majority rule without an important constitutional limit.&para;<br>The plurality’s decision fundamentally misunderstands&para;<br>the nature of the injustice worked by §26. This case is not,&para;<br>as the plurality imagines, about “who may resolve” the&para;<br>debate over the use of race in higher education admissions. Ante, at 18. I agree wholeheartedly that nothing&para;<br>vests the resolution of that debate exclusively in the courts&para;<br>or requires that we remove it from the reach of the electorate. Rather, this case is about how the debate over the&para;<br>use of race-sensitive admissions policies may be resolved,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>contra, ibid.—that is, it must be resolved in constitutionally permissible ways. While our Constitution does not&para;<br>guarantee minority groups victory in the political process,&para;<br>it does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to&para;<br>that process. It guarantees that the majority may not win&para;<br>by stacking the political process against minority groups&para;<br>permanently, forcing the minority alone to surmount&para;<br>unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals—here, educational&para;<br>diversity that cannot reasonably be accomplished through&para;<br>race-neutral measures. Today, by permitting a majority of&para;<br>the voters in Michigan to do what our Constitution forbids,&para;<br>the Court ends the debate over race-sensitive admissions&para;<br>policies in Michigan in a manner that contravenes constitutional protections long recognized in our precedents.&para;<br>Like the plurality, I have faith that our citizenry will&para;<br>continue to learn from this Nation’s regrettable history;&para;<br>that it will strive to move beyond those injustices towards&para;<br>a future of equality. And I, too, believe in the importance&para;<br>of public discourse on matters of public policy. But I part&para;<br>ways with the plurality when it suggests that judicial&para;<br>intervention in this case “impede[s]” rather than “advance[s]” the democratic process and the ultimate hope of&para;<br>equality. Ante, at 16. I firmly believe that our role as&para;<br>judges includes policing the process of self-government&para;<br>and stepping in when necessary to secure the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Because I would do&para;<br>so here, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>For much of its history, our Nation has denied to many&para;<br>of its citizens the right to participate meaningfully and&para;<br>equally in its politics. This is a history we strive to put&para;<br>behind us. But it is a history that still informs the society&para;<br>we live in, and so it is one we must address with candor.&para;<br>Because the political-process doctrine is best understood&para;<br>against the backdrop of this history, I will briefly trace its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>course.&para;<br>The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified after the Civil War,&para;<br>promised to racial minorities the right to vote. But many&para;<br>States ignored this promise. In addition to outright tactics&para;<br>of fraud, intimidation, and violence, there are countless&para;<br>examples of States categorically denying to racial minorities access to the political process. Consider Texas; there,&para;<br>a 1923 statute prevented racial minorities from participating in primary elections. After this Court declared that&para;<br>statute unconstitutional, Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536,&para;<br>540–541 (1927), Texas responded by changing the rules.&para;<br>It enacted a new statute that gave political parties themselves the right to determine who could participate in&para;<br>their primaries. Predictably, the Democratic Party specified that only white Democrats could participate in its&para;<br>primaries. Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73, 81–82 (1932).&para;<br>The Court invalidated that scheme, too. Id., at 89; see&para;<br>also Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944); Terry v.&para;<br>Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953).&para;<br>Some States were less direct. Oklahoma was one of&para;<br>many that required all voters to pass a literacy test. But&para;<br>the test did not apply equally to all voters. Under a&para;<br>“grandfather clause,” voters were exempt if their grandfathers had been voters or had served as soldiers before&para;<br>1866. This meant, of course, that black voters had to pass&para;<br>the test, but many white voters did not. The Court held&para;<br>the scheme unconstitutional. Guinn v. United States, 238&para;<br>U. S. 347 (1915). In response, Oklahoma changed the&para;<br>rules. It enacted a new statute under which all voters who&para;<br>were qualified to vote in 1914 (under the unconstitutional&para;<br>grandfather clause) remained qualified, and the remaining&para;<br>voters had to apply for registration within a 12-day period.&para;<br>Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 270–271 (1939). The Court&para;<br>struck down that statute as well. Id., at 275.&para;<br>Racial minorities were occasionally able to surmount the&para;<br>hurdles to their political participation. Indeed, in some&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>States, minority citizens were even able to win elective&para;<br>office. But just as many States responded to the Fifteenth&para;<br>Amendment by subverting minorities’ access to the polls,&para;<br>many States responded to the prospect of elected minority&para;<br>officials by undermining the ability of minorities to win&para;<br>and hold elective office. Some States blatantly removed&para;<br>black officials from local offices. See, e.g., H. Rabinowitz,&para;<br>Race Relations in the Urban South, 1865–1890, pp. 267,&para;<br>269–270 (1978) (describing events in Tennessee and Virginia). Others changed the processes by which local officials were elected. See, e.g., Extension of the Voting&para;<br>Rights Act, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil&para;<br>and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the&para;<br>Judiciary, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 2016–2017&para;<br>(1981) (hereinafter 1981 Hearings) (statement of Professor&para;<br>J. Morgan Kousser) (after a black judge refused to resign&para;<br>in Alabama, the legislature abolished the court on which&para;<br>he served and replaced it with one whose judges were&para;<br>appointed by the Governor); Rabinowitz, supra, at 269–&para;<br>270 (the North Carolina Legislature divested voters of&para;<br>the right to elect justices of the peace and county commissioners, then arrogated to itself the authority to select&para;<br>justices of the peace and gave them the power to select&para;<br>commissioners).&para;<br>This Court did not stand idly by. In Alabama, for example, the legislature responded to increased black voter&para;<br>registration in the city of Tuskegee by amending the State&para;<br>Constitution to authorize legislative abolition of the county&para;<br>in which Tuskegee was located, Ala. Const. Amdt. 132&para;<br>(1957), repealed by Ala. Const. Amdt. 406 (1982), and by&para;<br>redrawing the city’s boundaries to remove all the black&para;<br>voters “while not removing a single white voter,” Gomil­&para;<br>lion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 341 (1960). The Court&para;<br>intervened, finding it “inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution” could be “manipulated out of&para;<br>existence” by being “cloaked in the garb of [political] rea-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lignment.” Id., at 345 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>This Court’s landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of&para;<br>Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), triggered a new era of&para;<br>political restructuring, this time in the context of education. In Virginia, the General Assembly transferred control of student assignment from local school districts to a&para;<br>State Pupil Placement Board. See B. Muse, Virginia’s&para;<br>Massive Resistance 34, 74 (1961). And when the legislature learned that the Arlington County school board had&para;<br>prepared a desegregation plan, the General Assembly&para;<br>“swiftly retaliated” by stripping the county of its right to&para;<br>elect its school board by popular vote and instead making&para;<br>the board an appointed body. Id., at 24; see also B. Smith,&para;<br>They Closed Their Schools 142–143 (1965).&para;<br>Other States similarly disregarded this Court’s mandate&para;<br>by changing their political process. See, e.g., Bush v.&para;<br>Orleans Parish School Bd., 187 F. Supp. 42, 44–45 (ED La.&para;<br>1960) (the Louisiana Legislature gave the Governor the&para;<br>authority to supersede any school board’s decision to&para;<br>integrate); Extension of the Voting Rights Act, Hearings&para;<br>on H. R. 4249 et al. before Subcommittee No. 5 of the&para;<br>House Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess.,&para;<br>146–149 (1969) (statement of Thomas E. Harris, Assoc.&para;<br>Gen. Counsel, American Federation of Labor and Congress&para;<br>of Industrial Organizations) (the Mississippi Legislature&para;<br>removed from the people the right to elect superintendents&para;<br>of education in 11 counties and instead made those positions appointive).&para;<br>The Court remained true to its command in Brown. In&para;<br>Arkansas, for example, it enforced a desegregation order&para;<br>against the Little Rock school board. Cooper v. Aaron, 358&para;<br>U. S. 1, 5 (1958). On the very day the Court announced&para;<br>that ruling, the Arkansas Legislature responded by changing the rules. It enacted a law permitting the Governor to&para;<br>close any public school in the State, and stripping local&para;<br>school districts of their decisionmaking authority so long&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>as the Governor determined that local officials could not&para;<br>maintain “ ‘a general, suitable, and efficient educational&para;<br>system.’ ” Aaron v. Cooper, 261 F. 2d 97, 99 (CA8 1958)&para;<br>(per curiam) (quoting Arkansas statute).&para;<br>The thenGovernor immediately closed all of Little Rock’s high&para;<br>schools. Id., at 99–100; see also S. Breyer, Making Our&para;<br>Democracy Work 49–67 (2010) (discussing the events in&para;<br>Little Rock).&para;<br>The States’ political restructuring efforts in the 1960’s&para;<br>and 1970’s went beyond the context of education. Many&para;<br>States tried to suppress the political voice of racial minorities more generally by reconfiguring the manner in which&para;<br>they filled vacancies in local offices, often transferring&para;<br>authority from the electorate (where minority citizens had&para;<br>a voice at the local level) to the States’ executive branch&para;<br>(where minorities wielded little if any influence). See, e.g.,&para;<br>1981 Hearings, pt. 1, at 815 (report of J. Cox &amp; A. Turner)&para;<br>(the Alabama Legislature changed all municipal judgeships from elective to appointive offices); id., at 1955&para;<br>(report of R. Hudlin &amp; K. Brimah, Voter Educ. Project,&para;<br>Inc.) (the Georgia Legislature eliminated some elective&para;<br>offices and made others appointive when it appeared that&para;<br>a minority candidate would be victorious); id., at 501&para;<br>(statement of Frank R. Parker, Director, Lawyers’ Comm.&para;<br>for Civil Rights Under Law) (the Mississippi Legislature&para;<br>changed the manner of filling vacancies for various public&para;<br>offices from election to appointment).&para;<br>II&para;<br>It was in this historical context that the Court intervened in Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385 (1969), and&para;<br>Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457&para;<br>(1982). Together, Hunter and Seattle recognized a fundamental strand of this Court’s equal protection jurisprudence: the political-process doctrine. To understand that&para;<br>doctrine fully, it is necessary to set forth in detail precisely&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>what the Court had before it, and precisely what it said.&para;<br>For to understand Hunter and Seattle is to understand&para;<br>why those cases straightforwardly resolve this one.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In Hunter, the City Council of Akron, Ohio, enacted a&para;<br>fair housing ordinance to “assure equal opportunity to all&para;<br>persons to live in decent housing facilities regardless of&para;<br>race, color, religion, ancestry, or national origin.” 393&para;<br>U. S., at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted). A majority of the citizens of Akron disagreed with the ordinance&para;<br>and overturned it. But the majority did not stop there; it&para;<br>also amended the city charter to prevent the City Council&para;<br>from implementing any future ordinance dealing with&para;<br>racial, religious, or ancestral discrimination in housing&para;<br>without the approval of the majority of the Akron electorate. Ibid. That amendment changed the rules of the&para;<br>political process in Akron. The Court described the result&para;<br>of the change as follows:&para;<br>“[T]o enact an ordinance barring housing discrimination on the basis of race or religion, proponents had to&para;<br>obtain the approval of the City Council and of a majority of the voters citywide. To enact an ordinance preventing housing discrimination on other grounds, or&para;<br>to enact any other type of housing ordinance, proponents needed the support of only the City Council.”&para;<br>Seattle, 458 U. S., at 468 (describing Hunter; emphasis deleted).&para;<br>The Court invalidated the Akron charter amendment&para;<br>under the Equal Protection Clause. It concluded that the&para;<br>amendment unjustifiably “place[d] special burdens on&para;<br>racial minorities within the governmental process,” thus&para;<br>effecting “a real, substantial, and invidious denial of the&para;<br>equal protection of the laws.” Hunter, 393 U. S., at 391,&para;<br>393. The Court characterized the amendment as “no more&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>permissible” than denying racial minorities the right to&para;<br>vote on an equal basis with the majority. Id., at 391. For&para;<br>a “State may no more disadvantage any particular group&para;<br>by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf&para;<br>than it may dilute any person’s vote or give any group a&para;<br>smaller representation than another of comparable size.”&para;<br>Id., at 392–393. The vehicle for the change—a popular&para;<br>referendum—did not move the Court: “The sovereignty of&para;<br>the people,” it explained, “is itself subject to . . . constitutional limitations.” Id., at 392.&para;<br>Justice Harlan, joined by Justice Stewart, wrote in his&para;<br>concurrence that although a State can normally allocate&para;<br>political power according to any general principle, it bears&para;<br>a “far heavier burden of justification” when it reallocates&para;<br>political power based on race, because the selective reallocation necessarily makes it far more difficult for racial&para;<br>minorities to “achieve legislation that is in their interest.”&para;<br>Id., at 395 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>In Seattle, a case that mirrors the one before us, the&para;<br>Court applied Hunter to invalidate a statute, enacted by a&para;<br>majority of Washington State’s citizens, that prohibited&para;<br>racially integrative busing in the wake of Brown. As early&para;<br>as 1963, Seattle’s School District No. 1 began taking steps&para;<br>to cure the de facto racial segregation in its schools. 458&para;<br>U. S., at 460–461. Among other measures, it enacted a&para;<br>desegregation plan that made extensive use of busing and&para;<br>mandatory assignments. Id., at 461. The district was&para;<br>under no obligation to adopt the plan; Brown charged&para;<br>school boards with a duty to integrate schools that were&para;<br>segregated because of de jure racial discrimination, but&para;<br>there had been no finding that the de facto segregation in&para;<br>Seattle’s schools was the product of de jure discrimination.&para;<br>458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. Several residents who opposed&para;<br>the desegregation efforts formed a committee and sued to&para;<br>enjoin implementation of the plan. Id., at 461. When&para;<br>these efforts failed, the committee sought to change the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rules of the political process. It drafted a statewide initiative “designed to terminate the use of mandatory busing&para;<br>for purposes of racial integration.” Id., at 462. A majority of the State’s citizens approved the initiative. Id., at&para;<br>463–464.&para;<br>The Court invalidated the initiative under the Equal&para;<br>Protection Clause. It began by observing that equal protection of the laws “guarantees racial minorities the right&para;<br>to full participation in the political life of the community.”&para;<br>Id., at 467. “It is beyond dispute,” the Court explained,&para;<br>“that given racial or ethnic groups may not be denied the&para;<br>franchise, or precluded from entering into the political&para;<br>process in a reliable and meaningful manner.” Ibid. But&para;<br>the Equal Protection Clause reaches further, the Court&para;<br>stated, reaffirming the principle espoused in Hunter—that&para;<br>while “laws structuring political institutions or allocating&para;<br>political power according to neutral principles” do not&para;<br>violate the Constitution, “a different analysis is required&para;<br>when the State allocates governmental power nonneutrally,&para;<br>by explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process.” 458 U. S., at 470.&para;<br>That kind of state action, it observed, “places special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process,” by making it “more difficult for certain racial and&para;<br>religious minorities” than for other members of the community “to achieve legislation . . . in their interest.” Ibid.&para;<br>Rejecting the argument that the initiative had no racial&para;<br>focus, the Court found that the desegregation of public&para;<br>schools, like the Akron housing ordinance, “inure[d] primarily to the benefit of the minority, and [was] designed&para;<br>for that purpose.” Id., at 472. Because minorities had&para;<br>good reason to “consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest,’ ” the Court concluded that&para;<br>the “racial focus of [the initiative] . . . suffice[d] to trigger&para;<br>application of the Hunter doctrine.” Id., at 474 (quoting&para;<br>Hunter, 393 U. S., at 395) (Harlan, J. concurring)).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court next concluded that “the practical effect of&para;<br>[the initiative was] to work a reallocation of power of the&para;<br>kind condemned in Hunter.” Seattle, 458 U. S., at 474. It&para;<br>explained: “Those favoring the elimination of de facto&para;<br>school segregation now must seek relief from the state&para;<br>legislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority&para;<br>over all other student assignment decisions, as well as&para;<br>over most other areas of educational policy, remains vested&para;<br>in the local school board.” Ibid. Thus, the initiative required those in favor of racial integration in public schools&para;<br>to “surmount a considerably higher hurdle than persons&para;<br>seeking comparable legislative action” in different contexts. Ibid.&para;<br>The Court reaffirmed that the “ ‘simple repeal or modification of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without&para;<br>more, never has been viewed as embodying a presumptively invalid racial classification.’ ” Id., at 483 (quoting&para;<br>Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U. S. 527,&para;<br>539 (1982)). But because the initiative burdened future&para;<br>attempts to integrate by lodging the decisionmaking authority at a “new and remote level of government,” it was&para;<br>more than a “mere repeal”; it was an unconstitutionally&para;<br>discriminatory change to the political process.3 Seattle,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 In Crawford, the Court confronted an amendment to the California&para;<br>Constitution prohibiting state courts from mandating pupil assignments unless a federal court would be required to do so under the&para;<br>Equal Protection Clause. We upheld the amendment as nothing more&para;<br>than a repeal of existing legislation: The standard previously required&para;<br>by California went beyond what was federally required; the amendment&para;<br>merely moved the standard back to the federal baseline. The Court&para;<br>distinguished the amendment from the one in Seattle because it left the&para;<br>rules of the political game unchanged. Racial minorities in Crawford,&para;<br>unlike racial minorities in Seattle, could still appeal to their local school&para;<br>districts for relief.&para;<br>The Crawford Court distinguished Hunter v.

S., at 472; and&para;<br>(2) alters the political process in a manner that uniquely&para;<br>burdens racial minorities’ ability to achieve their goals&para;<br>through that process. A faithful application of the doctrine resoundingly resolves this case in respondents’ favor.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Section 26 has a “racial focus.” Seattle, 458 U. S., at&para;<br>474. That is clear from its text, which prohibits Michigan’s public colleges and universities from “grant[ing]&para;<br>preferential treatment to any individual or group on the&para;<br>basis of race.” Mich. Const., Art. I, §26. Like desegregation of public schools, race-sensitive admissions policies&para;<br>“inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority,” 458&para;<br>U. S., at 472, as they are designed to increase minorities’&para;<br>access to institutions of higher education.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>political process. 458 U. S., at 540. And the Seattle Court drew the&para;<br>same distinction when it held that the initiative “work[ed] something&para;<br>more than the ‘mere repeal’ of a desegregation law by the political&para;<br>entity that created it.” 458 U. S., at 483.&para;<br>4 JUSTICE SCALIA accuses me of crafting my own version (or versions)&para;<br>of the racial-focus prong. See ante, at 8–9, n. 4 (opinion concurring in&para;<br>judgment). I do not. I simply apply the test announced in Seattle:&para;<br>whether the policy in question “inures primarily to the benefit of the&para;<br>minority.” 458 U. S., at 472. JUSTICE SCALIA ignores this analysis, see&para;<br>Part II–B–1, supra, and instead purports to identify three versions of&para;<br>the test that he thinks my opinion advances. The first—whether “ ‘the&para;<br>policy in question benefits only a racial minority, ’ ” ante, at 8, n. 4&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner argues that race-sensitive admissions policies&para;<br>cannot “inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority,”&para;<br>ibid., as the Court has upheld such policies only insofar as&para;<br>they further “the educational benefits that flow from a&para;<br>diverse student body,” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 343. But&para;<br>there is no conflict between this Court’s pronouncement in&para;<br>Grutter and the common-sense reality that race-sensitive&para;<br>admissions policies benefit minorities.&para;<br>Rather, racesensitive admissions policies further a compelling state&para;<br>interest in achieving a diverse student body precisely&para;<br>because they increase minority enrollment, which necessarily benefits minority groups. In other words, constitutionally permissible race-sensitive admissions policies can&para;<br>both serve the compelling interest of obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body, and&para;<br>inure to the benefit of racial minorities. There is nothing&para;<br>mutually exclusive about the two. Cf. Seattle, 458 U. S., at&para;<br>472 (concluding that the desegregation plan had a racial&para;<br>focus even though “white as well as Negro children benefit from exposure to ‘ethnic and racial diversity in the&para;<br>classroom’ ”).&para;<br>It is worth emphasizing, moreover, that §26 is relevant&para;<br>——————&para;<br>(quoting supra, at 5)—misunderstands the doctrine and misquotes my&para;<br>opinion. The racial-focus prong has never required a policy to benefit&para;<br>only a minority group. The sentence from which JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>appears to quote makes the altogether different point that the politicalprocess doctrine is obviously not implicated in the first place by a&para;<br>restructuring that burdens members of society equally. This is the&para;<br>second prong of the political-process doctrine. See supra, at 5 (explaining that the political-process doctrine is implicated “[w]hen the majority&para;<br>reconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a&para;<br>racial minority”). The second version—which asks whether a policy&para;<br>“benefits primarily a racial minority,” ante, at 8, n. 4—is the one&para;<br>articulated by the Seattle Court and, as I have explained, see supra, at&para;<br>15 and this page, it is easily met in this case. And the third—whether&para;<br>the policy has “the incidental effect” of benefitting racial minorities,”&para;<br>ante, at 8–9, n. 4—is not a test I advance at all.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

A Gruttercompliant admissions policy must use race flexibly, not&para;<br>maintain a quota; must be limited in time; and must be&para;<br>employed only after “serious, good faith consideration of&para;<br>workable race-neutral alternatives,” 539 U. S., at 339.&para;<br>The policies banned by §26 meet all these requirements&para;<br>and thus already constitute the least restrictive ways to&para;<br>advance Michigan’s compelling interest in diversity in&para;<br>higher education.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Section 26 restructures the political process in Michigan&para;<br>in a manner that places unique burdens on racial minorities.

S., at 391 (striking down the Akron charter amendment&para;<br>because it “places a special burden on racial minorities&para;<br>within the governmental process”).&para;<br>Similarly, the plurality disregards what Seattle actually&para;<br>says and instead opines that “the political restriction in&para;<br>question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,&para;<br>to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.” Ante,&para;<br>at 17. Here, the plurality derives its conclusion not from&para;<br>Seattle itself, but from evidence unearthed more than a&para;<br>quarter-century later in Parents Involved in Community&para;<br>Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701 (2007):&para;<br>“Although there had been no judicial finding of de jure&para;<br>segregation with respect to Seattle’s school district, it&para;<br>appears as though school desegregation in the district in&para;<br>the 1940’s and 1950’s may have been the partial result of&para;<br>school board policies that ‘permitted white students to&para;<br>transfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer&para;<br>of black students into white schools.’ ”9 Ante, at 9 (quoting&para;<br>Parents Involved, 551 U. S., at 807–808 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). It follows, according to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>the political-process doctrine; it operates irrespective of discriminatory&para;<br>intent, for it protects a process-based right.&para;<br>9 The plurality relies on JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent in Parents Involved&para;<br>to conclude that “one permissible reading of the record was that the&para;<br>school board had maintained policies to perpetuate racial segregation&para;<br>in the schools.” Ante, at 9–10. Remarkably, some Members of today’s&para;<br>plurality criticized JUSTICE BREYER’s reading of the record in Parents&para;<br>Involved itself. See 551 U. S., at 736.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>plurality, that Seattle’s desegregation plan was constitutionally required, so that the initiative halting the plan&para;<br>was an instance of invidious discrimination aimed at&para;<br>inflicting a racial injury.&para;<br>Again, the plurality might prefer that the Seattle Court&para;<br>had said that, but it plainly did not. Not once did the&para;<br>Court suggest the presence of de jure segregation in Seattle. Quite the opposite: The opinion explicitly suggested&para;<br>the desegregation plan was adopted to remedy de facto&para;<br>rather than de jure segregation. See 458 U. S., at 472,&para;<br>n. 15 (referring to the “absen[ce]” of “a finding of prior de&para;<br>jure segregation”). The Court, moreover, assumed that no&para;<br>“constitutional violation” through de jure segregation had&para;<br>occurred. Id., at 474. And it unmistakably rested its&para;<br>decision on Hunter, holding Seattle’s initiative invalid&para;<br>because it “use[d] the racial nature of an issue to define&para;<br>the governmental decisionmaking structure, and thus&para;<br>impose[d] substantial and unique burdens on racial minorities.” 458 U. S., at 470.&para;<br>It is nothing short of baffling, then, for the plurality to&para;<br>insist—in the face of clear language in Hunter and Seattle&para;<br>saying otherwise—that those cases were about nothing&para;<br>more than the intentional and invidious infliction of a&para;<br>racial injury. Ante, at 8 (describing the injury in Hunter&para;<br>as “a demonstrated injury on the basis of race”); ante, at&para;<br>8–9 (describing the injury in Seattle as an “injur[y] on&para;<br>account of race”). The plurality’s attempt to rewrite&para;<br>Hunter and Seattle so as to cast aside the political-process&para;<br>doctrine sub silentio is impermissible as a matter of stare&para;<br>decisis. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, we usually&para;<br>stand by our decisions, even if we disagree with them,&para;<br>because people rely on what we say, and they believe they&para;<br>can take us at our word.&para;<br>And what now of the political-process doctrine? After&para;<br>the plurality’s revision of Hunter and Seattle, it is unclear&para;<br>what is left. The plurality certainly does not tell us. On&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>this point, and this point only, I agree with JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA that the plurality has rewritten those precedents&para;<br>beyond recognition. See ante, at 5–7 (opinion concurring&para;<br>in judgment).&para;<br>2&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER concludes that Hunter and Seattle do&para;<br>not apply. Section 26, he reasons, did not move the relevant decisionmaking authority from one political level to&para;<br>another; rather, it removed that authority from “unelected&para;<br>actors and placed it in the hands of the voters.” Ante, at 5&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment). He bases this conclusion on the premise that Michigan’s elected boards “delegated admissions-related decisionmaking authority to&para;<br>unelected university faculty members and administrators.” Ibid. But this premise is simply incorrect.&para;<br>For one thing, it is undeniable that prior to §26, board&para;<br>candidates often pledged to end or carry on the use of racesensitive admissions policies at Michigan’s public universities. See supra, at 18. Surely those were not empty&para;<br>promises. Indeed, the issue of race-sensitive admissions&para;<br>policies often dominated board elections. See, e.g., George,&para;<br>Detroit Free Press, at 2B (observing that “[t]he race for&para;<br>the University of Michigan Board of Regents could determine . . . the future of [the University’s] affirmative action&para;<br>policies”); Kosseff, UM Policy May Hang On Election,&para;<br>Crain’s Detroit Business, Sept. 18, 2000, p. 1 (noting that&para;<br>an upcoming election could determine whether the University would continue to defend its affirmative action&para;<br>policies); University of Michigan’s Admissions Policy Still&para;<br>an Issue for Regents’ Election, Black Issues in Higher&para;<br>Education, Oct. 21, 2004, p. 17 (commenting that although&para;<br>“the Supreme Court struck down the University of Michigan’s undergraduate admissions policy as too formulaic,”&para;<br>the issue “remains an important [one] to several people running” in an upcoming election for the Board of&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Regents).&para;<br>Moreover, a careful examination of the boards and their&para;<br>governing structure reveals that they remain actively&para;<br>involved in setting admissions policies and procedures.&para;<br>Take Wayne State University, for example. Its Board of&para;<br>Governors has enacted university statutes that govern the&para;<br>day-to-day running of the institution. See Wayne State&para;<br>Univ. Stat., online at http://bog.wayne.edu/code. A number of those statutes establish general admissions procedures, see §2.34.09 (establishing undergraduate admissions procedures); §2.34.12 (establishing graduate&para;<br>admissions procedures), and some set out more specific&para;<br>instructions for university officials, see, e.g., §2.34.09.030&para;<br>(“Admissions decisions will be based on a full evaluation of&para;<br>each student’s academic record, and on empirical data&para;<br>reflecting the characteristics of students who have successfully graduated from [the university] within the four&para;<br>years prior to the year in which the student applies”);&para;<br>§§2.34.12.080, 2.34.12.090 (setting the requisite grade&para;<br>point average for graduate applicants).&para;<br>The Board of Governors does give primary responsibility&para;<br>over day-to-day admissions matters to the university’s&para;<br>President. §2.34.09.080. But the President is “elected by&para;<br>and answerable to the Board.” Brief for Respondent Board&para;<br>of Governors of Wayne State University et al. 15. And&para;<br>while university officials and faculty members “serv[e] an&para;<br>important advisory role in recommending educational&para;<br>policy,” id., at 14, the Board alone ultimately controls&para;<br>educational policy and decides whether to adopt (or reject)&para;<br>program-specific admissions recommendations. For example, the Board has voted on recommendations “to revise&para;<br>guidelines for establishment of honors curricula, including&para;<br>admissions criteria”; “to modify the honor point criteria for&para;<br>graduate admission”; and “to modify the maximum number of transfer credits that the university would allow in&para;<br>certain cases where articulation agreements rendered&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The Board also “engages in&para;<br>robust and regular review of administrative actions involving admissions policy and related matters.” Id., at 16.&para;<br>Other public universities more clearly entrust admissions policy to university officials. The Board of Regents&para;<br>of the University of Michigan, for example, gives primary&para;<br>responsibility for admissions to the Associate Vice Provost,&para;<br>Executive Director of Undergraduate Admissions, and&para;<br>Directors of Admissions. Bylaws §8.01, online at http://&para;<br>www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws. And the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University relies on the President&para;<br>to make recommendations regarding admissions policies.&para;<br>Bylaws, Art. 8, online at http://www.trustees.msu.edu/&para;<br>bylaws. But the bylaws of the Board of Regents and the&para;<br>Board of Trustees “make clear that all university operations remain subject to their control.” Brief for Respondents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of&para;<br>Trustees of Michigan State University et al. 13–14.&para;<br>The boards retain ultimate authority to adopt or reject&para;<br>admissions policies in at least three ways. First, they&para;<br>routinely meet with university officials to review admissions policies, including race-sensitive admissions policies.&para;<br>For example, shortly after this Court’s decisions in Gratz&para;<br>v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), and Grutter, 539 U. S.,&para;<br>at 306, the President of the University of Michigan appeared before the University’s Board of Regents to discuss&para;<br>the impact of those decisions on the University. See&para;<br>Proceedings 2003–2004, pp. 10–12 (July 2003), online&para;<br>at http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ACW7513.2003.001. Six&para;<br>members of the Board voiced strong support for the University’s use of race as a factor in admissions. Id., at 11–&para;<br>12. In June 2004, the President again appeared before the&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Board to discuss changes to undergraduate admissions&para;<br>policies. Id., at 301 (June 2004). And in March 2007, the&para;<br>University’s Provost appeared before the Board of Regents&para;<br>to present strategies to increase diversity in light of the&para;<br>passage of Proposal 2. Proceedings 2006–2007, pp. 264–&para;<br>265 (Mar. 2007), online at http://name.umdl.umich.edu/&para;<br>ACW7513.2006.001.&para;<br>Second, the boards may enact bylaws with respect to&para;<br>specific admissions policies and may alter any admissions&para;<br>policies set by university officials. The Board of Regents&para;<br>may amend any bylaw “at any regular meeting of the&para;<br>board, or at any special meeting, provided notice is given&para;<br>to each regent one week in advance.” Bylaws §14.03. And&para;<br>Michigan State University’s Board of Trustees may,&para;<br>“[u]pon the recommendation of the President[,] . . . determine and establish the qualifications of students for admissions at any level.” Bylaws, Art. 8. The boards may&para;<br>also permanently remove certain admissions decisions&para;<br>from university officials.10 This authority is not merely&para;<br>theoretical. Between 2008 and 2012, the University of&para;<br>Michigan’s Board of Regents “revised more than two dozen&para;<br>of its bylaws, two of which fall within Chapter VIII, the&para;<br>section regulating admissions practices.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 30a.&para;<br>Finally, the boards may appoint university officials who&para;<br>share their admissions goals, and they may remove those&para;<br>officials if the officials’ goals diverge from those of the&para;<br>boards. The University of Michigan’s Board of Regents&para;<br>“directly appoints [the University’s] Associate Vice Provost&para;<br>and Executive Director of Undergraduate Admissions,”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Under the bylaws of the University of Michigan’s Board of Regents,&para;<br>“[a]ny and all delegations of authority made at any time and from time&para;<br>to time by the board to any member of the university staff, or to any&para;<br>unit of the university may be revoked by the board at any time, and&para;<br>notice of such revocation shall be given in writing.” Bylaws §14.04,&para;<br>online at http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and Michigan State University’s Board of Trustees elects&para;<br>that institution’s President. Brief for Respondents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees&para;<br>of Michigan State University et al. 14.&para;<br>The salient point is this: Although the elected and politically accountable boards may well entrust university&para;<br>officials with certain day-to-day admissions responsibilities, they often weigh in on admissions policies themselves&para;<br>and, at all times, they retain complete supervisory authority over university officials and over all admissions&para;<br>decisions.&para;<br>There is no question, then, that the elected boards in&para;<br>Michigan had the power to eliminate or adopt racesensitive admissions policies prior to §26. There is also no&para;<br>question that §26 worked an impermissible reordering of&para;<br>the political process; it removed that power from the elected&para;<br>boards and placed it instead at a higher level of the&para;<br>political process in Michigan. See supra, at 17–22. This&para;<br>case is no different from Hunter and Seattle in that respect. Just as in Hunter and Seattle, minorities in Michigan “participated in the political process and won.” Ante,&para;<br>at 5 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). And just as in&para;<br>Hunter and Seattle, “the majority’s subsequent reordering&para;<br>of the political process repealed the minority’s successes&para;<br>and made it more difficult for the minority to succeed in&para;<br>the future,” thereby “diminish[ing] the minority’s ability to&para;<br>participate meaningfully in the electoral process.” Ibid.&para;<br>There is therefore no need to consider “extend[ing] the&para;<br>holding of Hunter and Seattle to reach situations in which&para;<br>decisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative&para;<br>body to a political one,” ibid. Such a scenario is not before us.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The political-process doctrine not only resolves this case&para;<br>as a matter of stare decisis; it is correct as a matter of first&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>principles.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Under our Constitution, majority rule is not without&para;<br>limit. Our system of government is predicated on an&para;<br>equilibrium between the notion that a majority of citizens&para;<br>may determine governmental policy through legislation&para;<br>enacted by their elected representatives, and the overriding principle that there are nonetheless some things the&para;<br>Constitution forbids even a majority of citizens to do. The&para;<br>political-process doctrine, grounded in the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment, is a central check on majority rule.&para;<br>The Fourteenth Amendment instructs that all who act&para;<br>for the government may not “deny to any person . . . the&para;<br>equal protection of the laws.” We often think of equal&para;<br>protection as a guarantee that the government will apply&para;<br>the law in an equal fashion—that it will not intentionally&para;<br>discriminate against minority groups. But equal protection of the laws means more than that; it also secures the&para;<br>right of all citizens to participate meaningfully and equally&para;<br>in the process through which laws are created.&para;<br>Few rights are as fundamental as the right to participate meaningfully and equally in the process of government. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 370 (1886)&para;<br>(political rights are “fundamental” because they are “preservative of all rights”). That right is the bedrock of our&para;<br>democracy, recognized from its very inception. See J. Ely,&para;<br>Democracy and Distrust 87 (1980) (the Constitution “is&para;<br>overwhelmingly concerned, on the one hand, with procedural fairness in the resolution of individual disputes,”&para;<br>and on the other, “with ensuring broad participation in the&para;<br>processes and distributions of government”).&para;<br>This should come as no surprise. The political process is&para;<br>the channel of change. Id., at 103 (describing the importance of the judiciary in policing the “channels of political change”). It is the means by which citizens may both&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>obtain desirable legislation and repeal undesirable legislation. Of course, we do not expect minority members of our&para;<br>society to obtain every single result they seek through the&para;<br>political process—not, at least, when their views conflict&para;<br>with those of the majority. The minority plainly does not&para;<br>have a right to prevail over majority groups in any given&para;<br>political contest. But the minority does have a right to&para;<br>play by the same rules as the majority. It is this right&para;<br>that Hunter and Seattle so boldly vindicated.&para;<br>This right was hardly novel at the time of Hunter and&para;<br>Seattle. For example, this Court focused on the vital&para;<br>importance of safeguarding minority groups’ access to the&para;<br>political process in United States v. Carolene Products Co.,&para;<br>304 U. S. 144 (1938), a case that predated Hunter by 30&para;<br>years. In a now-famous footnote, the Court explained that&para;<br>while ordinary social and economic legislation carries a&para;<br>presumption of constitutionality, the same may not be&para;<br>true of legislation that offends fundamental rights or&para;<br>targets minority groups.&para;<br>Citing cases involving restrictions on the right to vote, restraints on the dissemination of information, interferences with political organizations, and prohibition of peaceable assembly, the Court&para;<br>recognized that “legislation which restricts those political&para;<br>processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about&para;<br>repeal of undesirable legislation” could be worthy of “more&para;<br>exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of&para;<br>legislation.” Id., at 152, n. 4; see also Ely, supra, at 76&para;<br>(explaining that “[p]aragraph two [of Carolene Products&para;<br>footnote 4] suggests that it is an appropriate function of&para;<br>the Court to keep the machinery of democratic government running as it should, to make sure the channels of&para;<br>political participation and communication are kept open”).&para;<br>The Court also noted that “prejudice against discrete and&para;<br>insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends&para;<br>seriously to curtail the operation of those political pro-&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>cesses ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities,&para;<br>and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.” Carolene Products, 304 U. S., at 153,&para;<br>n. 4, see also Ely, supra, at 76 (explaining that&para;<br>“[p]aragraph three [of Carolene Products footnote 4] suggests that the Court should also concern itself with what&para;<br>majorities do to minorities, particularly mentioning laws&para;<br>‘directed at’ religious, national and racial minorities and&para;<br>those infected by prejudice against them”).&para;<br>The values identified in Carolene Products lie at the&para;<br>heart of the political-process doctrine. Indeed, Seattle&para;<br>explicitly relied on Carolene Products. See 458 U. S., at&para;<br>486 (“[W]hen the State’s allocation of power places unusual&para;<br>burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation specifically designed to overcome the ‘special condition’ of prejudice, the governmental action seriously&para;<br>‘curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities’ ” (quoting&para;<br>Carolene Products, 304 U. S., at 153, n. 4)). These values&para;<br>are central tenets of our equal protection jurisprudence.&para;<br>Our cases recognize at least three features of the right&para;<br>to meaningful participation in the political process. Two&para;<br>of them, thankfully, are uncontroversial. First, every&para;<br>eligible citizen has a right to vote. See Shaw v. Reno, 509&para;<br>U. S. 630, 639 (1993). This, woefully, has not always been&para;<br>the case. But it is a right no one would take issue with&para;<br>today. Second, the majority may not make it more difficult for the minority to exercise the right to vote. This,&para;<br>too, is widely accepted. After all, the Court has invalidated grandfather clauses, good character requirements, poll&para;<br>taxes, and gerrymandering provisions.11 The third fea——————&para;<br>11 Attempts by the majority to make it more difficult for the minority&para;<br>to exercise its right to vote are, sadly, not a thing of the past. See&para;<br>Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 15–17)&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (describing recent examples of discriminatory&para;<br>changes to state voting laws, including a 1995 dual voter registration&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ture, the one the plurality dismantles today, is that a&para;<br>majority may not reconfigure the existing political process&para;<br>in a manner that creates a two-tiered system of political&para;<br>change, subjecting laws designed to protect or benefit&para;<br>discrete and insular minorities to a more burdensome&para;<br>political process than all other laws. This is the politicalprocess doctrine of Hunter and Seattle.&para;<br>My colleagues would stop at the second. The plurality&para;<br>embraces the freedom of “self-government” without limits.&para;<br>See ante, at 13. And JUSTICE SCALIA values a “nearlimitless” notion of state sovereignty. See ante, at 13&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment). The wrong sought to be&para;<br>corrected by the political-process doctrine, they say, is not&para;<br>one that should concern us and is in any event beyond the&para;<br>reach of the Fourteenth Amendment. As they see it, the&para;<br>Court’s role in protecting the political process ends once&para;<br>we have removed certain barriers to the minority’s participation in that process. Then, they say, we must sit back&para;<br>and let the majority rule without the key constitutional&para;<br>limit recognized in Hunter and Seattle.&para;<br>That view drains the Fourteenth Amendment of one of&para;<br>its core teachings. Contrary to today’s decision, protecting&para;<br>the right to meaningful participation in the political process must mean more than simply removing barriers to&para;<br>participation. It must mean vigilantly policing the political process to ensure that the majority does not use other&para;<br>methods to prevent minority groups from partaking in&para;<br>that process on equal footing. Why? For the same reason&para;<br>we guard the right of every citizen to vote. If “[e]fforts to&para;<br>reduce the impact of minority votes, in contrast to direct&para;<br>——————&para;<br>system in Mississippi to disfranchise black voters, a 2000 redistricting&para;<br>plan in Georgia to decrease black voting strength, and a 2003 proposal&para;<br>to change the voting mechanism for school board elections in South&para;<br>Carolina). Until this Court’s decision last Term in Shelby County, the&para;<br>preclearance requirement of §5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 blocked&para;<br>those and many other discriminatory changes to voting procedures.&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v.

For as the Court recognized in&para;<br>Seattle, “minorities are no less powerless with the vote&para;<br>than without it when a racial criterion is used to assign&para;<br>governmental power in such a way as to exclude particular&para;<br>racial groups ‘from effective participation in the political&para;<br>proces[s].’ ”12 458 U. S., at 486.&para;<br>To accept the first two features of the right to meaningful participation in the political process, while renouncing&para;<br>the third, paves the way for the majority to do what it has&para;<br>done time and again throughout our Nation’s history:&para;<br>afford the minority the opportunity to participate, yet&para;<br>manipulate the ground rules so as to ensure the minority’s&para;<br>defeat. This is entirely at odds with our idea of equality&para;<br>under the law.&para;<br>To reiterate, none of this is to say that the politicalprocess doctrine prohibits the exercise of democratic selfgovernment. Nothing prevents a majority of citizens from&para;<br>pursuing or obtaining its preferred outcome in a political&para;<br>contest. Here, for instance, I agree with the plurality that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Preserving the right to participate meaningfully and equally in the&para;<br>process of government is especially important with respect to education&para;<br>policy. I do not mean to suggest that “the constitutionality of laws&para;<br>forbidding racial preferences depends on the policy interest at stake.”&para;<br>Ante, at 14–15 (plurality opinion). I note only that we have long recognized that “ ‘education . . . is the very foundation of good citizenship.’ ”&para;<br>Grutter, 539 U. S., at 331 (quoting Brown v.

In those cases,&para;<br>the Court described the right to vote as “ ‘the essence of a&para;<br>democratic society.’ ” Shaw, 509 U. S., at 639. It rejected&para;<br>States’ use of ostensibly race-neutral measures to prevent&para;<br>minorities from exercising their political rights. See id., at&para;<br>639–640. And it invalidated practices such as at-large&para;<br>electoral systems that reduce or nullify a minority group’s&para;<br>ability to vote as a cohesive unit, when those practices&para;<br>were adopted with a discriminatory purpose.

S. 399 (2006)&para;<br>(LULAC).&para;<br>Romer involved a Colorado constitutional amendment&para;<br>that removed from the local political process an issue&para;<br>primarily affecting gay and lesbian citizens. The amendment, enacted in response to a number of local ordinances&para;<br>prohibiting discrimination against gay citizens, repealed&para;<br>these ordinances and effectively prohibited the adoption of&para;<br>similar ordinances in the future without another amendment to the State Constitution. 517 U. S., at 623–624.&para;<br>Although the Court did not apply the political-process&para;<br>doctrine in Romer,13 the case resonates with the principles&para;<br>undergirding the political-process doctrine. The Court&para;<br>rejected an attempt by the majority to transfer decisionmaking authority from localities (where the targeted&para;<br>minority group could influence the process) to state government (where it had less ability to participate effectively). See id., at 632 (describing this type of political&para;<br>restructuring as a “disability” on the minority group).&para;<br>Rather than being able to appeal to municipalities for&para;<br>policy changes, the Court commented, the minority was&para;<br>forced to “enlis[t] the citizenry of Colorado to amend the&para;<br>State Constitution,” id., at 631—just as in this case.&para;<br>LULAC, a Voting Rights Act case, involved an enactment by the Texas Legislature that redrew district lines&para;<br>for a number of Texas seats in the House of Representatives. 548 U.

It concluded that the&para;<br>amendment “impose[d] a broad and undifferentiated disability on a&para;<br>single named group,” and was “so discontinuous with the reasons&para;<br>offered for it that [it] seem[ed] inexplicable by anything but animus&para;<br>toward the class it affect[ed].” Romer, 517 U.

Against this backdrop,&para;<br>the Court found that just as “Latino voters were poised to&para;<br>elect their candidate of choice,” id., at 438, the State’s&para;<br>enactment “took away [their] opportunity because [they]&para;<br>were about to exercise it,” id., at 440. The Court refused&para;<br>to sustain “the resulting vote dilution of a group that was&para;<br>beginning to achieve [the] goal of overcoming prior electoral discrimination.” Id., at 442.&para;<br>As in Romer, the LULAC Court—while using a different&para;<br>analytic framework—applied the core teaching of Hunter&para;<br>and Seattle: The political process cannot be restructured in&para;<br>a manner that makes it more difficult for a traditionally&para;<br>excluded group to work through the existing process to&para;<br>seek beneficial policies. And the events giving rise to&para;<br>LULAC are strikingly similar to those here. Just as redistricting prevented Latinos in Texas from attaining a benefit they had fought for and were poised to enjoy, §26&para;<br>prevents racial minorities in Michigan from enjoying a&para;<br>last-resort benefit that they, too, had fought for through&para;<br>the existing political processes.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>My colleagues claim that the political-process doctrine is&para;<br>unadministrable and contrary to our more recent equal&para;<br>protection precedents. See ante, at 11–15 (plurality opinion); ante, at 7–17 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).

I note that in the view of many, it is those precedents that have departed from the mandate of the Equal&para;<br>Protection Clause in the first place, by applying strict&para;<br>scrutiny to actions designed to benefit rather than burden&para;<br>the minority. See Gratz, 539 U. S., at 301 (GINSBURG, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (“[A]s I see it, government decisionmakers may&para;<br>properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and&para;<br>inclusion.

For nothing the&para;<br>Court has said in the last 32 years undermines the principles announced in those cases.&para;<br>1&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA first argues that the political-process&para;<br>doctrine “misreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect&para;<br>‘particular group[s],’ ” running counter to a line of cases&para;<br>that treat “ ‘equal protection as a personal right.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>9 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting Adarand, 515&para;<br>U. S., at 230). Equal protection, he says, protects “ ‘per­&para;<br>sons, not groups.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting Adarand, 515&para;<br>U. S., at 227). This criticism ignores the obvious: Discrimination against an individual occurs because of that individual’s membership in a particular group. Yes, equal&para;<br>protection is a personal right, but there can be no equal&para;<br>protection violation unless the injured individual is a&para;<br>member of a protected group or a class of individuals. It is&para;<br>membership in the group—here the racial minority—that&para;<br>gives rise to an equal protection violation.&para;<br>Relatedly, JUSTICE SCALIA argues that the politicalprocess doctrine is inconsistent with our precedents because it protects only the minority from political restructurings. This aspect of the doctrine, he says, cannot be&para;<br>tolerated because our precedents have rejected “ ‘a reading&para;<br>of the guarantee of equal protection under which the level&para;<br>of scrutiny varies according to the ability of different&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>groups to defend their interests in the representative&para;<br>process.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson&para;<br>Co., 488 U. S., 469, 495 (1989) (plurality opinion)). Equal&para;<br>protection, he continues, “ ‘cannot mean one thing when&para;<br>applied to one individual and something else when applied&para;<br>to a person of another color.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting Bakke,&para;<br>438 U. S., at 289–290) (opinion of Powell, J.).&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA is troubled that the political-process&para;<br>doctrine has not been applied to trigger strict scrutiny for&para;<br>political restructurings that burden the majority. But the&para;<br>doctrine is inapplicable to the majority. The minority&para;<br>cannot achieve such restructurings against the majority,&para;<br>for the majority is, well, the majority. As the Seattle Court&para;<br>explained, “ ‘[t]he majority needs no protection against&para;<br>discriminat[ory restructurings], and if it did, a referendum, [for instance], might be bothersome but no more&para;<br>than that.’ ” 458 U. S., at 468. Stated differently, the&para;<br>doctrine protects only the minority because it implicates a&para;<br>problem that affects only the minority. Nothing in my&para;<br>opinion suggests, as JUSTICE SCALIA says, that under the&para;<br>political-process doctrine, “the Constitution prohibits&para;<br>discrimination against minority groups, but not against&para;<br>majority groups.” Ante, at 10, n. 7. If the minority somehow managed to effectuate a political restructuring that&para;<br>burdened only the majority, we could decide then whether&para;<br>to apply the political-process doctrine to safeguard the&para;<br>political right of the majority. But such a restructuring is&para;<br>not before us, and I cannot fathom how it could be&para;<br>achieved.&para;<br>2&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA next invokes state sovereignty, arguing&para;<br>that “we have emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty&para;<br>of each State to design its governing structure as it sees&para;<br>fit.” Ante, at 13 (opinion concurring in judgment). But&para;<br>state sovereignty is not absolute; it is subject to constitu-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>41&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tional limits. The Court surely did not offend state sovereignty by barring States from changing their voting procedures to exclude racial minorities. So why does the&para;<br>political-process doctrine offend state sovereignty? The&para;<br>doctrine takes nothing away from state sovereignty that&para;<br>the Equal Protection Clause does not require. All it says&para;<br>is that a State may not reconfigure its existing political&para;<br>processes in a manner that establishes a distinct and more&para;<br>burdensome process for minority members of our society&para;<br>alone to obtain legislation in their interests.&para;<br>More broadly, JUSTICE SCALIA is troubled that the&para;<br>political-process doctrine would create supposed “affirmative-action safe havens” in places where the ordinary&para;<br>political process has thus far produced race-sensitive&para;<br>admissions policies. Ante, at 13–14. It would not. As&para;<br>explained previously, the voters in Michigan who opposed&para;<br>race-sensitive admissions policies had any number of&para;<br>options available to them to challenge those policies. See&para;<br>supra, at 34–35. And in States where decisions regarding&para;<br>race-sensitive admissions policies are not subject to the&para;<br>political process in the first place, voters are entirely free&para;<br>to eliminate such policies via a constitutional amendment&para;<br>because that action would not reallocate power in the&para;<br>manner condemned in Hunter and Seattle (and, of course,&para;<br>present here). The Seattle Court recognized this careful&para;<br>balance between state sovereignty and constitutional&para;<br>protections:&para;<br>“[W]e do not undervalue the magnitude of the State’s&para;<br>interest in its system of education. Washington could&para;<br>have reserved to state officials the right to make all&para;<br>decisions in the areas of education and student assignment. It has chosen, however, to use a more elaborate system; having done so, the State is obligated to&para;<br>operate that system within the confines of the Fourteenth Amendment.” 458 U. S., at 487.&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The same is true of Michigan.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Finally, JUSTICE SCALIA disagrees with “the proposition&para;<br>that a facially neutral law may deny equal protection&para;<br>solely because it has a disparate racial impact.” Ante,&para;<br>at 15 (opinion concurring in judgment).&para;<br>He would&para;<br>acknowledge, however, that an act that draws racial distinctions or makes racial classifications triggers strict&para;<br>scrutiny regardless of whether discriminatory intent is&para;<br>shown. See Adarand, 515 U. S., at 213. That should&para;<br>settle the matter: Section 26 draws a racial distinction. As&para;<br>the Seattle Court explained, “when the political process or&para;<br>the decisionmaking mechanism used to address racially&para;<br>conscious legislation—and only such legislation—is singled out for peculiar and disadvantageous treatment, the&para;<br>governmental action plainly rests on ‘distinctions based on&para;<br>race.’ ” 458 U. S., at 485 (some internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); see also id., at 470 (noting that although a State&para;<br>may “ ‘allocate governmental power on the basis of any&para;<br>general principle,’ ” it may not use racial considerations “to&para;<br>define the governmental decisionmaking structure”).&para;<br>But in JUSTICE SCALIA’s view, cases like Washington v.&para;<br>Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), and Arlington Heights v.&para;<br>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252&para;<br>(1977), call Seattle into question. It is odd to suggest that&para;<br>prior precedents call into question a later one. Seattle&para;<br>(decided in 1982) postdated both Washington v. Davis&para;<br>(1976) and Arlington Heights (1977). JUSTICE SCALIA’s&para;<br>suggestion that Seattle runs afoul of the principles established in Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights&para;<br>would come as a surprise to Justice Blackmun, who joined&para;<br>the majority opinions in all three cases. Indeed, the Seat­&para;<br>tle Court explicitly rejected the argument that Hunter had&para;<br>been effectively overruled by Washington v. Davis and&para;<br>Arlington Heights:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>43&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“There is one immediate and crucial difference between Hunter and [those cases]. While decisions such&para;<br>as Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights considered classifications facially unrelated to race, the&para;<br>charter amendment at issue in Hunter dealt in explicitly racial terms with legislation designed to benefit&para;<br>minorities ‘as minorities,’ not legislation intended to&para;<br>benefit some larger group of underprivileged citizens&para;<br>among whom minorities were disproportionately represented.” 458 U. S., at 485.&para;<br>And it concluded that both the Hunter amendment and&para;<br>the Seattle initiative rested on distinctions based on race.&para;<br>458 U. S., at 485. So does §26.14&para;<br>B&para;<br>My colleagues also attack the first prong of the doctrine&para;<br>as “rais[ing] serious constitutional concerns,” ante, at 11&para;<br>(plurality opinion), and being “unadministrable,” ante, at 7&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>wonders whether judges are equipped to weigh in on what&para;<br>constitutes a “racial issue.” See ante, at 8. The plurality,&para;<br>too, thinks courts would be “with no clear legal standards&para;<br>or accepted sources to guide judicial decision.” Ante, at 12.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 The plurality raises another concern with respect to precedent. It&para;<br>points to decisions by the California Supreme Court and the United&para;<br>States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upholding as constitutional Proposition 209, a California constitutional amendment identical&para;<br>in substance to §26. Ante, at 14. The plurality notes that if we were to&para;<br>affirm the lower court’s decision in this case, “those holdings would be&para;<br>invalidated . . . .” Ibid. I fail to see the significance. We routinely&para;<br>resolve conflicts between lower courts; the necessary result, of course, is&para;<br>that decisions of courts on one side of the debate are invalidated or&para;<br>called into question. I am unaware of a single instance where that&para;<br>(inevitable) fact influenced the Court’s decision one way or the other.&para;<br>Had the lower courts proceeded in opposite fashion—had the California&para;<br>Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit invalidated Proposition 209 and the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit upheld §26—would the plurality come out the other way?&para;<br>&para;<br>44&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHUETTE v. BAMN&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Yet as JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, Hunter and Seattle&para;<br>provide a standard: Does the public policy at issue “inur[e]&para;<br>primarily to the benefit of the minority, and [was it] designed for that purpose”? Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472; see&para;<br>ante, at 8. Surely this is the kind of factual inquiry that&para;<br>judges are capable of making. JUSTICE SCALIA, for instance, accepts the standard announced in Washington v.&para;<br>Davis, which requires judges to determine whether discrimination is intentional or whether it merely has a&para;<br>discriminatory effect. Such an inquiry is at least as difficult for judges as the one called for by Hunter and Seattle.&para;<br>In any event, it is clear that the constitutional amendment&para;<br>in this case has a racial focus; it is facially race-based and,&para;<br>by operation of law, disadvantages only minorities. See&para;<br>supra, at 15–16.&para;<br>“No good can come” from these inquiries, JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA responds, because they divide the Nation along&para;<br>racial lines and perpetuate racial stereotypes. Ante, at 9.&para;<br>The plurality shares that view; it tells us that we must not&para;<br>assume all individuals of the same race think alike. See&para;<br>ante, at 11–12. The same could have been said about&para;<br>desegregation: Not all members of a racial minority in&para;<br>Seattle necessarily regarded the integration of public&para;<br>schools as good policy. Yet the Seattle Court had little&para;<br>difficulty saying that school integration as a general matter “inure[d] . . . to the benefit of ” the minority. 458 U. S.,&para;<br>at 472.&para;<br>My colleagues are of the view that we should leave race&para;<br>out of the picture entirely and let the voters sort it out.&para;<br>See ante, at 13 (plurality opinion) (“Racial division would&para;<br>be validated, not discouraged, were the Seattle formulation . . . to remain in force”); ante, at 9 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“ ‘[R]acial stereotyping [is] at odds with&para;<br>equal protection mandates’ ”).

It is a sentiment out&para;<br>of touch with reality, one not required by our Constitution,&para;<br>and one that has properly been rejected as “not sufficient”&para;<br>to resolve cases of this nature. Id., at 788 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

And although we have made great&para;<br>strides, “voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts&para;<br>that.” Shelby County, 570 U.

See Gratz, 539&para;<br>U.

Before the advent of race-sensitive admissions&para;<br>policies, those institutions, like others around the country,&para;<br>were essentially segregated. In 1868, two black students&para;<br>were admitted to the University of Michigan, the first of&para;<br>their race. See Expert Report of James D. Anderson 4, in&para;<br>Gratz v.

A little more than a decade ago, in Grutter, the&para;<br>Court reaffirmed this understanding.

Similarly, the Law School’s Dean&para;<br>of Admissions testified that she expected “a decline in&para;<br>minority admissions because, in her view, it is impossible&para;<br>‘to get a critical mass of underrepresented minorities . . . without considering race.’ ” Ibid. And the Dean of&para;<br>Wayne State University Law School stated that “although&para;<br>some creative approaches might mitigate the effects of&para;<br>[§26], he ‘did not think that any one of these proposals or&para;<br>any combination of these proposals was reasonably likely&para;<br>to result in the admission of a class that had the same or&para;<br>similar or higher numbers of African Americans, Latinos&para;<br>and Native Americans as the prior policy.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>Michigan tells a different story.

See ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C.

That view is at odds with our recognition in&para;<br>Grutter, and more recently in Fisher v. University of Texas&para;<br>at Austin, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), that race-sensitive admissions policies are necessary to achieve a diverse student&para;<br>body when race-neutral alternatives have failed. More&para;<br>fundamentally, it ignores the importance of diversity in&para;<br>institutions of higher education and reveals how little my&para;<br>colleagues understand about the reality of race in America.&para;<br>This Court has recognized that diversity in education is&para;<br>paramount. With good reason. Diversity ensures that the&para;<br>next generation moves beyond the stereotypes, the assumptions, and the superficial perceptions that students&para;<br>coming from less-heterogeneous communities may harbor,&para;<br>consciously or not, about people who do not look like them.&para;<br>Recognizing the need for diversity acknowledges that,&para;<br>“[j]ust as growing up in a particular region or having&para;<br>particular professional experiences is likely to affect an&para;<br>individual’s views, so too is one’s own, unique experience&para;<br>of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in&para;<br>which race unfortunately still matters.” Grutter, 539&para;<br>U.

The statistics I have described make that&para;<br>fact glaringly obvious. We should not turn a blind eye to&para;<br>something we cannot help but see.&para;<br>To be clear, I do not mean to suggest that the virtues of&para;<br>adopting race-sensitive admissions policies should inform&para;<br>the legal question before the Court today regarding the&para;<br>constitutionality of §26. But I cannot ignore the unfortunate outcome of today’s decision: Short of amending the&para;<br>State Constitution, a Herculean task, racial minorities in&para;<br>Michigan are deprived of even an opportunity to convince&para;<br>Michigan’s public colleges and universities to consider race&para;<br>in their admissions plans when other attempts to achieve&para;<br>racial diversity have proved unworkable, and those institutions are unnecessarily hobbled in their pursuit of a&para;<br>diverse student body.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from&para;<br>political defeat.
