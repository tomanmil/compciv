ANIMALFEEDS IN-&para;<br>&para;<br>TERNATIONAL CORP. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1198. Argued December 9, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010&para;<br>Petitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for par&para;<br>cel tankers—seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately&para;<br>chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish&para;<br>to ship liquids in small quantities. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pur&para;<br>suant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a char&para;<br>ter party. The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbi&para;<br>tration clause. AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit&para;<br>against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated&para;<br>with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in&para;<br>which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling&para;<br>that the charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration. As a con&para;<br>sequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their&para;<br>antitrust dispute. AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a&para;<br>class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services. The par&para;<br>ties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agree&para;<br>ment allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who&para;<br>would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American&para;<br>Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Baz&para;<br>zle, 539 U. S. 444. One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to deter&para;<br>mine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration. The&para;<br>parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as&para;<br>the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was&para;<br>“silent” on the class arbitration issue. The panel determined that the&para;<br>arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court&para;<br>vacated the award. It concluded that the arbitrators’ award was&para;<br>made in “manifest disregard” of the law, for had the arbitrators con&para;<br>ducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of&para;<br>custom and usage. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that be&para;<br>cause petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of&para;<br>custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators’ decision&para;<br>was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitra&para;<br>tors had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not es&para;<br>tablished a rule against class arbitration.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to au&para;<br>thorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration&para;<br>Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq. Pp. 7–23.&para;<br>(a) The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own&para;<br>policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision de&para;<br>rived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(1) An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA §10(a)(4)&para;<br>on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, “only when&para;<br>[an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the&para;<br>agreement and effectively ‘dispense[s] his own brand of industrial&para;<br>justice,’ ” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S.&para;<br>504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrator’s task is to interpret and en&para;<br>force a contract, not to make public policy. P. 7.&para;<br>(2) The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on&para;<br>AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument for permitting class arbitration&para;<br>under the charter party’s arbitration clause. However, because the&para;<br>parties agreed that their agreement was “silent” on the class arbitra&para;<br>tion issue, the arbitrators’ proper task was to identify the rule of law&para;<br>governing in that situation. Instead, the panel based its decision on&para;<br>post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were&para;<br>based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York&para;<br>law. Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a&para;<br>“default rule” permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitra&para;<br>tion absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a com&para;<br>mon-law court’s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule&para;<br>for such a situation. Finding no reason to depart from its perception&para;<br>of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration&para;<br>was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its&para;<br>own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration. The&para;<br>panel’s few references to intent do not show that the panel did any&para;<br>thing other than impose its own policy preference. Thus, under FAA&para;<br>§10(b), this Court must either “direct a rehearing by the arbitrators”&para;<br>or decide the question originally referred to the panel. Because there&para;<br>can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to&para;<br>direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(b) Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the in&para;<br>stant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>class. Pp. 12–17.&para;<br>(1) No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which&para;<br>concerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers&para;<br>that had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class&para;<br>arbitration. The plurality decided only the question whether the&para;<br>court or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were “silent”&para;<br>on the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on&para;<br>his resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate deci&para;<br>sionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows&para;<br>class arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropri&para;<br>ate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.&para;<br>Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(2) The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at&para;<br>their arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to&para;<br>have believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to de&para;<br>cide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question ad&para;<br>dressed only by the plurality. That question need not be revisited&para;<br>here because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitra&para;<br>tion panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermis&para;<br>sible. Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have&para;<br>misunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in&para;<br>deciding whether class arbitration is permitted. However, Bazzle left&para;<br>that question open. Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>(c) Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.&para;<br>Pp. 17–23.&para;<br>(1) The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including&para;<br>the basic precept that arbitration “is a matter of consent, not coer&para;<br>cion.” Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489&para;<br>U. S. 468, 479. The FAA requires that a “written provision in any&para;<br>maritime transaction” calling for the arbitration of a controversy&para;<br>arising out of such transaction “shall be valid, irrevocable, and en&para;<br>forceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the&para;<br>revocation of any contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, and permits a party to an&para;<br>arbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order&para;<br>directing that arbitration proceed “in the manner provided for in such&para;<br>agreement,” §4. Thus, this Court has said that the FAA’s central&para;<br>purpose is to ensure that “private agreements to arbitrate are en&para;<br>forced according to their terms.” Volt, 489 U. S., at 479. Whether en&para;<br>forcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,&para;<br>courts and arbitrators must “give effect to the [parties’] contractual&para;<br>rights and expectations.” Ibid. The parties’ “intentions control,”&para;<br>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.&para;<br>614, 626, and the parties are “generally free to structure their arbi&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tration agreements as they see fit,” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman&para;<br>Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 57. They may agree to limit the issues ar&para;<br>bitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will pro&para;<br>ceed. They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their&para;<br>disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.&para;<br>Pp. 17–20.&para;<br>(2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to&para;<br>submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con&para;<br>cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel&para;<br>imposed class arbitration despite the parties’ stipulation that they&para;<br>had reached “no agreement” on that issue. The panel’s conclusion is&para;<br>fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi&para;<br>tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that&para;<br>parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra&para;<br>tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties’&para;<br>agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,&para;<br>84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is&para;<br>not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an&para;<br>agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and&para;<br>complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.&para;<br>Pp. 20–23.&para;<br>&para;<br>548 F. 3d 85, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

In one of these,&para;<br>the District Court for the District of Connecticut held that&para;<br>the charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration&para;<br>under the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second&para;<br>Circuit reversed. See JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen&para;<br>S. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was&para;<br>pending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation&para;<br>ordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against&para;<br>petitioners, including AnimalFeeds’ action, in the District&para;<br>of Connecticut. See In re Parcel Tanker Shipping Services&para;<br>Antitrust Litigation, 296 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1371, and n. 1&para;<br>(JPML 2003). The parties agree that as a consequence of&para;<br>these judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners&para;<br>must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand&para;<br>for class arbitration, designating New York City as the&para;<br>place of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of&para;<br>“[a]ll direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation&para;<br>services globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils,&para;<br>acids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any&para;<br>time during the period from August 1, 1998, to November&para;<br>30, 2002.” 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental&para;<br>agreement providing for the question of class arbitration&para;<br>to be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to&para;<br>“follow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American&para;<br>Arbitration Association’s Supplementary Rules for Class&para;<br>Arbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 59a. These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were&para;<br>developed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA)&para;<br>after our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v.

Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to&para;<br>the arbitration panel that the term “silent” did not simply&para;<br>mean that the clause made no express reference to class&para;<br>arbitration. Rather, he said, “[a]ll the parties agree that&para;<br>when a contract is silent on an issue there’s been no&para;<br>agreement that has been reached on that issue.” Id.,&para;<br>at 77a.&para;<br>After hearing argument and evidence, including testi­&para;<br>mony from petitioners’ experts regarding arbitration&para;<br>customs and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators&para;<br>concluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class&para;<br>arbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other&para;<br>arbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed “a wide&para;<br>variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing&para;<br>for class arbitration,” but the panel acknowledged that&para;<br>none of these decisions was “exactly comparable” to the&para;<br>present dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a.&para;<br>Petitioners’ expert evidence did not show an “inten[t] to&para;<br>preclude class arbitration,” the arbitrators reasoned, and&para;<br>petitioners’ argument would leave “no basis for a class&para;<br>action absent express agreement among all parties and&para;<br>the putative class members.” Id., at 51a.&para;<br>The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the par­&para;<br>ties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an appli­&para;<br>cation to vacate the arbitrators’ award in the District&para;<br>Court for the Southern District of New York.

The District Court&para;<br>vacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators’ deci­&para;<br>sion was made in “manifest disregard” of the law insofar&para;<br>as the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analy­&para;<br>sis. 435 F. Supp. 2d 382, 384–385 (SDNY 2006). See&para;<br>Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.

Had such an analysis been conducted,&para;<br>the District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied&para;<br>the rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts&para;<br>be interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d, at 385–386.&para;<br>AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which&para;<br>reversed. See 9 U. S. C. §16(a)(1)(E) (“An appeal may be&para;<br>taken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award”). As an&para;<br>initial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the “mani­&para;<br>fest disregard” standard survived our decision in Hall&para;<br>Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576&para;<br>(2008), as a “judicial gloss” on the enumerated grounds for&para;<br>vacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U. S. C. §10. 548&para;<br>F. 3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded&para;<br>that, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a&para;<br>federal maritime rule of custom and usage against class&para;<br>arbitration, the arbitrators’ decision was not in manifest&para;<br>disregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97–98. Nor had&para;<br>the arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>case law established a rule against class arbitration. Id.,&para;<br>at 98–99.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Invoking&para;<br>&para;<br>an argument not pressed in or considered by the courts&para;<br>below, the dissent concludes that the question presented is not ripe for&para;<br>our review. See post, at 1, 3–6 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In so doing,&para;<br>the dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument&para;<br>“we necessarily considered and rejected” in granting certiorari. United&para;<br>States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992). Ripeness reflects constitu­&para;<br>tional considerations that implicate “Article III limitations on judicial&para;<br>power,” as well as “prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdic­&para;<br>tion.” Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 57, n. 18&para;<br>(1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial&para;<br>review, we consider both “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision”&para;<br>and “the hardship of withholding court consideration.” National Park&para;<br>Hospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003).&para;<br>To the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we&para;<br>granted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.&para;<br>The arbitration panel’s award means that petitioners must now submit&para;<br>to class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners&para;<br>are correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the&para;<br>parties’ agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class&para;<br>Rule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what&para;<br>they maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would&para;<br>almost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9&para;<br>U. S. C. §4. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,&para;<br>143 (1974) (“Where the inevitability of the operation of a statute&para;<br>against certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of&para;<br>a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the&para;<br>disputed provisions will come into effect”). We think it is clear on these&para;<br>facts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that&para;<br>their question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the&para;<br>dissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that&para;<br>argument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56,&para;<br>n. 4 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver. We express&para;<br>no view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a&para;<br>question of prudential ripeness on its own motion. See National Park&para;<br>Hospitality Assn., supra, at 808 (“[E]ven in a case raising only pruden­&para;<br>tial concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court’s&para;<br>own motion”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

It is not enough for peti­&para;<br>tioners to show that the panel committed an error—or&para;<br>even a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.&para;<br>Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000); Paperworkers v.&para;<br>Misco, Inc., 484 U.

ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in support of construing the arbitration clause to permit class&para;<br>arbitration:&para;<br>“The parties’ arbitration clause should be construed&para;<br>to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the issue of class treatment and, without express prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under&para;<br>Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit&para;<br>class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)&para;<br>the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable&para;<br>if it forbade class arbitration.” App. in No. 06–3474–&para;<br>cv (CA2), at A–308 to A–309 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds’ first&para;<br>argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing&para;<br>about the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested&para;<br>its decision on AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument.&para;<br>Because the parties agreed their agreement was “silent” in&para;<br>the sense that they had not reached any agreement on the&para;<br>issue of class arbitration, the arbitrators’ proper task was&para;<br>to identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.&para;<br>Had they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably&para;<br>would have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the&para;<br>two bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,&para;<br>i.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the&para;<br>panel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule&para;<br>of decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt&para;<br>to determine what rule would govern under either maritime or New York law in the case of a “silent” contract.&para;<br>Instead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbitral decisions that “construed a wide variety of clauses in a&para;<br>wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel did not mention&para;<br>whether any of these decisions were based on a rule de-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among&para;<br>arbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in “a wide&para;<br>variety of settings,” the panel considered only whether&para;<br>there was any good reason not to follow that consensus in&para;<br>this case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel was&para;<br>not persuaded by “court cases denying consolidation of&para;<br>arbitrations,”5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy&para;<br>charter party had “never been the basis of a class action,”&para;<br>or by expert opinion that “sophisticated, multinational&para;<br>commercial parties of the type that are sought to be in­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The panel’s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the&para;<br>panel’s decision was not based on a determination regarding the&para;<br>parties’ intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA’s&para;<br>Class Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available&para;<br>when the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during&para;<br>the class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2&para;<br>2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the&para;<br>panel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that “[w]hen you talk about&para;<br>expectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were&para;<br>the subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So&para;<br>therefore, if you are going to talk about the parties’ intentions, pre&para;<br>[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are&para;<br>common.” App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to&para;<br>acknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a&para;<br>contract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 50a.&para;<br>5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,&para;<br>74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods.

See,&para;<br>e.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (“In the 30 years I&para;<br>have been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered&para;<br>an arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as&para;<br>allowing class action arbitration”); id., at 139a (expert declaration of&para;<br>Bruce Harris) (“I have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty&para;<br>years and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the&para;<br>issue of a class action arbitration has even been raised”). These experts&para;<br>amplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See,&para;<br>e.g., App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class&para;<br>action in a maritime arbitration would be “quite foreign” to overseas&para;<br>shipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a–112a (Mr. Harris)&para;<br>(opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitra­&para;<br>tion, class arbitration is “inconceivable”).&para;<br>Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of&para;<br>“custom and usage” is relevant to determining the parties’ intent when&para;<br>an express agreement is ambiguous.

The&para;<br>opinion states that, under Bazzle, “arbitrators must look&para;<br>to the language of the parties’ agreement to ascertain the&para;<br>parties’ intention whether they intended to permit or to&para;<br>preclude class action,” and the panel added that “[t]his is&para;<br>also consistent with New York law.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>49a. But the panel had no occasion to “ascertain the&para;<br>parties’ intention” in the present case because the parties&para;<br>were in complete agreement regarding their intent.

But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf.&para;<br>United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 614 (2000), the arbitrators&para;<br>need not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the&para;<br>hearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized&para;<br>that the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds&para;<br>relied involved “essentially consumer non-value cases.” App. 82a. In&para;<br>response, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those&para;<br>awards by asserting that the “vast majority” of the claimants against&para;<br>petitioners “have negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to&para;<br>litigate than you would get if you won.” Id., at 82a–83a. The panel&para;<br>credited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not&para;<br>demonstrated the parties’ intent to preclude class arbitration, and&para;<br>further observed that if petitioners’ anticonsolidation precedents&para;<br>controlled, then “there would appear to be no basis for a class action&para;<br>absent express agreement among all parties and the putative class&para;<br>members.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>acknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the&para;<br>Vegoilvoy charter party was “silent on whether [it] per­&para;<br>mit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,” but that the&para;<br>charter party was “not ambiguous so as to call for parol&para;<br>evidence.” Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in­&para;<br>quiry regarding the parties’ intent, and any inquiry into&para;<br>that settled question would have been outside the panel’s&para;<br>assigned task.&para;<br>The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan­&para;<br>guage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but&para;<br>since the only task that was left for the panel, in light of&para;<br>the parties’ stipulation, was to identify the governing rule&para;<br>applicable in a case in which neither the language of the&para;<br>contract nor any other evidence established that the par­&para;<br>ties had reached any agreement on the question of class&para;<br>arbitration, the particular wording of the charter party&para;<br>was quite beside the point.&para;<br>In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of&para;<br>decision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New&para;<br>York law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy&para;<br>choice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under&para;<br>§10(b) of the FAA, we must either “direct a rehearing by&para;<br>the arbitrators” or decide the question that was originally&para;<br>referred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can&para;<br>be only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see&para;<br>no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle “controlled”&para;<br>the “resolution” of the question whether the Vegoilvoy&para;<br>charter party “permit[s] this arbitration to proceed on&para;<br>behalf of a class,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a, but that&para;<br>understanding was incorrect.&para;<br>Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender&para;<br>(Green Tree) and its customers. These contracts con­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention&para;<br>class arbitration. Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted&para;<br>class arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the&para;<br>customers.&para;<br>The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the&para;<br>awards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C.&para;<br>244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Seventh Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority&para;<br>to order classwide arbitration under §4 of the FAA, see&para;<br>Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and&para;<br>conflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior&para;<br>Court of Alameda Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P. 2d 1192&para;<br>(1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the&para;<br>California approach, which it characterized as permitting&para;<br>a trial court to “order class-wide arbitration under adhesive but enforceable franchise contracts,” 351 S. C., at 259,&para;<br>266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the&para;<br>South Carolina court observed, a trial judge must&para;<br>“[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies” of&para;<br>requiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual&para;<br>basis against “resulting prejudice to the drafting party”&para;<br>and should take into account factors such as “efficiency”&para;<br>and “equity.” Id., at 260, and n. 15, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357,&para;<br>and n. 15.&para;<br>Applying these standards to the case before it, the South&para;<br>Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause&para;<br>in the Green Tree contracts was “silent regarding classwide arbitration.” Id., at 263, 569 S. E. 2d, at 359&para;<br>(emphasis deleted). The Court described its holding as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be ordered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it&para;<br>would serve efficiency and equity, and would not result in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhesive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting&para;<br>party could effectively prevent class actions against&para;<br>it without having to say it was doing so in the&para;<br>agreement.” Id., at 266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 360 (footnote&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>When Bazzle reached this Court, no single rationale&para;<br>commanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who&para;<br>joined the judgment—that is, the plurality opinion and&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion—collectively addressed three&para;<br>separate questions. The first was which decision maker&para;<br>(court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts&para;<br>in question were “silent” on the issue of class arbitration.&para;<br>The second was what standard the appropriate decision&para;<br>maker should apply in determining whether a contract&para;<br>allows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA&para;<br>entirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit&para;<br>class arbitration only under limited circumstances, such&para;<br>as when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this&para;<br>question left entirely to state law?) The final question was&para;<br>whether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class&para;<br>arbitration had been properly ordered in the case&para;<br>at hand.&para;<br>The plurality opinion decided only the first question,&para;<br>concluding that the arbitrator and not a court should&para;<br>decide whether the contracts were indeed “silent” on the&para;<br>issue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, “[i]n&para;<br>certain limited circumstances,” involving “gateway mat­&para;<br>ters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration&para;<br>agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitra­&para;<br>tion clause applies to a certain type of controversy,” it is&para;<br>assumed “that the parties intended courts, not arbitra­&para;<br>tors,” to make the decision. 539 U. S., at 452. But the&para;<br>plurality opined that the question whether a contract with&para;<br>an arbitration clause forbids class arbitration “does not&para;<br>fall into this narrow exception.” Ibid. The plurality there­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme&para;<br>Court should be vacated and that the case should be re­&para;<br>manded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question&para;<br>whether the contracts were indeed “silent.” The plurality&para;<br>did not decide either the second or the third question&para;<br>noted above.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS concurred in the judgment vacating&para;<br>and remanding because otherwise there would have been&para;<br>“no controlling judgment of the Court,” but he did not&para;<br>endorse the plurality’s rationale. Id., at 455 (opinion&para;<br>concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did&para;<br>not take a definitive position on the first question, stating&para;<br>only that “[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties’&para;<br>agreement should have been made in the first instance by&para;<br>the arbitrator.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he&para;<br>did not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of&para;<br>the appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach&para;<br>that question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci­&para;<br>sion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that “the&para;<br>decision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct&para;<br>as a matter of law.” Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by­&para;<br>passed the first question noted above and rested instead&para;<br>on his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus,&para;<br>Bazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three&para;<br>questions.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Unfortunately, the opinions in Bazzle appear to have&para;<br>baffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitra­&para;<br>tion proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to have&para;<br>believed that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitra­&para;<br>tor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class&para;<br>arbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before&para;<br>arbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: “What&para;<br>[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is&para;<br>left up to the arbitrator, that’s the rule in [Bazzle]”).

ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fact, however, only the plurality decided that question.&para;<br>But we need not revisit that question here because the&para;<br>parties’ supplemental agreement expressly assigned this&para;<br>issue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that&para;<br>this assignment was impermissible.&para;<br>Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbitration panel seem to have misunderstood Bazzle in another respect, namely, that it established the standard to&para;<br>be applied by a decision maker in determining whether a&para;<br>contract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class&para;<br>arbitration. The arbitration panel began its discussion&para;<br>by stating that the parties “differ regarding the rule of&para;<br>interpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel&para;<br>continued:&para;<br>“Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language&para;<br>that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class&para;<br>action. The Panel, however, agrees with Respondents&para;<br>that the test is a more general one—arbitrators must&para;<br>look to the language of the parties’ agreement to ascertain the parties’ intention whether they intended to&para;<br>permit or to preclude class action.” Ibid.&para;<br>As we have explained, however, Bazzle did not establish&para;<br>the rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration&para;<br>is permitted.8 The decision in Bazzle left that question&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 AnimalFeeds&para;<br>&para;<br>invokes the parties’ supplemental agreement as evidence that petitioners “waived” any claim that the arbitrators could not&para;<br>construe the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration. Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 15. The dissent concludes, likewise, that the existence&para;<br>of the parties’ supplemental agreement renders petitioners’ argument&para;<br>under §10(a)(4) “scarcely debatable.” Post, at 7. These arguments are&para;<br>easily answered by the clear terms of the supplemental agreement&para;<br>itself. The parties expressly provided that their supplemental agreement “does not alter the scope of the Parties’ arbitration agreements in&para;<br>any Charter Party Agreement,” and that “[n]either the fact of this&para;<br>Agreement nor any of its terms may be used to support or oppose any&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The&para;<br>question that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was&para;<br>whether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed&para;<br>for class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement&para;<br>conferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter&para;<br>party itself.

The&para;<br>panel’s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foun­&para;<br>dational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of&para;<br>consent.&para;<br>In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that&para;<br>parties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly&para;<br>authorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Thus,&para;<br>we have said that “ ‘ “procedural” questions which grow out&para;<br>of the dispute and bear on its final disposition’ are pre­&para;<br>sumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to&para;<br>decide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.&para;<br>79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v.&para;<br>Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is&para;<br>grounded in the background principle that “[w]hen the&para;<br>parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract&para;<br>have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential&para;<br>to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which&para;<br>is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the&para;<br>court.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204 (1979).&para;<br>An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra­&para;<br>tion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer&para;<br>solely from the fact of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate.&para;<br>This is so because class-action arbitration changes the&para;<br>nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be&para;<br>presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to&para;<br>submit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi­&para;<br>tration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate&para;<br>review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of&para;<br>private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency&para;<br>and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to&para;<br>resolve specialized disputes.&para;<br>See Gilmer v.

An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed­&para;<br>upon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 2, no longer resolves a&para;<br>single dispute between the parties to a single agreement,&para;<br>but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or&para;<br>perhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (“[W]e&para;<br>believe domestic class members could be in the hundreds”&para;<br>and that “[t]here could be class members that ship to and&para;<br>from the U.

The arbitrator’s award no&para;<br>longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitra­&para;<br>tion agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent par­&para;<br>ties as well. Cf. Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.

We&para;<br>think that the differences between bilateral and class­&para;<br>action arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,&para;<br>consistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that&para;<br>the parties’ mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi­&para;<br>tration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in&para;<br>class proceedings.10&para;<br>The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by&para;<br>characterizing the question before the arbitrators as being&para;<br>merely what “procedural mode” was available to present&para;<br>AnimalFeeds’ claims.

Contrary to&para;<br>the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz­&para;<br>ing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques­&para;<br>tion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class&para;<br>arbitration.

See supra, at 2. The panel&para;<br>did just what it was commissioned to do. It construed the&para;<br>broad arbitration clause (covering “[a]ny dispute arising&para;<br>from the making, performance or termination of this&para;<br>Charter Party,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a) and ruled,&para;<br>expressly and only, that the clause permitted class arbi&para;<br>tration.

The four&para;<br>grounds for vacatur codified in §10(a) restate the long&para;<br>standing rule that, “[i]f [an arbitration] award is within&para;<br>the submission, and contains the honest decision of the&para;<br>arbitrators, after a full and fair hearing of the parties, a&para;<br>court . . . will not set [the award] aside for error, either in&para;<br>law or fact.” Burchell v.

Instead, the panel tied its conclusion&para;<br>that the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal mari&para;<br>time law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to&para;<br>Rule 3 of the American Arbitration Association’s Supple&para;<br>mentary Rules for Class Arbitrations. Id., at 49a–50a.&para;<br>At the outset of its explanation, the panel rejected the&para;<br>argument, proffered by AnimalFeeds, that this Court’s&para;<br>decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S.&para;<br>444 (2003), settled the matter by “requir[ing] clear lan&para;<br>guage that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class&para;<br>action.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added).&para;<br>Agreeing with Stolt-Nielsen in this regard, the panel said&para;<br>that the test it employed looked to the language of the&para;<br>particular agreement to gauge whether the parties “in&para;<br>tended to permit or to preclude class action[s].” Ibid.&para;<br>Concentrating on the wording of the arbitration clause,&para;<br>the panel observed, is “consistent with New York law as&para;<br>articulated by the [New York] Court of Appeals . . . and&para;<br>with federal maritime law.” Ibid.9&para;<br>Emphasizing the breadth of the clause in question—&para;<br>“ ‘any dispute arising from the making, performance or&para;<br>termination of this Charter Party’ shall be put to arbitra&para;<br>tion,” id., at 50a—the panel noted that numerous other&para;<br>partial awards had relied on language similarly compre&para;<br>hensive to permit class proceedings “in a wide variety of&para;<br>settings.” Id., at 49a–50a. The panel further noted “that&para;<br>many of the other panels [had] rejected arguments similar&para;<br>to those advanced by [Stolt-Nielsen].” Id., at 50a.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 On New York law, the panel referred to Evans v.

The sentence quoted from the hearing tran&para;<br>script concluded: “therefore there has been no agreement&para;<br>to bar class arbitrations.” App. 77a (emphasis added).&para;<br>Counsel quickly clarified his position: “It’s also undisputed&para;<br>that the arbitration clause here contains broad language&para;<br>and this language should be interpreted to permit class&para;<br>arbitrations.” Id., at 79a. See also id., at 80a (noting&para;<br>consistent recognition by arbitration panels that “a silent&para;<br>broadly worded arbitration clause, just like the one at&para;<br>issue here, should be construed to permit class arbitra&para;<br>tion”); id., at 88a (“[B]road . . . language . . . silent as to&para;<br>class proceedings should be interpreted to permit a class&para;<br>proceeding.”).&para;<br>Stolt-Nielsen, the panel acknowledged, had vigorously&para;<br>argued, with the support of expert testimony, that “the&para;<br>bulk of international shippers would never intend to have&para;<br>their disputes decided in a class arbitration.” App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 52a. That concern, the panel suggested, might be&para;<br>met at a later stage; “if a class is certified,” the panel&para;<br>noted, class membership could be confined to those who&para;<br>affirmatively “ ‘opt in’ ” to the proceeding. Ibid.&para;<br>The question properly before the Court is not whether&para;<br>the arbitrators’ ruling was erroneous, but whether the&para;<br>arbitrators “exceeded their powers.” §10(a)(4).

Just as&para;<br>§10(a)(4) provides no justification for the Court’s disposi&para;<br>tion, see supra, at 6–9 and this page, so, too, §10(b) pro&para;<br>vides no grounding for the Court’s peremptory action.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>A&para;<br>For arbitrators to consider whether a claim should&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

See ante, at 20 (“[A] party may not&para;<br>be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration&para;<br>unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the&para;<br>party agreed to do so.”); ante, at 23. The breadth of the&para;<br>arbitration clause, and the absence of any provision waiv&para;<br>ing or banning class proceedings,10 will not do. Ante, at&para;<br>20–23.&para;<br>The Court ties the requirement of affirmative authoriza&para;<br>tion to “the basic precept that arbitration ‘is a matter of&para;<br>consent, not coercion.’ ” Ante, at 17 (quoting Volt Informa&para;<br>tion Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford&para;<br>Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989)). Parties may&para;<br>“specify with whom they choose to arbitrate,” the Court&para;<br>observes, just as they may “limit the issues they choose to&para;<br>arbitrate.” Ante, at 19. But arbitrators, in delineating an&para;<br>appropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard&para;<br>such contractual constraints. In this case, for example,&para;<br>AnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only&para;<br>“claims . . . arising out of any [charter party agreement]&para;<br>. . . that provides for arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the&para;<br>proposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of&para;<br>persons “with whom” Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate,&para;<br>and only “issues” subject to arbitration. Ante, at 19 (em&para;<br>phasis omitted).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Several courts have invalidated contractual bans on, or waivers of,&para;<br>class arbitration because proceeding on an individual basis was not&para;<br>feasible in view of the high costs entailed and the slim benefits achiev&para;<br>able. See, e.g., In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d&para;<br>300, 315–316, 320 (CA2 2009); Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F. 3d 25,&para;<br>55, 59 (CA1 2006); Discover Bank v. Superior Court, 36 Cal. 4th 148,&para;<br>162–163, 113 P. 3d 1100, 1110 (2005); Leonard v. Terminix Int’l Co.,&para;<br>LP, 854 So. 2d 529, 539 (Ala. 2002). Were there no right to proceed on&para;<br>behalf of a class in the first place, however, a provision banning or&para;<br>waiving recourse to this aggregation device would be superfluous.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court also links its affirmative-authorization re&para;<br>quirement to the parties’ right to stipulate rules under&para;<br>which arbitration may proceed. See ibid. The question,&para;<br>however, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu&para;<br>lation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a&para;<br>species of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. AlbertoCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties&para;<br>had chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of&para;<br>“any dispute” involving a contract for ocean carriage of&para;<br>goods. There is little question that the designated court,&para;<br>state or federal, would have authority to conduct claims&para;<br>like AnimalFeeds’ on a class basis. Why should the class&para;<br>action prospect vanish when the “any dispute” clause is&para;<br>contained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut&para;<br>General Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,&para;<br>210 F. 3d 771, 774–776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract’s&para;<br>authorization to arbitrate “[a]ny dispute” to permit con&para;<br>solidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi&para;<br>trators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro&para;<br>ceedings, see ante, at 21–22, then the claimant should&para;<br>retain its right to proceed in that format in court.&para;<br>B&para;<br>When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no&para;<br>more than modest in size, class proceedings may be “the&para;<br>thing,” i.e., without them, potential claimants will have&para;<br>little, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.&para;<br>Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617&para;<br>(1997); Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656,&para;<br>661 (CA7 2004) (“The realistic alternative to a class action&para;<br>is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits,&para;<br>as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.”). Mindful that&para;<br>disallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the&para;<br>dimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can&para;<br>mount, I note some stopping points in the Court’s decision.&para;<br>First, the Court does not insist on express consent to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Class arbitration may be ordered if&para;<br>“there is a contractual basis for concluding that the&para;<br>part[ies] agreed” “to submit to class arbitration”. Ante, at&para;<br>20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (“We have no occasion to decide&para;<br>what contractual basis may support a finding that the&para;<br>parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.”).&para;<br>Second, by observing that “the parties [here] are sophisti&para;<br>cated business entities,” and “that it is customary for the&para;<br>shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a&para;<br>particular shipment,” the Court apparently spares from its&para;<br>affirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe&para;<br>sion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.&para;<br>While these qualifications limit the scope of the Court’s&para;<br>decision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators’ judg&para;<br>ment should not have been disturbed.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition&para;<br>for want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.
