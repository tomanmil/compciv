CHAFIN&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1347. Argued December 5, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013&para;<br>The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction requires the judicial or administrative authority of a Contracting State to order a child returned to her country of habitual residence if the authority finds that the child has been wrongfully&para;<br>removed to or retained in the Contracting State. The International&para;<br>Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) implements the Convention&para;<br>in the United States, granting federal and state courts concurrent jurisdiction over Convention actions and directing those courts to decide cases in accordance with the Convention. ICARA also requires&para;<br>defendants to pay various expenses incurred by plaintiffs associated&para;<br>with the return of children.&para;<br>Petitioner Mr. Chafin, a United States citizen and member of the&para;<br>military, married respondent Ms. Chafin, a United Kingdom citizen,&para;<br>in Germany, where they later had a daughter, E. C. When Mr. Chafin was deployed to Afghanistan, Ms. Chafin took E. C. to Scotland.&para;<br>Mr. Chafin was later transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and Ms.&para;<br>Chafin eventually traveled there with E. C. Soon after Ms. Chafin’s&para;<br>arrival, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and child custody in Alabama.&para;<br>Ms. Chafin was subsequently deported, but E. C. remained in Alabama with Mr. Chafin. Several months later, Ms. Chafin filed a petition under the Convention and ICARA, seeking E. C.’s return to Scotland. The District Court concluded that E. C.’s country of habitual&para;<br>residence was Scotland and granted the petition for return. Ms.&para;<br>Chafin immediately departed for Scotland with E. C. Ms. Chafin&para;<br>then initiated custody proceedings in Scotland and was granted interim custody and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mr. Chafin from&para;<br>removing E. C. from Scotland. Mr. Chafin appealed the District&para;<br>Court’s order, but the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAFIN v.CHAFIN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>on the ground that once a child has been returned to a foreign country, a U. S. court becomes powerless to grant relief. On remand, the&para;<br>District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to reimburse Ms. Chafin for court&para;<br>costs, attorney’s fees, and travel expenses.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The return of a child to a foreign country pursuant to a Convention return order does not render an appeal of that order moot.&para;<br>Pp. 5–14.&para;<br>(a) Article III restricts the power of federal courts to “Cases” and&para;<br>“Controversies,” and this “requirement subsists through all stages of&para;<br>[the] proceedings,” Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472,&para;<br>477. No case or controversy exists, and a suit becomes moot, “when&para;<br>the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally&para;<br>cognizable interest in the outcome,” Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___. But a case “becomes moot only when it is impossible&para;<br>for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing&para;<br>party,” Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___, ___. As “long as the&para;<br>parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the&para;<br>litigation, the case is not moot,” ibid. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) Because the Chafins continue to vigorously contest the question&para;<br>of where their daughter will be raised, this dispute is very much&para;<br>alive. This case does not address “a hypothetical state of facts,” Lewis, supra, at 477, and there continues to exist between the parties&para;<br>“that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues,” Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(1) Mr. Chafin seeks typical appellate relief: reversal of the District Court determination that E. C.’s habitual residence was Scotland and, upon reversal, an order that E. C. be returned to the United States. The question is whether such relief would be effectual. In&para;<br>arguing that this case is moot because the District Court has no authority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pursuant to its inherent equitable powers, Ms. Chafin confuses mootness&para;<br>with the merits. See, e.g., Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 500.&para;<br>Mr. Chafin’s claim for re-return cannot be dismissed as so implausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, and his prospects of&para;<br>success are therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry. As to the&para;<br>effectiveness of any relief, even if Scotland were to ignore a re-return&para;<br>order, this case would not be moot. The U. S. courts continue to have&para;<br>personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin and may command her to take&para;<br>action under threat of sanctions. She could decide to comply with an&para;<br>order against her and return E. C. to the United States. Enforcement&para;<br>of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Chafin chooses to defy it, but&para;<br>such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(2) Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the District&para;<br>Court’s expense orders. That too is common relief on appeal, and the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>mootness inquiry comes down to its effectiveness. In contending that&para;<br>this case is moot due to Mr. Chafin’s failure to pursue an appeal of&para;<br>the expense orders, which were entered as separate judgments, Ms.&para;<br>Chafin again confuses mootness with the merits. Because there is&para;<br>authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such judgments&para;<br>separately does not preclude relief, it is for lower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to&para;<br>the relief he seeks. That relief would not be “ ‘fully satisfactory,’ ” but&para;<br>“even the availability of a ‘partial remedy’ is ‘sufficient to prevent [a]&para;<br>case from being moot,’ ” Calderon v. Moore, 518 U. S. 149, 150.&para;<br>Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(c) Manipulating constitutional doctrine and holding these cases&para;<br>moot is not necessary to achieve the ends of the Convention and ICARA, and may undermine the treaty’s goals and harm the children&para;<br>meant to be protected. If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course,&para;<br>to prevent the loss of any right to appeal. Such routine stays would&para;<br>conflict with the Convention’s mandate of prompt return. Courts&para;<br>should instead apply traditional factors in considering whether to&para;<br>stay a return order, see, e.g., Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434, thus&para;<br>ensuring that each case will receive the individualized treatment&para;<br>necessary for appropriate consideration of the child’s best interests.&para;<br>Finally, at both the district and appellate court level, courts should&para;<br>take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible.

C.’s&para;<br>habitual residence was Scotland and, if that determination&para;<br>is reversed, an order that E. C. be returned to the United&para;<br>States (or “re-return,” as the parties have put it). In short,&para;<br>Mr. Chafin is asking for typical appellate relief: that the&para;<br>Court of Appeals reverse the District Court and that the&para;<br>District Court undo what it has done. See Arkadelphia&para;<br>Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., 249 U. S.&para;<br>134, 145–146 (1919); Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, 139&para;<br>U. S. 216, 219 (1891) (“Jurisdiction to correct what had&para;<br>been wrongfully done must remain with the court so long&para;<br>as the parties and the case are properly before it, either in&para;<br>the first instance or when remanded to it by an appellate&para;<br>tribunal”). The question is whether such relief would be&para;<br>effectual in this case.&para;<br>Ms. Chafin argues that this case is moot because the&para;<br>District Court lacks the authority to issue a re-return&para;<br>order either under the Convention or pursuant to its inherent equitable powers. But that argument—which&para;<br>goes to the meaning of the Convention and the legal avail­&para;<br>ability of a certain kind of relief—confuses mootness with&para;<br>the merits. In Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486 (1969),&para;<br>this Court held that a claim for backpay saved the case&para;<br>from mootness, even though the defendants argued that&para;<br>the backpay claim had been brought in the wrong court&para;<br>and therefore could not result in relief. As the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAFIN v. CHAFIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>explained, “this argument . . . confuses mootness with&para;<br>whether [the plaintiff] has established a right to recover&para;<br>. . . , a question which it is inappropriate to treat at this&para;<br>stage of the litigation.” Id., at 500. Mr. Chafin’s claim&para;<br>for re-return—under the Convention itself or according to&para;<br>general equitable principles—cannot be dismissed as so&para;<br>implausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction,&para;<br>see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.&para;<br>83, 89 (1998), and his prospects of success are therefore&para;<br>not pertinent to the mootness inquiry.&para;<br>As to the effectiveness of any relief, Ms. Chafin asserts&para;<br>that even if the habitual residence ruling were reversed&para;<br>and the District Court were to issue a re-return order, that&para;<br>relief would be ineffectual because Scotland would simply&para;<br>ignore it.1 But even if Scotland were to ignore a U. S. re­&para;<br>return order, or decline to assist in enforcing it, this case&para;<br>would not be moot. The U. S. courts continue to have&para;<br>personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin, may command her&para;<br>to take action even outside the United States, and may&para;<br>back up any such command with sanctions. See Steele v.&para;<br>Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280, 289 (1952); cf. Leman v.&para;<br>Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U. S. 448, 451–452&para;<br>(1932). No law of physics prevents E. C.’s return from&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Whether Scotland would do so is unclear; Ms. Chafin cited no au­&para;<br>thority for her assertion in her brief or at oral argument. In a recently&para;<br>issued decision from the Family Division of the High Court of Justice&para;<br>of England and Wales, a judge of that court rejected the “concept of&para;<br>automatic re-return of a child in response to the overturn of [a] Hague&para;<br>order.” DL v. EL, [2013] EWHC 49, ¶59 (Judgt. of Jan. 17). The judge&para;<br>in that case did not ignore the pertinent re-return order—issued by the&para;<br>District Court in Larbie v. Larbie, 690 F. 3d 295 (CA5 2012), cert.&para;<br>pending, No. 12–304—but did not consider it binding in light of the&para;<br>proceedings in England.&para;<br>Earlier in those proceedings, the Family Division of the High Court&para;<br>directed the parties to provide this Court with a joint statement on&para;<br>the status of those proceedings.

Courts often adjudicate disputes&para;<br>where the practical impact of any decision is not assured.&para;<br>For example, courts issue default judgments against de­&para;<br>fendants who failed to appear or participate in the pro­&para;<br>ceedings and therefore seem less likely to comply.

United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462&para;<br>U. S. 579, 581, n. 2 (1983).&para;<br>So too here. A re-return order may not result in the&para;<br>return of E.

But it cannot be said that the parties&para;<br>here have no “concrete interest” in whether Mr. Chafin&para;<br>secures a re-return order. Knox, 567 U.

Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the&para;<br>District Court’s expense orders. The District Court or­&para;<br>dered Mr. Chafin to pay Ms. Chafin over $94,000 in court&para;<br>costs, attorney’s fees, and travel expenses. See Civ. No.&para;<br>11–1461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 15–16; Civ. No. 11–&para;<br>1461 (ND Ala., June 5, 2012), p. 2. That award was predi­&para;<br>cated on the District Court’s earlier judgment allowing&para;<br>Ms. Chafin to return with her daughter to Scotland. See&para;<br>Civ.

The District Court cited Eleventh Circuit cases&para;<br>for the proposition that if a plaintiff obtains relief before a district court&para;<br>and the case becomes moot on appeal, the plaintiff is still a prevailing&para;<br>party entitled to attorney’s fees. We express no view on that question.&para;<br>The fact remains that the District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to pay&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

That too is&para;<br>common relief on appeal, see, e.g., Fawcett, supra, at 501,&para;<br>n. 6 (reversing costs and fees award when reversing on the&para;<br>issue of wrongful removal), and the mootness inquiry&para;<br>comes down to its effectiveness.&para;<br>At oral argument, Ms. Chafin contended that such relief&para;<br>was “gone in this case,” and that the case was therefore&para;<br>moot, because Mr. Chafin had failed to pursue an appeal&para;<br>of the expense orders, which had been entered as separate&para;<br>judgments. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see Civ. No. 11–1461 (ND&para;<br>Ala., Mar. 7, 2012); Civ. No. 11–1461 (ND Ala., June 5,&para;<br>2012). But this is another argument on the merits. Mr.&para;<br>Chafin’s requested relief is not so implausible that it may&para;<br>be disregarded on the question of jurisdiction; there is&para;<br>authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such&para;<br>judgments separately does not preclude relief. See 15B&para;<br>Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, supra, §3915.6, at 230, and&para;<br>n. 39.5 (2d ed., Supp. 2012) (citing cases). It is thus for&para;<br>lower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide&para;<br>whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to the relief he seeks—&para;<br>vacatur of the expense orders.&para;<br>Such relief would of course not be “ ‘fully satisfactory,’ ”&para;<br>but with respect to the case as whole, “even the availabil­&para;<br>ity of a ‘partial remedy’ is ‘sufficient to prevent [a] case&para;<br>from being moot.’ ” Calderon v. Moore, 518 U. S. 149, 150&para;<br>(1996) (per curiam) (quoting Church of Scientology, 506&para;<br>U. S., at 13).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Ms. Chafin is correct to emphasize that both the Hague&para;<br>Convention and ICARA stress the importance of the&para;<br>prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained.&para;<br>We are also sympathetic to the concern that shuttling&para;<br>——————&para;<br>attorney’s fees and travel expenses based on its earlier ruling. A&para;<br>reversal, as opposed to vacatur, of the earlier ruling could change the&para;<br>prevailing party calculus and afford Mr. Chafin effective relief.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CHAFIN v. CHAFIN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>children back and forth between parents and across inter­&para;<br>national borders may be detrimental to those children.&para;<br>But courts can achieve the ends of the Convention and&para;<br>ICARA—and protect the well-being of the affected chil­&para;<br>dren—through the familiar judicial tools of expediting&para;<br>proceedings and granting stays where appropriate. There&para;<br>is no need to manipulate constitutional doctrine and hold&para;<br>these cases moot. Indeed, doing so may very well under­&para;<br>mine the goals of the treaty and harm the children it is&para;<br>meant to protect.&para;<br>If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts&para;<br>would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course,&para;<br>to prevent the loss of any right to appeal. See, e.g., Garrison v. Hudson, 468 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1984) (Burger, C. J.,&para;<br>in chambers) (“When . . . the normal course of appellate&para;<br>review might otherwise cause the case to become moot,&para;<br>issuance of a stay is warranted” (citation and internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)); Nicolson v. Pappalardo, Civ.&para;<br>No. 10–1125 (CA1, Feb. 19, 2010) (“Without necessarily&para;<br>finding a clear probability that appellant will prevail, we&para;<br>grant the stay because . . . a risk exists that the case could&para;<br>effectively be mooted by the child’s departure”). In cases&para;<br>in which a stay would not be granted but for the prospect&para;<br>of mootness, a child would lose precious months when she&para;<br>could have been readjusting to life in her country of habit­&para;<br>ual residence, even though the appeal had little chance of&para;<br>success. Such routine stays due to mootness would be&para;<br>likely but would conflict with the Convention’s mandate of&para;<br>prompt return to a child’s country of habitual residence.&para;<br>Routine stays could also increase the number of appeals.&para;<br>Currently, only about 15% of Hague Convention cases are&para;<br>appealed.

In every case under the Hague Convention, the&para;<br>well-being of a child is at stake; application of the tradi­&para;<br>tional stay factors ensures that each case will receive the&para;<br>individualized treatment necessary for appropriate con­&para;<br>sideration of the child’s best interests.&para;<br>Importantly, whether at the district or appellate court&para;<br>level, courts can and should take steps to decide these&para;<br>cases as expeditiously as possible, for the sake of the&para;<br>children who find themselves in such an unfortunate&para;<br>situation.
