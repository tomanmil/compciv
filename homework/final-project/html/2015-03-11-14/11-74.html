CROSS&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 11–74. Decided December 12, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254, “imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings and&para;<br>demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of&para;<br>the doubt.” Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). In this case, the Court of Appeals departed&para;<br>from this standard, and we therefore grant certiorari and&para;<br>reverse.&para;<br>Irving Cross was tried for kidnaping and sexually assaulting A. S. at knifepoint. Cross claimed that A. S. had&para;<br>consented to sex in exchange for money and drugs. Despite her avowed fear of taking the stand, A. S. testified as&para;<br>the State’s primary witness at Cross’ trial in November&para;<br>1999 and was cross-examined by Cross’ attorney. According to the trial judge, A. S.’s testimony was halting. The&para;<br>jury found Cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to&para;<br>reach a verdict on the sexual assault charges, and the trial&para;<br>judge declared a mistrial. The State decided to retry&para;<br>Cross on those counts, and the retrial was scheduled for&para;<br>March 29, 2000.&para;<br>On March 20, 2000, the prosecutor informed the trial&para;<br>judge that A. S. could not be located. A week later, on&para;<br>March 28, the State moved to have A. S. declared unavailable and to introduce her prior testimony at the second&para;<br>trial.&para;<br>The State represented that A. S. had said after the first&para;<br>trial that she was willing to testify at the retrial. The&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDY v. CROSS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>State said that it had remained in “constant contact” with&para;<br>A. S. and her mother and that “[e]very indication” had&para;<br>been that A. S., “though extremely frightened, would be&para;<br>willing to again come to court and testify.” Record, Exh. J,&para;<br>p. 111 (hereinafter Exh. J). On March 3, however, A. S.’s&para;<br>mother and brother told the State’s investigator that they&para;<br>did not know where she was, and A. S.’s mother reported&para;<br>that A. S. was “very fearful and very concerned” about&para;<br>testifying again. Record, Exh. K, p. E–9 (hereinafter Exh.&para;<br>K); id., at E–14. On March 9 or 10, the investigator interviewed A. S.’s father, who also had “no idea where [A. S.]&para;<br>was.” Id., at E–12. The father’s only suggestion was to&para;<br>refer the investigator back to the mother.&para;<br>On March 10, the State learned from A. S.’s mother that&para;<br>A. S. had run away from home the day before and had not&para;<br>returned.* Exh. J, at 111. Thereafter, “efforts began by&para;<br>members of the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and&para;<br>by law enforcement personnel to locate” A. S. Id., at 112.&para;<br>The State averred that its efforts included the following:&para;<br>“Constant personal visits to the home of [A. S.] and&para;<br>her mother, at all hours of the day and night. This&para;<br>is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault&para;<br>occurred.&para;<br>“Personal visits to the home of [A. S.’s] father. This&para;<br>is where the victim lived when the sexual assault&para;<br>occurred.&para;<br>“Personal conversations, in English and in Spanish,&para;<br>with the victim’s mother, father, and other family&para;<br>members.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The State’s motion does not mention the investigator’s March 3 visit&para;<br>with A. S.’s mother and brother, and the record in this case does not&para;<br>make entirely clear when A. S. disappeared and when the State’s&para;<br>attorney actually became aware of this fact. In any event, the parties&para;<br>do not dispute the facts in this case regarding the State’s efforts to&para;<br>locate A. S. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>“Telephone calls, in English and in Spanish, to the victim’s mother, father, and other family members.&para;<br>“Checks at the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook&para;<br>County.&para;<br>“Checks at local hospitals.&para;<br>“Checks at the Cook County Department of Corrections.&para;<br>“Check at the victim’s school.&para;<br>“Check with the family of an old boyfriend of the&para;<br>victim.&para;<br>“Check with the Illinois Secretary of State’s Office.&para;<br>“[Department of] Public [A]id check.” Id., at 112–113.&para;<br>The State also inquired at the Department of Public&para;<br>Health, the morgue, the Cook County Jail, the Illinois&para;<br>Department of Corrections, the Immigration Department,&para;<br>and the post office. See Exh. K, at E–14 to E–17, E–21;&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The State’s investigator was&para;<br>assisted in the search by a police detective and a victim’s&para;<br>advocate. The detective visited A. S.’s father’s home once&para;<br>and went to A. S.’s mother’s home—A. S.’s last-known&para;<br>residence—on numerous occasions, approximately once&para;<br>every three days, at different hours of the day and night.&para;<br>Exh. K, at E27 to E29, E35. On one visit, A. S.’s mother told the victim’s advocate that A. S. could be staying&para;<br>with an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, 40 miles away.&para;<br>Id., at E42 to E43. The police detective visited the&para;<br>Waukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend’s&para;<br>mother that she had not seen A. S. in several months and&para;<br>that A. S. was not staying with her or her son. Id., at&para;<br>E33 to E34. The efforts to find A. S. continued until&para;<br>March 28, the day of the hearing on the State’s motion.&para;<br>Id., at E30.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDY v. CROSS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>On a final visit to A. S.’s mother on the morning of&para;<br>March 28, the mother informed the police detective that&para;<br>A. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had&para;<br>said that she did not want to testify and would not return&para;<br>to Chicago. See id., at E–30; 632 F. 3d 356, 359 (CA7&para;<br>2011). A. S.’s mother told the detective that she still did&para;<br>not know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K,&para;<br>at E30.&para;<br>The trial court granted the State’s motion and admitted&para;<br>A. S.’s earlier testimony. The trial court concluded that&para;<br>the State had “expended efforts that go way beyond due&para;<br>diligence,” id., at E–65, and that A. S. “ha[d] made it&para;<br>impossible for anybody to find where she is . . . in spite of&para;<br>what I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],” id.,&para;<br>at E–67. At Cross’ retrial, a legal intern from the State’s&para;<br>attorney’s office read A. S.’s prior, cross-examined testimony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the&para;<br>clerk’s reading of the prior testimony did not include the&para;<br>long pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk&para;<br>read the transcript with a slight inflection. See 632 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 359. The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual&para;<br>assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal&para;<br>sexual assault.&para;<br>On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that&para;<br>A. S. was unavailable because “[i]t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in&para;<br>the city” and “also evident that she was in hiding and did&para;<br>not want to be located.” Id., at 83a. The court found that&para;<br>the State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to&para;<br>locate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed&para;<br>the introduction of A. S.’s cross-examined testimony from&para;<br>the first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross’ convictions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied&para;<br>Cross’ petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross’&para;<br>petition for a writ of certiorari.&para;<br>Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>under 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Cross argued,&para;<br>among other things, that the state court had unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecution made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarant’s&para;<br>presence at trial. The District Court denied Cross’ petition, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unreasonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient&para;<br>effort to secure A. S.’s presence at the retrial. The Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of A. S.’s testimony&para;<br>and the manner of her testimony at the first trial.&para;<br>In Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719 (1968), we held that “a&para;<br>witness is not ‘unavailable’ for purposes of the . . . confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities&para;<br>have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at&para;<br>trial.” Id., at 724–725. In Barber, we held that a witness&para;<br>had not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes because the State, which could have brought the&para;<br>witness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad&para;<br>testificandum, had “made absolutely no effort to obtain&para;<br>[his] presence . . . at trial” apart from determining that he&para;<br>was serving a sentence in a federal prison. Id., at 723; see&para;<br>also id., at 725.&para;<br>We again addressed the question of witness unavailability in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). In that case,&para;<br>we held, the State had discharged its “duty of good-faith&para;<br>effort.” Id., at 75. We noted that the prosecutor had&para;<br>spoken to the witness’ mother, who reported that she had&para;<br>no knowledge of her daughter’s whereabouts and “knew of&para;<br>no way to reach [her] even in an emergency.” Ibid. We&para;<br>also noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the&para;<br>witness’ name to her parents’ residence over a 4-month&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HARDY v. CROSS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>period prior to the trial. “ ‘The lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness,’ ” the Court made&para;<br>clear, “ ‘is a question of reasonableness.’ ” Id., at 74 (quoting California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 189, n. 22 (1970)&para;<br>(Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there&para;<br>were some additional steps that the prosecutor might have&para;<br>taken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that&para;<br>“[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.”&para;<br>448 U. S., at 75. But “the great improbability that such&para;<br>efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and&para;<br>would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any&para;<br>intimation that a concept of reasonableness required their&para;<br>execution.” Id., at 76.&para;<br>In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of&para;<br>Appeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith&para;<br>search for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable application of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether&para;<br>or not the state court went too far in characterizing the&para;<br>prosecution’s efforts as “superhuman,” the state court&para;<br>identified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and&para;<br>applied it in a reasonable manner.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit found that the State’s efforts were&para;<br>inadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh&para;<br>Circuit faulted the State for failing to contact “A. S.’s&para;<br>current boyfriend—whom she was with just moments&para;<br>before the alleged assault—or any of her other friends in&para;<br>the Chicago area.” 632 F. 3d, at 362. But the record does&para;<br>not show that any of A. S.’s family members or any other&para;<br>persons interviewed by the State provided any reason to&para;<br>believe that any of these individuals had information&para;<br>about A. S.’s whereabouts.&para;<br>Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because&para;<br>it did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where&para;<br>A. S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court’s own&para;<br>opinion observed that the information about A. S.’s enrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>not “noteworthy” or “particularly helpful.” Ibid. Since&para;<br>A. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at&para;<br>E–42, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the&para;<br>school had better information about A. S.’s location than&para;<br>did the members of her family.&para;<br>Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State’s&para;<br>efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve&para;<br>her with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testifying at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear&para;<br>about testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless&para;<br>appeared in court and had taken the stand. The State&para;<br>represented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to&para;<br>testify at the retrial as well. 632 F. 3d, at 362. We have&para;<br>never held that the prosecution must have issued a subpoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into&para;<br>hiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes,&para;<br>and the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a&para;<br>sexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she&para;<br>is willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.&para;<br>As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears&para;<br>before trial, it is always possible to think of additional&para;<br>steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the&para;<br>witness’ presence, see 448 U. S., at 75, but the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust&para;<br>every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.&para;<br>And, more to the point, the deferential standard of review&para;<br>set out in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) does not permit a federal&para;<br>court to overturn a state court’s decision on the question of&para;<br>unavailability merely because the federal court identifies&para;<br>additional steps that might have been taken. Under&para;<br>AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it&para;<br>cannot be disturbed.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross’ motion to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment&para;<br>of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is&para;<br>Reversed.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
