ARKANSAS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS&para;<br>No. 10–1320. Argued February 22, 2012—Decided May 24, 2012&para;<br>The State of Arkansas charged petitioner Alex Blueford with capital&para;<br>murder for the death of a one-year-old child. That charge included&para;<br>the lesser offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. Before the start of deliberations, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the offenses as follows: “If you have a&para;<br>reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt on the charge of capital&para;<br>murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree. . . .&para;<br>If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt on the charge&para;<br>of murder in the first degree, you will then consider the charge of&para;<br>manslaughter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s&para;<br>guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the&para;<br>charge of negligent homicide.” The court also presented the jury with&para;<br>a set of verdict forms, which allowed the jury either to convict&para;<br>Blueford of one of the charged offenses, or to acquit him of all of&para;<br>them. Acquitting on some but not others was not an option.&para;<br>After deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could&para;<br>not reach a verdict. The court inquired about the jury’s progress on&para;<br>each offense. The foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous&para;<br>against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate. The&para;<br>jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a&para;<br>mistrial. When the State subsequently sought to retry Blueford, he&para;<br>moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder charges on double jeopardy grounds. The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.&para;<br>Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrying Blueford on&para;<br>charges of capital murder and first-degree murder. Pp. 5−10.&para;<br>(a) The jury did not acquit Blueford of capital or first-degree mur-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>der. Blueford contends that the foreperson’s report that the jury was&para;<br>unanimous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor.&para;<br>But the report was not a final resolution of anything. When the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury’s&para;<br>deliberations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back to&para;<br>the jury room to deliberate further, and nothing in the court’s instructions prohibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital&para;<br>and first-degree murder as deliberations continued. The foreperson’s&para;<br>report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the finality&para;<br>necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses. That same&para;<br>lack of finality undermines Blueford’s reliance on Green v. United&para;<br>States, 355 U. S. 184, and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323. In both of&para;<br>those cases, the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report of the foreperson was not. Pp. 5−8.&para;<br>(b) The trial court’s declaration of a mistrial was not improper. A&para;<br>trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the&para;<br>same offense when “particular circumstances manifest a necessity” to&para;<br>declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 690. Blueford contends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and firstdegree murder, given the foreperson’s report that the jury had voted&para;<br>unanimously against guilt on those charges. According to Blueford,&para;<br>the court at that time should have taken some action, whether&para;<br>through new partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to&para;<br>give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to&para;<br>the remaining charges. Blueford acknowledges, however, that the&para;<br>trial court’s reason for declaring a mistrial here—that the jury was&para;<br>unable to reach a verdict—has long been considered the “classic basis” establishing necessity for doing so. Arizona v. Washington, 434&para;<br>U. S. 497, 509. And this Court has never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse―let alone to consider giving&para;<br>the jury new options for a verdict. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___. As permitted under Arkansas law, the jury’s options in this case&para;<br>were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on&para;<br>all.

The Clause does not,&para;<br>however, bar a second trial if the first ended in a mistrial.&para;<br>Before the jury concluded deliberations in this case, it reported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of&para;<br>capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked&para;<br>on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate.&para;<br>The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the&para;<br>court declared a mistrial. All agree that the defendant&para;<br>may be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent&para;<br>homicide. The question is whether he may also be retried&para;<br>on charges of capital and first-degree murder.&para;<br>I&para;<br>One-year-old Matthew McFadden, Jr., suffered a severe&para;<br>head injury on November 28, 2007, while home with his&para;<br>mother’s boyfriend, Alex Blueford. Despite treatment at a&para;<br>hospital, McFadden died a few days later.&para;<br>The State of Arkansas charged Blueford with capital&para;<br>murder, but waived the death penalty. The State’s theory&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at trial was that Blueford had injured McFadden intentionally, causing the boy’s death “[u]nder circumstances&para;<br>manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human&para;<br>life.” Ark. Code Ann. §5–10–101(a)(9)(A) (Supp. 2011).&para;<br>The defense, in contrast, portrayed the death as the result of Blueford accidentally knocking McFadden onto the&para;<br>ground.&para;<br>The trial court instructed the jury that the charge of&para;<br>capital murder included three lesser offenses: first-degree&para;<br>murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. In addition to describing these offenses, the court addressed the&para;<br>order in which the jury was to consider them: “If you have&para;<br>a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt on the charge&para;<br>of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder&para;<br>in the first degree. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of&para;<br>the defendant’s guilt on the charge of murder in the first&para;<br>degree, you will then consider the charge of manslaughter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s&para;<br>guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.” App. 51–52.&para;<br>The prosecution commented on these instructions in its&para;<br>closing argument. It told the jury, for example, that “before you can consider a lesser included of capital murder,&para;<br>you must first, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of&para;<br>capital murder.” Id., at 55. The prosecution explained&para;<br>that this was “not a situation where you just lay everything out here and say, well, we have four choices. Which&para;<br>one does it fit the most?” Id., at 59. Rather, the prosecution emphasized, “unless all 12 of you agree that this&para;<br>man’s actions were not consistent with capital murder,&para;<br>then and only then would you go down to murder in the&para;<br>first degree.” Ibid.&para;<br>After the parties concluded their arguments, the court&para;<br>presented the jury with a set of five verdict forms, each&para;<br>representing a possible verdict. There were four separate&para;<br>forms allowing the jury to convict on each of the charged&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>offenses: capital murder, first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. A fifth form allowed the jury&para;<br>to return a verdict of acquittal, if the jury found Blueford&para;<br>not guilty of any offense. There was no form allowing the&para;<br>jury to acquit on some offenses but not others. As stated&para;<br>in the court’s instructions, the jury could either “find the&para;<br>defendant guilty of one of these offenses” or “acquit him&para;<br>outright.” Id., at 51. Any verdict—whether to convict on&para;<br>one or to acquit on all—had to be unanimous.&para;<br>A few hours after beginning its deliberations, the jury&para;<br>sent the court a note asking “what happens if we cannot&para;<br>agree on a charge at all.” Id., at 62. The court called the&para;<br>jury back into the courtroom and issued a so-called “Allen&para;<br>instruction,” emphasizing the importance of reaching a verdict. See Allen v. United States, 164 U. S. 492, 501–502&para;<br>(1896). The jury then deliberated for a half hour more&para;<br>before sending out a second note, stating that it “cannot&para;<br>agree on any one charge in this case.” App. 64. When the&para;<br>court summoned the jury again, the jury foreperson reported that the jury was “hopelessly” deadlocked. Ibid.&para;<br>The court asked the foreperson to disclose the jury’s votes&para;<br>on each offense:&para;<br>“THE COURT: All right. If you have your numbers&para;<br>together, and I don’t want names, but if you have your&para;<br>numbers I would like to know what your count was on&para;<br>capital murder.&para;<br>“JUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous&para;<br>against that. No.&para;<br>“THE COURT: Okay, on murder in the first degree?&para;<br>“JUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous&para;<br>against that.&para;<br>“THE COURT: Okay. Manslaughter?&para;<br>“JUROR NUMBER ONE: Nine for, three against.&para;<br>“THE COURT: Okay. And negligent homicide?&para;<br>“JUROR NUMBER ONE: We did not vote on that,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sir.&para;<br>“THE COURT: Did not vote on that.&para;<br>“JUROR NUMBER ONE: No, sir. We couldn’t get&para;<br>past the manslaughter. Were we supposed to go past&para;<br>that? I thought we were supposed to go one at a&para;<br>time.” Id., at 64–65.&para;<br>Following this exchange, the court gave another Allen&para;<br>instruction and sent the jurors back to the jury room.&para;<br>After deliberations resumed, Blueford’s counsel asked the&para;<br>court to submit new verdict forms to the jurors, to be&para;<br>completed “for those counts that they have reached a&para;<br>verdict on.” Id., at 67. The prosecution objected on the&para;<br>grounds that the jury was “still deliberating” and that a&para;<br>verdict of acquittal had to be “all or nothing.” Id., at 68.&para;<br>The court denied Blueford’s request. To allow for a partial&para;<br>verdict, the court explained, would be “like changing&para;<br>horses in the middle of the stream,” given that the jury&para;<br>had already received instructions and verdict forms. Ibid.&para;<br>The court informed counsel that it would declare a mistrial “if the jury doesn’t make a decision.” Id., at 69.&para;<br>When the jury returned a half hour later, the foreperson&para;<br>stated that they had not reached a verdict. The court&para;<br>declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.&para;<br>The State subsequently sought to retry Blueford. He&para;<br>moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder&para;<br>charges on double jeopardy grounds, citing the foreperson’s report that the jurors had voted unanimously against&para;<br>guilt on those offenses. The trial court denied the motion,&para;<br>and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal. According to the State Supreme Court, the&para;<br>foreperson’s report had no effect on the State’s ability to&para;<br>retry Blueford, because the foreperson “was not making a&para;<br>formal announcement of acquittal” when she disclosed the&para;<br>jury’s votes. 2011 Ark. 8, p. 9, ___ S. W. 3d ___, ___. This&para;<br>was not a case, the court observed, “where a formal verdict&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was announced or entered of record.” Ibid. The court&para;<br>added that the trial court did not err in denying Blueford’s&para;<br>request for new verdict forms that would have allowed the&para;<br>jury to render a partial verdict on the charges of capital&para;<br>and first-degree murder.&para;<br>Blueford sought review in this Court, and we granted&para;<br>certiorari. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person&para;<br>shall “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in&para;<br>jeopardy of life or limb.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The&para;<br>Clause “guarantees that the State shall not be permitted&para;<br>to make repeated attempts to convict the accused, thereby&para;<br>subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and&para;<br>compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and&para;<br>insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even&para;<br>though innocent he may be found guilty.” United States v.&para;<br>Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 569 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Blueford contends that the foreperson’s report means&para;<br>that he cannot be tried again on charges of capital and&para;<br>first-degree murder. According to Blueford, the Double&para;<br>Jeopardy Clause prohibits a second trial on those charges,&para;<br>for two reasons.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Blueford’s primary submission is that he cannot be&para;<br>retried for capital and first-degree murder because the&para;<br>jury actually acquitted him of those offenses. See Green v.&para;<br>United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957). The Arkansas&para;<br>Supreme Court noted—and Blueford acknowledges—that&para;<br>no formal judgment of acquittal was entered in his case.&para;<br>But none was necessary, Blueford maintains, because an&para;<br>acquittal is a matter of substance, not form. Quoting from&para;<br>our decision in Martin Linen, supra, at 571, Blueford&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>contends that despite the absence of a formal verdict, a&para;<br>jury’s announcement constitutes an acquittal if it “ ‘actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of the factual&para;<br>elements of the offense charged.’ ” Brief for Petitioner 21.&para;<br>Here, according to Blueford, the foreperson’s announcement of the jury’s unanimous votes on capital and firstdegree murder represented just that: a resolution of some&para;<br>or all of the elements of those offenses in Blueford’s favor.&para;<br>We disagree. The foreperson’s report was not a final&para;<br>resolution of anything. When the foreperson told the court&para;<br>how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury’s deliberations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back&para;<br>to the jury room to deliberate further, even after the foreperson had delivered her report. When they emerged a&para;<br>half hour later, the foreperson stated only that they were&para;<br>unable to reach a verdict. She gave no indication whether&para;<br>it was still the case that all 12 jurors believed Blueford&para;<br>was not guilty of capital or first-degree murder, that 9 of&para;<br>them believed he was guilty of manslaughter, or that a&para;<br>vote had not been taken on negligent homicide. The fact&para;<br>that deliberations continued after the report deprives that&para;<br>report of the finality necessary to constitute an acquittal&para;<br>on the murder offenses.&para;<br>Blueford maintains, however, that any possibility that&para;<br>the jurors revisited the murder offenses was foreclosed by&para;<br>the instructions given to the jury. Those instructions, he&para;<br>contends, not only required the jury to consider the offenses in order, from greater to lesser, but also prevented&para;<br>it from transitioning from one offense to the next without unanimously—and definitively—resolving the greater&para;<br>offense in his favor. “A jury is presumed to follow its&para;<br>instructions.” Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234&para;<br>(2000). So, Blueford says, the foreperson’s report that the&para;<br>jury was deadlocked on manslaughter necessarily establishes that the jury had acquitted Blueford of the greater&para;<br>offenses of capital and first-degree murder.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>But even if we assume that the instructions required a&para;<br>unanimous vote before the jury could consider a lesser&para;<br>offense—as the State assumes for purposes of this case,&para;<br>see Brief for Respondent 25, n. 3—nothing in the instructions prohibited the jury from reconsidering such a vote.&para;<br>The instructions said simply, “If you have a reasonable&para;<br>doubt of the defendant’s guilt on the charge of [the greater&para;<br>offense], you will [then] consider the charge of [the lesser&para;<br>offense].” App. 51–52. The jurors were never told that&para;<br>once they had a reasonable doubt, they could not rethink&para;<br>the issue. The jury was free to reconsider a greater offense, even after considering a lesser one.1&para;<br>A simple example illustrates the point. A jury enters&para;<br>the jury room, having just been given these instructions.&para;<br>The foreperson decides that it would make sense to determine the extent of the jurors’ agreement before discussions begin. Accordingly, she conducts a vote on capital&para;<br>murder, and everyone votes against guilt. She does the&para;<br>same for first-degree murder, and again, everyone votes&para;<br>against guilt. She then calls for a vote on manslaughter,&para;<br>and there is disagreement. Only then do the jurors engage in a discussion about the circumstances of the crime.&para;<br>While considering the arguments of the other jurors on&para;<br>how the death was caused, one of the jurors starts rethinking his own stance on a greater offense. After reflecting on&para;<br>the evidence, he comes to believe that the defendant did&para;<br>knowingly cause the death—satisfying the definition of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In reaching a contrary conclusion, post, at 6 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,&para;<br>J.), the dissent construes the jury instructions to “require a jury to&para;<br>complete its deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider a&para;<br>lesser,” post, at 3 (emphasis added). But no such requirement can be&para;<br>found in the text of the instructions themselves. And the dissent’s&para;<br>attempt to glean such a requirement from the Arkansas Supreme&para;<br>Court’s decision in Hughes v. State, 347 Ark. 696, 66 S. W. 3d 645&para;<br>(2002), is unavailing, for that decision nowhere addresses the issue&para;<br>here—whether a jury can reconsider a greater offense after considering&para;<br>a lesser one.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>first-degree murder. At that point, nothing in the instructions prohibits the jury from doing what juries often do:&para;<br>revisit a prior vote. “The very object of the jury system,”&para;<br>after all, “is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views,&para;<br>and by arguments among the jurors themselves.” Allen,&para;<br>164 U. S., at 501. A single juror’s change of mind is all it&para;<br>takes to require the jury to reconsider a greater offense.&para;<br>It was therefore possible for Blueford’s jury to revisit the&para;<br>offenses of capital and first-degree murder, notwithstanding its earlier votes. And because of that possibility, the&para;<br>foreperson’s report prior to the end of deliberations lacked&para;<br>the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those&para;<br>offenses, quite apart from any requirement that a formal&para;<br>verdict be returned or judgment entered.&para;<br>That same lack of finality undermines Blueford’s reliance on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and&para;<br>Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970). In those cases, we&para;<br>held that the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when&para;<br>a defendant, tried for a greater offense and convicted of&para;<br>a lesser included offense, is later retried for the greater&para;<br>offense. See Green, supra, at 190; Price, supra, at 329.&para;<br>Blueford argues that the only fact distinguishing his case&para;<br>from Green and Price is that his case involves a deadlock&para;<br>on the lesser included offense, as opposed to a conviction.&para;<br>In his view, that distinction only favors him, because the&para;<br>Double Jeopardy Clause should, if anything, afford greater&para;<br>protection to a defendant who is not found guilty of the&para;<br>lesser included offense.&para;<br>Blueford’s argument assumes, however, that the votes&para;<br>reported by the foreperson did not change, even though&para;<br>the jury deliberated further after that report. That assumption is unjustified, because the reported votes were,&para;<br>for the reasons noted, not final. Blueford thus overlooks&para;<br>the real distinction between the cases: In Green and Price,&para;<br>the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report&para;<br>of the foreperson was not.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Blueford acknowledges that a trial&para;<br>can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for&para;<br>the same offense when “particular circumstances manifest&para;<br>a necessity” to declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336&para;<br>U. S. 684, 690 (1949); see also United States v. Perez, 9&para;<br>Wheat. 579, 580 (1824).

Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 509 (1978).&para;<br>Blueford therefore accepts that a second trial on manslaughter and negligent homicide would pose no double&para;<br>jeopardy problem. He contends, however, that there was&para;<br>no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree&para;<br>murder, given the foreperson’s report that the jury had&para;<br>voted unanimously against guilt on those charges. According to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken&para;<br>“some action,” whether through partial verdict forms or&para;<br>other means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes,&para;<br>and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining&para;<br>charges.

Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503 (1978). To implement this rule, our&para;<br>cases have articulated two principles. First, an acquittal&para;<br>occurs if a jury’s decision, “whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the&para;<br>factual elements of the offense charged.” United States v.&para;<br>Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571 (1977). Second, a trial judge may not defeat a defendant’s entitlement&para;<br>to “the verdict of a tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed to his fate” by declaring a mistrial before&para;<br>deliberations end, absent a defendant’s consent or a&para;<br>“ ‘manifest necessity’ ” to do so. United States v. Jorn, 400&para;<br>U. S. 470, 486, 481 (1971) (plurality opinion) (quoting&para;<br>United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824)).&para;<br>Today’s decision misapplies these longstanding principles. The Court holds that petitioner Alex Blueford&para;<br>was not acquitted of capital or first-degree murder, even&para;<br>though the forewoman of the Arkansas jury empaneled to&para;<br>try him announced in open court that the jury was “unanimous against” convicting Blueford of those crimes.

ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to those offenses. The Court thus grants the State what&para;<br>the Constitution withholds: “the proverbial ‘second bite at&para;<br>the apple.’ ” Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 17 (1978).&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The bar on retrials following acquittals is “the most&para;<br>fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence.” Martin Linen, 430 U.

This prohibition stops the State, “with all its&para;<br>resources and power,” from mounting abusive, harassing&para;<br>reprosecutions, Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187&para;<br>(1957), which subject a defendant to “embarrassment,&para;<br>expense, anxiety, and insecurity, and the possibility that&para;<br>he may be found guilty even though innocent,” United&para;<br>States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 136 (1980).&para;<br>In ascertaining whether an acquittal has occurred,&para;<br>“form is not to be exalted over substance.” Sanabria v.&para;<br>United States, 437 U.

S. 462, 468 (2005). Jurisdictions have different procedures respecting the announcement of verdicts and the entry of judgments, but&para;<br>that diversity has no constitutional significance. Jeopardy&para;<br>terminates upon a determination, however characterized,&para;<br>that the “evidence is insufficient” to prove a defendant’s&para;<br>“factual guilt.” Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140, 144&para;<br>(1986). Thus, we have treated as acquittals a trial judge’s&para;<br>directed verdict of not guilty, Smith, 543 U. S., at 468; an&para;<br>appellate reversal of a conviction for insufficiency of the&para;<br>evidence, Burks, 437 U.

Arkansas is a classic “acquittal-first”&para;<br>or “hard-transition” jurisdiction. See generally People v.&para;<br>Richardson, 184 P. 3d 755, 764, n. 7 (Colo. 2008). Arkansas’ model jury instructions require a jury to complete its&para;<br>deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider&para;<br>a lesser. 1 Ark. Model Jury Instr., Crim., No. 302 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1994). As a matter of Arkansas law, “[b]efore it may&para;<br>consider any lesser-included offense, the jury must first&para;<br>determine that the proof is insufficient to convict on the&para;<br>greater offense. Thus, the jury must, in essence, acquit&para;<br>the defendant of the greater offense before considering his&para;<br>or her guilt on the lesser-included offense.” Hughes v.&para;<br>State, 347 Ark. 696, 706–707, 66 S. W. 3d 645, 651 (2002).1&para;<br>Here, the trial judge instructed Blueford’s jury to consider the offenses in order, from the charged offense of&para;<br>capital murder to the lesser included offenses of firstdegree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.&para;<br>The judge told the jury to proceed past capital murder only&para;<br>upon a unanimous finding of a “reasonable doubt” as to&para;<br>that offense—that is, upon an acquittal. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 363 (1970). The State’s closing arguments repeated this directive: “[B]efore you can consider a&para;<br>lesser included of capital murder, you must first, all 12,&para;<br>vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.” App.&para;<br>55. And the forewoman’s colloquy with the judge leaves no&para;<br>doubt that the jury understood the instructions to mandate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser: The forewoman&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>State has taken the same position. See Brief for Appellee in&para;<br>Boyd v. State, No. CR 06–973 (Ark.), p. 13 (“[U]nanimity is the essence&para;<br>of a jury verdict as it pertains to acquitting a defendant of the charged&para;<br>offense and the subsequent consideration of lesser-included offenses”).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>reported that the jury had not voted on negligent homicide&para;<br>because the jurors “couldn’t get past the manslaughter”&para;<br>count on which they were deadlocked. Id., at 65.&para;<br>In this context, the forewoman’s announcement in open&para;<br>court that the jury was “unanimous against” conviction on&para;<br>capital and first-degree murder, id., at 64–65, was an&para;<br>acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.2 Per Arkansas&para;<br>law, the jury’s determination of reasonable doubt as to&para;<br>those offenses was an acquittal “in essence.” Hughes, 347&para;<br>Ark., at 707, 66 S. W. 3d, at 651. By deciding that the&para;<br>State “had failed to come forward with sufficient proof,”&para;<br>the jury resolved the charges of capital and first-degree&para;<br>murder adversely to the State. Burks, 437 U. S., at 10.&para;<br>That acquittal cannot be reconsidered without putting&para;<br>Blueford twice in jeopardy.&para;<br>Green and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970), bolster&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The jury’s acquittals on the murder counts were unsurprising in&para;<br>light of the deficiencies in the State’s case. For example, Dr. Adam&para;<br>Craig—the medical examiner who autopsied the victim, Matthew&para;<br>McFadden, Jr., and whose testimony was essential to the State’s theory&para;<br>of the crime—was not board certified in anatomical pathology, having failed the certification examination five times. Dr. Craig took only&para;<br>2 slides of Matthew’s brain, not the 10 to 20 called for by prevailing professional standards. He dismissed Blueford’s explanation for&para;<br>Matthew’s death—that Blueford accidentally knocked Matthew to the&para;<br>floor—on the basis of an outdated paper on child head injuries, acknowledging that he was only “vaguely aware” of a more recent, seminal paper that supported Blueford’s account. Record 390; see Goldsmith &amp; Plunkett, A Biomechanical Analysis of the Causes of&para;<br>Traumatic Brain Injury in Infants and Children, 25 Am. J. Forensic&para;<br>Med. &amp; Pathology 89 (2004). Blueford’s expert pathologist, Dr. Robert&para;<br>Bux, testified that Dr. Craig’s autopsy was inadequate to establish&para;<br>whether Matthew’s death was accidental or intentional. And Blueford’s expert pediatrician, Dr. John Galaznik, testified that the State’s&para;<br>theory—that Blueford slammed Matthew into a mattress on the floor—&para;<br>was “not a likely cause” of the boy’s injuries when assessed in view of&para;<br>current medical literature. Record 766. Even the trial judge observed&para;<br>that the State’s proof was “circumstantial at best,” and that this was&para;<br>“probably . . . a lesser included offense case.” Id., at 610.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that conclusion. In Green, the jury convicted the defendant on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder&para;<br>without returning a verdict on the charged offense of firstdegree murder. This Court concluded that this result was&para;<br>an “implicit acquittal” on the greater offense of firstdegree murder, barring retrial. 355 U. S., at 190. The&para;<br>defendant “was forced to run the gantlet once on that&para;<br>charge and the jury refused to convict him. When given&para;<br>the choice between finding him guilty of either first or&para;<br>second degree murder it chose the latter.” Ibid.; see also&para;<br>Price, 398 U. S., at 329 (“[T]his Court has consistently&para;<br>refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after&para;<br>an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied&para;<br>by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the&para;<br>jury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on&para;<br>the greater charge” (footnote omitted)). Notably, Green&para;<br>acknowledged that its finding of an “implicit acquittal”&para;<br>was an “assumption,” because the jury had made no express statement with respect to the greater offense. 355&para;<br>U. S., at 190–191.&para;<br>Blueford’s position is even stronger because his jury was&para;<br>not silent on the murder counts, but announced that it&para;<br>was “unanimous against” conviction. And the trial judge&para;<br>specifically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter&para;<br>only after acquitting Blueford of the murder counts.&para;<br>Courts in several acquittal-first jurisdictions have held&para;<br>that a jury’s deadlock on a lesser included offense justifies&para;<br>the assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater&para;<br>offenses. See State v. Tate, 256 Conn. 262, 283–285, 773&para;<br>A. 2d. 308, 323–324 (2001); Stone v.

That assumption is not even necessary&para;<br>here because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The majority holds that the forewoman’s announcement&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was not an acquittal because it “was not a final resolution&para;<br>of anything.” Ante, at 6. In the majority’s view, the jury&para;<br>might have revisited its decisions on the murder counts&para;<br>during the 31 minutes of deliberations that followed the&para;<br>forewoman’s announcement. We cannot know whether&para;<br>the jury did so, the majority reasons, because the jury was&para;<br>discharged without confirming that it remained “unanimous against” convicting Blueford of capital and firstdegree murder. Ante, at 6–8.3&para;<br>Putting to one side the lack of record evidence to support&para;<br>this speculation—by far the more plausible inference is&para;<br>that the jurors spent those 31 minutes attempting to&para;<br>resolve their deadlock on manslaughter—I do not agree&para;<br>that the jury was free to reconsider its decisions when&para;<br>its deliberations resumed. “A verdict of acquittal on the&para;<br>issue of guilt or innocence is, of course, absolutely final.”&para;<br>Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430, 445 (1981). The&para;<br>jury heard instructions and argument that it was required&para;<br>unanimously to acquit on capital and first-degree murder&para;<br>before it could reach manslaughter. And as the forewoman’s colloquy makes plain, the jury followed those instructions scrupulously. There is no reason to believe that the&para;<br>jury’s vote was anything other than a verdict in substance—that is, a “final collective decision . . . reached&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 This Court granted certiorari to decide “[w]hether, if a jury deadlocks on a lesser-included offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars&para;<br>reprosecution of a greater offense after a jury announces that it has&para;<br>voted against guilt on the greater offense.” Pet. for Cert. i. The majority resolves the question presented by determining that the forewoman’s&para;<br>announcements were not final, such that Blueford’s jury did not necessarily deadlock on the lesser included offense of manslaughter. See&para;<br>ante, at 8–9, n. 2. In light of that determination, I do not read today’s&para;<br>opinion to express any view with respect to the requirements of the&para;<br>Double Jeopardy Clause where a jury does deadlock on a lesser included offense. Cf., e.g., State v. Tate, 256 Conn. 262, 284–285, 773&para;<br>A. 2d 308, 324–325 (2001); Whiteaker v. State, 808 P. 2d 270, 274&para;<br>(Alaska App. 1991).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>after full deliberation, consideration, and compromise&para;<br>among the individual jurors.” Harrison v. Gillespie, 640&para;<br>F. 3d 888, 906 (CA9 2011) (en banc). And when that decision was announced in open court, it became entitled to&para;<br>full double jeopardy protection. See, e.g., Commonwealth&para;<br>v. Roth, 437 Mass. 777, 796, 776 N. E. 2d 437, 450–451&para;<br>(2002) (declining to give effect to “ ‘ “the verdict received&para;<br>from the lips of the foreman in open court” ’ ” would “elevate form over substance”); Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511, 646&para;<br>P. 2d, at 814–815 (“[I]n determining what verdict, if any, a&para;<br>jury intended to return, the oral declaration of the jurors&para;<br>endorsing the result is the true return of the verdict”&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)); see also, e.g., Dixon v.&para;<br>State, 29 Ark. 165, 171 (1874) (technical defect in verdict&para;<br>“is of no consequence whatever, for the verdict need not be&para;<br>in writing, but may be announced by the foreman of the&para;<br>jury orally”); State v. Mills, 19 Ark. 476 (1858) (“The verdict was of no validity until delivered, by the jury, in&para;<br>Court”).&para;<br>The majority’s example of a jury that takes a preliminary vote on greater offenses, advances to the consideration of a lesser, and then returns to a greater, is inapposite.&para;<br>See ante, at 7. In the majority’s example, the jury has&para;<br>not announced its vote in open court. Moreover, the&para;<br>instructions in this case did not contemplate that the&para;<br>jury’s deliberations could take the course that the majority&para;<br>imagines. Arkansas’ model instruction requires acquittal&para;<br>as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense, and&para;<br>the Double Jeopardy Clause entitles an acquittal to finality. Indeed, the purpose of an acquittal-first instruction is&para;<br>to ensure careful and conclusive deliberation on a greater&para;<br>offense. See United States v. Tsanas, 572 F. 2d 340, 346&para;<br>(CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.) (acquittal-first instruction avoids&para;<br>“the danger that the jury will not adequately discharge its&para;<br>duties with respect to the greater offense, and instead will&para;<br>move too quickly to the lesser”). True, Arkansas’ instruc-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion does not expressly forbid reconsideration, but it does&para;<br>not expressly permit reconsideration either. In any event,&para;<br>nothing indicates that the jury’s announced decisions were&para;<br>tentative, compromises, or mere steps en route to a final&para;<br>verdict, and the Double Jeopardy Clause demands that&para;<br>ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant. See&para;<br>Downum v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 738 (1963).&para;<br>The fact that the jury was not given the express option&para;<br>of acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant. See ante,&para;<br>at 3, 9. Arkansas law ascribes no significance to the presence of such options on a verdict form. See Rowland v.&para;<br>State, 263 Ark. 77, 85, 562 S. W. 2d 590, 594 (1978) (“The&para;<br>jury may prepare and present its own form of verdict”).&para;<br>The lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a&para;<br>judgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of&para;<br>an acquittal for constitutional purposes. See Hudson v.&para;<br>Louisiana, 450 U. S. 40, 41, n. 1 (1981).&para;<br>Finally, the majority’s distinction of Green and Price is&para;<br>unavailing. The majority observes that Green and Price,&para;<br>unlike this case, involved final decisions. Ante, at 8. As I&para;<br>have explained, I view the forewoman’s announcements of&para;<br>acquittal in this case as similarly final. In any event,&para;<br>Green clarified that the defendant’s “claim of former jeopardy” was “not based on his previous conviction for second&para;<br>degree murder but instead on the original jury’s refusal to&para;<br>convict him of first degree murder.” 355 U. S., at 190,&para;<br>n. 11; accord, id., at 194, n. 14. That is, the jury’s silence&para;<br>on the greater offense spoke with sufficient clarity to&para;<br>justify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 191; see also Price, 398 U. S.,&para;<br>at 329. In light of the forewoman’s announcement, this is&para;<br>an a fortiori case.&para;<br>In short, the Double Jeopardy Clause demands an inquiry into the substance of the jury’s actions. Blueford’s&para;<br>jury had the option to convict him of capital and firstdegree murder, but expressly declined to do so. That&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ought to be the end of the matter.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Even if the majority were correct that the jury might&para;<br>have reconsidered an acquitted count—a doubtful assumption for the reasons just explained—that would not defeat&para;<br>Blueford’s double jeopardy claim. It “has been long established as an integral part of double jeopardy jurisprudence” that “a defendant could be put in jeopardy even in&para;<br>a prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an&para;<br>acquittal.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 34 (1978). This&para;<br>rule evolved in response to the “abhorrent” practice under&para;<br>the Stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions, and&para;<br>thereby evading the bar on retrials, when it appeared that&para;<br>the Crown’s proof might be insufficient. Washington, 434&para;<br>U. S., at 507; see, e.g., Ireland’s Case, 7 How. St. Tr. 79,&para;<br>120 (1678). Accordingly, retrial is barred if a jury is discharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant&para;<br>consents or there is a “manifest necessity” for the discharge. Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580; see also King v. Perkins,&para;<br>90 Eng. Rep. 1122 (K. B. 1698).&para;<br>In Perez, this Court explained that “manifest necessity”&para;<br>is a high bar: “[T]he power ought to be used with the&para;<br>greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very&para;<br>plain and obvious causes.” 9 Wheat., at 580. Since Perez,&para;<br>this Court has not relaxed the showing required. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Washington, 434 U. S., at 506 (requiring a “ ‘high degree’ ”&para;<br>of necessity); Downum, 372 U. S., at 736 (“imperious&para;<br>necessity”); see also, e.g., United States v. Coolidge, 25&para;<br>F. Cas. 622, 623 (No. 14,858) (CC Mass. 1815) (Story, J.)&para;<br>(“extraordinary and striking circumstances”). Before declaring a mistrial, therefore, a trial judge must weigh&para;<br>heavily a “defendant’s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.” Wade v. Hunter, 336&para;<br>U. S. 684, 689 (1949). And in light of the historical abuses&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>against which the Double Jeopardy Clause guards, a trial&para;<br>judge must tread with special care where a mistrial would&para;<br>“help the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is going&para;<br>badly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity&para;<br>to convict the accused.” Gori v. United States, 367 U. S.&para;<br>364, 369 (1961); see Green, 355 U. S., at 188.&para;<br>A jury’s genuine inability to reach a verdict constitutes&para;<br>manifest necessity. But in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, a&para;<br>jury that advances to the consideration of a lesser included&para;<br>offense has not demonstrated an inability to decide a defendant’s guilt or innocence on a greater—it has acquitted on the greater. Under Green, that is unquestionably&para;<br>true if the jury convicts on the lesser. See id., at 189. It&para;<br>would be anomalous if the Double Jeopardy Clause offered&para;<br>less protection to a defendant whose jury has deadlocked&para;<br>on the lesser and thus convicted of nothing at all. See&para;<br>Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511–512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d, at 815, n. 5.&para;<br>I would therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause&para;<br>requires a trial judge, in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, to&para;<br>honor a defendant’s request for a partial verdict before&para;<br>declaring a mistrial on the ground of jury deadlock.&para;<br>Courts in acquittal-first jurisdictions have so held. See,&para;<br>e.g., Tate, 256 Conn., at 285–287, 773 A. 2d, at 324–325;&para;<br>Whiteaker v. State, 808 P. 2d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991);&para;<br>Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 519, 646 P. 2d, at 820; State v.&para;<br>Pugliese, 120 N. H. 728, 730, 422 A. 2d 1319, 1321 (1980)&para;<br>(per curiam); State v. Castrillo, 90 N. M. 608, 611, 566&para;<br>P. 2d 1146, 1149 (1977); see also N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law&para;<br>Ann. §310.70 (West 2002). Requiring a partial verdict in&para;<br>an acquittal-first jurisdiction ensures that the jurisdiction&para;<br>takes the bitter with the sweet. In general, an acquittalfirst instruction increases the likelihood of conviction on a&para;<br>greater offense. See People v. Boettcher, 69 N. Y. 2d 174,&para;<br>182, 505 N. E. 2d 594, 597 (1987). True, such an instruction may also result in deadlock on a greater, preventing a&para;<br>State “from obtaining a conviction on the lesser charge&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that would otherwise have been forthcoming and thus&para;<br>require the expense of a retrial.” Tsanas, 572 F. 2d, at&para;<br>346. But a State willing to incur that expense loses nothing by overcharging in an acquittal-first regime. At worst,&para;<br>the State enjoys a second opportunity to convict, “with the&para;<br>possibility that the earlier ‘trial run’ will strengthen the&para;<br>prosecution’s case.” Crist, 437 U. S., at 52 (Powell, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). If a State wants the benefits of requiring a&para;<br>jury to acquit before compromising, it should not be permitted to deprive a defendant of the corresponding benefits of having been acquitted. The Double Jeopardy Clause&para;<br>expressly prohibits that outcome.&para;<br>The majority observes that we “have never required a&para;<br>trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung&para;<br>jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the&para;<br>impasse—let alone to consider giving the jury new options&para;<br>for a verdict.” Ante, at 10 (citing Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)). That hands-off approach&para;<br>dilutes Perez beyond recognition. This Court has never&para;<br>excused a trial judge from exercising “scrupulous” care&para;<br>before discharging a jury. Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plurality opinion). Rather, we have insisted that a trial judge&para;<br>may not act “irrationally,” “irresponsibly,” or “precipitately.” Washington, 434 U. S., at 514–515. Nor have we&para;<br>retreated from the rule that “reviewing courts have an&para;<br>obligation to ensure themselves that . . . the trial judge&para;<br>exercised ‘sound discretion’ in declaring a mistrial.” Id., at&para;<br>514 (quoting Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580).4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority’s reliance on Renico, a habeas corpus case decided&para;<br>under the deferential standard of review prescribed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), is perplexing.&para;<br>As Renico made clear, the question there was “not whether the trial&para;<br>judge should have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it was an&para;<br>abuse of discretion for her to have done so—the applicable standard on&para;<br>direct review. The question under AEDPA is instead whether the&para;<br>determination of the Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>Even if the Double Jeopardy Clause did not compel that&para;<br>broader rule, the facts of this case confirm that there was&para;<br>no necessity, let alone manifest necessity, for a mistrial.&para;<br>There was no reason for the judge not to have asked the&para;<br>jury, prior to discharge, whether it remained “unanimous&para;<br>against” conviction on capital and first-degree murder.&para;<br>There would have been no intrusion on the jury’s deliberative process. The judge was not required to issue new&para;<br>instructions or verdict forms, allow new arguments, direct&para;<br>further deliberations, or take any other action that might&para;<br>have threatened to coerce the jury. Merely repeating his&para;<br>earlier question would have sufficed. Because the judge&para;<br>failed to take even this modest step—or indeed, to explore&para;<br>any alternatives to a mistrial, or even to make an on-therecord finding of manifest necessity—I conclude that there&para;<br>was an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., id., at 486; see also&para;<br>Washington, 434 U. S., at 525 (Marshall, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(manifest necessity requires showing “that there were no&para;<br>meaningful and practical alternatives to a mistrial, or&para;<br>that the trial court scrupulously considered available alternatives and found all wanting but a termination of the&para;<br>proceedings”).&para;<br>Indeed, the only reason I can divine for the judge’s&para;<br>failure to take this modest step is his misperception of&para;<br>Arkansas law with respect to the transitional instruction.&para;<br>After the colloquy with the forewoman, the judge commented at sidebar that the jurors “haven’t even taken a&para;<br>vote on [negligent homicide]. . . . I don’t think they’ve&para;<br>completed their deliberation. . . . I mean, under any rea——————&para;<br>of discretion was ‘an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established&para;<br>Federal law.’ ” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1)); accord, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 11, n. 3). Renico&para;<br>thus has little to say about a trial judge’s responsibilities, or this&para;<br>Court’s, on direct review. Cf. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 30–31).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sonable circumstances, they would at least take a vote&para;<br>on negligent homicide.” App. 65–66. And after the jury&para;<br>retired for the last half-hour of deliberations, the judge&para;<br>said, “I don’t think they have an understanding of really&para;<br>that they don’t have to get past every charge unanimously&para;<br>before they can move to the next charge.” Id., at 69. That&para;<br>misstated Arkansas law as well as the judge’s own instructions. The jury was required to reach a unanimous&para;<br>decision on a greater offense before considering a lesser.&para;<br>See supra, at 2–3. In discharging the jury, the judge said,&para;<br>“Madam Foreman, there seems to be a lot of confusion on&para;<br>the part . . . of the jury about some of the instructions.&para;<br>And because of the confusion and because of the timeliness&para;<br>and the amount of hours that has gone by without being&para;<br>able to reach a verdict, the Court is going to declare a&para;<br>mistrial.” App. 69–70.&para;<br>If, as these comments suggest, the judge wrongly believed that the jury was not required to reach unanimity&para;<br>on a greater offense before considering a lesser, then he&para;<br>accorded insufficient finality and weight to the forewoman’s earlier announcement of acquittal on capital and firstdegree murder. That mistake of law negates the deference&para;<br>due the judge’s decision to declare a mistrial. The judge&para;<br>explained that the jury was being discharged in part based&para;<br>on its “confusion” with respect to the instructions, when in&para;<br>fact, the confusion was the judge’s. Ibid.; see, e.g., Washington, 434 U. S., at 510, n. 28 (“If the record reveals that&para;<br>the trial judge has failed to exercise the ‘sound discretion’&para;<br>entrusted to him, the reason for . . . deference by an appellate court disappears”); Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S.&para;<br>458, 469 (1973) (critiquing “erratic” mistrial inquiry); Gori,&para;<br>367 U. S., at 371, n. 3 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (noting that&para;<br>“[i]n state cases, a second prosecution has been barred&para;<br>where the jury was discharged through the trial judge’s&para;<br>misconstruction of the law,” and collecting cases). And a&para;<br>trial court “by definition abuses its discretion when it&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>makes an error of law.” Koon v. United States, 518 U. S.&para;<br>81, 100 (1996).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>At its core, the Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the&para;<br>wisdom of the founding generation, familiar to “ ‘every&para;<br>person acquainted with the history of governments,’ ” that&para;<br>“ ‘state trials have been employed as a formidable engine&para;<br>in the hands of a dominant administration. . . . To prevent&para;<br>this mischief the ancient common law . . . provided that&para;<br>one acquittal or conviction should satisfy the law.’ ” Ex&para;<br>parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 171 (1874) (quoting Commonwealth v. Olds, 15 Ky. 137, 139 (1824)). The Double Jeopardy Clause was enacted “ ‘[t]o perpetuate this wise rule,&para;<br>so favorable and necessary to the liberty of the citizen&para;<br>in a government like ours.’ ” 18 Wall., at 171. This case&para;<br>demonstrates that the threat to individual freedom from&para;<br>reprosecutions that favor States and unfairly rescue them&para;<br>from weak cases has not waned with time. Only this&para;<br>Court’s vigilance has.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
