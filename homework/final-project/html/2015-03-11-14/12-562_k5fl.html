Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–562.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 9, 2013—Decided December 3, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Gary Woods and his employer, Billy Joe McCombs, participated in an offsetting-option tax shelter designed to generate large&para;<br>paper losses that they could use to reduce their taxable income. To&para;<br>that end, they purchased from Deutsche Bank a series of currencyoption spreads. Each spread was a package consisting of a long option, which Woods and McCombs purchased from Deutsche Bank and&para;<br>for which they paid a premium, and a short option, which Woods and&para;<br>McCombs sold to Deutsche Bank and for which they received a premium. Because the premium paid for the long option was largely offset by the premium received for the short option, the net cost of the&para;<br>package to Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost&para;<br>of the long option alone. Woods and McCombs contributed the&para;<br>spreads, along with cash, to two partnerships, which used the cash to&para;<br>purchase stock and currency. When calculating their basis in the&para;<br>partnership interests, Woods and McCombs considered only the long&para;<br>component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offsetting short&para;<br>component. As a result, when the partnerships’ assets were disposed&para;<br>of for modest gains, Woods and McCombs claimed huge losses. Although they had contributed roughly $3.2 million in cash and spreads&para;<br>to the partnerships, they claimed losses of more than $45 million.&para;<br>The Internal Revenue Service sent each partnership a Notice of&para;<br>Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, disregarding the&para;<br>partnerships for tax purposes and disallowing the related losses. It&para;<br>concluded that the partnerships were formed for the purpose of tax&para;<br>avoidance and thus lacked “economic substance,” i.e., they were&para;<br>shams. As there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes, the IRS&para;<br>determined that the partners could not claim a basis for their partnership interests greater than zero and that any resulting tax under-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>payments would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements. Woods sought judicial review. The District&para;<br>Court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams&para;<br>but that the valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply. The Fifth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The District Court had jurisdiction to determine whether the&para;<br>partnerships’ lack of economic substance could justify imposing a&para;<br>valuation-misstatement penalty on the partners. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(a) Because a partnership does not pay federal income taxes, its&para;<br>taxable income and losses pass through to the partners. Under the&para;<br>Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), the IRS&para;<br>initiates partnership-related tax proceedings at the partnership level&para;<br>to adjust “partnership items,” i.e., items relevant to the partnership&para;<br>as a whole. 26 U. S. C. §§6221, 6231(a)(3). Once the adjustments become final, the IRS may undertake further proceedings at the partner level to make any resulting “computational adjustments” in the&para;<br>tax liability of the individual partners.&para;<br>§§6230(a)(1)–(2), (c),&para;<br>6231(a)(6). Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>(b) Under TEFRA’s framework, a court in a partnership-level&para;<br>proceeding has jurisdiction to determine “the applicability of any&para;<br>penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.”&para;<br>§6226(f). A determination that a partnership lacks economic substance is such an adjustment. TEFRA authorizes courts in partnership-level proceedings to provisionally determine the applicability of&para;<br>any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership&para;<br>item, even though imposing the penalty requires a subsequent, partner-level proceeding. In that later proceeding, each partner may&para;<br>raise any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specifically. Applying those principles here, the District Court had jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the valuation-misstatement&para;<br>penalty. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>2. The valuation-misstatement penalty applies in this case.&para;<br>Pp. 11–16.&para;<br>(a) A penalty applies to the portion of any underpayment that is&para;<br>“attributable to” a “substantial” or “gross” “valuation misstatement,”&para;<br>which exists where “the value of any property (or the adjusted basis&para;<br>of any property) claimed on any return of tax” exceeds by a specified&para;<br>percentage “the amount determined to be the correct amount of such&para;<br>valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).” §§6662(a), (b)(3),&para;<br>(e)(1)(A), (h). The penalty’s plain language makes it applicable here.&para;<br>Once the partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes, no&para;<br>partner could legitimately claim a basis in his partnership interest&para;<br>greater than zero. Any underpayment resulting from use of a non-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>zero basis would therefore be “attributable to” the partner’s having&para;<br>claimed an “adjusted basis” in the partnerships that exceeded “the&para;<br>correct amount of such . . . adjusted basis.” §6662(e)(1)(A). And under the relevant Treasury Regulation, when an asset’s adjusted basis&para;<br>is zero, a valuation misstatement is automatically deemed gross.&para;<br>Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(b) Woods’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive. The valuationmisstatement penalty encompasses misstatements that rest on legal&para;<br>as well as factual errors, so it is applicable to misstatements that rest&para;<br>on the use of a sham partnership. And the partnerships’ lack of economic substance is not an independent ground separate from the&para;<br>misstatement of basis in this case. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>471 Fed.

The Facts&para;<br>A&para;<br>This case involves an offsetting-option tax shelter, vari­&para;<br>ants of which were marketed to high-income taxpayers in&para;<br>the late 1990’s. Tax shelters of this type sought to gener­&para;<br>ate large paper losses that a taxpayer could use to reduce&para;<br>taxable income. They did so by attempting to give the tax­&para;<br>payer an artificially high basis in a partnership interest,&para;<br>which enabled the taxpayer to claim a significant tax loss&para;<br>upon disposition of the interest. See IRS Notice 2000–44,&para;<br>2000–2 Cum. Bull. 255 (describing offsetting-option tax&para;<br>shelters).&para;<br>The particular tax shelter at issue in this case was&para;<br>developed by the now-defunct law firm Jenkens &amp;&para;<br>Gilchrist and marketed by the accounting firm Ernst &amp;&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Young under the name “Current Options Bring Reward&para;<br>Alternatives,” or COBRA. Respondent Gary Woods and&para;<br>his employer, Billy Joe McCombs, agreed to participate in&para;<br>COBRA to reduce their tax liability for 1999. To that end,&para;<br>in November 1999 they created two general partnerships:&para;<br>one, Tesoro Drive Partners, to produce ordinary losses,&para;<br>and the other, SA Tesoro Investment Partners, to produce&para;<br>capital losses.&para;<br>Over the next two months, acting through their respec­&para;<br>tive wholly owned, limited liability companies, Woods and&para;<br>McCombs executed a series of transactions. First, they&para;<br>purchased from Deutsche Bank five 30-day currency­&para;<br>option spreads. Each of these option spreads was a pack­&para;<br>age consisting of a so-called long option, which entitled&para;<br>Woods and McCombs to receive a sum of money from&para;<br>Deutsche Bank if a certain currency exchange rate ex­&para;<br>ceeded a certain figure on a certain date, and a so-called&para;<br>short option, which entitled Deutsche Bank to receive a&para;<br>sum of money from Woods and McCombs if the exchange&para;<br>rate for the same currency on the same date exceeded a&para;<br>certain figure so close to the figure triggering the long&para;<br>option that both were likely to be triggered (or not to be&para;<br>triggered) on the fated date. Because the premium paid to&para;<br>Deutsche Bank for purchase of the long option was largely&para;<br>offset by the premium received from Deutsche Bank for&para;<br>sale of the short option, the net cost of the package to&para;<br>Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost&para;<br>of the long option alone. Specifically, the premiums paid&para;<br>for all five of the spreads’ long options totaled $46 million,&para;<br>and the premiums received for the five spreads’ short&para;<br>options totaled $43.7 million, so the net cost of the spreads&para;<br>was just $2.3 million. Woods and McCombs contributed&para;<br>the spreads to the partnerships along with about $900,000&para;<br>in cash. The partnerships used the cash to purchase&para;<br>assets—Canadian dollars for the partnership that sought&para;<br>to produce ordinary losses, and Sun Microsystems stock&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for the partnership that sought to produce capital losses.&para;<br>The partnerships then terminated the five option spreads&para;<br>in exchange for a lump-sum payment from Deutsche&para;<br>Bank.&para;<br>As the tax year drew to a close, Woods and McCombs&para;<br>transferred their interests in the partnerships to two S&para;<br>corporations. One corporation, Tesoro Drive Investors,&para;<br>Inc., received both partners’ interests in Tesoro Drive&para;<br>Partners; the other corporation, SA Tesoro Drive Inves­&para;<br>tors, Inc., received both partners’ interests in SA Tesoro&para;<br>Investment Partners. Since this left each partnership&para;<br>with only a single partner (the relevant S corporation), the&para;<br>partnerships were liquidated by operation of law, and&para;<br>their assets—the Canadian dollars and Sun Microsystems&para;<br>stock, plus the remaining cash—were deemed distributed&para;<br>to the corporations. The corporations then sold those&para;<br>assets for modest gains of about $2,000 on the Canadian&para;<br>dollars and about $57,000 on the stock. But instead of&para;<br>gains, the corporations reported huge losses: an ordinary&para;<br>loss of more than $13 million on the sale of the Canadian&para;<br>dollars and a capital loss of more than $32 million on the&para;<br>sale of the stock. The losses were allocated between&para;<br>Woods and McCombs as the corporations’ co-owners.&para;<br>The reason the corporations were able to claim such vast&para;<br>losses—the alchemy at the heart of an offsetting-options&para;<br>tax shelter—lay in how Woods and McCombs calculated&para;<br>the tax basis of their interests in the partnerships. Tax&para;<br>basis is the amount used as the cost of an asset when&para;<br>computing how much its owner gained or lost for tax&para;<br>purposes when disposing of it. See J. Downes &amp; J. Good­&para;<br>man, Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 736&para;<br>(2010). A partner’s tax basis in a partnership interest—&para;<br>called “outside basis” to distinguish it from “inside basis,”&para;<br>the partnership’s basis in its own assets—is tied to the&para;<br>value of any assets the partner contributed to acquire the&para;<br>interest. See 26 U. S. C. §722. Collectively, Woods and&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>McCombs contributed roughly $3.2 million in option&para;<br>spreads and cash to acquire their interests in the two&para;<br>partnerships. But for purposes of computing outside&para;<br>basis, Woods and McCombs considered only the long&para;<br>component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offset­&para;<br>ting short component on the theory that it was “too con­&para;<br>tingent” to count. Brief for Respondent 14. As a result,&para;<br>they claimed a total adjusted outside basis of more than&para;<br>$48 million. Since the basis of property distributed to a&para;<br>partner by a liquidating partnership is equal to the ad­&para;<br>justed basis of the partner’s interest in the partnership&para;<br>(reduced by any cash distributed with the property), see&para;<br>§732(b), the inflated outside basis figure was carried over&para;<br>to the S corporations’ basis in the Canadian dollars and&para;<br>the stock, enabling the corporations to report enormous&para;<br>losses when those assets were sold. At the end of the day,&para;<br>Woods’ and McCombs’ $3.2 million investment generated&para;<br>tax losses that, if treated as valid, could have shielded&para;<br>more than $45 million of income from taxation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Internal Revenue Service, however, did not treat&para;<br>the COBRA-generated losses as valid. Instead, after&para;<br>auditing the partnerships’ tax returns, it issued to each&para;<br>partnership a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative&para;<br>Adjustment, or “FPAA.” In the FPAAs, the IRS deter­&para;<br>mined that the partnerships had been “formed and availed&para;<br>of solely for purposes of tax avoidance by artificially over­&para;<br>stating basis in the partnership interests of [the] purported&para;<br>partners.” App. 92, 146. Because the partnerships had&para;<br>“no business purpose other than tax avoidance,” the IRS&para;<br>said, they “lacked economic substance”—or, put more&para;<br>starkly, they were “sham[s]”—so the IRS would disregard&para;<br>them for tax purposes and disallow the related losses.&para;<br>Ibid. And because there were no valid partnerships for&para;<br>tax purposes, the IRS determined that the partners had&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“not established adjusted bases in their respective part­&para;<br>nership interests in an amount greater than zero,” id., at&para;<br>95, ¶7, 149, ¶7 so that any resulting tax underpayments&para;<br>would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valua­&para;<br>tion misstatements, see 26 U. S. C. §6662(b)(3).&para;<br>Woods, as the tax-matters partner for both partner­&para;<br>ships, sought judicial review of the FPAAs pursuant to&para;<br>§6226(a). The District Court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams but that the&para;<br>valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply. The Govern­&para;<br>ment appealed the decision on the penalty to the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. While the appeal was pend­&para;<br>ing, the Fifth Circuit held in a similar case that, under&para;<br>Circuit precedent, the valuation-misstatement penalty&para;<br>does not apply when the relevant transaction is disregarded&para;<br>for lacking economic substance.

United States, 598 F. 3d 1372, 1380 (CA&para;<br>Fed. 2010); Petaluma FX Partners, LLC v. Commissioner,&para;<br>591 F. 3d 649, 655–656 (CADC 2010), we ordered briefing&para;<br>on that question as well.&para;<br>II. District-Court Jurisdiction &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We begin with a brief explanation of the statutory&para;<br>scheme for dealing with partnership-related tax matters.&para;<br>A partnership does not pay federal income taxes; instead,&para;<br>its taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.&para;<br>26 U. S. C. §701. A partnership must report its tax items&para;<br>on an information return, §6031(a), and the partners must&para;<br>report their distributive shares of the partnership’s tax&para;<br>items on their own individual returns, §§702, 704.&para;<br>Before 1982, the IRS had no way of correcting errors on&para;<br>a partnership’s return in a single, unified proceeding.&para;<br>Instead, tax matters pertaining to all the members of a&para;<br>partnership were dealt with just like tax matters pertain­&para;<br>ing only to a single taxpayer: through deficiency proceed­&para;<br>ings at the individual-taxpayer level.&para;<br>See generally&para;<br>§§6211–6216 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). Deficiency proceed­&para;<br>ings require the IRS to issue a separate notice of deficien­&para;<br>cy to each taxpayer, §6212(a) (2006 ed.), who can file a&para;<br>petition in the Tax Court disputing the alleged deficiency&para;<br>before paying it, §6213(a). Having to use deficiency pro­&para;<br>ceedings for partnership-related tax matters led to du­&para;<br>plicative proceedings and the potential for inconsistent&para;<br>treatment of partners in the same partnership. Congress&para;<br>addressed those difficulties by enacting the Tax Treatment&para;<br>of Partnership Items Act of 1982, as Title IV of the Tax&para;<br>Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). 96&para;<br>Stat. 648 (codified as amended at 26 U. S. C. §§6221–6232&para;<br>(2006 ed. and Supp. V)).&para;<br>Under TEFRA, partnership-related tax matters are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>addressed in two stages. First, the IRS must initiate&para;<br>proceedings at the partnership level to adjust “partnership&para;<br>items,” those relevant to the partnership as a whole.&para;<br>§§6221, 6231(a)(3). It must issue an FPAA notifying the&para;<br>partners of any adjustments to partnership items,&para;<br>§6223(a)(2), and the partners may seek judicial review of&para;<br>those adjustments, §6226(a)–(b). Once the adjustments to&para;<br>partnership items have become final, the IRS may under­&para;<br>take further proceedings at the partner level to make any&para;<br>resulting “computational adjustments” in the tax liability&para;<br>of the individual partners. §6231(a)(6). Most computa­&para;<br>tional adjustments may be directly assessed against the&para;<br>partners, bypassing deficiency proceedings and permitting&para;<br>the partners to challenge the assessments only in post­&para;<br>payment refund actions. §6230(a)(1), (c). Deficiency&para;<br>proceedings are still required, however, for certain com­&para;<br>putational adjustments that are attributable to “affected&para;<br>items,” that is, items that are affected by (but are not&para;<br>themselves) partnership items.&para;<br>§§6230(a)(2)(A)(i),&para;<br>6231(a)(5).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Under the TEFRA framework, a court in a partnership­&para;<br>level proceeding like this one has jurisdiction to determine&para;<br>not just partnership items, but also “the applicability of&para;<br>any penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment to a part­&para;<br>nership item.” §6226(f). As both sides agree, a determina­&para;<br>tion that a partnership lacks economic substance is an&para;<br>adjustment to a partnership item. Thus, the jurisdictional&para;<br>question here boils down to whether the valuation­&para;<br>misstatement penalty “relates to” the determination that&para;<br>the partnerships Woods and McCombs created were&para;<br>shams.&para;<br>The Government’s theory of why the penalty was trig­&para;<br>gered is based on a straightforward relationship between&para;<br>the economic-substance determination and the penalty. In&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Government’s view, there can be no outside basis in a&para;<br>sham partnership (which, for tax purposes, does not exist),&para;<br>so any partner who underpaid his individual taxes by&para;<br>declaring an outside basis greater than zero committed a&para;<br>valuation misstatement. In other words, the penalty flows&para;<br>logically and inevitably from the economic-substance&para;<br>determination.&para;<br>Woods, however, argues that because outside basis is&para;<br>not a partnership item, but an affected item, a penalty&para;<br>that would rest on a misstatement of outside basis cannot&para;<br>be considered at the partnership level. He maintains, in&para;<br>short, that a penalty does not relate to a partnership-item&para;<br>adjustment if it “requires a partner-level determination,”&para;<br>regardless of “whether or not the penalty has a connection&para;<br>to a partnership item.” Brief for Respondent 27.&para;<br>Because §6226(f)’s “relates to” language is “essentially&para;<br>indeterminate,” we must resolve this dispute by looking to&para;<br>“the structure of [TEFRA] and its other provisions.” Maracich v. Spears, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). That&para;<br>inquiry makes clear that the District Court’s jurisdiction&para;<br>is not as narrow as Woods contends. Prohibiting courts in&para;<br>partnership-level proceedings from considering the ap­&para;<br>plicability of penalties that require partner-level inquiries&para;<br>would be inconsistent with the nature of the “applicabil­&para;<br>ity” determination that TEFRA requires.&para;<br>Under TEFRA’s two-stage structure, penalties for tax&para;<br>underpayment must be imposed at the partner level,&para;<br>because partnerships themselves pay no taxes. And im­&para;<br>posing a penalty always requires some determinations&para;<br>that can be made only at the partner level. Even where a&para;<br>partnership’s return contains significant errors, a partner&para;<br>may not have carried over those errors to his own return;&para;<br>or if he did, the errors may not have caused him to under­&para;<br>pay his taxes by a large enough amount to trigger the&para;<br>penalty; or if they did, the partner may nonetheless have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>acted in good faith with reasonable cause, which is a bar&para;<br>to the imposition of many penalties, see §6664(c)(1). None&para;<br>of those issues can be conclusively determined at the&para;<br>partnership level. Yet notwithstanding that every pen­&para;<br>alty must be imposed in partner-level proceedings after&para;<br>partner-level determinations, TEFRA provides that the&para;<br>applicability of some penalties must be determined at&para;<br>the partnership level. The applicability determination is&para;<br>therefore inherently provisional; it is always contingent&para;<br>upon determinations that the court in a partnership-level&para;<br>proceeding does not have jurisdiction to make. Barring&para;<br>partnership-level courts from considering the applicability&para;<br>of penalties that cannot be imposed without partner-level&para;<br>inquiries would render TEFRA’s authorization to consider&para;<br>some penalties at the partnership level meaningless.&para;<br>Other provisions of TEFRA confirm that conclusion.&para;<br>One requires the IRS to use deficiency proceedings for&para;<br>computational adjustments that rest on “affected items&para;<br>which require partner level determinations (other than&para;<br>penalties . . . that relate to adjustments to partnership&para;<br>items).” §6230(a)(2)(A)(i). Another states that while a&para;<br>partnership-level determination “concerning the applica­&para;<br>bility of any penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment&para;<br>to a partnership item” is “conclusive” in a subsequent re­&para;<br>fund action, that does not prevent the partner from “as­&para;<br>sert[ing] any partner level defenses that may apply.”&para;<br>§6230(c)(4). Both these provisions assume that a penalty can&para;<br>relate to a partnership-item adjustment even if the penalty&para;<br>cannot be imposed without additional, partner-level&para;<br>determinations.&para;<br>These considerations lead us to reject Woods’ interpreta­&para;<br>tion of §6226(f). We hold that TEFRA gives courts in&para;<br>partnership-level proceedings jurisdiction to determine the&para;<br>applicability of any penalty that could result from an&para;<br>adjustment to a partnership item, even if imposing the&para;<br>penalty would also require determining affected or non­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>partnership items such as outside basis.

Applicability of Valuation-Misstatement Penalty&para;<br>A&para;<br>Taxpayers who underpay their taxes due to a “valuation&para;<br>misstatement” may incur an accuracy-related penalty. A&para;<br>20-percent penalty applies to “the portion of any under­&para;<br>payment which is attributable to . . . [a]ny substantial&para;<br>valuation misstatement under chapter 1.” 26 U. S. C.&para;<br>§6662(a), (b)(3). Under the version of the penalty statute&para;<br>in effect when the transactions at issue here occurred,&para;<br>“there is a substantial valuation misstatement under&para;<br>chapter 1 if . . . the value of any property (or the ad­&para;<br>justed basis of any property) claimed on any return of&para;<br>tax imposed by chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the&para;<br>amount determined to be the correct amount of such&para;<br>valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).”&para;<br>§6662(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.).&para;<br>If the reported value or adjusted basis exceeds the correct&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Some amici warn that our holding bodes an odd procedural result:&para;<br>The IRS will be able to assess the 40-percent penalty directly, but it&para;<br>will have to use deficiency proceedings to assess the tax underpayment&para;<br>upon which the penalty is imposed. See Brief for New Millennium&para;<br>Trading, LLC, et al. as Amici Curiae 12–13. That criticism assumes&para;<br>that the underpayment would not be exempt from deficiency proceed­&para;<br>ings because it would rest on outside basis, an “affected ite[m] . . . other&para;<br>than [a] penalt[y],” 26 U. S. C. §6230(a)(2)(A)(i). We need not resolve&para;<br>that question today, but we do not think amici’s answer necessarily&para;<br>follows. Even an underpayment attributable to an affected item is&para;<br>exempt so long as the affected item does not “require partner level&para;<br>determinations,” ibid.; see Bush v. United States, 655 F. 3d 1323, 1330,&para;<br>1333–1334 (CA Fed. 2011) (en banc); and it is not readily apparent&para;<br>why additional partner-level determinations would be required before&para;<br>adjusting outside basis in a sham partnership. Cf. Petaluma FX&para;<br>Partners, LLC v. Commissioner, 591 F. 3d 649, 655 (CADC 2010)&para;<br>(“If disregarding a partnership leads ineluctably to the conclusion that&para;<br>its partners have no outside basis, that should be just as obvious in&para;<br>partner-level proceedings as it is in partnership-level proceedings”).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

But once&para;<br>the partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes,&para;<br>no partner could legitimately claim an outside basis&para;<br>greater than zero. Accordingly, if a partner used an out­&para;<br>side basis figure greater than zero to claim losses on his&para;<br>tax return, and if deducting those losses caused the part­&para;<br>ner to underpay his taxes, then the resulting underpay­&para;<br>ment would be “attributable to” the partner’s having&para;<br>claimed an “adjusted basis” in the partnerships that ex­&para;<br>ceeded “the correct amount of such . . . adjusted basis.”&para;<br>§6662(e)(1)(A).&para;<br>An IRS regulation provides that when an asset’s true&para;<br>value or adjusted basis is zero, “[t]he value or adjusted&para;<br>basis claimed . . . is considered to be 400 percent or more&para;<br>of the correct amount,” so that the resulting valuation&para;<br>misstatement is automatically deemed gross and subject&para;<br>to the 40-percent penalty.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Woods’ primary argument is that the economic-substance&para;<br>determination did not result in a “valuation misstate­&para;<br>ment.” He asserts that the statutory terms “value” and&para;<br>“valuation” connote “a factual—rather than legal—&para;<br>concept,” and that the penalty therefore applies only to&para;<br>factual misrepresentations about an asset’s worth or cost,&para;<br>not to misrepresentations that rest on legal errors (like&para;<br>the use of a sham partnership). Brief for Respondent 35.&para;<br>We are not convinced. To begin, we doubt that “value”&para;<br>is limited to factual issues and excludes threshold legal&para;<br>determinations. Cf. Powers v. Commissioner, 312 U. S.&para;<br>259, 260 (1941) (“[W]hat criterion should be employed for&para;<br>determining the ‘value’ of the gifts is a question of law”);&para;<br>Chapman Glen Ltd. v. Commissioner, 140 T. C. No. 15,&para;<br>2013 WL2319282, *17 (2013) (“[T]hree approaches are&para;<br>used to determine the fair market value of property,” and&para;<br>“which approach to apply in a case is a question of law”).&para;<br>But even if “value” were limited to factual matters, the&para;<br>statute refers to “value” or “adjusted basis,” and there is&para;<br>no justification for extending that limitation to the latter&para;<br>term, which plainly incorporates legal inquiries. An as­&para;<br>set’s “basis” is simply its cost, 26 U. S. C. §1012(a) (2006&para;<br>ed., Supp. V), but calculating its “adjusted basis” requires&para;<br>the application of a host of legal rules, see §§1011(a) (2006&para;<br>ed.), 1016 (2006 ed. and Supp. V), including specialized&para;<br>rules for calculating the adjusted basis of a partner’s&para;<br>interest in a partnership, see §705 (2006 ed.). The statute&para;<br>contains no indication that the misapplication of one of&para;<br>those legal rules cannot trigger the penalty. Were we to&para;<br>hold otherwise, we would read the word “adjusted” out of&para;<br>the statute.&para;<br>To overcome the plain meaning of “adjusted basis,”&para;<br>Woods asks us to interpret the parentheses in the statutory&para;<br>phrase “the value of any property (or the adjusted basis of&para;<br>any property)” as a signal that “adjusted basis” is merely&para;<br>explanatory or illustrative and has no meaning inde­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. WOODS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>pendent of “value.” The parentheses cannot bear that&para;<br>much weight, given the compelling textual evidence to the&para;<br>contrary. For one thing, the terms reappear later in the&para;<br>same sentence sans parentheses—in the phrase “such&para;<br>valuation or adjusted basis.” Moreover, the operative&para;<br>terms are connected by the conjunction “or.” While that&para;<br>can sometimes introduce an appositive—a word or phrase&para;<br>that is synonymous with what precedes it (“Vienna or&para;<br>Wien,” “Batman or the Caped Crusader”)—its ordinary&para;<br>use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it&para;<br>connects are to “be given separate meanings.” Reiter v.&para;<br>Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979). And, of course,&para;<br>there is no way that “adjusted basis” could be regarded as&para;<br>synonymous with “value.” Finally, the terms’ second&para;<br>disjunctive appearance is followed by “as the case may be,”&para;<br>which eliminates any lingering doubt that the preceding&para;<br>items are alternatives. See New Oxford American Dic­&para;<br>tionary 269 (3d ed. 2010). The parentheses thus do not&para;<br>justify “rob[bing] the term [‘adjusted basis’] of its inde­&para;<br>pendent and ordinary significance.” Reiter, supra, at&para;<br>338–339.&para;<br>Our holding that the valuation-misstatement penalty&para;<br>encompasses legal as well as factual misstatements of&para;<br>adjusted basis does not make superfluous the new penalty&para;<br>that Congress enacted in 2010 for transactions lacking in&para;<br>economic substance, see §1409(b)(2), 124 Stat. 1068–1069&para;<br>(codified at 26 U. S. C. §6662(b)(6) (2006 ed., Supp. V)).&para;<br>The new penalty covers all sham transactions, including&para;<br>those that do not cause the taxpayer to misrepresent value&para;<br>or basis; thus, it can apply in situations where the valuation­&para;<br>misstatement penalty cannot. And the fact that both&para;<br>penalties are potentially applicable to sham transactions&para;<br>resulting in valuation misstatements is not problematic.&para;<br>Congress recognized that penalties might overlap in a&para;<br>given case, and it addressed that possibility by providing&para;<br>that a taxpayer generally cannot receive more than one&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

See&para;<br>§6662(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).5&para;<br>C&para;<br>In the alternative, Woods argues that any underpay­&para;<br>ment of tax in this case would be “attributable,” not to&para;<br>the misstatements of outside basis, but rather to the deter­&para;<br>mination that the partnerships were shams—which he&para;<br>describes as an “independent legal ground.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 46. That is the rationale that the Fifth&para;<br>and Ninth Circuits have adopted for refusing to apply&para;<br>the valuation-misstatement penalty in cases like this,&para;<br>although both courts have voiced doubts about it. See&para;<br>Bemont, 679 F. 3d, at 347–348; id., at 351–355 (Prado, J.,&para;<br>concurring); Keller v. Commissioner, 556 F. 3d 1056, 1060–&para;<br>1061 (CA9 2009).&para;<br>We reject the argument’s premise: The economic­&para;<br>substance determination and the basis misstatement are&para;<br>not “independent” of one another. This is not a case where&para;<br>a valuation misstatement is a mere side effect of a sham&para;<br>transaction. Rather, the overstatement of outside basis&para;<br>was the linchpin of the COBRA tax shelter and the mech­&para;<br>anism by which Woods and McCombs sought to reduce&para;<br>their taxable income. As Judge Prado observed, in this&para;<br>type of tax shelter, “the basis misstatement and the trans­&para;<br>action’s lack of economic substance are inextricably inter­&para;<br>twined,” so “attributing the tax underpayment only to the&para;<br>artificiality of the transaction and not to the basis over­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 We&para;<br>&para;<br>do not consider Woods’ arguments based on legislative history.&para;<br>Whether or not legislative history is ever relevant, it need not be&para;<br>consulted when, as here, the statutory text is unambiguous.

Nor&para;<br>do we evaluate the claim that application of the penalty to legal rather&para;<br>than factual misrepresentations is a recent innovation.

In short, the partners underpaid&para;<br>their taxes because they overstated their outside basis,&para;<br>and they overstated their outside basis because the part­&para;<br>nerships were shams. We therefore have no difficulty&para;<br>concluding that any underpayment resulting from the&para;<br>COBRA tax shelter is attributable to the partners’ misrep­&para;<br>resentation of outside basis (a valuation misstatement).&para;<br>Woods contends, however, that a document known as&para;<br>the “Blue Book” compels a different result.
