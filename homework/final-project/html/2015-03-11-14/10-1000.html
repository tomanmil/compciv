Decided May 2, 2011 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>An Ohio jury convicted respondent Harry Mitts on two&para;<br>counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted&para;<br>murder. He was sentenced to death. At issue here is part&para;<br>of the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of&para;<br>Mitts’s trial. The instructions, in pertinent part, were as&para;<br>follows:&para;<br>“[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt&para;<br>whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts]&para;<br>was found guilty of committing in the separate counts,&para;<br>are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you&para;<br>find are present in this case.&para;<br>“When all 12 members of the jury find by proof be&para;<br>yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum&para;<br>stances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has&para;<br>been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigat&para;<br>ing factors, if any, then you must return such finding&para;<br>to the Court.&para;<br>“I instruct you as a matter of law that if you make&para;<br>such a finding, then you must recommend to the&para;<br>Court that the sentence of death be imposed on&para;<br>[Mitts].&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“On the other hand, [if] after considering all the&para;<br>relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and tes&para;<br>timony received at this hearing and the arguments of&para;<br>counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. MITTS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating cir&para;<br>cumstances with which [Mitts] was found guilty of&para;<br>committing outweigh the mitigating factors, you will&para;<br>then proceed to determine which of two possible life&para;<br>imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a–353a.&para;<br>We considered virtually the same Ohio jury instructions&para;<br>last Term in Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(slip op., at 7). See Mitts v. Bagley, 620 F. 3d 650, 652&para;<br>(CA6 2010) (noting that the “instructions in this case are&para;<br>the same Ohio instructions that were given in” Spisak).&para;<br>That case, like this one, involved review of a federal ha&para;<br>beas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death&para;<br>Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA provides, as rele&para;<br>vant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state&para;<br>court adjudication “resulted in a decision that was con&para;<br>trary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined&para;<br>by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1).&para;<br>In Spisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that&para;<br>had found these instructions invalid under our decision in&para;<br>Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988). See 558 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 8–9). Up until our decision in Spisak,&para;<br>Mitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions&para;<br>were invalid under Mills. After Spisak rejected that&para;<br>claim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that&para;<br>the instructions were contrary to our decision in Beck v.&para;<br>Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), and accordingly vacated&para;<br>Mitts’s death sentence. See 620 F. 3d, at 658.&para;<br>In Beck, we held that the death penalty may not be&para;<br>imposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a&para;<br>verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and&para;<br>when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.”&para;<br>447 U. S., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). We&para;<br>explained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>“risk of an unwarranted conviction” because it “interjects&para;<br>irrelevant considerations into the factfinding process,&para;<br>diverting the jury’s attention from the central issue of&para;<br>whether the State has satisfied its burden of proving&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a&para;<br>capital crime.” Id., at 638, 642. “[F]orcing the jury to&para;<br>choose between conviction on the capital offense and ac&para;<br>quittal,” we observed, “may encourage the jury to convict&para;<br>for an impermissible reason—its belief that the defendant&para;<br>is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished,”&para;<br>even when there is “some doubt with respect to an ele&para;<br>ment” of the capital offense. Id., at 632, 642, 637. Be&para;<br>cause the scheme in Beck created a danger that the jury&para;<br>would resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we con&para;<br>cluded that it violated due process. See id., at 638, 643.&para;<br>According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty&para;<br>phase instructions given at Mitts’s trial—and the Supreme&para;<br>Court of Ohio decision upholding their use—were “con&para;<br>trary to” Beck, because they “interposed before the jury&para;<br>the same false choice” that our holding in Beck prohibits.&para;<br>620 F. 3d, at 658, 657 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Referring to the instructions as “acquittal-first,” the Court&para;<br>of Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the&para;<br>jury to first decide whether to “acquit” Mitts of the death&para;<br>penalty before considering “mercy and some form of life&para;<br>imprisonment.” Id., at 656–657. Interpreting Beck to&para;<br>stand for the proposition that “a jury instruction violates&para;<br>due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sen&para;<br>tence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the&para;<br>jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment,” the&para;<br>Court of Appeals concluded that the instructions given&para;<br>during the penalty phase of Mitts’s trial unconstitutionally&para;<br>“deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to con&para;<br>sider” a life sentence. 620 F. 3d, at 658, 657 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The instructions here are surely not invalid under our&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. MITTS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>decision in Beck. The concern addressed in Beck was “the&para;<br>risk of an unwarranted conviction” created when the jury&para;<br>is forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of&para;<br>a capital offense and declaring him innocent of any&para;<br>wrongdoing. 447 U. S., at 637 (emphasis added); id., at&para;<br>638; see also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455&para;<br>(1984) (explaining that the “goal of the Beck rule” is “to&para;<br>eliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is&para;<br>created when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing&para;<br>choice between capital murder and innocence”); Schad v.&para;<br>Arizona, 501 U. S. 624, 646 (1991) (“Our fundamental&para;<br>concern in Beck was that a jury convinced that the defen&para;<br>dant had committed some violent crime but not convinced&para;<br>that he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless&para;<br>vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to&para;<br>set the defendant free with no punishment at all”).&para;<br>The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase,&para;<br>not the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that&para;<br>the logic of Beck is not directly applicable to penalty phase&para;<br>proceedings. In California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983),&para;<br>we rejected an argument that Beck prohibited an instruc&para;<br>tion to “a capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor’s&para;<br>power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of&para;<br>parole.” 463 U. S., at 994, 1006–1009. In so doing, we&para;<br>noted the “fundamental difference between the nature of&para;<br>the guilt/innocence determination at issue in Beck and the&para;<br>nature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.” Id.,&para;<br>at 1007. In light of that critical distinction, we observed&para;<br>that “the concern of Beck regarding the risk of an unwar&para;<br>ranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the&para;<br>deliberative process in which the capital jury engages in&para;<br>determining the appropriate penalty.” Id., at 1009; see&para;<br>also Schad, supra, at 647 (stating that the “central con&para;<br>cern of Beck simply is not implicated” when the “jury was&para;<br>not faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense&para;<br>of conviction (capital murder) and innocence”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The jurors in Mitts’s case could not have plausibly&para;<br>thought that if they declined to recommend the death&para;<br>penalty Mitts would “escape all penalties for his alleged&para;<br>participation in the crime.” Beck, supra, at 629. They had&para;<br>just convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder&para;<br>and two counts of attempted murder. They were specifi&para;<br>cally instructed that if they did not find that the aggravat&para;<br>ing factors outweighed the mitigating factors—and there&para;<br>fore did not recommend the death penalty—they would&para;<br>choose from two life sentence options. There is accord&para;<br>ingly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case,&para;<br>unlike the jurors in Beck, could have been improperly&para;<br>influenced by a fear that a decision short of death would&para;<br>have resulted in Mitts walking free.&para;<br>We all but decided the question presented here in&para;<br>Spisak itself. After rejecting the contention that the Ohio&para;<br>instructions were contrary to Mills, we noted that “the&para;<br>Court of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitu&para;<br>tional for an additional reason, that the instructions ‘re&para;<br>quire[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence&para;<br>before considering other sentencing alternatives.’ ” 558&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Spisak v. Mitchell, 465&para;<br>F. 3d 684, 709 (CA6 2006)). That is essentially the Beck&para;<br>claim presented here. See 620 F. 3d, at 658 (holding that&para;<br>a “jury instruction violates due process if it requires a&para;<br>mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be&para;<br>avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity&para;<br>to consider life imprisonment”). We rejected that claim in&para;<br>Spisak under AEDPA, noting that “[w]e have not . . .&para;<br>previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this&para;<br>reason.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Although neither&para;<br>the parties nor the courts below in Spisak had cited Beck,&para;<br>a separate concurrence in Spisak would have struck down&para;<br>the instructions in reliance on that decision. See 558&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concur&para;<br>ring in judgment) (slip op., at 3–6). The Court nonetheless&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOBBY v. MITTS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>concluded that whatever the merits of that argument on&para;<br>direct review, “the jury instructions at Spisak’s trial were&para;<br>not contrary to ‘clearly established Federal law’ ” under&para;<br>AEDPA. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The same conclusion&para;<br>applies here.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is&para;<br>Reversed.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
