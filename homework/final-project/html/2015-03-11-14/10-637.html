A jury convicted Greene. The&para;<br>Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that&para;<br>the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, did not&para;<br>apply because the confessions were redacted to remove any specific&para;<br>reference to Greene. While Greene’s petition to the Pennsylvania&para;<br>Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confessions. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greene’s&para;<br>appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal&para;<br>court may not grant such relief to a state prisoner on any claim that&para;<br>has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings” unless that adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal&para;<br>law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Here, the District Court concluded that, because&para;<br>the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Gray had not yet been&para;<br>issued when the Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene’s&para;<br>claim, the condition for granting habeas relief had not been met. The&para;<br>Third Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Under §2254(d)(1), “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States” includes only this&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GREENE v. FISHER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Court’s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court adjudication on the merits. The Court’s decision last Term in Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, established that §2254(d)(1)’s “backwardlooking language requires an examination of the state-court decision&para;<br>at the time it was made.” Id., at ___. As the Court explained in Cullen, §2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to measure state-court decisions “against this Court’s precedents as of ‘the time the state court&para;<br>renders its decision.’ ” Id., at ___. That reasoning determines the result here. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>2. Because the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision—the last&para;<br>state-court adjudication on the merits of Greene’s claim—predated&para;<br>Gray by nearly three months, the Third Circuit correctly held that&para;<br>Gray was not “clearly established Federal law” against which it could&para;<br>measure the state-court decision. It therefore correctly concluded&para;<br>that the state court’s decision neither was “contrary to,” nor “involved&para;<br>an unreasonable application of,” any “clearly established Federal&para;<br>law.” Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>&para;<br>606 F. 3d 85, affirmed.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

S. C. §2254(d)(1). We consider whether “clearly established Federal law” includes decisions of this Court that&para;<br>are announced after the last adjudication of the merits in&para;<br>state court but before the defendant’s conviction becomes&para;<br>final.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In December 1993, petitioner Eric Greene and four&para;<br>co-conspirators robbed a grocery store in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the robbery, one of the men&para;<br>shot and killed the store’s owner. The five were appre-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GREENE v. FISHER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>hended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the&para;<br>robbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by&para;<br>the others’ statements.&para;<br>When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the coconspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing,&para;<br>inter alia, that the confessions of his nontestifying codefendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial&para;<br>court denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require&para;<br>redaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As&para;<br>redacted, the confessions replaced names with words like&para;<br>“this guy,” “someone,” and “other guys,” or with the word&para;<br>“blank,” or simply omitted the names without substitution.&para;<br>A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania&para;<br>Superior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was&para;<br>demanded by the rule announced in Bruton v. United&para;<br>States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause&para;<br>forbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestifying codefendant’s confession implicating the defendant in the&para;<br>crime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the&para;<br>conviction, holding that the redaction had cured any problem under Bruton.&para;<br>Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the&para;<br>Pennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same Bruton&para;<br>claim. While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v.&para;<br>Maryland, 523 U. S. 185, 195 (1998), that “considered as a&para;<br>class, redactions that replace a proper name with an&para;<br>obvious blank, the word ‘delete,’ a symbol, or similarly&para;<br>notify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar&para;<br>enough to Bruton’s unredacted confessions as to warrant&para;<br>the same legal results.” The Pennsylvania Supreme Court&para;<br>granted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the&para;<br>question whether admission of the redacted confessions&para;<br>violated Greene’s Sixth Amendment rights. After the&para;<br>parties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania&para;<br>Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>granted.&para;<br>Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Eastern District of&para;<br>Pennsylvania, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction&para;<br>of his nontestifying codefendants’ statements violated the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court denied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in&para;<br>Gray was not “clearly established Federal law” when the&para;<br>Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene’s Confrontation Clause claim, that court’s decision was not&para;<br>“contrary to,” or “an unreasonable application of, clearly&para;<br>established Federal law.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Third Circuit affirmed. Greene v. Palakovich, 606&para;<br>F. 3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the “clearly established Federal law” referred to in §2254(d)(1) is the law at&para;<br>the time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. Id.,&para;<br>at 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at&para;<br>the time the conviction becomes final. Id., at 108. We&para;<br>granted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Section 2254(d) of Title 28, U. S. C., as amended by&para;<br>AEDPA, provides:&para;<br>“An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf&para;<br>of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a&para;<br>State court shall not be granted with respect to any&para;<br>claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State&para;<br>court proceedings unless the adjudication of the&para;<br>claim—&para;<br>“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States; or&para;<br>“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GREENE v. FISHER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>The issue here pertains to the first exception. We have&para;<br>said that its standard of “contrary to, or involv[ing] an&para;<br>unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal&para;<br>law” is “difficult to meet,” because the purpose of AEDPA&para;<br>is to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a&para;<br>“ ‘guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal&para;<br>justice systems,’ ” and not as a means of error correction.&para;<br>Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at&para;<br>12–13) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,&para;<br>n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).&para;<br>In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of&para;<br>the provision, we held last Term, in Cullen v. Pinholster,&para;<br>563 U. S. ___ (2011), that review under §2254(d)(1) is&para;<br>limited to the record that was before the state court that&para;<br>adjudicated the prisoner’s claim on the merits. We said&para;<br>that the provision’s “backward-looking language requires&para;<br>an examination of the state-court decision at the time it&para;<br>was made.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The reasoning of&para;<br>Cullen determines the result here. As we explained,&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to “focu[s] on what a&para;<br>state court knew and did,” and to measure state-court&para;<br>decisions “against this Court’s precedents as of ‘the time&para;<br>the state court renders its decision.’ ” Id., at __ (slip op., at&para;<br>10) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72&para;<br>(2003); emphasis added).&para;<br>Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Teague held&para;<br>that, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner&para;<br>seeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitutional rules of criminal procedure announced before the&para;<br>prisoner’s conviction became final. Id., at 310 (plurality&para;<br>opinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313&para;<br>(1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule). Finality&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>occurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and&para;<br>a petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become&para;<br>time barred or has been disposed of. Griffith v. Kentucky,&para;<br>479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). Greene contends that,&para;<br>because finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague&para;<br>purposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for “clearly&para;<br>established Federal law” under AEDPA.&para;<br>The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have&para;<br>explained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that&para;<br>“the AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.” Horn v.&para;<br>Banks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam). The retroactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the&para;<br>merits—which include Teague—are quite separate from&para;<br>the relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates&para;<br>or qualifies the other. If §2254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged&para;<br>to Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court&para;<br>merits adjudication “resulted in a decision that became&para;<br>contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly&para;<br>established Federal law, before the conviction became&para;<br>final.” The statute says no such thing, and we see no&para;<br>reason why Teague should alter AEDPA’s plain meaning.*&para;<br>Greene alternatively contends that the relevant “decision” to which the “clearly established Federal law” criterion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme&para;<br>court that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant’s&para;<br>conviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision&para;<br>does not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This&para;<br>is an implausible reading of §2254(d)(1). The text, we&para;<br>repeat, provides that habeas relief&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Whether §2254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from&para;<br>relying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication&para;<br>on the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in&para;<br>Teague, 489 U. S., at 311, is a question we need not address to resolve&para;<br>this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GREENE v. FISHER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“shall not be granted with respect to any claim that&para;<br>was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted&para;<br>in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal&para;<br>law . . . .” (Emphasis added.)&para;<br>The words “the adjudication” in the “unless” clause obviously refer back to the “adjudicat[ion] on the merits,” and&para;<br>the phrase “resulted in a decision” in the “unless” clause&para;<br>obviously refers to the decision produced by that same&para;<br>adjudication on the merits. A later affirmance of that&para;<br>decision on alternative procedural grounds, for example,&para;<br>would not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudication. And much less would be (what is at issue here)&para;<br>a decision by the state supreme court not to hear the&para;<br>appeal—that is, not to decide at all.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute,&para;<br>that the last state-court adjudication on the merits of&para;<br>Greene’s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct&para;<br>appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. 606 F. 3d, at&para;<br>92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision&para;<br>predated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.&para;<br>The Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not&para;<br>“clearly established Federal law” against which it could&para;<br>measure the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision. 606&para;<br>F. 3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do&para;<br>not dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision neither was “contrary to,” nor “involved an unreasonable application of,” any “clearly established Federal law”&para;<br>that existed at the time. Id., at 106. Consequently,&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene’s&para;<br>application for a writ of habeas corpus.&para;<br>We must observe that Greene’s predicament is an unusual one of his own creation.

Chater, 516&para;<br>U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). See, e.g., Stanbridge v.&para;<br>New York, 395 U. S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light&para;<br>of Bruton). Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a&para;<br>petition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two&para;<br>obvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to&para;<br>provide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner&para;<br>contrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to&para;<br>do so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
