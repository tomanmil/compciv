It applies, as well, to challenges initiated by noncontracting&para;<br>parties. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(a) Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but&para;<br>its reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit’s holding mis&para;<br>perceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doc&para;<br>trine. Announced three months after the Court of Appeals’ disposi&para;<br>tion in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierra’s&para;<br>instruction to FERC to “presume that the rate set out in a freely ne&para;<br>gotiated . . . contract meets the ‘just and reasonable’ requirement”&para;<br>unless “FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public&para;<br>interest.” 554 U. S., at ___. The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it&para;<br>unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the&para;<br>D. C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with,&para;<br>the “just and reasonable” standard. Rather, the public interest stan&para;<br>dard defines “what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and&para;<br>reasonable standard in the contract context.” Id., at ___. And if&para;<br>FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate result&para;<br>ing from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may&para;<br>not escape that presumption. Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine&para;<br>does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a con&para;<br>tract rate that “seriously harms the consuming public.” 554 U. S., at&para;<br>___. Finally, the D. C. Circuit’s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate&para;<br>challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine’s animating&para;<br>purpose: promotion of “the stability of supply arrangements which all&para;<br>agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.” Mobile, 350&para;<br>U. S., at 344.

For many&para;<br>years in New England, the supply of capacity was barely&para;<br>sufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New&para;<br>England’s generators, electricity providers, and power&para;<br>customers made several attempts to address this problem.&para;<br>This case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.&para;<br>In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into&para;<br>“reliability must-run” agreements with the New England&para;<br>Independent System Operator (ISO), which operates the&para;<br>region’s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing&para;<br>those agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a&para;<br>new market mechanism that would set prices separately&para;<br>for various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,&para;<br>103 FERC ¶61,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).&para;<br>In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure&para;<br>responsive to FERC’s directions.

Id., at 62,307.

Under that provi­&para;<br>sion, challenges to both transition-period payments and&para;<br>auction-clearing prices would be adjudicated under “the&para;<br>‘public interest’ standard of review set forth in United Gas&para;<br>Pipe Line Co. v.

But&para;<br>the objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue: The&para;<br>D. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to con­&para;<br>tracting parties. Id., at 478. In this Court, the parties&para;<br>have switched places. Defenders of the settlement, includ­&para;<br>ing the Mobile-Sierra provision, are petitioners; objectors&para;<br>to the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only&para;<br>on the Mobile-Sierra issue, are respondents.&para;<br>Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of&para;<br>our recent decision in Morgan Stanley, we granted certio­&para;<br>rari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: “[Does]&para;<br>Mobile-Sierra’s public-interest standard appl[y] when a&para;<br>contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a&para;<br>party to the contract[?]” Brief for Petitioners i. Satisfied&para;<br>that the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the&para;<br>D. C. Circuit’s judgment insofar as it rejected application&para;<br>of Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the “sale of&para;<br>electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.” See&para;<br>16 U. S. C. §824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities&para;<br>to set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and&para;<br>buyers may agree on rates by contract. See §824d(c), (d).&para;<br>Whether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must&para;<br>be “just and reasonable.” §824d(a). Rates may be exam­&para;<br>ined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own&para;<br>initiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed&para;<br>or after a rate goes into effect. §§824d(e), 824e(a). Follow­&para;<br>ing a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate&para;<br>found “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or&para;<br>preferential,” and replace it with a just and reasonable&para;<br>rate. §824e(a).&para;<br>The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions&para;<br>announced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. &para;<br>&para;<br>UTIL. COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.&para;<br>Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned&para;<br>rates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved&para;<br>the Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili­&para;<br>ties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility’s&para;<br>argument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author­&para;<br>ized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur­&para;<br>chaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336–337.&para;<br>Filing, we explained, was a precondition to changing a&para;<br>rate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful&para;<br>contract. Id., at 339–344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 4).&para;<br>The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had&para;<br>the Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed&para;<br>tariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com­&para;<br>mission had suggested that, in any event, the contract&para;<br>rate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust&para;<br>and unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so&para;<br>“solely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair&para;<br>return on the [utility’s] net invested capital.” 350 U. S., at&para;<br>355.&para;<br>The Commission’s suggestion prompted this Court to&para;<br>home in on “the question of how the Commission may&para;<br>evaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.”&para;<br>Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The&para;<br>Sierra Court answered the question this way:&para;<br>“[T]he Commission’s conclusion appears on its face to&para;<br>be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may&para;<br>be that the Commission may not normally impose&para;<br>upon a public utility a rate which would produce less&para;<br>than a fair return, it does not follow that the public&para;<br>utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af­&para;<br>fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it&para;<br>is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the&para;<br>Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so&para;<br>low as to adversely affect the public interest—as where&para;<br>it might impair the financial ability of the public util­&para;<br>ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers&para;<br>an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.”&para;<br>350 U. S., at 354–355 (some emphasis added).&para;<br>In a later case, we similarly explained: “The regulatory&para;<br>system created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual&para;<br>agreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa­&para;<br>nies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only&para;<br>in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.” Per&para;<br>mian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3&para;<br>Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the&para;<br>Court reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.&para;<br>That case presented two questions: First, does the MobileSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated&para;<br>between sophisticated parties meet the just and reason­&para;<br>able standard imposed by 16 U. S. C. §824d(a)) “apply only&para;<br>when FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a&para;<br>contract rate without the presumption?” 554 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 1). “Second, does the presumption [generally]&para;<br>impose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of whole­&para;<br>sale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?” Id., at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in MobileSierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and&para;<br>Water Div., 358 U. S. 103, 110–113 (1958), that parties may contract&para;<br>out of the Mobile-Sierra presumption. They could do so, we ruled, by&para;<br>specifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission&para;<br>would supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an&para;<br>option midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract&para;<br>that does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a&para;<br>new rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the&para;<br>contract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further&para;<br>showing that it adversely affects the public interest.

This Court’s&para;<br>understanding of Sierra provides an answer. “Sierra was&para;<br>grounded in the commonsense notion that ‘[i]n wholesale&para;<br>markets, the party charging the rate and the party&para;<br>charged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying&para;<br>presumptively equal bargaining power, who could be&para;<br>expected to negotiate a “just and reasonable” rate as be&para;<br>tween the two of them.’ ” Morgan Stanley, 554 U.
