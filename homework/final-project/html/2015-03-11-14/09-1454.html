GREENE, PERSONALLY AND AS NEXT FRIEND&para;<br>OF S. G., A MINOR, ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1454. Argued March 1, 2011—Decided May 26, 2011*&para;<br>Nearly a decade ago, petitioner Camreta, a state child protective ser&para;<br>vices worker, and petitioner Alford, a county deputy sheriff, inter&para;<br>viewed then 9-year-old S. G. at her Oregon elementary school about&para;<br>allegations that her father had sexually abused her. They did not&para;<br>have a warrant or parental consent to conduct the interview. S. G.&para;<br>eventually stated that she had been abused. Her father stood trial&para;<br>for that abuse, but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges&para;<br>were later dismissed. S. G.’s mother, respondent here (hereinafter&para;<br>S. G.), subsequently sued Camreta and Alford on S G.’s behalf for&para;<br>damages under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the in-school inter&para;<br>view breached the Fourth Amendment’s proscription on unreasonable&para;<br>seizures. The District Court granted summary judgment to the offi&para;<br>cials. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals first ruled&para;<br>that seizing S. G. absent a warrant, court order, parental consent, or&para;<br>exigent circumstances violated the Constitution. But the court fur&para;<br>ther held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from&para;<br>damages liability because no clearly established law had warned&para;<br>them of the illegality of their conduct. The court explained that it&para;<br>had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim so that of&para;<br>ficials would be on notice that they could not dispense with tradi&para;<br>tional Fourth Amendment protections in this context. Although the&para;<br>judgment entered was in their favor, Camreta and Alford petitioned&para;<br>this Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s ruling that their conduct vio&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 09–1478, Alford, Deputy Sheriff, Deschutes&para;<br>County, Oregon v. Greene, Personally and as Next Friend of S. G., a&para;<br>Minor, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>lated the Fourth Amendment. S. G. declined to cross-petition for re&para;<br>view of the decision that the officials have immunity.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. This Court generally may review a lower court’s constitutional&para;<br>ruling at the behest of government officials who have won final&para;<br>judgment on qualified immunity grounds. Pp. 4–14.&para;<br>(a) The relevant statute confers unqualified power on this Court&para;<br>to grant certiorari “upon the petition of any party.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1254(1). That language covers petitions brought by litigants who&para;<br>have prevailed, as well as those who have lost, in the courts below.&para;<br>Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) An appeal brought by a prevailing party may satisfy Article&para;<br>III’s case-or-controversy requirement. To comply with that require&para;<br>ment, litigants must demonstrate a “personal stake” in the suit.&para;<br>Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488, ___. The petitioner&para;<br>has such a stake when he has “suffered an ‘injury in fact’ ” that is&para;<br>caused by “the conduct complained of” and that “will be ‘redressed by&para;<br>a favorable decision.’ ” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,&para;<br>560–561. And the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest&para;<br>in the dispute, so that the case features “ ‘that concrete adverseness&para;<br>which sharpens the presentation of issues.’ ” Los Angeles v. Lyons,&para;<br>461 U. S. 95, 101. The parties must have the necessary stake not&para;<br>only at the outset of litigation, but throughout its course. Arizonans&para;<br>for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67. So long as the liti&para;<br>gants possess the requisite personal stake, an appeal presents a case&para;<br>or controversy, no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing&para;<br>party below. See Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S.&para;<br>326, 332–336; Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas &amp; Betts Co., 307&para;<br>U. S. 241.&para;<br>This Article III standard often will be met when immunized offi&para;<br>cials seek to challenge a determination that their conduct violated&para;<br>the Constitution because that ruling may have prospective effect on&para;<br>the parties. So long as it remains good law, an official who regularly&para;<br>engages in the challenged conduct as part of his job (as Camreta&para;<br>does) must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a&para;<br>meritorious damages action. The official thus can demonstrate in&para;<br>jury, causation, and redressability. And conversely, if the person who&para;<br>initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged con&para;<br>duct, she has a stake in preserving the court’s holding so that she will&para;<br>have ongoing protection from the practice. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(c) This Court’s prudential practice of declining to hear appeals&para;<br>by prevailing parties does not bar consideration of immunized offi&para;<br>cials’ petitions. The Court has recognized exceptions to this pruden&para;<br>tial rule when there has been a “policy reaso[n] . . . of sufficient im&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>portance to allow an appeal” by the winner below. Deposit Guaranty,&para;<br>445 U. S., at 336, n. 7. Just such a reason exists in qualified immu&para;<br>nity cases. The constitutional rulings that prevailing parties ask the&para;<br>Court to consider in these cases have a significant future effect on the&para;<br>conduct of public officials and the policies of the government units to&para;<br>which they belong. The rulings are self-consciously designed to pro&para;<br>duce this effect by establishing controlling law and preventing invo&para;<br>cations of immunity in later cases. Moreover, they are so designed&para;<br>with this Court’s permission, to promote clarity—and observance—of&para;<br>constitutional rules. Taken together, these features of qualified im&para;<br>munity cases support bending the usual rule to permit consideration&para;<br>of immunized officials’ petitions.&para;<br>To begin with the nature of these suits: Under §1983 and Bivens v.&para;<br>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, a plaintiff may&para;<br>seek money damages from government officials who have violated her&para;<br>constitutional or statutory rights. But if those officials are entitled to&para;<br>qualified immunity, a court can dismiss the damages claim without&para;<br>ever deciding its merits—and so the qualified immunity situation&para;<br>threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.&para;<br>To prevent that problem, this Court has permitted lower courts to de&para;<br>termine whether a right exists before examining whether it was&para;<br>clearly established. See, e.g., Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223,&para;<br>237. Here, the Ninth Circuit followed exactly this two-step process so&para;<br>that it could settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide&para;<br>the future conduct of officials.&para;<br>Given its purpose and effect, such a decision is reviewable in this&para;<br>Court at an immunized official’s behest. If the Court’s usual prevail&para;<br>ing party rule applied, the official would either have to acquiesce in a&para;<br>ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this Court, or defy the&para;<br>lower court’s view, adhere to what has been declared an illegal prac&para;<br>tice, and invite further law suits and possible punitive damages. Id.,&para;<br>at 240–241. And applying this Court’s usual bar on review would&para;<br>undermine the purpose of the two-step process, “which is to clarify&para;<br>constitutional rights without undue delay.” Bunting v. Mellen, 541&para;<br>U. S. 1019, 1024 (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).&para;<br>Just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching be&para;<br>yond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue, so too may&para;<br>it support this Court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court’s&para;<br>decision.&para;<br>This holding is limited in two respects. First, it addresses only this&para;<br>Court’s authority to review cases in this procedural posture. The&para;<br>Court need not decide if an appellate court can also entertain an ap&para;<br>peal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds. Second,&para;<br>the holding concerns only what the Court may review, not what the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Court actually will choose to review. Going forward, the Court will&para;<br>consider prevailing parties’ petitions one by one in accord with its&para;<br>usual standards for granting certiorari. Pp. 7–14.&para;<br>2. A separate jurisdictional problem requires the Court to dismiss&para;<br>this case at the threshold: The case is moot. In a dispute of this kind,&para;<br>both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the&para;<br>outcome. That is true of Camreta, who remains employed as a child&para;<br>protective services worker, and so has an interest in challenging the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit’s ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before con&para;<br>ducting an in-school interview. But S. G. can no longer claim the&para;<br>plaintiff’s usual stake in preserving the court’s holding because she&para;<br>no longer needs protection from the challenged practice. She has&para;<br>moved to Florida and is only months away from her 18th birthday&para;<br>and, presumably, from her high school graduation. When “subse&para;<br>quent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful&para;<br>behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,” there is no live&para;<br>controversy to review. United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Ex&para;<br>port Assn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203.&para;<br>When a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal, this Court has au&para;<br>thority to “direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or&para;<br>order, or require such further proceedings . . . as may be just under&para;<br>the circumstances.” 28 U. S. C. §2106. The Court’s “established”&para;<br>practice is to vacate the judgment below, see, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39, to ensure that “those who have&para;<br>been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled&para;<br>[are] not . . . treated as if there had been a review,” ibid. The point of&para;<br>vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision “from spawning any&para;<br>legal consequences.” Id., at 40–41. A constitutional ruling in a quali&para;<br>fied immunity case is a legally consequential decision. When hap&para;<br>penstance prevents this Court’s review of that ruling, the normal rule&para;<br>should apply: Vacatur rightly “strips the decision below of its binding&para;<br>effect,” Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193, 200, and clears “the&para;<br>path for future relitigation,” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40. Because&para;<br>mootness has frustrated Camreta’s ability to challenge the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s ruling that he must obtain a warrant before interviewing a&para;<br>suspected child abuse victim at school, that part of the Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit’s decision must be vacated. Pp. 14–18.&para;<br>&para;<br>588 F. 3d 1011, vacated in part and remanded.&para;<br>KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

The girl’s mother&para;<br>subsequently sued the government officials on the child’s&para;<br>behalf for damages under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1983, claiming that the interview infringed the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit agreed, ruling that the officials had violated&para;<br>the Constitution by failing to obtain a warrant to conduct&para;<br>the interview. But the Court of Appeals further held that&para;<br>qualified immunity shielded the officials from monetary&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>liability because the constitutional right at issue was not&para;<br>clearly established under existing law.&para;<br>The two officials sought this Court’s review of the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s ruling on the Fourth Amendment. We granted&para;<br>their petitions to examine two questions. First, may gov&para;<br>ernment officials who prevail on grounds of qualified im&para;<br>munity obtain our review of a court of appeals’ decision&para;<br>that their conduct violated the Constitution? And second,&para;<br>if we may consider cases in this procedural posture, did&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit correctly determine that this interview&para;<br>breached the Fourth Amendment?&para;<br>We conclude that this Court generally may review a&para;<br>lower court’s constitutional ruling at the behest of a gov&para;<br>ernment official granted immunity. But we may not do so&para;<br>in this case for reasons peculiar to it. The case has become&para;<br>moot because the child has grown up and moved across&para;<br>the country, and so will never again be subject to the&para;<br>Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitu&para;<br>tionality is at issue. We therefore do not reach the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment question in this case. In line with our normal&para;<br>practice when mootness frustrates a party’s right to ap&para;<br>peal, see United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36,&para;<br>39 (1950), we vacate the part of the Ninth Circuit’s opinion&para;<br>that decided the Fourth Amendment issue.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In February 2003, police arrested Nimrod Greene for&para;<br>suspected sexual abuse of a young boy unrelated to him.&para;<br>During the investigation of that offense, the boy’s parents&para;<br>told police that they suspected Greene of molesting his 9&para;<br>year-old daughter S. G. The police reported this informa&para;<br>tion to the Oregon Department of Human Services, which&para;<br>assigned petitioner Bob Camreta, a child protective ser&para;<br>vices caseworker, to assess S. G.’s safety. Several days&para;<br>later, Camreta, accompanied by petitioner James Alford, a&para;<br>Deschutes County deputy sheriff, went to S. G.’s elemen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tary school and interviewed her about the allegations. Cam&para;<br>reta and Alford did not have a warrant, nor had they&para;<br>obtained parental consent to conduct the interview. Al&para;<br>though S. G. at first denied that her father had molested&para;<br>her, she eventually stated that she had been abused.&para;<br>Greene was indicted and stood trial for sexually abusing&para;<br>S. G., but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges&para;<br>were later dismissed.&para;<br>Respondent Sarah Greene, S. G.’s mother, subsequently&para;<br>sued Camreta and Alford on S. G.’s behalf 1 for damages&para;<br>under 42 U. S. C. §1983, which authorizes suits against&para;<br>state officials for violations of constitutional rights. S. G.&para;<br>alleged that the officials’ in-school interview had breached&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment’s proscription on unreasonable&para;<br>seizures.2&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment to Cam&para;<br>reta and Alford, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals first ruled that the interview violated&para;<br>S. G.’s rights because Camreta and Alford had “seize[d]&para;<br>and interrogate[d] S. G. in the absence of a warrant, a&para;<br>court order, exigent circumstances, or parental consent.”&para;<br>588 F. 3d 1011, 1030 (2009) (footnote omitted). But the&para;<br>court further held that the officials were entitled to quali&para;<br>fied immunity from damages liability because no clearly&para;<br>established law had warned them of the illegality of their&para;<br>conduct. Id., at 1031–1033.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit explained why it had chosen to rule&para;<br>on the merits of the constitutional claim, rather than&para;<br>merely hold that the officials were immune from suit. By&para;<br>addressing the legality of the interview, the court said, it&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Because Greene filed suit as next friend for her minor daughter, we&para;<br>will refer to respondent as S. G. throughout this opinion.&para;<br>2 S. G. also sued Deschutes County, alleging that it has a policy of&para;<br>unconstitutionally seizing children in public schools. See 588 F. 3d&para;<br>1011, 1020, n. 4 (CA9 2009). The District Court rejected this claim, and&para;<br>S. G. did not appeal that ruling to the Ninth Circuit. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>could “provide guidance to those charged with the difficult&para;<br>task of protecting child welfare within the confines of&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment.” Id., at 1022. That guidance came&para;<br>in no uncertain terms: “[G]overnment officials investigat&para;<br>ing allegations of child abuse,” the court warned, “should&para;<br>cease operating on the assumption that a ‘special need’&para;<br>automatically justifies dispensing with traditional Fourth&para;<br>Amendment protections in this context.” Id., at 1033.&para;<br>Although the judgment entered was in their favor,&para;<br>Camreta and Alford petitioned this Court to review the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit’s ruling that their conduct violated the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment. S. G. declined to cross-petition for&para;<br>review of the decision that the officials have immunity.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>We first consider our ability to act on a petition brought&para;<br>by government officials who have won final judgment on&para;<br>grounds of qualified immunity, but who object to an appel&para;<br>late court’s ruling that they violated the plaintiff’s consti&para;<br>tutional rights. Camreta and Alford are, without doubt,&para;<br>prevailing parties. The Ninth Circuit’s decision shielded&para;<br>them from monetary liability, and S. G. chose not to con&para;<br>test that ruling. So whatever else follows, they will not&para;<br>have to pay S. G. the damages she sought. The question&para;<br>we confront is whether we may nonetheless review the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ holding that the officials violated the&para;<br>Constitution.&para;<br>The statute governing this Court’s jurisdiction author&para;<br>izes us to adjudicate a case in this posture, and S. G. does&para;<br>not contend otherwise. The relevant provision confers&para;<br>unqualified power on this Court to grant certiorari “upon&para;<br>the petition of any party.” 28 U. S. C. §1254(1) (emphasis&para;<br>added). That language covers petitions brought by liti&para;<br>gants who have prevailed, as well as those who have&para;<br>lost, in the court below. See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp; E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac&para;<br>tice 87 (9th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Stern &amp; Gressman).&para;<br>S. G., however, alleges two impediments to our exercise&para;<br>of statutory authority here, one constitutional and the&para;<br>other prudential. First, she claims that Article III bars&para;<br>review because petitions submitted by immunized officials&para;<br>present no case or controversy. See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>31–39. Second, she argues that our settled practice of&para;<br>declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties should&para;<br>apply with full force when officials have obtained immu&para;<br>nity. See id., at 24–27. We disagree on both counts.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Article III of the Constitution grants this Court author&para;<br>ity to adjudicate legal disputes only in the context of&para;<br>“Cases” or “Controversies.” To enforce this limitation,&para;<br>we demand that litigants demonstrate a “personal stake”&para;<br>in the suit. Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S.&para;<br>488, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); see also United States Parole Comm’n v. Ger&para;<br>aghty, 445 U. S. 388, 395–397 (1980). The party invoking&para;<br>the Court’s authority has such a stake when three condi&para;<br>tions are satisfied: The petitioner must show that he has&para;<br>“suffered an injury in fact” that is caused by “the conduct&para;<br>complained of” and that “will be redressed by a favorable&para;<br>decision.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,&para;<br>560–561 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). And&para;<br>the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest&para;<br>in the dispute, so that the case features “that concrete ad&para;<br>verseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.” Los&para;<br>Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 101 (1983) (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). To ensure a case remains “fit for&para;<br>federal-court adjudication,” the parties must have the&para;<br>necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation, but&para;<br>throughout its course. Arizonans for Official English v.&para;<br>Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We have previously recognized that an appeal brought&para;<br>by a prevailing party may satisfy Article III’s case-or&para;<br>controversy requirement. See Deposit Guaranty Nat.&para;<br>Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 332–336 (1980). Indeed, we&para;<br>have twice before allowed a party for whom judgment was&para;<br>entered to challenge an unfavorable lower court ruling.&para;<br>See ibid.; Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas &amp; Betts Co.,&para;<br>307 U. S. 241 (1939).3 In that context as in others, we&para;<br>stated, the critical question under Article III is whether&para;<br>the litigant retains the necessary personal stake in the&para;<br>appeal. Deposit Guaranty, 445 U. S., at 334. As we will&para;<br>explain, a court will usually invoke rules of “federal appel&para;<br>late practice” to decline review of a prevailing party’s&para;<br>challenge even when he has the requisite stake. Id., at&para;<br>333; see infra, at 8. But in such a case, Article III is not&para;<br>what poses the bar; these rules of practice “d[o] not have&para;<br>[their] source in the jurisdictional limitations” of the Con&para;<br>stitution. Deposit Guaranty, 445 U. S., at 333–334. So&para;<br>long as the litigants possess the personal stake discussed&para;<br>above, an appeal presents a case or controversy, no matter&para;<br>that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.&para;<br>This Article III standard often will be met when immu&para;<br>nized officials seek to challenge a ruling that their conduct&para;<br>violated the Constitution. That is not because a court has&para;<br>made a retrospective judgment about the lawfulness of the&para;<br>officials’ behavior, for that judgment is unaccompanied by&para;<br>any personal liability. Rather, it is because the judgment&para;<br>may have prospective effect on the parties. The court in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent discusses Deposit Guaranty and Electrical Fittings at&para;<br>length in an effort to distinguish them from this suit. See post, at 4–7&para;<br>(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). But we do not say those cases are foursquare&para;<br>with this one on their facts; we rely on them only for the proposition&para;<br>that this Court has previously identified no special Article III bar on&para;<br>review of appeals brought by parties who obtained a judgment in their&para;<br>favor below. The dissent does not, because it cannot, dispute that&para;<br>simple point.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>such a case says: “Although this official is immune from&para;<br>damages today, what he did violates the Constitution and&para;<br>he or anyone else who does that thing again will be per&para;<br>sonally liable.” If the official regularly engages in that&para;<br>conduct as part of his job (as Camreta does), he suffers&para;<br>injury caused by the adverse constitutional ruling. So&para;<br>long as it continues in effect, he must either change the&para;<br>way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages&para;<br>action. Cf. id., at 337–338 (discussing prevailing party’s&para;<br>stake in a ruling’s prospective effects). Only by overturn&para;<br>ing the ruling on appeal can the official gain clearance to&para;<br>engage in the conduct in the future. He thus can demon&para;<br>strate, as we demand, injury, causation, and redressabil&para;<br>ity.4 And conversely, if the person who initially brought&para;<br>the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct,&para;<br>she has a stake in preserving the court’s holding. See Erie&para;<br>v. Pap’s A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 287–289 (2000); Honig v.&para;<br>Doe, 484 U. S. 305, 318–323 (1988); cf. Lyons, 461 U. S., at&para;<br>111 (examining whether the plaintiff had shown “a suffi&para;<br>cient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar&para;<br>way”). Only if the ruling remains good law will she have&para;<br>ongoing protection from the practice.&para;<br>We therefore reject S. G.’s view that Article III bars&para;<br>us from adjudicating any and all challenges brought by&para;<br>government officials who have received immunity below.&para;<br>That the victor has filed the appeal does not deprive us&para;<br>of jurisdiction. The parties in such cases may yet have&para;<br>a sufficient “interest in the outcome of [a litigated] issue”&para;<br>to present a case or controversy. Deposit Guaranty, 445&para;<br>U. S., at 336, n. 7.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Contrary&para;<br>&para;<br>to the dissent’s view, see post, at 12, the injury to the offi&para;<br>cial thus occurs independent of any future suit brought by a third&para;<br>party. Indeed, no such suit is likely to arise because the prospect of&para;<br>damages liability will force the official to change his conduct.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>Article III aside, an important question of judicial policy&para;<br>remains. As a matter of practice and prudence, we have&para;<br>generally declined to consider cases at the request of a&para;<br>prevailing party, even when the Constitution allowed us to&para;<br>do so. See, e.g., Gunn v. University Comm. to End War in&para;<br>Viet Nam, 399 U. S. 383, 390, n. 5 (1970); New York Tele&para;<br>phone Co. v. Maltbie, 291 U.

Our&para;<br>resources are not well spent superintending each word&para;<br>a lower court utters en route to a final judgment in the&para;<br>petitioning party’s favor. See California v. Rooney, 483&para;<br>U. S. 307, 311 (1987) (per curiam) (“[T]hat the Court of&para;<br>Appeal reached its decision through analysis different&para;<br>than this Court might have used does not make it appro&para;<br>priate . . . for the prevailing party to request us to review&para;<br>it”). We therefore have adhered with some rigor to the&para;<br>principle that “[t]his Court reviews judgments, not state&para;<br>ments in opinions.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted). On the few occasions when we have departed from&para;<br>that principle, we have pointed to a “policy reaso[n] . . . of&para;<br>sufficient importance to allow an appeal” by the winner&para;<br>below. Deposit Guaranty, 445 U. S., at 336, n. 7.&para;<br>We think just such a reason places qualified immunity&para;<br>cases in a special category when it comes to this Court’s&para;<br>review of appeals brought by winners. The constitutional&para;<br>determinations that prevailing parties ask us to consider&para;<br>in these cases are not mere dicta or “statements in opin&para;<br>ions.” Rooney, 483 U. S., at 311 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); see Bunting, 541 U.

See supra, at 6–7. And more:&para;<br>they are rulings self-consciously designed to produce this&para;<br>effect, by establishing controlling law and preventing&para;<br>invocations of immunity in later cases. And still more:&para;<br>they are rulings designed this way with this Court’s&para;<br>permission, to promote clarity—and observance—of consti&para;<br>tutional rules. We describe in more detail below these fea&para;<br>tures of the qualified immunity world and why they came&para;<br>to be. We hold that taken together, they support bending&para;<br>our usual rule to permit consideration of immunized offi&para;<br>cials’ petitions.&para;<br>To begin, then, with the nature of these suits: Under&para;<br>§1983 (invoked in this case) and Bivens v. Six Unknown&para;<br>Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), a plaintiff&para;<br>may seek money damages from government officials who&para;<br>have violated her constitutional or statutory rights. But to&para;<br>ensure that fear of liability will not “unduly inhibit offi&para;<br>cials in the discharge of their duties,” Anderson v. Creigh&para;<br>ton, 483 U. S. 635, 638 (1987), the officials may claim&para;<br>qualified immunity; so long as they have not violated a&para;<br>“clearly established” right, they are shielded from personal&para;<br>liability, Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).&para;<br>That means a court can often avoid ruling on the plain&para;<br>tiff’s claim that a particular right exists. If prior case law&para;<br>has not clearly settled the right, and so given officials fair&para;<br>notice of it, the court can simply dismiss the claim for&para;<br>money damages. The court need never decide whether the&para;<br>plaintiff’s claim, even though novel or otherwise unsettled,&para;<br>in fact has merit.&para;<br>And indeed, our usual adjudicatory rules suggest that&para;<br>a court should forbear resolving this issue. After all, a&para;<br>“longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that&para;<br>courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of the necessity of deciding them.” Lyng v. Northwest&para;<br>Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., 485 U. S. 439, 445&para;<br>(1988); see also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–347&para;<br>(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). In this category of quali&para;<br>fied immunity cases, a court can enter judgment without&para;<br>ever ruling on the (perhaps difficult) constitutional claim&para;<br>the plaintiff has raised. Small wonder, then, that a court&para;<br>might leave that issue for another day.&para;<br>But we have long recognized that this day may never&para;<br>come—that our regular policy of avoidance sometimes&para;<br>does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it&para;<br>threatens to leave standards of official conduct perma&para;<br>nently in limbo. County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S.&para;<br>833, 841, n. 5 (1998). Consider a plausible but unsettled&para;<br>constitutional claim asserted against a government official&para;<br>in a suit for money damages. The court does not resolve&para;<br>the claim because the official has immunity. He thus&para;<br>persists in the challenged practice; he knows that he can&para;<br>avoid liability in any future damages action, because the&para;<br>law has still not been clearly established. Another plain&para;<br>tiff brings suit, and another court both awards immunity&para;<br>and bypasses the claim. And again, and again, and again.&para;<br>So the moment of decision does not arrive.5 Courts fail to&para;<br>clarify uncertain questions, fail to address novel claims,&para;<br>fail to give guidance to officials about how to comply with&para;<br>legal requirements. See, e.g., ibid.; Wilson v. Layne, 526&para;<br>U. S. 603, 609 (1999). Qualified immunity thus may frus&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The constitutional issue could arise in a case in which qualified&para;<br>immunity is unavailable—for example, “in a suit to enjoin future con&para;<br>duct, in an action against a municipality, or in litigating a suppres&para;<br>sion motion in a criminal proceeding.” Lewis, 523 U. S., at 841, n. 5. A&para;<br>decision in such a case would break the repetitive cycle of qualified&para;<br>immunity defenses described above. But some kinds of constitutional&para;<br>questions do not often come up in these alternative settings. Pearson v.&para;<br>Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009); see Lewis, 523 U.

Pearson v. Calla&para;<br>han, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009).&para;<br>For this reason, we have permitted lower courts to avoid&para;<br>avoidance—that is, to determine whether a right exists&para;<br>before examining whether it was clearly established. See,&para;<br>e.g., ibid.; Lewis, 523 U. S., at 841, n. 5. Indeed, for some&para;<br>time we required courts considering qualified immunity&para;<br>claims to first address the constitutional question, so as to&para;<br>promote “the law’s elaboration from case to case.” Saucier&para;<br>v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). More recently, we have&para;<br>left this matter to the discretion of lower courts, and in&para;<br>deed detailed a range of circumstances in which courts&para;<br>should address only the immunity question. See Pearson,&para;<br>555 U. S., at 236–242. In general, courts should think&para;<br>hard, and then think hard again, before turning small&para;<br>cases into large ones. But it remains true that following&para;<br>the two-step sequence—defining constitutional rights and&para;<br>only then conferring immunity—is sometimes beneficial&para;<br>to clarify the legal standards governing public officials.&para;<br>Id., at 236; see id., at 236–242 (discussing factors courts&para;<br>should consider in making this determination).&para;<br>Here, the Court of Appeals followed exactly this two&para;<br>step process, for exactly the reasons we have said may in&para;<br>select circumstances make it “advantageous.” Id., at 242.&para;<br>The court, as noted earlier, explained that it was “ad&para;<br>dress[ing] both prongs of the qualified immunity inquiry&para;<br>. . . to provide guidance to those charged with the difficult&para;<br>task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment.” 588 F. 3d, at 1022. To that end, the&para;<br>court adopted constitutional standards to govern all in&para;<br>school interviews of suspected child abuse victims. See&para;<br>id., at 1030. And the court specifically instructed govern&para;<br>ment officials to follow those standards going forward—to&para;<br>“cease operating on the assumption” that warrantless&para;<br>interviews are permitted. See id., at 1033. With the law&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>thus clearly established, officials who conduct this kind of&para;<br>interview will not receive immunity in the Ninth Circuit.&para;<br>And the State of Oregon has done just what we would&para;<br>expect in the wake of the court’s decision: It has provided&para;<br>revised legal advice, consonant with the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>ruling, to child protective services workers wishing to&para;<br>interview children in schools. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. The&para;<br>court thus accomplished what it set out to do: settle a&para;<br>question of constitutional law and thereby guide the con&para;<br>duct of officials.&para;<br>Given its purpose and effect, such a decision is review&para;<br>able in this Court at the behest of an immunized official.&para;<br>No mere dictum, a constitutional ruling preparatory to a&para;<br>grant of immunity creates law that governs the official’s&para;<br>behavior. If our usual rule pertaining to prevailing parties&para;<br>applied, the official would “fac[e] an unenviable choice”:&para;<br>He must either acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportu&para;<br>nity to contest in this Court, or “defy the views of the&para;<br>lower court, adhere to practices that have been declared&para;<br>illegal, and thus invite new suits and potential punitive&para;<br>damages.” Pearson, 555 U. S., at 240–241 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks and brackets omitted). And if our usual bar on&para;<br>review applied, it would undermine the very purpose&para;<br>served by the two-step process, “which is to clarify consti&para;<br>tutional rights without undue delay.” Bunting, 541 U. S.,&para;<br>at 1024 (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).&para;<br>This Court, needless to say, also plays a role in clarifying&para;<br>rights. Just as that purpose may justify an appellate court&para;<br>in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a con&para;<br>stitutional issue, so too that purpose may support this&para;<br>Court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court’s&para;<br>decision.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The dissent complains that our decision “allows plaintiffs to obtain&para;<br>binding constitutional determinations on the merits that lie beyond this&para;<br>Court’s jurisdiction to review.” Post, at 10. But that is not the case. It&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We emphasize, however, two limits of today’s holding.&para;<br>First, it addresses only our own authority to review cases&para;<br>in this procedural posture. The Ninth Circuit had no oc&para;<br>casion to consider whether it could hear an appeal from&para;<br>an immunized official: In that court, after all, S. G. ap&para;<br>pealed the judgment in the officials’ favor. We therefore&para;<br>need not and do not decide if an appellate court, too, can&para;<br>entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on&para;<br>immunity grounds.7 Second, our holding concerns only&para;<br>what this Court may review; what we actually will choose&para;<br>to review is a different matter. That choice will be gov&para;<br>erned by the ordinary principles informing our decision&para;<br>whether to grant certiorari—a “power [we] . . . sparingly&para;<br>exercis[e].” Forsyth v. Hammond, 166 U. S. 506, 514&para;<br>(1897); see also id., at 514–515 (this Court grants review&para;<br>“only when the circumstances of the case satisfy us that&para;<br>the importance of the question involved, the necessity of&para;<br>avoiding conflict [in the lower courts], or some matter&para;<br>affecting the interests of this nation . . . , demands such&para;<br>——————&para;<br>is not this decision but our prior precedents that allow lower courts to&para;<br>issue “binding constitutional determinations” in qualified immunity&para;<br>cases even when the plaintiff is not entitled to money damages. And it&para;<br>is not our decision but the dissent that would insulate these rulings&para;<br>from this Court’s power to review.&para;<br>7 We note, however, that the considerations persuading us to permit&para;<br>review of petitions in this posture may not have the same force as&para;<br>applied to a district court decision. “A decision of a federal district&para;<br>court judge is not binding precedent in either a different judicial&para;<br>district, the same judicial district, or even upon the same judge in&para;<br>a different case.”&para;<br>18 J. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice&para;<br>§134.02[1][d], p. 134–26 (3d ed. 2011). Many Courts of Appeals there&para;<br>fore decline to consider district court precedent when determining if&para;<br>constitutional rights are clearly established for purposes of qualified&para;<br>immunity. See, e.g., Kalka v. Hawk, 215 F. 3d 90, 100 (CADC 2000)&para;<br>(Tatel, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (collecting&para;<br>cases). Otherwise said, district court decisions—unlike those from the&para;<br>courts of appeals—do not necessarily settle constitutional standards or&para;<br>prevent repeated claims of qualified immunity.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exercise”); this Court’s Rule 10. Our decision today does&para;<br>no more than exempt one special category of cases from&para;<br>our usual rule against considering prevailing parties’&para;<br>petitions. Going forward, we will consider these petitions&para;<br>one by one in accord with our usual standards.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although we reject S. G.’s arguments for dismissing this&para;<br>case at the threshold, we find that a separate jurisdic&para;<br>tional problem requires that result: This case, we con&para;<br>clude, is moot.8&para;<br>As we explained above, supra, at 6–7, in a dispute of&para;<br>this kind, both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily&para;<br>retain a stake in the outcome. That is true of one defen&para;<br>dant here: Camreta remains employed as a child protec&para;<br>tive services worker, so he has an interest in challenging&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit’s ruling requiring him to obtain a war&para;<br>rant before conducting an in-school interview.9 But S. G.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR maintains that, because this case is moot,&para;<br>“[t]here is no warrant for reaching th[e] question” whether immunized&para;<br>officials may obtain our consideration of an adverse constitutional&para;<br>ruling. Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment). But this Court has&para;<br>never held that it may consider only one threshold issue per case. And&para;<br>here, as we will explain, infra, at 16–18, and n. 10, our discussion of&para;<br>reviewability is critical to our ultimate disposition of this suit. More&para;<br>over, that issue was fully litigated in this Court. We granted certiorari&para;<br>to consider whether “the Ninth Circuit’s constitutional ruling [is]&para;<br>reviewable, notwithstanding that [the Court of Appeals] ruled in [the&para;<br>officials’] favor on qualified immunity grounds.” Pet. for Cert. in No.&para;<br>09–1454, p. i. And all the parties, as well as the United States as&para;<br>amicus curiae, addressed that question in their briefs and oral argu&para;<br>ments.

After we&para;<br>granted certiorari, we discovered that S. G. has “moved to&para;<br>Florida, and ha[s] no intention of relocating back to Ore&para;<br>gon.” Brief for Respondent 13, n. 13. What is more, S. G.&para;<br>is now only months away from her 18th birthday—and,&para;<br>presumably, from her high school graduation. See id.,&para;<br>at 31. S. G. therefore cannot be affected by the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ ruling; she faces not the slightest possibility of&para;<br>being seized in a school in the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction&para;<br>as part of a child abuse investigation. When “subsequent&para;<br>events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrong&para;<br>ful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,” we&para;<br>have no live controversy to review. United States v. Con&para;<br>centrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203&para;<br>(1968); see, e.g., Atherton Mills v. Johnston, 259 U. S. 13,&para;<br>15–16 (1922) (suit contesting the validity of a child labor&para;<br>statute mooted when plaintiff-child was “[no longer]&para;<br>within the ages affected by the act”); DeFunis v. Ode&para;<br>gaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam) (suit challenging&para;<br>law school admissions policy mooted when plaintiff neared&para;<br>graduation). Time and distance combined have stymied&para;<br>our ability to consider this petition.&para;<br>Camreta makes only one counterargument: He avers&para;<br>that S. G. has a continuing interest in the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>constitutional ruling because it may help her establish a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>County or in law enforcement. See Brief for Respondent 1, n. 2; Reply&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner in No. 09–1478. Because Alford will not again&para;<br>participate in a child abuse investigation, he has lost his interest in the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment ruling. See supra, at 6–7; cf. Arizonans for Official&para;<br>English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997) (holding that the plaintiff’s&para;<br>challenge to a state law affecting the performance of her job duties was&para;<br>mooted when she left state employment). But in light of Camreta’s&para;<br>continuing stake, Alford’s altered circumstances are immaterial to our&para;<br>resolution of this dispute, and we do not decide any questions that&para;<br>would arise if he were the only defendant.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>municipal liability claim against Deschutes County. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; id., at 8. S. G.’s initial complaint&para;<br>charged that the county has an official policy of unconsti&para;<br>tutionally subjecting schoolchildren to police interrogation.&para;<br>See n. 2, supra. Finding no evidence of such a policy (even&para;<br>assuming that an unlawful seizure had occurred in this&para;<br>case), the District Court granted summary judgment to&para;<br>the county, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09–1454, pp. 66–&para;<br>67, and S. G. did not appeal that ruling, 588 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1020, n. 4. And although S.

Whatever interest S. G. might have&para;<br>were her municipal liability claim still pending (an issue&para;<br>we need not and do not decide), we do not think S.

When&para;<br>a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal, we have the&para;<br>authority to “direct the entry of such appropriate judg&para;<br>ment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings&para;<br>to be had as may be just under the circumstances.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2106. Our “established” (though not excep&para;<br>tionless) practice in this situation is to vacate the judg&para;<br>ment below. See Munsingwear, 340 U.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). “A party&para;<br>who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling, but&para;<br>is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,” we have&para;<br>emphasized, “ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce&para;<br>in” that ruling.

The equitable&para;<br>remedy of vacatur ensures that “those who have been&para;<br>prevented from obtaining the review to which they are&para;<br>entitled [are] not . . . treated as if there had been a re&para;<br>view.” Munsingwear, 340 U.

Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 41–42; Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. Far from counsel&para;<br>ing against vacatur, S. G.’s argument reveals the necessity&para;<br>of that procedural course. The point of vacatur is to pre&para;<br>vent an unreviewable decision “from spawning any legal&para;<br>consequences,” so that no party is harmed by what we&para;<br>have called a “preliminary” adjudication.

S., at 25 (holding that the appealing&para;<br>party had “surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur”&para;<br>by settling the case and thus “voluntarily forfeit[ing] his legal remedy&para;<br>by the ordinary processes of appeal”); Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 83&para;<br>(1987) (holding that vacatur in light of mootness was not warranted&para;<br>when the losing party declined to file an appeal). So if immunized&para;<br>officials could not challenge an appellate decision in this Court, we&para;<br>would choose not to exercise our equitable authority to vacate that&para;<br>decision, even if the case later became moot. But here, as we have just&para;<br>explained, the theory that underlies our prior cases applying Munsing&para;<br>wear is satisfied: Vacatur expunges an adverse decision that would be&para;<br>reviewable had this case not become moot. See Arizonans, 520 U. S., at&para;<br>74 (finding vacatur proper because, “when the mooting event occurred,”&para;<br>the Arizona Attorney General was pursuing his “right to present&para;<br>argument on appeal”).&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tutional ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally&para;<br>consequential decision; that is the very reason we think it&para;<br>appropriate for review even at the behest of a prevailing&para;<br>party. See supra, at 8–12. When happenstance prevents&para;<br>that review from occurring, the normal rule should ap&para;<br>ply: Vacatur then rightly “strips the decision below of its&para;<br>binding effect,” Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193,&para;<br>200 (1988), and “clears the path for future relitigation,”&para;<br>Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.&para;<br>In this case, the happenstance of S. G.’s moving across&para;<br>country and becoming an adult has deprived Camreta of&para;<br>his appeal rights. Mootness has frustrated his ability to&para;<br>challenge the Court of Appeals’ ruling that he must obtain&para;<br>a warrant before interviewing a suspected child abuse&para;<br>victim at school. We therefore vacate the part of the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s opinion that addressed that issue, and remand&para;<br>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.11 See,&para;<br>e.g., Arave v. Hoffman, 552 U. S. 117, 118–119 (2008) (per&para;<br>curiam); Selig v. Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc., 551 U. S.&para;<br>1142 (2007).&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Our disposition of this case differs slightly from the normal&para;<br>Munsingwear order vacating the lower court’s judgment and remanding&para;<br>the case with instructions to dismiss the relevant claim. We leave&para;<br>untouched the Court of Appeals’ ruling on qualified immunity and its&para;<br>corresponding dismissal of S. G.’s claim because S. G. chose not to&para;<br>challenge that ruling. We vacate the Ninth Circuit’s ruling addressing&para;<br>the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue because, as we have ex&para;<br>plained, supra, at 11–12, that is the part of the decision that mootness&para;<br>prevents us from reviewing but that has prospective effects on Cam&para;<br>reta. See Walling v. James V. Reuter, Inc., 321 U. S. 671, 677 (1944)&para;<br>(observing that when a suit becomes moot, “this Court . . . may make&para;<br>such disposition of the whole case as justice may require”). But we&para;<br>emphasize that this unique disposition follows from the unique posture&para;<br>of this case and signals no endorsement of deviations from the usual&para;<br>Munsingwear order in other situations.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

The Court is correct to&para;<br>note the problem presented when, on the one hand, its&para;<br>precedents permit or invite courts to rule on the merits of&para;<br>a constitutional claim even when qualified immunity&para;<br>disposes of the matter; and, on the other hand, jurisdic&para;<br>tional principles prevent us from reviewing those invited&para;<br>rulings. It does seem that clarification is required. In my&para;<br>view, however, the correct solution is not to override juris&para;<br>dictional rules that are basic to the functioning of the&para;<br>Court and to the necessity of avoiding advisory opinions.&para;<br>Dictum, though not precedent, may have its utility; but it&para;<br>ought not to be treated as a judgment standing on its own.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>So, while acknowledging the problem the Court confronts,&para;<br>my concern with the rule adopted for this case calls for&para;<br>this respectful dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Court acknowledges our “settled refusal to enter&para;<br>tain an appeal,” including a petition for certiorari, “by a&para;<br>party on an issue as to which he prevailed.” Ante, at 8&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). At the outset, how&para;<br>ever, it is important to state this rule more fully to show&para;<br>its foundational character. A party that has already ob&para;<br>tained the judgment it requested may not seek review to&para;<br>challenge the reasoning of a judicial decision. As we have&para;<br>said on many occasions, “This Court reviews judgments,&para;<br>not statements in opinions.” California v. Rooney, 483&para;<br>U. S. 307, 311 (1987) (per curiam) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted); see also Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural&para;<br>Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842, and&para;<br>n. 8 (1984) (collecting cases). The rule has been noted and&para;<br>followed since the early years of this Court. “The question&para;<br>before an appellate Court is, was the judgment correct, not&para;<br>the ground on which the judgment professes to proceed.”&para;<br>McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598, 603 (1821).&para;<br>The rule against hearing appeals or accepting petitions&para;<br>for certiorari by prevailing parties is related to the Article&para;<br>III prohibition against issuing advisory opinions. This&para;<br>principle underlies, for example, the settled rule against&para;<br>hearing cases involving a disputed judgment based on&para;<br>grounds of state law. As Justice Jackson explained for the&para;<br>Court: “[O]ur power is to correct wrong judgments, not to&para;<br>revise opinions. We are not permitted to render an advi&para;<br>sory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered&para;<br>by the state court after we corrected its views of federal&para;<br>laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an&para;<br>advisory opinion.” Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125–&para;<br>126 (1945). This point has been repeated with force and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>clarity. See, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041–&para;<br>1042 (1983). The “ ‘judicial Power’ is one to render dis&para;<br>positive judgments,” not advisory opinions. Plaut v.&para;<br>Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 219 (1995) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties&para;<br>applies in countless situations, many involving govern&para;<br>ment parties. Deficient performance may not yield preju&para;<br>dice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).&para;<br>A defective warrant may be entitled to good-faith reliance&para;<br>under United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984). An&para;<br>unreasonable search may be cured through the inevitable&para;<br>discovery doctrine of Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431 (1984).&para;<br>In these and myriad other situations, an error is identi&para;<br>fied, but that conclusion does not affect the ultimate&para;<br>judgment entered. In all these contexts, it is established&para;<br>that the prevailing party may not appeal. This conclusion&para;<br>holds true even though a statement on the merits can&para;<br>have adverse consequences for the prevailing party. “The&para;<br>Court of Appeal’s use of analysis that may have been&para;<br>adverse to the State’s long-term interests does not allow&para;<br>the State to claim status as a losing party for purposes of&para;<br>this Court’s review.” Rooney, supra, at 311.&para;<br>The Court nonetheless holds that defendants who pre&para;<br>vail in the Courts of Appeals based on qualified immunity&para;<br>may still obtain review in this Court. This point is put in&para;<br>perspective by the fact that the Court today, in an alto&para;<br>gether unprecedented disposition, says that it vacates not&para;<br>a judgment but rather “part of the Ninth Circuit’s opin&para;<br>ion.” Ante, at 2. The Court’s conclusion is unsettling in its&para;<br>implications. Even on the Court’s reading of our cases, the&para;<br>almost invariable rule is that prevailing parties are not&para;<br>permitted to obtain a writ of certiorari. Cf. Kalka v.&para;<br>Hawk, 215 F. 3d 90, 96, n. 9 (CADC 2000) (concluding that&para;<br>the Supreme Court “has apparently never granted the&para;<br>certiorari petition of a party who prevailed in the appel&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>late court”). After today, however, it will be common for&para;<br>prevailing parties to seek certiorari based on the Court’s&para;<br>newfound exception. And that will be so even though the&para;<br>“admonition” against reviewing mere statements in opin&para;<br>ions “has special force when the statements raise consti&para;<br>tutional questions, for it is our settled practice to avoid&para;<br>the unnecessary decision of such issues.” FCC v. Pacifica&para;<br>Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 734 (1978).&para;<br>The Court defends its holding with citations to just two&para;<br>of our cases. Ante, at 6. Neither provides support for the&para;<br>Court’s result.&para;<br>The first case is Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas &amp;&para;<br>Betts Co., 307 U. S. 241 (1939). There, a plaintiff alleged&para;<br>the infringement of two patent claims. The District Court&para;<br>found the plaintiff’s first claim valid but not infringed and&para;<br>the second claim invalid. Rather than issuing a judgment&para;<br>“dismissing the bill without more,” the District Court&para;<br>instead “entered a decree adjudging claim 1 valid” and&para;<br>“dismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement.” Id.,&para;<br>at 241–242. The District Court thus issued a formal judg&para;<br>ment regarding the validity of the first claim. The defen&para;<br>dant appealed to dispute that claim’s validity. This Court&para;<br>noted, without qualification, that a party “may not appeal&para;<br>from a judgment or decree in his favor, for the purpose of&para;<br>obtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which&para;<br>are not necessary to support the decree.” Id., at 242.&para;<br>“But,” this Court went on to explain, “here the decree itself&para;<br>purports to adjudge the validity of claim 1, and though&para;<br>the adjudication was immaterial to the disposition of the&para;<br>cause, it stands as an adjudication of one of the issues&para;<br>litigated.” Ibid. In other words, the District Court had&para;<br>entered an unnecessary legal conclusion into the terms of&para;<br>the judgment itself, making it possible, for example, that&para;<br>the decree would have estoppel effect as to an issue whose&para;<br>resolution was unnecessary to the proper judgment of&para;<br>dismissal. Electrical Fittings therefore concluded that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“the petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the&para;<br>decree eliminated.” Ibid. The sole relief provided was&para;<br>an order for the “reformation of the decree.” Ibid. That&para;<br>result accords with, indeed flows from, the settled rule&para;<br>that this Court reviews only judgments, not statements in&para;<br>opinions.&para;<br>The second case is Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v.&para;<br>Roper, 445 U. S. 326 (1980). In that case plaintiffs at&para;<br>tempted to bring a class action against a bank. After the&para;<br>District Court denied class certification, the defendant&para;<br>tendered to the plaintiffs the maximum value that they&para;<br>could recover as individuals. Of course, that offer did&para;<br>not amount to “all that ha[d] been requested in the&para;<br>complaint”—namely, “relief for the class.” Id., at 341&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J., concurring). It is therefore no surprise&para;<br>that the plaintiffs responded with “a counteroffer of judg&para;<br>ment in which they attempted to reserve the right to&para;<br>appeal the adverse class certification ruling.” Id., at 329&para;<br>(opinion of the Court). But that proposal was denied.&para;<br>“Based on the bank’s offer, the District Court entered&para;<br>judgment in respondents’ favor, over their objection.” Id.,&para;<br>at 330. The District Court thus issued a judgment other&para;<br>than the one the plaintiffs had sought. The would-be class&para;<br>plaintiffs appealed, and this Court later granted certiorari.&para;<br>The Court held that appeal was not barred by the prevailing&para;<br>party rule: “We view the denial of class certification as&para;<br>an example of a procedural ruling, collateral to the merits&para;<br>of a litigation, that is appealable after the entry of final&para;<br>judgment.” Id., at 336. As the Court explained, the plain&para;<br>tiffs had obtained only a judgment in their individual&para;<br>capacities. Yet the plaintiffs had “asserted as their per&para;<br>sonal stake in the appeal their desire to shift to successful&para;<br>class litigants a portion of those fees and expenses that&para;<br>have been incurred in this litigation.” Id., at 334, n. 6; see&para;<br>also id., at 336. Because the purported prevailing parties&para;<br>were injured by their failure to obtain the class-based&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>judgment they had sought, the Court held there was “ju&para;<br>risdiction to entertain the appeal only to review the as&para;<br>serted procedural error, not for the purpose of passing on&para;<br>the merits.” Ibid. The Court was clear that the District&para;<br>Court’s denial of class certification had a direct effect on&para;<br>the judgment: “As in Electrical Fittings,” the purported&para;<br>prevailing parties “were entitled to have [a] portion of the&para;<br>District Court’s judgment reviewed.” Ibid.&para;<br>Neither Electrical Fittings nor Deposit Guaranty pro&para;<br>vides support for the rule adopted today. Those decisions&para;<br>instead held that, in the unusual circumstances presented,&para;<br>particular parties who at first appeared to have prevailed&para;<br>below had in fact failed to obtain the judgments they had&para;<br>sought. This Court therefore had jurisdiction, including of&para;<br>course jurisdiction under Article III, to provide relief for&para;<br>the harm caused by the adverse judgments entered below.&para;<br>The parties seeking appeal in Electrical Fittings and&para;<br>Deposit Guaranty might be compared with plaintiffs who&para;<br>have requested $1,000 in relief but obtained only $500.&para;<br>Such parties have prevailed in part, but have not “re&para;<br>ceive[d] all that [they] ha[d] sought.” Deposit Guaranty,&para;<br>supra, at 333. In contrast the Court appears to assume&para;<br>that the petitioners in the present case are true prevailing&para;<br>parties. They have obtained from the Court of Appeals the&para;<br>only formal judgment they requested: denial of respon&para;<br>dent’s claim for damages.&para;<br>The Court points to policy concerns as the basis for its&para;<br>willingness to hear appeals by prevailing parties. Ante, at&para;<br>8–10. But those concerns are unwarranted. In only one&para;<br>dissenting opinion has it been suggested that certiorari&para;<br>should be granted to reach a merits determination “locked&para;<br>inside” a favorable qualified immunity ruling. Bunting v.&para;<br>Mellen, 541 U. S. 1019, 1024 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>from denial of certiorari). That dissenting opinion was&para;<br>issued in response to the rule that constitutional issues&para;<br>should be decided in every case involving qualified immu&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>nity. Id., at 1025. Yet that mandated rule of decision has&para;<br>now been disapproved, so the dissent’s argument is no&para;<br>longer applicable. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223&para;<br>(2009). Indeed, the Court today suggests that it still&para;<br>would not allow review of the merits even in the case that&para;<br>provoked the dissent. Unlike petitioner Camreta, the&para;<br>petitioner in Bunting had left the Government’s employ&para;<br>before filing a petition for certiorari and so lacked stand&para;<br>ing to obtain review in this Court. Compare 541 U. S., at&para;<br>1025, n., with id., at 1021 (Stevens, J., respecting denial of&para;<br>certiorari), and ante, at 14–15, and n. 9.&para;<br>The instant case thus appears to be the first in which&para;<br>the Court’s new exception to the prevailing party rule&para;<br>might have been applied. And even here that exception is&para;<br>neither necessary nor sufficient for the merits to be adju&para;<br>dicated by this Court. The Fourth Amendment question&para;<br>decided below is bound to arise again in future cases.&para;<br>Indeed, the reasoning of the decision below implicates a&para;<br>number of decisions in other Courts of Appeals. Cf. 588&para;<br>F. 3d 1011, 1026, n. 11 (CA9 2009) (collecting cases). Yet&para;<br>today’s decision does not supply the Courts of Appeals&para;<br>with guidance as to these merits issues. The Court in&para;<br>stead vacates part of the reasoning of the decision below,&para;<br>thereby leaving other decisions intact and unreviewed.&para;<br>The Court thus resolves difficult constitutional issues and&para;<br>provides an unprecedented answer to “an important ques&para;<br>tion of judicial policy,” all to no end. Ante, at 7.&para;<br>The Court errs in reading Electrical Fittings and Deposit&para;<br>Guaranty to permit review and, indeed, the provision of&para;<br>relief disconnected from any judgment. The result is an&para;<br>erroneous and unbounded exception to an essential princi&para;<br>ple of judicial restraint. Parties who have obtained all&para;<br>requested relief may not seek review here.&para;<br>II&para;<br>As today’s decision illustrates, our recent qualified im&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>munity cases tend to produce decisions that are in ten&para;<br>sion with conventional principles of case-or-controversy&para;<br>adjudication. This Court has given the Courts of Appeals&para;<br>“permission” to find constitutional violations when order&para;<br>ing dismissal or summary judgment based on qualified&para;<br>immunity. Ante, at 9; see Pearson, supra. This invitation,&para;<br>as the Court is correct to note, was intended to produce&para;<br>binding constitutional holdings on the merits. Ante, at&para;<br>10–11. The goal was to make dictum precedent, in order&para;<br>to hasten the gradual process of constitutional interpreta&para;<br>tion and alter the behavior of government defendants.&para;<br>Ibid. The present case brings the difficulties of that objec&para;<br>tive into perspective. In express reliance on the permis&para;<br>sion granted in Pearson, the Court of Appeals went out of&para;<br>its way to announce what may be an erroneous interpreta&para;<br>tion of the Constitution; and, under our case law, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit must give that dictum legal effect as prece&para;<br>dent in future cases.&para;<br>In this way unnecessary merits decisions in qualified&para;<br>immunity cases could come to resemble declaratory judg&para;<br>ments or injunctions. Indeed the United States as amicus&para;<br>curiae contends that the merits decision below “has an&para;<br>effect similar to an injunction or a declaratory judgment&para;<br>against the government as a whole.” Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 13. Today’s opinion adopts that&para;<br>view, providing as relief the vacatur of “part of the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s opinion”—namely, the part of the opinion that&para;<br>rules on the constitutional merits. Ante, at 2. For the first&para;<br>time, obiter dictum is treated not just as precedent for&para;<br>future cases but as a judgment in its own right.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals in this case did not in fact issue a&para;<br>declaratory judgment or injunction embodying a determi&para;<br>nation on the merits, and it does not appear that a judg&para;<br>ment of that kind could have issued. Plaintiffs must&para;<br>establish standing as to each form of relief they request,&para;<br>yet the plaintiff in this case had no separate interest in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S. 95, 103–105 (1983) (citing Ashcroft v.&para;<br>Mattis, 431 U. S. 171 (1977) (per curiam); Golden v. Zwick&para;<br>ler, 394 U. S. 103 (1969)); see also MedImmune, Inc. v.&para;<br>Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127 (2007). There was no&para;<br>likelihood that S. G., the plaintiff’s daughter, would again&para;<br>be subjected to interrogation while at school, much less&para;<br>that she would be interrogated by petitioner-defendant&para;<br>Camreta, so S. G. would seem to have had no greater&para;<br>stake in obtaining a declaratory judgment than the plain&para;<br>tiff in Lyons had in obtaining an injunction. See 461 U. S.,&para;<br>at 104 (noting the “actual controversy that must exist for a&para;<br>declaratory judgment to be entered”). Our qualified im&para;<br>munity cases should not permit plaintiffs in constitutional&para;<br>cases to make an end-run around established principles of&para;<br>justiciability. In treating dictum as though it were a&para;<br>declaratory judgment or an injunction, the Court appears&para;<br>to approve the issuance of such judgments outside the&para;<br>bounds of Article III jurisdiction.&para;<br>The Court creates an exception to the prevailing party&para;<br>rule in order to solve the difficulties created by our quali&para;<br>fied immunity jurisprudence, but the Court’s solution&para;<br>creates new problems. Sometimes defendants in qualified&para;<br>immunity cases have no particular interest in disputing&para;<br>the constitutional merits. Acknowledging as much, the&para;<br>Court notes that petitioner Alford no longer works for the&para;<br>government and so “has lost his interest in the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment ruling.” Ante, at 14, n. 9. In concluding that&para;<br>Alford lacks Article III standing, the Court suggests that&para;<br>it would lack jurisdiction to review and perhaps even to&para;<br>vacate the merits decision of the Court of Appeals if re&para;<br>spondent had sued only Alford. Ibid.; cf. Arizonans for&para;<br>Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 72–73 (1997)&para;<br>(discussing standing to obtain review in this Court as well&para;<br>as this Court’s jurisdiction to vacate judgments issued&para;<br>without jurisdiction). That suggestion is disconcerting.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Under today’s decision, it appears that the Court’s ability&para;<br>to review merits determinations in qualified immunity&para;<br>cases is contingent on the defendant who has been sued.&para;<br>A defendant who has left the government’s employ or&para;<br>otherwise lacks an interest in disputing the merits will&para;<br>be unable to obtain further review. See ante, at 14, n. 9&para;<br>(discussing Article III limits on relief in this Court); ante,&para;<br>at 17, n. 10 (discussing limitations on this Court’s equita&para;<br>ble vacatur authority).&para;<br>The Court today avoids this difficulty by concluding that&para;<br>petitioner Camreta has suffered an Article III injury.&para;<br>Ante, at 7; cf. ante, at 15, n. 9 (“[W]e do not decide any&para;<br>questions that would arise if [Alford] were the only defen&para;<br>dant”). But the Court can reach that conclusion only&para;<br>because, “as part of his job,” Camreta “regularly engages”&para;<br>in conduct made unlawful by the reasoning of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals. Ante, at 7. As discussed below, this conclusion is&para;<br>doubtful. See infra, at 11–13. In any event the Court’s&para;<br>standing analysis will be inapplicable in most qualified&para;<br>immunity cases. Cf. ante, at 6 (asserting that the “Article&para;<br>III standard often will be met”). When an officer is sued&para;<br>for taking an extraordinary action, such as using excessive&para;<br>force during a high-speed car chase, there is little possibil&para;<br>ity that a constitutional decision on the merits will again&para;<br>influence that officer’s conduct. The officer, like petitioner&para;<br>Alford or the petitioner in Bunting, would have no interest&para;<br>in litigating the merits in the Court of Appeals and, under&para;<br>the Court’s rule, would seem unable to obtain review of a&para;<br>merits ruling by petitioning for certiorari. See ante, at 5–&para;<br>7; ante, at 14, n. 9, ante, at 17, n. 10; see also Lyons, supra,&para;<br>at 103–105. This problem will arise with great frequency&para;<br>in qualified immunity cases. Once again, the decision&para;<br>today allows plaintiffs to obtain binding constitutional&para;<br>determinations on the merits that lie beyond this Court’s&para;<br>jurisdiction to review. The Court thus fails to solve the&para;<br>problem it identifies.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>It is most doubtful that Article III permits appeals by&para;<br>any officer to whom the reasoning of a judicial decision&para;<br>might be applied in a later suit. Yet that appears to be&para;<br>the implication of the Court’s holding. The favorable judg&para;<br>ment of the Court of Appeals did not in itself cause peti&para;<br>tioner Camreta to suffer an Article III injury entitling him&para;<br>to appeal. Cf. supra, at 1–7 (discussing Electrical Fittings&para;<br>and Deposit Guaranty); ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S.&para;<br>605, 619 (1989) (finding an Article III controversy where&para;<br>petitioner challenged “a final judgment altering tangible&para;<br>legal rights”). On the contrary, Camreta has been injured&para;<br>by the decision below to no greater extent than have hun&para;<br>dreds of other government officers who might argue that&para;<br>they too have been affected by the unnecessary statements&para;<br>made by the Court of Appeals. The Court notes as a limit&para;<br>on its authority to entertain appeals from prevailing par&para;<br>ties certain statutory directives, directives that can be&para;<br>interpreted or shaped to allow expanded powers of review.&para;<br>Ante, at 4. But even if Congress were to give explicit&para;<br>permission for certiorari petitions to be filed by “any per&para;<br>son” instead of by “any party,” 28 U. S. C. §1254(1), the&para;<br>constitutional definition of a case or controversy would&para;<br>still constrain this Court’s jurisdiction.&para;<br>The Court’s analysis appears to rest on the premise that&para;<br>the reasoning of the decision below in itself causes Cam&para;<br>reta injury. Until today, however, precedential reasoning&para;<br>of general applicability divorced from a particular adverse&para;<br>judgment was not thought to yield “standing to appeal.”&para;<br>Parr v. United States, 351 U. S. 513, 516, 517 (1956) (opin&para;<br>ion for the Court by Harlan, J.).

It&para;<br>is revealing that the Court creates an exception to the&para;<br>prevailing party rule while making clear that the Courts&para;<br>of Appeals are not to follow suit, in any context. See ante,&para;<br>at 13–14.&para;<br>The conclusion that precedent of general applicability&para;<br>cannot in itself create standing to sue or appeal flows from&para;<br>basic principles. Camreta’s asserted injury is caused not&para;<br>by the Court of Appeals or by respondent but rather by&para;<br>“the independent action of some third party not before the&para;<br>court”—that is, by the still-unidentified private plaintiffs&para;<br>whose lawsuits Camreta hopes to avoid. Lujan v. Defend&para;<br>ers of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561 (1992) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>This circumstance distin&para;<br>guishes the present case from requests for declaratory or&para;<br>injunctive relief filed against officeholders who threaten&para;<br>legal enforcement.

See&para;<br>MedImmune, Inc., 549 U. S., at 127 (explaining that de&para;<br>claratory relief requires a controversy “between parties&para;<br>having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and&para;<br>reality” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Babbitt v.&para;<br>Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298–299 (1979) (“A plaintiff&para;<br>who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic&para;<br>danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the&para;<br>statute’s operation or enforcement”). Without an adverse&para;<br>judgment from which to appeal, Camreta has in effect filed&para;<br>a new declaratory judgment action in this Court against&para;<br>the Court of Appeals. This is no more consistent with&para;<br>Article III than filing a declaratory judgment action&para;<br>against this Court for its issuance of an adverse precedent&para;<br>or against Congress in response to its enactment of an&para;<br>unconstitutional law.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>If today’s decision proves to be more than an isolated&para;<br>anomaly, the Court might find it necessary to reconsider&para;<br>its special permission that the Courts of Appeals may&para;<br>issue unnecessary merits determinations in qualified im&para;<br>munity cases with binding precedential effect.&para;<br>Other dynamics permit the law of the Constitution to be&para;<br>elaborated within the conventional framework of a case or&para;<br>controversy. “[T]he development of constitutional law is&para;<br>by no means entirely dependent on cases in which the&para;<br>defendant may seek qualified immunity.” Pearson, 555&para;<br>U. S., at 242–243. For example, qualified immunity does&para;<br>not bar Fourth and Fifth Amendment suppression chal&para;<br>lenges. See, e.g., Kentucky v. King, ante, p. ___. Nor does&para;<br>it prevent invocation of the Constitution as a defense&para;<br>against criminal prosecution, civil suit, or cruel and un&para;<br>usual punishment. See, e.g., Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2011); Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010); Law&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003). Nor is qualified&para;<br>immunity available in constitutional suits against munici&para;<br>palities—as this very case illustrates. Ante, at 15–16.&para;<br>Our cases make clear, moreover, that “officials can still be&para;<br>on notice that their conduct violates established law even&para;<br>in novel factual circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S.&para;<br>730, 741 (2002). That rule permits clearly established&para;<br>violations to be found when extreme though unheard-of&para;<br>actions violate the Constitution. See, e.g., ibid. Further&para;<br>more, constitutional plaintiffs may seek declaratory or&para;<br>injunctive relief pursuant to standard principles of justi&para;<br>ciability. Those plaintiffs do not need Pearson’s special&para;<br>rule.&para;<br>See, e.g., Citizens United v. Federal Election&para;<br>Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___ (2010); McDonald v. Chicago, 561&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010). In any event, some incremental advance&para;<br>in the law occurs even when clearly established violations&para;<br>are found. It is an inevitable aspect of judicial decision&para;<br>making that the resolution of one legal question or factual&para;<br>dispute casts light on the next.&para;<br>It would be preferable at least to explore refinements to&para;<br>our qualified immunity jurisprudence before altering basic&para;<br>principles of jurisdiction. For instance, the objectives of&para;<br>qualified immunity might be satisfied if there were no bar&para;<br>to reaching the merits and issuing judgment when re&para;<br>quested damages are nominal and substantial attorney’s&para;<br>fees are waived or not allowed. Cf. Farrar v. Hobby, 506&para;<br>U. S. 103, 112–115 (1992) (discussing unavailability of&para;<br>attorney’s fees where nominal damages are only relief);&para;<br>Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 761–763 (1987); Harlow&para;<br>v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 819, n. 34 (1982); Carey v.&para;<br>Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 266 (1978) (discussing the propriety&para;<br>of providing nominal damages as relief).&para;<br>The desire to resolve more constitutional questions&para;<br>ought not lead to altering our jurisdictional rules. That is&para;<br>the precise object that our legal tradition tells us we&para;<br>should resist. Haste to resolve constitutional issues has&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>never been thought advisable. We instead have encour&para;<br>aged the Courts of Appeals to follow “that older, wiser&para;<br>judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutional&para;<br>ity . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.” Scott v.&para;<br>Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 388 (2007) (BREYER, J., concurring)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted); see generally Ash&para;<br>wander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J.,&para;<br>concurring). Experience teaches that there is no persua&para;<br>sive reason to reverse normal principles of judicial review&para;<br>in qualified immunity cases. Compare, e.g., Pearson,&para;<br>supra, at 236, and Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 235&para;<br>(1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (“[I]t seems&para;<br>to reverse the usual ordering of issues to tell the trial and&para;<br>appellate courts that they should resolve the constitu&para;<br>tional question first”), with id., at 232 (opinion of the&para;<br>Court), and Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). Yet&para;<br>this Court’s “puzzling misadventure in constitutional&para;<br>dictum” still has not come to an end. Leval, Judging&para;<br>Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81 N. Y. U.&para;<br>L. Rev. 1249, 1275 (2006).&para;<br>There will be instances where courts discuss the merits&para;<br>in qualified immunity cases. It is sometimes a better&para;<br>analytic approach and a preferred allocation of judicial&para;<br>time and resources to dismiss a claim on the merits rather&para;<br>than to dismiss based on qualified immunity. And “[i]t&para;<br>often may be difficult to decide whether a right is clearly&para;<br>established without deciding precisely what the existing&para;<br>constitutional right happens to be.” Pearson, supra, at 236&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). This Court should not&para;<br>superintend the judicial decisionmaking process in quali&para;<br>fied immunity cases under special rules, lest it make the&para;<br>judicial process more complex for civil rights suits than for&para;<br>other litigation. It follows, however, that the Court should&para;<br>provide no special permission to reach the merits. If&para;<br>qualified immunity cases were treated like other cases&para;<br>raising constitutional questions, settled principles of con&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CAMRETA v. GREENE&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>stitutional avoidance would apply. So would conventional rules regarding dictum and holding. Judicial obser&para;<br>vations made in the course of explaining a case might give&para;<br>important instruction and be relevant when assessing a&para;<br>later claim of qualified immunity. Cf. Wilkinson v. Rus&para;<br>sell, 182 F. 3d 89, 112, and n. 3 (CA2 1999) (Calabresi, J.,&para;<br>concurring). But as dicta those remarks would not estab&para;<br>lish law and would not qualify as binding precedent. See&para;<br>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 67 (1996).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The distance our qualified immunity jurisprudence has&para;<br>taken us from foundational principles is made all the more&para;<br>apparent by today’s decision. The Court must construe&para;<br>two of its precedents in so broad a manner that they are&para;<br>taken out of their proper and logical confines. To vacate&para;<br>the reasoning of the decision below, the Court accepts that&para;<br>obiter dictum is not just binding precedent but a judgment&para;<br>susceptible to plenary review. I would dismiss this case&para;<br>and note that our jurisdictional rule against hearing ap&para;<br>peals by prevailing parties precludes petitioners’ attempt&para;<br>to obtain review of judicial reasoning disconnected from a&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
