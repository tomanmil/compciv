(NML), one of Argentina’s bondholders, prevailed in 11 debt-collection actions that it brought against Argentina in the Southern District of New York. In aid of executing the&para;<br>judgments, NML sought discovery of Argentina’s property, serving&para;<br>subpoenas on two nonparty banks for records relating to Argentina’s&para;<br>global financial transactions. The District Court granted NML’s motions to compel compliance. The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting&para;<br>Argentina’s argument that the District Court’s order transgressed&para;<br>the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act).&para;<br>Held: No provision in the FSIA immunizes a foreign-sovereign judgment debtor from postjudgment discovery of information concerning&para;<br>its extraterritorial assets. Pp. 4–12.&para;<br>(a) This Court assumes without deciding that, in the ordinary case,&para;<br>a district court would have the discretion under Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 69(a)(2) to permit discovery of third-party information&para;<br>bearing on a judgment debtor’s extraterritorial assets. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The FSIA replaced an executive-driven, factor-intensive, loosely&para;<br>common-law-based immunity regime with “a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity.” Republic of&para;<br>Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 699. Henceforth, any sort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in an American court&para;<br>must stand or fall on the Act’s text. The Act confers on foreign states&para;<br>two kinds of immunity. The first, jurisdictional immunity (28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1604), was waived here. The second, execution immunity,&para;<br>generally shields “property in the United States of a foreign state”&para;<br>from attachment, arrest, and execution. §§1609, 1610. See also&para;<br>§1611(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). The Act has no third provision forbidding or&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v.

Even if Argentina were&para;<br>correct that §1609 execution immunity implies coextensive discoveryin-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield from discovery a foreign sovereign’s extraterritorial assets, since the text of&para;<br>§1609 immunizes only foreign-state property “in the United States.”&para;<br>The prospect that NML’s general request for information about Argentina’s worldwide assets may turn up information about property&para;<br>that Argentina regards as immune does not mean that NML cannot&para;<br>pursue discovery of it.

Background&para;<br>In 2001, petitioner, Republic of Argentina, defaulted on&para;<br>its external debt.

Approving the subpoenas&para;<br>in principle, it concluded that extraterritorial asset discov­&para;<br>ery did not offend Argentina’s sovereign immunity, and it&para;<br>reaffirmed that it would serve as a “clearinghouse for&para;<br>information” in NML’s efforts to find and attach Argenti­&para;<br>na’s assets. App. to Pet. for Cert. 31. But the court made&para;<br>clear that it expected the parties to negotiate further over&para;<br>specific production requests, which, the court said, must&para;<br>include “some reasonable definition of the information&para;<br>being sought.” Id., at 32. There was no point, for in­&para;<br>stance, in “getting information about something that&para;<br>might lead to attachment in Argentina because that would&para;<br>be useless information,” since no Argentinian court would&para;<br>allow attachment. Ibid. “Thus, the district court . . .&para;<br>sought to limit the subpoenas to discovery that was rea­&para;<br>sonably calculated to lead to attachable property.” 695&para;<br>F. 3d, at 204–205.&para;<br>NML and BOA later negotiated additional changes to&para;<br>the BOA subpoena. NML expressed its willingness to&para;<br>narrow its requests from BNA as well, but BNA neither&para;<br>engaged in negotiation nor complied with the subpoena.&para;<br>Only Argentina appealed, arguing that the court’s order&para;<br>transgressed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act be­&para;<br>cause it permitted discovery of Argentina’s extraterritorial&para;<br>assets. The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that “be­&para;<br>cause the Discovery Order involves discovery, not attach­&para;<br>ment of sovereign property, and because it is directed at&para;<br>third-party banks, not at Argentina itself, Argentina’s&para;<br>sovereign immunity is not infringed.” Id., at 205.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 571 U.

Analysis&para;<br>A&para;<br>The rules governing discovery in postjudgment execu­&para;<br>tion proceedings are quite permissive. Federal Rule of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 69(a)(2) states that, “[i]n aid of the judg­&para;<br>ment or execution, the judgment creditor . . . may obtain&para;<br>discovery from any person—including the judgment debtor—&para;<br>as provided in the rules or by the procedure of the&para;<br>state where the court is located.” See 12 C. Wright, A.&para;<br>Miller, &amp; R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure&para;<br>§3014, p. 160 (2d ed. 1997) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller)&para;<br>(court “may use the discovery devices provided in [the&para;<br>federal rules] or may obtain discovery in the manner&para;<br>provided by the practice of the state in which the district&para;<br>court is held”). The general rule in the federal system is&para;<br>that, subject to the district court’s discretion, “[p]arties&para;<br>may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter&para;<br>that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.” Fed. Rule&para;<br>Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1). And New York law entitles judgment&para;<br>creditors to discover “all matter relevant to the satisfac­&para;<br>tion of [a] judgment,” N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §5223&para;<br>(West 1997), permitting “investigation [of] any person&para;<br>shown to have any light to shed on the subject of the&para;<br>judgment debtor’s assets or their whereabouts,” D. Siegel,&para;<br>New York Practice §509, p. 891 (5th ed. 2011).&para;<br>The meaning of those rules was much discussed at oral&para;<br>argument. What if the assets targeted by the discovery&para;<br>request are beyond the jurisdictional reach of the court to&para;<br>which the request is made? May the court nonetheless&para;<br>permit discovery so long as the judgment creditor shows&para;<br>that the assets are recoverable under the laws of the&para;<br>jurisdictions in which they reside, whether that be Florida&para;<br>or France? We need not take up those issues today, since&para;<br>Argentina has not put them in contention. In the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, Argentina’s only asserted ground for objection to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the subpoenas was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.&para;<br>See 695 F. 3d, at 208 (“Argentina argues . . . that the&para;<br>normally broad scope of discovery in aid of execution is&para;<br>limited in this case by principles of sovereign immunity”).&para;<br>And Argentina’s petition for writ of certiorari asked us to&para;<br>decide only whether that Act “imposes [a] limit on a United&para;<br>States court’s authority to order blanket post-judgment&para;<br>execution discovery on the assets of a foreign state used&para;<br>for any activity anywhere in the world.” Pet. for Cert. 14.&para;<br>Plainly, then, this is not a case about the breadth of Rule&para;<br>69(a)(2).2 We thus assume without deciding that, as the&para;<br>Government conceded at argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 24,&para;<br>and as the Second Circuit concluded below, “in a run-of­&para;<br>the-mill execution proceeding . . . the district court would&para;<br>have been within its discretion to order the discovery from&para;<br>third-party banks about the judgment debtor’s assets&para;<br>located outside the United States.” 695 F. 3d, at 208. The&para;<br>single, narrow question before us is whether the Foreign&para;<br>Sovereign Immunities Act specifies a different rule when&para;<br>the judgment debtor is a foreign state.&para;<br>B&para;<br>To understand the effect of the Act, one must know&para;<br>something about the regime it replaced. Foreign sovereign&para;<br>immunity is, and always has been, “a matter of grace and&para;<br>comity on the part of the United States, and not a re­&para;<br>striction imposed by the Constitution.” Verlinden B. V. v.&para;<br>Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983). Ac­&para;<br>cordingly, this Court’s practice has been to “defe[r] to the&para;<br>decisions of the political branches” about whether and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 On one of the final pages of its reply brief, Argentina makes for the&para;<br>first time the assertion (which it does not develop, and for which it cites&para;<br>no authority) that the scope of Rule 69 discovery in aid of execution is&para;<br>limited to assets upon which a United States court can execute. Reply&para;<br>Brief 19. We will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the&para;<br>petitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>when to exercise judicial power over foreign states. Ibid.&para;<br>For the better part of the last two centuries, the political&para;<br>branch making the determination was the Executive,&para;<br>which typically requested immunity in all suits against&para;<br>friendly foreign states. Id., at 486–487. But then, in 1952,&para;<br>the State Department embraced (in the so-called Tate&para;<br>Letter) the “restrictive” theory of sovereign immunity,&para;<br>which holds that immunity shields only a foreign sover­&para;<br>eign’s public, noncommercial acts. Id., at 487, and n. 9.&para;<br>The Tate Letter “thr[ew] immunity determinations into&para;<br>some disarray,” since “political considerations sometimes&para;<br>led the Department to file suggestions of immunity in&para;<br>cases where immunity would not have been available&para;<br>under the restrictive theory.” Republic of Austria v. Alt­&para;<br>mann, 541 U. S. 677, 690 (2004) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Further muddling matters, when in particular&para;<br>cases the State Department did not suggest immunity,&para;<br>courts made immunity determinations “generally by refer­&para;<br>ence to prior State Department decisions.” Verlinden, 461&para;<br>U. S., at 487. Hence it was that “sovereign immunity&para;<br>decisions were [being] made in two different branches,&para;<br>subject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplo­&para;<br>matic considerations. Not surprisingly, the governing&para;<br>standards were neither clear nor uniformly applied.” Id.,&para;<br>at 488.&para;<br>Congress abated the bedlam in 1976, replacing the old&para;<br>executive-driven, factor-intensive, loosely common-law­&para;<br>based immunity regime with the Foreign Sovereign Im­&para;<br>munities Act’s “comprehensive set of legal standards&para;<br>governing claims of immunity in every civil action against&para;<br>a foreign state.” Ibid. The key word there—which goes a&para;<br>long way toward deciding this case—is comprehensive. We&para;<br>have used that term often and advisedly to describe the&para;<br>Act’s sweep: “Congress established [in the FSIA] a com­&para;<br>prehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign&para;<br>immunity.” Altman, 541 U. S., at 699. The Act “compre­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>hensively regulat[es] the amenability of foreign nations to&para;<br>suit in the United States.” Verlinden, supra, at 493. This&para;<br>means that “[a]fter the enactment of the FSIA, the Act—&para;<br>and not the pre-existing common law—indisputably gov­&para;<br>erns the determination of whether a foreign state is enti­&para;<br>tled to sovereign immunity.” Samantar v. Yousuf, 560&para;<br>U. S. 305, 313 (2010). As the Act itself instructs, “[c]laims&para;<br>of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided&para;<br>by courts . . . in conformity with the principles set forth in&para;<br>this [Act].” 28 U. S. C. §1602 (emphasis added). Thus, any&para;<br>sort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in&para;<br>an American court must stand on the Act’s text. Or it&para;<br>must fall.&para;<br>The text of the Act confers on foreign states two kinds of&para;<br>immunity. First and most significant, “a foreign state&para;<br>shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the&para;<br>United States . . . except as provided in sections 1605 to&para;<br>1607.” §1604. That provision is of no help to Argentina&para;<br>here: A foreign state may waive jurisdictional immunity,&para;<br>§1605(a)(1), and in this case Argentina did so, see 695&para;<br>F. 3d, at 203. Consequently, the Act makes Argentina&para;<br>“liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a&para;<br>private individual under like circumstances.” §1606.&para;<br>The Act’s second immunity-conferring provision states&para;<br>that “the property in the United States of a foreign state&para;<br>shall be immune from attachment[,] arrest[,] and execu­&para;<br>tion except as provided in sections 1610 and 1611 of this&para;<br>chapter.” §1609. The exceptions to this immunity defense&para;<br>(we will call it “execution immunity”) are narrower. “The&para;<br>property in the United States of a foreign state” is subject&para;<br>to attachment, arrest, or execution if (1) it is “used for a&para;<br>commercial activity in the United States,” §1610(a), and&para;<br>(2) some other enumerated exception to immunity applies,&para;<br>such as the one allowing for waiver, see §1610(a)(1)–(7).&para;<br>The Act goes on to confer a more robust execution immu­&para;<br>nity on designated international-organization property,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§1611(a), property of a foreign central bank, §1611(b)(1),&para;<br>and “property of a foreign state . . . [that] is, or is intended&para;<br>to be, used in connection with a military activity” and is&para;<br>either “of a military character” or “under the control of a&para;<br>military authority or defense agency,” §1611(b)(2).&para;<br>That is the last of the Act’s immunity-granting sections.&para;<br>There is no third provision forbidding or limiting discovery&para;<br>in aid of execution of a foreign-sovereign judgment debt­&para;<br>or’s assets. Argentina concedes that no part of the Act&para;<br>“expressly address[es] [postjudgment] discovery.” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 22. Quite right. The Act speaks of discovery&para;<br>only once, in a subsection requiring courts to stay discov­&para;<br>ery requests directed to the United States that would&para;<br>interfere with criminal or national-security matters,&para;<br>§1605(g)(1). And that section explicitly suspends certain&para;<br>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when such a stay is&para;<br>entered, see §1605(g)(4). Elsewhere, it is clear when the&para;<br>Act’s provisions specifically applicable to suits against&para;<br>sovereigns displace their general federal-rule counter­&para;<br>parts. See, e.g., §1608(d). Far from containing the “plain&para;<br>statement” necessary to preclude application of federal&para;<br>discovery rules, Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale&para;<br>v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa,&para;<br>482 U. S. 522, 539 (1987), the Act says not a word on the&para;<br>subject.3&para;<br>Argentina would have us draw meaning from this si­&para;<br>lence. Its argument has several parts. First, it asserts&para;<br>that, before and after the Tate Letter, the State Depart­&para;<br>ment and American courts routinely accorded absolute&para;<br>execution immunity to foreign-state property. If a thing&para;<br>belonged to a foreign sovereign, then, no matter where it&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Argentina and the United States suggest that, under the terms of&para;<br>Rule 69 itself, the Act trumps the federal rules, since Rule 69(a)(1)&para;<br>states that “a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.” But,&para;<br>since the Act does not contain implicit discovery-immunity protections,&para;<br>it does not “apply” (in the relevant sense) at all.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was found, it was immune from execution. And absolute&para;<br>immunity from execution necessarily entailed immunity&para;<br>from discovery in aid of execution. Second, by codifying&para;<br>execution immunity with only a small set of exceptions,&para;<br>Congress merely “partially lowered the previously uncon­&para;<br>ditional barrier to post-judgment relief.” Brief for Peti­&para;<br>tioner 29. Because the Act gives “no indication that it was&para;<br>authorizing courts to inquire into state property beyond&para;<br>the court’s limited enforcement authority,” ibid., Argen­&para;<br>tina contends, discovery of assets that do not fall within an&para;<br>exception to execution immunity (plainly true of a foreign&para;<br>state’s extraterritorial assets) is forbidden.&para;<br>The argument founders at each step. To begin with,&para;<br>Argentina cites no case holding that, before the Act, a&para;<br>foreign state’s extraterritorial assets enjoyed absolute&para;<br>execution immunity in United States courts. No surprise&para;<br>there. Our courts generally lack authority in the first&para;<br>place to execute against property in other countries, so&para;<br>how could the question ever have arisen? See Wright &amp;&para;<br>Miller §3013, at 156 (“[A] writ of execution . . . can be&para;<br>served anywhere within the state in which the district&para;<br>court is held”). More importantly, even if Argentina were&para;<br>right about the scope of the common-law execution­&para;<br>immunity rule, then it would be obvious that the terms of&para;<br>§1609 execution immunity are narrower, since the text of&para;<br>that provision immunizes only foreign-state property “in&para;<br>the United States.” So even if Argentina were correct that&para;<br>§1609 execution immunity implies coextensive discovery­&para;<br>in-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield&para;<br>from discovery a foreign sovereign’s extraterritorial assets.&para;<br>But what of foreign-state property that would enjoy&para;<br>execution immunity under the Act, such as Argentina’s&para;<br>diplomatic or military property? Argentina maintains&para;<br>that, if a judgment creditor could not ultimately execute a&para;<br>judgment against certain property, then it has no business&para;<br>pursuing discovery of information pertaining to that prop­&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>erty. But the reason for these subpoenas is that NML does&para;<br>not yet know what property Argentina has and where it is,&para;<br>let alone whether it is executable under the relevant&para;<br>jurisdiction’s law. If, bizarrely, NML’s subpoenas had&para;<br>sought only “information that could not lead to executable&para;<br>assets in the United States or abroad,” then Argentina&para;<br>likely would be correct to say that the subpoenas were&para;<br>unenforceable—not because information about nonexecut­&para;<br>able assets enjoys a penumbral “discovery immunity”&para;<br>under the Act, but because information that could not&para;<br>possibly lead to executable assets is simply not “relevant”&para;<br>to execution in the first place, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.&para;<br>26(b)(1); N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §5223.4 But of course&para;<br>that is not what the subpoenas seek. They ask for infor­&para;<br>mation about Argentina’s worldwide assets generally, so&para;<br>that NML can identify where Argentina may be holding&para;<br>property that is subject to execution.

The dissent&para;<br>goes on to assert that, unless a judgment creditor proves up front that&para;<br>all of the information it seeks is relevant to execution under the laws of&para;<br>all foreign jurisdictions, discovery of information concerning extraterri­&para;<br>torial assets is limited to that which the Act makes relevant to execu­&para;<br>tion in the United States.

S. C. §§1330, 1602 et seq., if one of several conditions is&para;<br>met, permits execution of a judgment rendered in the&para;<br>United States against a foreign sovereign only on “property&para;<br>in the United States . . . used for a commercial activity.”&para;<br>§1610(a). Accordingly, no inquiry into a foreign sovereign’s property in the United States that is not “used for a&para;<br>commercial activity” could be ordered; such an inquiry,&para;<br>as the Court recognizes, would not be “ ‘relevant’ to execution in the first place.” Ante, at 10 (citing Fed. Rule Civ.&para;<br>Proc. 26(b)(1)). Yet the Court permits unlimited inquiry&para;<br>into Argentina’s property outside the United States,&para;<br>whether or not the property is “used for a commercial&para;<br>activity.” By what authorization does a court in the United&para;<br>States become a “clearinghouse for information,” ante,&para;<br>at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), about any and all&para;<br>property held by Argentina abroad? NML may seek such&para;<br>information, the Court reasons, because “NML does not yet&para;<br>know what property Argentina has [outside the United&para;<br>States], let alone whether it is executable under the relevant jurisdiction’s law.” Ante, at 10.

Without proof of any kind that other nations&para;<br>broadly expose a foreign sovereign’s property to arrest,&para;<br>attachment or execution, a more modest assumption is in&para;<br>order. See EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 695 F. 3d&para;<br>201, 207 (CA2 2012) (recognizing that postjudgment discovery “must be calculated to assist in collecting on a&para;<br>judgment” (citing Fed.

Accordingly, I would limit NML’s&para;<br>discovery to property used here or abroad “in connection&para;<br>with . . . commercial activities.” §§1602, 1610(a). I therefore dissent from the sweeping examination of Argentina’s&para;<br>worldwide assets the Court exorbitantly approves today.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
