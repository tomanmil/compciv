PINHOLSTER&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1088. Argued November 9, 2010—Decided April 4, 2011&para;<br>A California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first&para;<br>degree murder. At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prose&para;<br>cution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s his&para;<br>tory of threatening and violent behavior. Pinholster’s trial counsel,&para;<br>who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the&para;<br>ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice&para;<br>under California law, called only Pinholster’s mother. Counsel did&para;<br>not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg,&para;<br>who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.&para;<br>The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sen&para;<br>tenced to death. Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the Califor&para;<br>nia Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had&para;<br>failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence dur&para;<br>ing the penalty phase. He introduced additional evidence to support&para;<br>his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from&para;<br>family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychia&para;<br>trist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure dis&para;<br>orders, and who criticized Dr. Stalberg’s report. Each time, the State&para;<br>Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the&para;<br>merits. Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary&para;<br>hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254. Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the&para;<br>new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the&para;<br>State Supreme Court’s decision “involved an unreasonable applica&para;<br>tion of . . . clearly established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Review under §2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before&para;<br>the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen&para;<br>alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), §2254 sets several limits on a federal&para;<br>court’s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner. As relevant&para;<br>here, a claim that has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court&para;<br>proceedings,” “shall not be granted . . . unless the adjudication” “(1)&para;<br>resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason&para;<br>able application of, clearly established Federal law,” or “(2) resulted&para;<br>in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the&para;<br>facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>§2254(d). This “difficult to meet,” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, and “ ‘highly deferential standard’ . . . demands that state&para;<br>court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,” Woodford v. Vis&para;<br>ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24. Section 2254(d)(1)’s backward-looking lan&para;<br>guage—“resulted in” and “involved”—requires an examination of the&para;<br>state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the re&para;<br>cord under review is also limited to the record in existence at that&para;<br>same time—i.e., the state-court record. This understanding is com&para;<br>pelled by “the broader context of the statute as a whole,” which dem&para;<br>onstrates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first to state&para;<br>courts. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. It is also con&para;<br>sistent with this Court’s precedents, which emphasize that&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did. See,&para;<br>e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72. Moreover, it is consis&para;<br>tent with Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474, which explained&para;<br>that a federal habeas court is “not required to hold an evidentiary&para;<br>hearing” when the state-court record “precludes habeas relief” under&para;<br>§2254(d)’s limitations. The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Wil&para;<br>liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, and Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649,&para;<br>as supporting the contrary view. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(b) This holding does not render superfluous §2254(e)(2)—which&para;<br>limits the federal habeas courts’ discretion to take new evidence in an&para;<br>evidentiary hearing. At a minimum, §2254(e)(2) still restricts their&para;<br>discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state&para;<br>court. Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence&para;<br>in federal court, AEDPA’s statutory scheme is designed to strongly&para;<br>discourage them from doing so. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(c) Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here,&para;<br>because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster&para;<br>merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone. P. 14.&para;<br>2. On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled&para;<br>to federal habeas relief. Pp. 14‘–31.&para;<br>(a) To satisfy §2254(d)(1)’s “unreasonable application” prong, he&para;<br>must show that “there was no reasonable basis” for the State Su&para;<br>preme Court’s summary decision. Richter, supra, at ___. Pp. 15–16.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(b) Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, provides the clearly&para;<br>established federal law here. To overcome the strong presumption&para;<br>that counsel has acted competently, id., at 690, a defendant must&para;<br>show that counsel failed to act “reasonabl[y] considering all the cir&para;<br>cumstances,” id., at 688, and must prove the “reasonable probability&para;<br>that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed&para;<br>ing would have been different,” id., at 694. Review here is thus “dou&para;<br>bly deferential,” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___, requiring&para;<br>a “highly deferential” look at counsel’s performance, Strickland, su&para;<br>pra, at 689, through §2254(d)’s “deferential lens,” Mirzayance, supra,&para;<br>at ___, n. 2. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>(c) Pinholster has not shown that the State Supreme Court’s de&para;<br>cision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his&para;<br>trial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of fed&para;<br>eral law. Pp. 18–26.&para;<br>(1) The state-court record supports the idea that his counsel&para;<br>acted strategically to get the prosecution’s aggravation witnesses ex&para;<br>cluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on his mother as a&para;<br>mitigation witness. Billing records show that they spent time inves&para;<br>tigating mitigating evidence. The record also shows that they had an&para;<br>unsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history dur&para;<br>ing the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.&para;<br>In addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no sig&para;<br>nificant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholster’s medi&para;<br>cal and social history. Given these impediments, it would have been&para;<br>a reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for&para;<br>Pinholster’s mother. Pinholster has responded with only a handful of&para;<br>post-hoc nondenials by one of his lawyers. Pp. 18–23.&para;<br>(2) The Ninth Circuit misapplied Strickland when it drew from&para;<br>this Court’s recent cases a “constitutional duty to investigate” and a&para;<br>principle that it was prima facie ineffective for counsel to abandon an&para;<br>investigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholster’s back&para;<br>ground. Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, “specific&para;<br>guidelines are not appropriate” under Strickland. 466 U. S., at 688.&para;<br>Nor did the Ninth Circuit properly apply the strong presumption of&para;<br>competence mandated by Strickland. Pp. 23–26.&para;<br>(d) Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster&para;<br>also has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have un&para;<br>reasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced. Pp. 26–31.&para;<br>(1) To determine “whether there is a reasonable probability&para;<br>that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that”&para;<br>death was not warranted, Strickland, supra, at 695, the aggravating&para;<br>evidence is reweighed “against the totality of available mitigating&para;<br>evidence,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534. Here, the State pre&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty&para;<br>phases. The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty&para;<br>phase testimony of Pinholster’s mother and guilt-phase testimony&para;<br>given by his brother. After considering the evidence, the jury re&para;<br>turned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found sup&para;<br>ported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence. Pp. 26–29.&para;<br>(2) There is no reasonable probability that the additional evi&para;<br>dence presented at Pinholster’s state proceedings would have&para;<br>changed the verdict. The “new” evidence largely duplicated the miti&para;<br>gation evidence of his mother and brother at trial. To the extent that&para;<br>there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of ques&para;<br>tionable mitigating value. Dr. Woods’ testimony would have opened&para;<br>the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to&para;<br>Pinholster’s substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems&para;<br>could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation. The&para;<br>remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse. Given&para;<br>what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in&para;<br>state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Court’s&para;<br>determination was unreasonable. Pp. 29–30.&para;<br>(3) Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the&para;<br>question of prejudice in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, and Rom&para;<br>pilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, those cases lack the important “doubly&para;<br>deferential” standard of Strickland and AEDPA, and thus offer no&para;<br>guidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably de&para;<br>termined that prejudice is lacking.

PINHOLSTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>On the evening of January 8, 1982, Pinholster solicited&para;<br>Art Corona and Paul David Brown to help him rob Mi­&para;<br>chael Kumar, a local drug dealer. On the way, they&para;<br>stopped at Lisa Tapar’s house, where Pinholster put his&para;<br>buck knife through her front door and scratched a swas­&para;<br>tika into her car after she refused to talk to him. The&para;<br>three men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no&para;<br>one at Kumar’s house, broke in, and began ransacking the&para;<br>home. They came across only a small amount of mari­&para;<br>juana before Kumar’s friends, Thomas Johnson and&para;<br>Robert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling&para;<br>the police.&para;<br>Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through&para;<br>the rear door, but Johnson blocked their path. Pinholster&para;<br>backed Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and&para;<br>money and repeatedly striking him in the chest. Johnson&para;<br>dropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting.&para;<br>Beckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster&para;<br>attacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.&para;<br>Pinholster forced Beckett to the ground, took both men’s&para;<br>wallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head. Mean­&para;<br>while, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, “ ‘bury[ing] his&para;<br>knife to the hilt.’ ” 35 Reporter’s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.).&para;<br>Johnson and Beckett died of their wounds.&para;<br>Corona drove the three men to Pinholster’s apartment.&para;<br>While in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, “ ‘We got&para;<br>’em, man, we got ’em good.’ ” Ibid. At the apartment,&para;<br>Pinholster washed his knife, and the three split the pro­&para;<br>ceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of mari­&para;<br>juana. Although Pinholster instructed Corona to “lay&para;<br>low,” Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks&para;<br>later. Id., at 4955. Pinholster was arrested shortly there­&para;<br>after and threatened to kill Corona if he did not keep quiet&para;<br>about the burglary and murders. Corona later became the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>State’s primary witness. The prosecution brought numer­&para;<br>ous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of&para;<br>first-degree murder.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and&para;<br>Wilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first­&para;<br>degree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their ap­&para;<br>pointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and&para;<br>insisted on representing himself. During that time, the&para;<br>State had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him&para;<br>that the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence&para;<br>during the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of&para;<br>death.&para;<br>The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.&para;<br>Pinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an&para;<br>alibi defense. He claimed that he had broken into&para;<br>Kumar’s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982,&para;<br>and had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone.&para;<br>Pinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m.,&para;<br>while he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar’s house to&para;<br>steal more drugs and did not return for three hours.&para;<br>Pinholster told the jury that he was a “professional rob­&para;<br>ber,” not a murderer. 43 id., at 6204. He boasted of com­&para;<br>mitting hundreds of robberies over the previous six years&para;<br>but insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The&para;<br>jury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree&para;<br>murder.&para;<br>Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved&para;<br>to exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that&para;<br>the prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence&para;<br>to be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann.&para;<br>§190.3 (West 2008). At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar&para;<br>argued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was “not&para;<br>presently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.”&para;<br>52 Tr. 7250. He acknowledged, however, that the prosecu­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tor “possibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.” Ibid.&para;<br>The trial court asked whether a continuance might be&para;<br>helpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could&para;<br>not think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster’s&para;<br>mother and that additional time would not “make a great&para;<br>deal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. Three days later,&para;<br>after hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster&para;<br>had received notice while representing himself and denied&para;<br>the motion to exclude.&para;<br>The penalty phase was held before the same jury that&para;<br>had convicted Pinholster. The prosecution produced eight&para;<br>witnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s history of&para;<br>threatening and violent behavior, including resisting&para;<br>arrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with&para;<br>juvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary&para;<br>record. Defense counsel called only Pinholster’s mother,&para;<br>Burnice Brashear. She gave an account of Pinholster’s&para;<br>troubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pin­&para;<br>holster’s siblings, and described Pinholster as “a perfect&para;<br>gentleman at home.” Id., at 7405. Defense counsel did not&para;<br>call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John&para;<br>Stalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted&para;<br>Pinholster’s “psychopathic personality traits,” diagnosed&para;<br>him with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded&para;<br>that he “was not under the influence of extreme mental or&para;<br>emotional disturbance” at the time of the murders. App.&para;<br>131.&para;<br>After 2½ days of deliberation, the jury unanimously&para;<br>voted for death on each of the two murder counts. On&para;<br>mandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed&para;<br>the judgment. People v. Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th 865, 824&para;<br>P. 2d 571 (1992).&para;<br>C&para;<br>In August 1993, Pinholster filed his first state habeas&para;<br>petition.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty&para;<br>phase of his trial. He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar&para;<br>had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigat­&para;<br>ing evidence, including evidence of mental disorders.&para;<br>Pinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and&para;<br>legal records, as well as declarations from family mem­&para;<br>bers, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who&para;<br>diagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and&para;<br>seizure disorders. Dr. Woods criticized Dr. Stalberg’s&para;<br>report as incompetent, unreliable, and inaccurate. The&para;<br>California Supreme Court unanimously and summarily1&para;<br>denied Pinholster’s penalty-phase ineffective-assistance&para;<br>claim “on the substantive ground that it is without merit.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 302.&para;<br>Pinholster filed a federal habeas petition in April 1997.&para;<br>He reiterated his previous allegations about penalty-phase&para;<br>ineffective assistance and also added new allegations that&para;<br>his trial counsel had failed to furnish Dr. Stalberg with&para;<br>adequate background materials. In support of the new&para;<br>allegations, Dr. Stalberg provided a declaration stating&para;<br>that in 1984, Pinholster’s trial counsel had provided him&para;<br>with only some police reports and a 1978 probation report.&para;<br>Dr. Stalberg explained that, had he known about the&para;<br>material that had since been gathered by Pinholster’s&para;<br>habeas counsel, he would have conducted “further inquiry”&para;<br>before concluding that Pinholster suffered only from a&para;<br>personality disorder.

PINHOLSTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was held in abeyance to allow Pinholster to go back to&para;<br>state court.&para;<br>In August 1997, Pinholster filed his second state habeas&para;<br>petition, this time including Dr. Stalberg’s declaration and&para;<br>requesting judicial notice of the documents previously&para;<br>submitted in support of his first state habeas petition. His&para;<br>allegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of coun­&para;<br>sel mirrored those in his federal habeas petition. The&para;<br>California Supreme Court again unanimously and sum­&para;<br>marily denied the petition “on the substantive ground that&para;<br>it is without merit.”2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 300.&para;<br>Having presented Dr. Stalberg’s declaration to the state&para;<br>court, Pinholster returned to the District Court. In No­&para;<br>vember 1997, he filed an amended petition for a writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus. His allegations of penalty-phase ineffec­&para;<br>tive assistance of counsel were identical to those in his&para;<br>second state habeas petition. Both parties moved for&para;<br>summary judgment and Pinholster also moved, in the&para;<br>alternative, for an evidentiary hearing.&para;<br>The District Court concluded that the Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat.&para;<br>1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing.&para;<br>Before the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stalberg, who&para;<br>stated that none of the new material he reviewed altered&para;<br>his original diagnosis. Dr. Stalberg disagreed with Dr.&para;<br>Woods’ conclusion that Pinholster suffers from bipolar&para;<br>disorder. Pinholster did not call Dr. Stalberg to testify at&para;<br>the hearing.

C. §2254 sets several&para;<br>limits on the power of a federal court to grant an applica­&para;<br>tion for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a state pris­&para;<br>oner. Section 2254(a) permits a federal court to entertain&para;<br>only those applications alleging that a person is in state&para;<br>custody “in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties&para;<br>of the United States.” Sections 2254(b) and (c) provide&para;<br>that a federal court may not grant such applications&para;<br>unless, with certain exceptions, the applicant has ex­&para;<br>hausted state remedies.&para;<br>If an application includes a claim that has been “adjudi­&para;<br>cated on the merits in State court proceedings,” §2254(d),&para;<br>an additional restriction applies. Under §2254(d), that&para;<br>application “shall not be granted with respect to [such a]&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

This backward­&para;<br>looking language requires an examination of the state­&para;<br>court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the&para;<br>record under review is limited to the record in existence at&para;<br>that same time⎯i.e., the record before the state court.&para;<br>This understanding of the text is compelled by “the&para;<br>broader context of the statute as a whole,” which demon­&para;<br>strates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first&para;<br>to the state courts.

In practical effect, we went on to note, this&para;<br>means that when the state-court record “precludes habeas&para;<br>relief” under the limitations of §2254(d), a district court is&para;<br>“not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.” Id., at 474&para;<br>(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit’s recognition that&para;<br>“an evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can&para;<br>be resolved by reference to the state court record” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted Williams v.&para;<br>Taylor, 529 U.

In fact, only one claim at&para;<br>issue in that case was even subject to §2254(d); the rest&para;<br>had not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court&para;<br>proceedings.

The lower court in that case had determined&para;<br>that the one claim subject to §2254(d)(1) did not satisfy&para;<br>that statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this&para;<br>Court concluded that it was “unnecessary to reach the&para;<br>question whether §2254(e)(2) would permit a [federal]&para;<br>hearing on th[at] claim.” Id., at 444. That conclusion is&para;<br>fully consistent with our holding that evidence later intro­&para;<br>duced in federal court is irrelevant to §2254(d)(1) review.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Holland v. Jackson,&para;<br>542 U. S. 649 (2004) (per curiam), was also mistaken. In&para;<br>Holland, we initially stated that “whether a state court’s&para;<br>decision was unreasonable [under §2254(d)(1)] must be&para;<br>assessed in light of the record the court had before it.” Id.,&para;<br>at 652. We then went on to assume for the sake of argu­&para;<br>ment what some Courts of Appeals had held⎯that&para;<br>§2254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does&para;<br>not apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new&para;<br>evidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in&para;<br>state court.6 Id., at 653. There was no reason to decide&para;<br>that question because regardless, the hearing should have&para;<br>been barred by §2254(e)(2). Today, we reject that assump­&para;<br>tion and hold that evidence introduced in federal court&para;<br>has no bearing on §2254(d)(1) review.

Pinholster must demonstrate that it was necessarily&para;<br>unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to con­&para;<br>clude: (1) that he had not overcome the strong presump­&para;<br>tion of competence; and (2) that he had failed to under­&para;<br>mine confidence in the jury’s sentence of death.&para;<br>C&para;<br>1&para;<br>Pinholster has not shown that the California Supreme&para;<br>Court’s decision that he could not demonstrate deficient&para;<br>performance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an&para;<br>unreasonable application of federal law. In arguing to the&para;<br>state court that his counsel performed deficiently, Pinhol­&para;<br>ster contended that they should have pursued and pre­&para;<br>sented additional evidence about: his family members and&para;<br>their criminal, mental, and substance abuse problems; his&para;<br>schooling; and his medical and mental health history,&para;<br>including his epileptic disorder. To support his allegation&para;<br>that his trial counsel had “no reasonable tactical basis” for&para;<br>the approach they took, Pinholster relied on statements&para;<br>his counsel made at trial.

In response&para;<br>to the trial court’s inquiry as to whether a continuance&para;<br>might be helpful, Dettmar noted that the only mitigation&para;<br>witness he could think of was Pinholster’s mother. Addi­&para;<br>tional time, Dettmar stated, would not “make a great deal&para;<br>of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258.&para;<br>We begin with the premise that “under the circum­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

After all, the “ ‘family sympathy’ ” mitigation&para;<br>defense was known to the defense bar in California at the&para;<br>time and had been used by other attorneys. Id., at 707.&para;<br>Rather than displaying neglect, we presume that Dett­&para;<br>mar’s arguments were part of this trial strategy.

Other state­&para;<br>ments made during the argument regarding the motion to&para;<br>exclude suggest that defense counsel were trying to take&para;<br>advantage of a legal technicality and were not truly sur­&para;<br>prised.

Finally, Pinholster’s aunt once saw the children&para;<br>mixing flour and water to make something to eat, al­&para;<br>though “[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and&para;<br>foods of that ilk.” Id., at 1.&para;<br>Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinhol­&para;<br>ster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the&para;<br>California Supreme Court’s determination was unreason­&para;<br>able.

Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely&para;<br>have undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by&para;<br>Pinholster’s mother. The new material is thus not so&para;<br>significant that, even assuming Pinholster’s trial counsel&para;<br>performed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for&para;<br>the California Supreme Court to conclude that Pinholster&para;<br>had failed to show a “substantial” likelihood of a different&para;<br>sentence.

Or&para;<br>if the state-court rejection rested on only one of several&para;<br>related federal grounds (e.g., that counsel’s assistance was&para;<br>not “inadequate”), then, if the federal court found that the&para;<br>state court’s decision in respect to the ground it decided&para;<br>violated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider&para;<br>other related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,&para;<br>whether the counsel’s “inadequate” assistance was also&para;<br>prejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)&para;<br>hearing is needed as well.&para;<br>In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)&para;<br>hearing is needed until we know whether the state court,&para;<br>in rejecting Pinholster’s claim on the basis presented to&para;<br>that state court, violated (d).

In reading&para;<br>the statute to “compe[l]” this harsh result, ante, at 9,&para;<br>the Court ignores a key textual difference between&para;<br>§§2254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) and discards the previous&para;<br>understanding in our precedents that new evidence can, in&para;<br>fact, inform the §2254(d)(1) inquiry.

New&para;<br>evidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is&para;<br>now irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has&para;<br>satisfied §2254(d)(1).

The majority’s&para;<br>construction of §2254(d)(1) fails to give meaning to Con&para;<br>gress’ decision to include language referring to the evi&para;<br>dence presented to the state court in §2254(d)(2).

In particular, Con&para;<br>gress’ decision to include in AEDPA a provision,&para;<br>§2254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in&para;<br>certain circumstances provides further evidence that&para;<br>Congress did not intend to limit the §2254(d)(1) inquiry to&para;<br>the state-court record in every case.&para;<br>We have long recognized that some diligent habeas&para;<br>petitioners are unable to develop all of the facts support&para;<br>ing their claims in state court.4 As discussed above, in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529 U.

Some courts have held that when a federal&para;<br>court admits new evidence supporting a claim adjudicated&para;<br>on the merits in state court, §2254(d)(1) does not apply at&para;<br>all and the federal court may review the claim de novo.&para;<br>See ante, at 12; Holland v.

See ante, at 12. It would un&para;<br>dermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to de&para;<br>cline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim&para;<br>because the state court, through no fault of its own,&para;<br>lacked all the relevant evidence.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Of&para;<br>&para;<br>course, §2254(d)(1) only applies when a state court has adjudi&para;<br>cated a claim on the merits. There may be situations in which new&para;<br>evidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits gives rise to an&para;<br>altogether different claim. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 10–11&para;<br>(evidence withheld by the prosecutor relating to one claim may give rise&para;<br>to a separate claim under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.

The&para;<br>majority opinion does not foreclose this possibility.&para;<br>I assume that the majority does not intend to suggest that review is&para;<br>limited to the state-court record when a petitioner’s inability to develop&para;<br>the facts supporting his claim was the fault of the state court itself.

These courts have held&para;<br>that §2254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence&para;<br>properly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the&para;<br>reasonableness of the state-court decision. See Pinholster&para;<br>v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (“If the&para;<br>evidence is admissible under Michael Williams or&para;<br>§2254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner’s&para;<br>claims unexhausted . . . , then it is properly considered in&para;<br>evaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the&para;<br>state habeas court was a reasonable application of Su&para;<br>preme Court law”); accord, Wilson v.

This approach accommodates the competing goals,&para;<br>reflected in §§2254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according defer&para;<br>ence to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving&para;<br>the opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence&para;<br>to the federal court when they were unable to do so in&para;<br>state court.&para;<br>The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I&para;<br>am aware, no court of appeals has adopted: §2254(d)(1)&para;<br>continues to apply when a petitioner has additional evi&para;<br>dence that he was unable to present to the state court, but&para;<br>the district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding&para;<br>whether the petitioner has satisfied §2254(d)(1). The&para;<br>problem with this approach is its potential to bar federal&para;<br>habeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot&para;<br>present new evidence to a state court.&para;<br>Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently at&para;<br>tempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a&para;<br>claim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness&para;<br>statements in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83&para;<br>(1963). The state court denied relief on the ground that&para;<br>the withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level&para;<br>of materiality required under Brady.

See&para;<br>Michael Williams, 529 U.

Be&para;<br>cause the state court adjudicated the petitioner’s Brady&para;<br>claim on the merits, §2254(d)(1) would still apply.

S. 1, 7–8 (1992) (“[I]t is&para;<br>. . . irrational to distinguish between failing to properly&para;<br>assert a federal claim in state court and failing in state&para;<br>court to properly develop such a claim”).&para;<br>The majority responds to this anomaly by suggesting&para;<br>that my hypothetical petitioner “may well [have] a new&para;<br>claim.”7 Ante, at 14, n. 10. This suggestion is puzzling.&para;<br>New evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it&para;<br>merely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudi&para;<br>cated on the merits.8 The majority presumably means&para;<br>to suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain&para;<br>federal-court review of his new evidence if he can show&para;<br>cause and prejudice for his failure to present the “new”&para;<br>claim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the&para;<br>federal court would review the purportedly “new” claim de&para;<br>novo. The majority’s approach thus threatens to replace&para;<br>deferential review of new evidence under §2254(d)(1) with&para;<br>de novo review of new evidence in the form of “new”&para;<br>claims.9 Because it is unlikely that Congress intended&para;<br>de novo review—the result suggested by the majority’s&para;<br>opinion—it must have intended for district courts to&para;<br>consider newly discovered evidence in conducting the&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) analysis.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The majority declines, however, to provide any guidance to the lower&para;<br>courts on how to distinguish claims adjudicated on the merits from new&para;<br>claims.&para;<br>8 Even if it can fairly be argued that my hypothetical petitioner has a&para;<br>new claim, the majority fails to explain how a diligent petitioner with&para;<br>new evidence supporting an existing claim can present his new evi&para;<br>dence to a federal court.&para;<br>9 In this vein, it is the majority’s approach that “would not take seri&para;<br>ously AEDPA’s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court&para;<br>decisions.” Ante, at 10, n. 3.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v.

See ante, at 9–10 (“It would be contrary to&para;<br>[AEDPA’s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to&para;<br>overcome an adverse state-court decision with new evi&para;<br>dence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed&para;<br>by that court in the first instance effectively de novo”).10&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER takes the same position.

Where I disagree with the majority is in my&para;<br>understanding that §2254(e)(2) already accomplishes this&para;<br>result.&para;<br>By reading §2254(d)(1) to do the work of&para;<br>§2254(e)(2), the majority gives §2254(e)(2) an unnaturally&para;<br>cramped reading.

Under §2254(d)(1), federal courts routinely&para;<br>engage in analysis that the state court itself might never&para;<br>have conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a&para;<br>state court summarily denies a claim without explanation,&para;<br>as the California Supreme Court did here, district courts&para;<br>must deny habeas relief pursuant to §2254(d)(1) so long as&para;<br>“there is any reasonable argument” supporting the denial&para;<br>of the petitioner’s claim. Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 16). We likewise ask whether a state-court&para;<br>decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal&para;<br>law when the state court issued a reasoned decision but&para;<br>failed to cite federal law altogether. See Early v. Packer,&para;<br>537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). Determining whether a&para;<br>state court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief&para;<br>in light of newly discovered evidence is not so different&para;<br>than determining whether there is any reasonable basis&para;<br>for a state court’s unreasoned decision.&para;<br>Admittedly, the text of §2254(d)(1), standing alone, does&para;<br>not compel either reading of that provision. But constru&para;<br>ing §2254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence prop&para;<br>erly introduced in federal court best accords with the text&para;<br>of §2254(d)(2) and AEDPA’s structure as a whole. By&para;<br>interpreting §2254(d)(1) to prevent nondiligent petitioners&para;<br>from gaming the system—the very purpose of&para;<br>§2254(e)(2)—the majority potentially has put habeas relief&para;<br>out of reach for diligent petitioners with meritorious&para;<br>claims based on new evidence.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority claims that its holding is “consistent” with&para;<br>our case law. Ante, at 10. Quite the opposite is true: Our&para;<br>cases reflect our previous understanding that evidence&para;<br>properly admitted pursuant to §2254(e)(2) is relevant to&para;<br>the §2254(d)(1) analysis.&para;<br>In Landrigan, JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today’s&para;<br>opinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>between §§2254(d)(1) and 2254(e)(2). As noted above, we&para;<br>admonished district courts to consider whether a peti&para;<br>tioner’s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy §2254(d)&para;<br>in determining whether to grant a hearing. After high&para;<br>lighting the deference owed to state courts under&para;<br>§§2254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:&para;<br>“In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing,&para;<br>a federal court must consider whether such a hearing&para;<br>could enable an applicant to prove the petition’s fac&para;<br>tual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the&para;<br>applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the defer&para;<br>ential standards prescribed by §2254 control whether&para;<br>to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into&para;<br>account those standards in deciding whether an evi&para;<br>dentiary hearing is appropriate.” 550 U. S., at 474 (ci&para;<br>tation omitted).&para;<br>By instructing district courts to consider the §2254(d)&para;<br>standards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must&para;<br>have understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing&para;<br>could be considered in the §2254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief&para;<br>for American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 9&para;<br>(“The whole point of Landrigan’s admonition that the&para;<br>court must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye&para;<br>on §2254(d)(1) is that some proffers of evidence will not&para;<br>justify federal fact-finding in view of §2254(d)(1), but that&para;<br>other proffers of proof will”).11&para;<br>In Michael Williams, the warden argued that&para;<br>§2254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing whenever a peti&para;<br>tioner was unable to develop the factual record in state&para;<br>court, “whether or not through his own fault or neglect.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The majority overlooks this aspect of Landrigan. It quotes Landri&para;<br>gan’s observation that “if the record refutes the applicant’s factual&para;<br>allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not&para;<br>required to hold an evidentiary hearing,” 550 U.

Under the warden’s argument, a peti&para;<br>tioner who did not develop the record in state court, what&para;<br>ever the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence&para;<br>to the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we&para;<br>observed:&para;<br>“A prisoner who developed his claim in state court and&para;<br>can prove the state court’s decision was ‘contrary to,&para;<br>or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly es&para;<br>tablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States,’ is not barred from obtain&para;<br>ing relief by §2254(d)(1). If the opening clause of&para;<br>§2254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hear&para;<br>ing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but&para;<br>remained undeveloped in state court because, for in&para;<br>stance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner&para;<br>lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence&para;<br>could be barred from a hearing on the claim even if he&para;<br>could satisfy §2254(d).” Id., at 434 (citation omitted;&para;<br>emphasis added).&para;<br>A petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly&para;<br>be unable to “satisfy §2254(d)” without introducing the&para;<br>concealed facts in federal court. This passage thus reflects&para;<br>our understanding that, in some circumstances, a peti&para;<br>tioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court&para;<br>to prove the facts necessary to satisfy §2254(d). To avoid&para;<br>foreclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded&para;<br>that §2254(e)(2) could not bear the warden’s “harsh read&para;<br>ing,” which essentially would have held petitioners strictly&para;<br>at fault for their inability to develop the facts in state&para;<br>court. Ibid. The majority today gives an equally “harsh&para;<br>reading” to §2254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in&para;<br>Michael Williams.12&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 The majority claims that Michael Williams supports its reading of&para;<br>§2254(d)(1). With respect to one claim asserted by the petitioner, we&para;<br>observed that “[t]he Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>None of the other cases cited by the majority supports&para;<br>its result. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000)&para;<br>(Terry Williams), we interpreted §2254(d)(1) to ask&para;<br>whether the state-court decision “identifies the correct&para;<br>governing legal principle from this Court’s decisions but&para;<br>unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the&para;<br>prisoner’s case.” Id., at 413. However, we had no reason&para;<br>to decide whether the §2254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to&para;<br>the state-court record, as the District Court did not hold&para;<br>an evidentiary hearing in that case. See id., at 372.&para;<br>In Holland v. Jackson, we stated that “we have made&para;<br>clear that whether a state court’s decision was unreason&para;<br>able must be assessed in light of the record the court had&para;<br>before it.” 542 U. S., at 652. In the next sentence, how&para;<br>ever, we observed that the evidence at issue “could have&para;<br>been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District&para;<br>Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to&para;<br>develop that evidence in state court.” Id., at 652–653. We&para;<br>proceeded to find that the evidence was not properly ad&para;<br>mitted under §2254(e)(2) before concluding that the Court&para;<br>of Appeals had erred in its §2254(d)(1) analysis. Id., at&para;<br>653; see also Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.

In reading&para;<br>our precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the ma&para;<br>jority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision&para;<br>in Michael Williams: Some petitioners, even if diligent,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>under §2254(d)(1), so it is unnecessary to reach the question whether&para;<br>§2254(e)(2) would permit a hearing on the claim.” 529 U.

I therefore highlight several aspects of the&para;<br>facts and history of this case.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 I&para;<br>&para;<br>agree with the majority that the state-court record in this case&para;<br>consists of “the ‘allegations of [the] habeas corpus petition . . . and . . .&para;<br>any matter of record pertaining to the case.’ ” Ante, at 16, n. 12 (quot&para;<br>ing In re Hochberg, 2 Cal. 3d 870, 874, n. 2, 471 P. 2d 1, 3–4, n. 2&para;<br>(1970); some internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The majority does not decide which of the two state-court decisions&para;<br>should be reviewed. See ante, at 15, n. 11. One amicus argues that&para;<br>Pinholster must prove that both state-court decisions involved an&para;<br>unreasonable application of law. See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal&para;<br>Foundation as Amicus Curiae 26. This argument is based on amicus’&para;<br>understanding that the California Supreme Court rejected the second&para;<br>petition as successive and, alternatively, on the merits. The State has&para;<br>not argued, however, that the second ruling rests on a procedural&para;<br>ground. See ante, at 6, n. 2. When a state court denies two petitions on&para;<br>the merits and the difference between the petitions is that the second&para;<br>petition contains additional evidence supporting the petitioner’s claim,&para;<br>I see no reason why the petitioner must independently show that the&para;<br>first decision was unreasonable.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the court in&para;<br>structed the jury to return six days later for the penalty&para;<br>phase. This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding&para;<br>whether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer&para;<br>aggravating evidence. Pinholster’s court-appointed attor&para;<br>ney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be&para;<br>precluded from offering aggravating evidence:&para;<br>“I am not presently prepared to offer anything by way&para;<br>of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on mitigation,&para;<br>the people would have the right to rebuttal with or&para;<br>without notice.&para;<br>“I took the position, since the people had not given&para;<br>notice, I had not prepared any evidence by way of miti&para;<br>gation. I would submit it on that basis.” 52 Re&para;<br>porter’s Tr. 7250 (hereinafter Tr.) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Undoubtedly anticipating that counsel might need addi&para;<br>tional time to prepare an adequate mitigation defense, the&para;<br>court asked Dettmar whether a continuance would be&para;<br>helpful in the event it ruled against him. He declined the&para;<br>offer on the spot, stating: “I think we would probably still&para;<br>go forward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes&para;<br>to mind is the defendant’s mother. How much beyond that&para;<br>I don’t know. I don’t think the pa[ss]age of time would&para;<br>make a great deal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. After&para;<br>hearing testimony, the court denied Pinholster’s motion to&para;<br>preclude aggravating evidence.&para;<br>At the penalty phase, defense counsel called only one&para;<br>witness: Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear. Brashear&para;<br>testified that Pinholster “never really wanted for anything&para;<br>at home too much” and “had everything normally materi&para;<br>alwise that most people have.” Id., at 7395. She said that&para;<br>Pinholster was “different” from his siblings, whom she&para;<br>characterized as “basically very good children.” Id., at&para;<br>7401–7402.

She described two car accidents—one&para;<br>when she ran over him in the driveway and one when he&para;<br>went through the windshield. Id., at 7389–7391. She&para;<br>stated that he started failing school in the first grade and&para;<br>that the school eventually “sent him to [an] educationally&para;<br>handicapped class.” Id., at 7393–7394. When Pinholster&para;<br>was 10, a psychologist recommended placing him in a&para;<br>mental institution, but she “didn’t think he was that far&para;<br>gone.” Id., at 7395. A few years later, she testified, he&para;<br>spent six months in a state hospital for emotionally handi&para;<br>capped children. Id., at 7402.&para;<br>According to Brashear, Pinholster had suffered from&para;<br>epilepsy since age 18, when he was beaten in jail. Id.,&para;<br>at 7397. She said that her family doctor, Dr. Dubin,&para;<br>had given him medication to treat the epilepsy. Ibid.&para;<br>Brashear also suggested that Pinholster did not have long&para;<br>to live, stating that he had “a chip in his head floating&para;<br>around” and that “they don’t think—he won’t be here very&para;<br>much longer anyway.”14 Ibid.&para;<br>In closing argument, the prosecutor ridiculed Brashear’s&para;<br>testimony. See 53 id., at 7442 (“She said his stepfather&para;<br>disciplined him. So what? I am sure you have all disci&para;<br>plined your children. I was disciplined myself”); ibid.

You heard that he was not a&para;<br>deprived child. Had many things going for him, probably&para;<br>more than many children.” Id., at 7442.&para;<br>Notwithstanding the meager mitigation case presented&para;<br>by Pinholster’s counsel, it took the jury two days to reach a&para;<br>decision to sentence Pinholster to death. His counsel later&para;<br>moved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment. In&para;<br>denying the motion, the trial judge stated, “The evidence&para;<br>which the defense offered concerning the defendant’s&para;<br>extenuation was merely some testimony from his mother&para;<br>that was not persuasive. His mother did not, in the court’s&para;<br>opinion, present any evidence which the court would find&para;<br>to be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.&para;<br>No witness supplied such evidence.” 54 id., at 7514.&para;<br>2&para;<br>After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on&para;<br>appeal, Pinholster filed a habeas petition in the California&para;<br>Supreme Court alleging, among other things, that his&para;<br>counsel had “unreasonably failed to investigate, prepare&para;<br>and present available mitigating evidence during penalty&para;<br>phase.” Record ER–103.&para;<br>Pinholster’s state-court petition included 121 exhibits.&para;<br>In a series of declarations, his trial attorney Harry&para;<br>Brainard (who had by then been disbarred) confirmed&para;<br>what Dettmar had forthrightly told the trial court:&para;<br>Brainard and Dettmar neither expected nor prepared to&para;<br>present mitigation evidence.15 See id., at ER–333 (“Mr.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 By the time of Pinholster’s state-court habeas petition, Dettmar&para;<br>was deceased.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Brainard further&para;<br>confirmed what was apparent from the mitigation case&para;<br>they eventually put on: They conducted virtually no miti&para;<br>gation investigation. See id., at ER–182 (“I have no recol&para;<br>lection of Mr. Dettmar having secured or reviewed any of&para;<br>Scott’s medical records, nor did I see any of Scott’s medical&para;<br>records.

Pinholster was “raised in chaos and poverty.” Id.,&para;<br>at ER–312. A relative remembered seeing the children&para;<br>mix together flour and water in an attempt to get some&para;<br>thing to eat.

PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Documentary evidence showed, directly contrary to&para;<br>Brashear’s trial testimony, that Pinholster’s siblings had&para;<br>very troubled pasts. Pinholster’s elder brother was ar&para;<br>rested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a&para;<br>14-year-old with a deadly weapon. While in custody, he&para;<br>was diagnosed as “catatonic-like” and “acutely psychotic,&para;<br>probably suffering some type of schizophrenia.” Id., at&para;<br>ER–219, ER–224. He later committed suicide.17 Pinhol&para;<br>ster’s half sister, a recovering alcoholic, had been made a&para;<br>ward of the juvenile court for prostitution and forcible&para;<br>sexual battery on a 14-year-old.&para;<br>Pinholster’s petition and exhibits described a long his&para;<br>tory of emotional disturbance and neurological problems.&para;<br>A former schoolteacher stated that, as a child, Pinholster&para;<br>“seemed incapable of relating either to his peers or to&para;<br>adults,” that “[i]t was even hard to maintain eye contact&para;<br>with him,” and that “[h]is hyperactivity was so extreme&para;<br>that [she] formed the opinion it probably had an organic&para;<br>base.” Id., at ER–231.

Ante, at 24.

There, counsel’s in&para;<br>vestigation was limited to three sources: psychological&para;<br>testing, a presentencing report, and Department of Social&para;<br>Services records. 539 U.

The records&para;<br>revealed that the petitioner’s mother was an alcoholic,&para;<br>that he displayed emotional difficulties in foster care, that&para;<br>he was frequently absent from school, and that on one&para;<br>occasion, his mother left him alone for days without food.&para;<br>Id., at 525. In these circumstances, we concluded, “any&para;<br>reasonably competent attorney would have realized that&para;<br>pursuing these leads was necessary to making an in&para;<br>formed choice among possible defenses.” Ibid. Accord&para;<br>ingly, we held, the state court’s assumption that counsel’s&para;<br>investigation was adequate was an unreasonable applica&para;<br>tion of Strickland. 539 U. S., at 528.23&para;<br>This case is remarkably similar to Wiggins. As the&para;<br>majority reads the record, counsel’s mitigation investiga&para;<br>tion consisted of talking to Pinholster’s mother, consulting&para;<br>with Dr. Stalberg, and researching epilepsy.24 Ante, at 20.&para;<br>What little information counsel gleaned from this “rudi&para;<br>mentary” investigation, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 524, would&para;<br>have led any reasonable attorney “to investigate further,”&para;<br>id., at 527.

S., at 526. Dettmar told the trial judge&para;<br>that he was unprepared to present any mitigation evi&para;<br>dence. The mitigation case that counsel eventually put on&para;<br>can be described, at best, as “halfhearted.” Ibid. Counsel&para;<br>made no effort to bolster Brashear’s self-interested testi&para;<br>mony with school or medical records, as the prosecutor&para;<br>effectively emphasized in closing argument. And because&para;<br>they did not pursue obvious leads, they failed to recognize&para;<br>that Brashear’s testimony painting Pinholster as the bad&para;<br>apple in a normal, nondeprived family was false.&para;<br>In denying Pinholster’s claim, the California Supreme&para;<br>Court necessarily overlooked Strickland’s clearly estab&para;<br>lished admonition that “strategic choices made after less&para;<br>than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to&para;<br>the extent that reasonable professional judgments support&para;<br>the limitations.” 466 U.

I agree that courts&para;<br>should not interpret our cases to prescribe strict rules regarding the&para;<br>required scope of mitigation investigations. See Rompilla v. Beard, 545&para;<br>U. S. 374, 394 (2005) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (noting “our longstand&para;<br>ing case-by-case approach to determining whether an attorney’s per&para;<br>formance was unconstitutionally deficient under Strickland”). The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit, however, did no such thing. It appropriately gave&para;<br>thoughtful consideration to the guideposts contained in these cases,&para;<br>just as we have previously done. See, e.g., Bobby v. Van Hook, 558&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8).&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>had failed to allege that his counsel’s investigation was&para;<br>inadequate under Strickland.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The majority also concludes that the California Supreme&para;<br>Court could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did&para;<br>not state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of&para;<br>the overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before&para;<br>the jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, “[t]he defendant&para;<br>must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but&para;<br>for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro&para;<br>ceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694. When a&para;<br>habeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, “the ques&para;<br>tion is whether there is a reasonable probability that,&para;<br>absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded&para;<br>that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circum&para;<br>stances did not warrant death.” Id., at 695. This inquiry&para;<br>requires evaluating “the totality of the available mitiga&para;<br>tion evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evi&para;<br>dence adduced in the habeas proceeding—in reweighing it&para;<br>against the evidence in aggravation.” Terry Williams, 529&para;<br>U. S., at 397–398. The ultimate question in this case is&para;<br>whether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggra&para;<br>vating evidence, “there is a reasonable probability that at&para;<br>least one juror would have struck a different balance.”&para;<br>Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal. Penal Code Ann.&para;<br>§190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict&para;<br>to impose a death sentence).&para;<br>1&para;<br>Like the majority, I first consider the aggravating and&para;<br>mitigating evidence presented at trial. By virtue of its&para;<br>verdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded&para;<br>that Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the&para;<br>majority states, the jury saw Pinholster “revel” in his&para;<br>history of burglaries during the guilt phase. Ante, at 26.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

He threatened to kill the State’s lead&para;<br>witness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in&para;<br>jail.&para;<br>Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently&para;<br>intended to be mitigating. See supra, at 19–20; see also&para;<br>ante, at 27–28.26 However, as the prosecutor argued,&para;<br>Brashear was not a neutral witness.

And&para;<br>Brashear’s statement that Pinholster would not be alive&para;<br>much longer because he had “a chip in his head floating&para;<br>around,” 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her&para;<br>credibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 id., at 7447&para;<br>(“Does she want you to believe sometime before he got to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>26 The majority mischaracterizes several aspects of Brashear’s testi&para;<br>mony.

As in Sears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the&para;<br>prosecutor used Brashear’s testimony that Pinholster&para;<br>came from a good family against him. See 53 Tr. 7442.&para;<br>In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating&para;<br>evidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their half&para;<br>hearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate&para;<br>for the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took two days&para;<br>to reach a decision to impose a death sentence.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The additional mitigating evidence presented to the&para;<br>California Supreme Court “adds up to a mitigation case&para;<br>that bears no relation” to Brashear’s unsubstantiated&para;<br>testimony. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 393.&para;<br>Assuming the evidence presented to the California&para;<br>Supreme Court to be true, as that court was required to&para;<br>do, the new mitigating evidence presented to that court&para;<br>would have shown that Pinholster was raised in “chaos&para;<br>and poverty.” Record ER–312. The family home was filled&para;<br>with violence. Pinholster’s siblings had extremely trou&para;<br>bled pasts. There was substantial evidence of “mental&para;<br>disturbance during Mr. Pinholster’s childhood and some&para;<br>degree of brain damage.” Id., at ER–493.&para;<br>Dr. Woods concluded that Pinholster’s aggressive con&para;<br>duct resulted from bipolar mood disorder. Just months&para;<br>before the murders, a doctor had recommended that Pin&para;<br>holster be sent to a psychiatric institute.

The available records con&para;<br>firmed that Pinholster suffered from longstanding seizure&para;<br>disorders, which may have been caused by his childhood&para;<br>head injuries.&para;<br>On this record, I do not see how it can be said that “[t]he&para;<br>‘new’ evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence&para;<br>at trial.” Ante, at 29; see Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S.&para;<br>279, 298–299 (1991) (evidence is not “merely cumulative”&para;<br>if it corroborates other evidence that is “unbelievable” on&para;<br>its own). Brashear’s self-interested testimony was not&para;<br>confirmed with objective evidence, as the prosecutor high&para;<br>lighted. The new evidence would have “destroyed the&para;<br>[relatively] benign conception of [Pinholster’s] upbringing”&para;<br>presented by his mother. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 391. The&para;<br>jury heard no testimony at all that Pinholster likely suf&para;<br>fered from brain damage or bipolar mood disorder, and&para;<br>counsel offered no evidence to help the jury understand&para;<br>the likely effect of Pinholster’s head injuries or his bizarre&para;<br>behavior on the night of the homicides. The jury heard no&para;<br>testimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinhol&para;<br>ster’s likely neurological problems. And it heard no medi&para;<br>cal evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy.&para;<br>The majority responds that “much” of Pinholster’s new&para;<br>mitigating evidence “is of questionable mitigating value.”&para;<br>Ante, at 29. By presenting psychiatric testimony, it con&para;<br>tends, “Pinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal&para;<br>by a state expert.” Ibid. But, because the California&para;<br>Supreme Court denied Pinholster’s petition on the plead&para;<br>ings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might&para;<br>have said. Moreover, given the record evidence, it is rea&para;<br>sonably probable that at least one juror would have cred&para;<br>ited his expert. In any event, even if a rebuttal expert&para;<br>testified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personal&para;<br>ity disorder, this would hardly have come as a surprise to&para;<br>the jury. See ante, at 22 (describing Pinholster as a “psy&para;<br>chotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>him to the jury”). It is for this reason that it was espe&para;<br>cially important for counsel to present the available evi&para;<br>dence to help the jury understand Pinholster. See Sears,&para;<br>561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6–7).&para;<br>Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the&para;<br>judge and jury would have heard credible evidence show&para;<br>ing that Pinholster’s criminal acts and aggressive tenden&para;<br>cies were “attributable to a disadvantaged background, or&para;<br>to emotional and mental problems.” Penry, 492 U. S., at&para;<br>319 (internal quotation marks omitted). They would have&para;<br>learned that Pinholster had the “ ‘kind of troubled history&para;<br>we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant’s&para;<br>moral culpability.’ ” Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)&para;<br>(quoting Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535). Applying Strickland,&para;<br>we have repeatedly found “a reasonable probability,” 466&para;<br>U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 12–13) (evi&para;<br>dence of the defendant’s childhood history of physical&para;<br>abuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic&para;<br>military service); Rompilla, 545 U.

S., at 398 (evidence of childhood&para;<br>mistreatment and neglect, head injuries, possible organic&para;<br>mental impairments, and borderline mental retardation).&para;<br>The majority does not dispute the similarity between&para;<br>this case and the cited cases. However, it criticizes the&para;<br>Court of Appeals for relying on Rompilla and Terry Wil&para;<br>liams on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice ques&para;<br>tion de novo in those cases.

In each of these cases, we did not purport to&para;<br>create new law; we simply applied the same clearly estab&para;<br>lished precedent, Strickland, to a different set of facts.&para;<br>Because these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation&para;<br>evidence that suffice to establish prejudice under Strick&para;<br>land, they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for&para;<br>courts to consider when determining whether a state court&para;<br>has unreasonably applied Strickland.&para;<br>In many cases, a state court presented with additional&para;<br>mitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is&para;<br>no “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofes&para;<br>sional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been&para;<br>different.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. This is not such&para;<br>a case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and&para;<br>killed two people, and his history of violent outbursts and&para;<br>burglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the&para;<br>homicides did not appear premeditated. And the State’s&para;<br>aggravation case was no stronger than in Rompilla and&para;<br>Terry Williams. See 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant&para;<br>committed murder by torture and had a significant history&para;<br>of violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U. S., at 418&para;<br>(Rehnquist, C.

Even on the trial record, it took the jury two&para;<br>days to decide on a penalty. The contrast between the “not&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>able in at least two respects”: (1) It applied the wrong legal standard,&para;<br>&para;<br>see 529 U.

The first&para;<br>was Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology&para;<br>and neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric&para;<br>Epilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center.&para;<br>It appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the&para;<br>testimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the fed&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>39&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>eral proceeding. See Decl. of Michael D. Abzug in Support&para;<br>of Stipulated Ex Parte Application to Continue Eviden&para;<br>tiary Hearing and Discovery Cut-Off and to Substitute&para;<br>Counsel in Pinholster v. Calderon, No. CV 95–6240–GLT&para;<br>(CD Cal.), p. 2. Relying in part on Pinholster’s abnormal&para;<br>EEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster’s childhood acci&para;<br>dents “likely result[ed] in brain injury” and that these&para;<br>injuries “conferred a risk of epilepsy.” Record ER–699 to&para;<br>ER–700. He concluded that it was reasonably probable&para;<br>that Pinholster had suffered from partial epilepsy since at&para;<br>least 1968 and had suffered from brain injury since at&para;<br>least 1964. Id., at ER–701.&para;<br>Pinholster’s second expert was Dr. Sophia Vinogradov,&para;<br>associate professor of psychiatry at the University of&para;<br>California, San Francisco. Dr. Vinogradov’s testimony&para;<br>was based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods’ and&para;<br>Dr. Stalberg’s state-court declarations. She highlighted&para;<br>Pinholster’s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy,&para;<br>abusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance&para;<br>abuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.&para;<br>She opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from&para;<br>childhood head traumas:&para;<br>“All data indicates that there were severe effects of&para;<br>the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and&para;<br>age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to&para;<br>dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and&para;<br>learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggres&para;<br>sivity, impulsivity, social-emotional impairment, sei&para;<br>zure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.” Id., at ER–&para;<br>731.&para;<br>She also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinhol&para;<br>ster was in an “apparently hallucinatory state [that] was&para;<br>likely the result of his intoxication with multiple sub&para;<br>stances.” Id., at ER–707&para;<br>The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>psychiatrist who had examined Pinholster in the middle of&para;<br>trial,28 and Dr. David Rudnick. Although Dr. Stalberg&para;<br>maintained that Pinholster suffered from antisocial per&para;<br>sonality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the&para;<br>middle of trial, he again emphasized that there was “vo&para;<br>luminous” and “compelling” mitigation evidence that had&para;<br>not previously been made available to him or presented to&para;<br>the jury. Id., at ER–926, ER–953. He stated that conver&para;<br>sations with Pinholster’s family revealed that he and his&para;<br>siblings were “raised like animals, wild animals,” id., at&para;<br>ER–948, and he opined that Pinholster’s upbringing was a&para;<br>risk factor for antisocial personality disorder. See ibid.&para;<br>(Pinholster’s upbringing “would speak volumes, looking at&para;<br>it from a mitigation point of view”). And he agreed that&para;<br>the mitigation evidence presented at trial was “profoundly&para;<br>misleading.” Id., at ER–966. Dr. Rudnick testified that&para;<br>Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.&para;<br>The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 proba&para;<br>tion report that Pinholster’s counsel had in their posses&para;<br>sion at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated that&para;<br>counsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for&para;<br>educationally handicapped children, that he was commit&para;<br>ted to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped chil&para;<br>dren, and that he suffered two “severe head injuries.” Id.,&para;<br>at SER–243.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>28 Before the hearing, Dr. Stalberg had opined that Pinholster was&para;<br>“substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergis&para;<br>tically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the crime&para;<br>was committed.” Record ER–587. At a prehearing deposition, however,&para;<br>Dr. Stalberg revised his opinion and stated that he continued to believe&para;<br>that Pinholster suffered from psychopathic personality traits. After the&para;<br>deposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert, pre&para;<br>sumably in light of Dr. Stalberg’s unexpected change in position. The&para;<br>State then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own expert.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>41&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was duplicative of the evidence submitted to the California&para;<br>Supreme Court. The additional evidence presented at the&para;<br>hearing only confirmed that the California Supreme Court&para;<br>could not reasonably have rejected Pinholster’s claim.29&para;<br>For example, the probation report presented by the&para;<br>State confirmed that counsel had in their possession in&para;<br>formation that would have led any reasonable attorney “to&para;<br>investigate further.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Counsel&para;<br>nevertheless took no action to investigate these leads.&para;<br>Pinholster’s experts opined that his childhood head&para;<br>traumas likely resulted in brain injury and conferred a&para;<br>risk of epilepsy. Although the State presented testimony&para;<br>that Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was&para;<br>not clear error for the District Court to conclude that&para;<br>jurors could have credited Pinholster’s experts. Even the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>29 The&para;<br>&para;<br>State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on&para;<br>the evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not dili&para;<br>gent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was there&para;<br>fore barred by 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat&para;<br>imprecise. Pinholster’s allegations in his amended federal petition&para;<br>were “identical” to the allegations he presented to the California&para;<br>Supreme Court, ante, at 6, and he diligently requested a hearing in&para;<br>state court. The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster’s&para;<br>new expert testimony changed “the factual basis” of his claim such that,&para;<br>by the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied&para;<br>§2254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State suggested that&para;<br>Pinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case, §2254(d)(1) does not apply at&para;<br>all, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural&para;<br>default. I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim&para;<br>to the District Court.&para;<br>In any event, Pinholster satisfied §2254(e)(2) in this case. He made&para;<br>“a reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time,&para;<br>to investigate and pursue claims in state court.” Michael Williams, 529&para;<br>U. S., at 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence. I&para;<br>cannot read §2254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners&para;<br>must use the same experts they presented to the state court. This rule&para;<br>would result in numerous practical problems, for example in the case of&para;<br>the unanticipated death of an expert.&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>State’s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the “volumi&para;<br>nous” mitigation evidence in Pinholster’s case. Record ER–&para;<br>926.&para;<br>In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already ap&para;<br>parent from the state-court record: Pinholster’s counsel&para;<br>failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,&para;<br>and there was a reasonable probability that at least one&para;<br>juror confronted with the “voluminous” mitigating evi&para;<br>dence counsel should have discovered would have voted to&para;<br>spare Pinholster’s life. Ibid. Accordingly, whether on the&para;<br>basis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below&para;<br>correctly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the&para;<br>California Supreme Court’s decision reflected an unrea&para;<br>sonable application of Strickland.30&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court’s ruling. I&para;<br>fear the consequences of the Court’s novel interpretation&para;<br>of §2254(d)(1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with&para;<br>compelling evidence supporting their claims who were&para;<br>unable, through no fault of their own, to present that&para;<br>evidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims.&para;<br>And the Court’s conclusion that the California Supreme&para;<br>Court reasonably denied Pinholster’s ineffective&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel’s failure to&para;<br>investigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast&para;<br>between the woefully inadequate mitigation case they&para;<br>presented and the evidence they should and would have&para;<br>discovered. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>30 The State’s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions&para;<br>whether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the addi&para;<br>tional evidence in the §2254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster&para;<br>satisfied §2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not&para;<br>challenged the District Court’s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had&para;<br>proved that he was “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws&para;<br>or treaties of the United States.” §2254(a).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
