COOPER&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–209.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 31, 2011—Decided March 21, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent&para;<br>to murder and three other offenses. The prosecution offered to dis­&para;<br>miss two of the charges and to recommend a 51-to-85-month sentence&para;<br>on the other two, in exchange for a guilty plea. In a communication&para;<br>with the court, respondent admitted his guilt and expressed a will­&para;<br>ingness to accept the offer. But he rejected the offer, allegedly after&para;<br>his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to&para;<br>establish intent to murder because the victim had been shot below&para;<br>the waist. At trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and re­&para;<br>ceived a mandatory minimum 185-to-360-month sentence. In a sub­&para;<br>sequent hearing, the state trial court rejected respondent’s claim that&para;<br>his attorney’s advice to reject the plea constituted ineffective assis­&para;<br>tance. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the ineffec­&para;<br>tive-assistance claim on the ground that respondent knowingly and&para;<br>intelligently turned down the plea offer and chose to go to trial. Re­&para;<br>spondent renewed his claim in federal habeas. Finding that the state&para;<br>appellate court had unreasonably applied the constitutional effective­&para;<br>assistance standards laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.&para;<br>668, and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, the District Court granted a&para;<br>conditional writ and ordered specific performance of the original plea&para;<br>offer. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. Applying Strickland, it found that&para;<br>counsel had provided deficient performance by advising respondent of&para;<br>an incorrect legal rule, and that respondent suffered prejudice be­&para;<br>cause he lost the opportunity to take the more favorable sentence of­&para;<br>fered in the plea.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Where counsel’s ineffective advice led to an offer’s rejection, and&para;<br>where the prejudice alleged is having to stand trial, a defendant must&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>show that but for the ineffective advice, there is a reasonable proba­&para;<br>bility that the plea offer would have been presented to the court, that&para;<br>the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or&para;<br>sentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been less severe&para;<br>than under the actual judgment and sentence imposed. Pp. 3–11.&para;<br>(a) Because the parties agree that counsel’s performance was de­&para;<br>ficient, the only question is how to apply Strickland’s prejudice test&para;<br>where ineffective assistance results in a rejection of the plea offer and&para;<br>the defendant is convicted at the ensuing trial. Pp. 3–4.&para;<br>(b) In that context, the Strickland prejudice test requires a de­&para;<br>fendant to show a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the plea&para;<br>process would have been different with competent advice. The Sixth&para;<br>Circuit and other federal appellate courts have agreed with the&para;<br>Strickland prejudice test for rejected pleas adopted here by this&para;<br>Court. Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a narrow view—&para;<br>that Strickland prejudice cannot arise from plea bargaining if the de­&para;<br>fendant is later convicted at a fair trial—but their reasoning is un­&para;<br>persuasive. First, they claim that the Sixth Amendment’s sole pur­&para;<br>pose is to protect the right to a fair trial, but the Amendment actually&para;<br>requires effective assistance at critical stages of a criminal proceed­&para;<br>ing, including pretrial stages. This is consistent with the right to ef­&para;<br>fective assistance on appeal, see, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S.&para;<br>605, and the right to counsel during sentencing, see, e.g., Glover v.&para;<br>United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203–204. This Court has not followed a&para;<br>rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at&para;<br>trial, but has instead inquired whether the trial cured the particular&para;<br>error at issue. See, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 263. Se­&para;<br>cond, this Court has previously rejected petitioner’s argument that&para;<br>Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, modified Strickland and does so&para;<br>again here. Fretwell and Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, demon­&para;<br>strate that “it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a dif­&para;<br>ferent outcome as legitimate ‘prejudice,’ ” Williams v. Taylor, 529&para;<br>U. S. 362, 391–392, where defendants would receive a windfall as a&para;<br>result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense&para;<br>strategy outside the law. Here, however, respondent seeks relief&para;<br>from counsel’s failure to meet a valid legal standard. Third, petition­&para;<br>er seeks to preserve the conviction by arguing that the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment’s purpose is to ensure a conviction’s reliability, but this&para;<br>argument fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>and is refuted by precedent. Here, the question is the fairness or re­&para;<br>liability not of the trial but of the processes that preceded it, which&para;<br>caused respondent to lose benefits he would have received but for&para;<br>counsel’s ineffective assistance. Furthermore, a reliable trial may not&para;<br>foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>altered the outcome. See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365,&para;<br>379. Petitioner’s position that a fair trial wipes clean ineffective as­&para;<br>sistance during plea bargaining also ignores the reality that criminal&para;<br>justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of&para;<br>trials. See Missouri v. Frye, ante, at ___. Pp. 4–11.&para;<br>2. Where a defendant shows ineffective assistance has caused the&para;<br>rejection of a plea leading to a more severe sentence at trial, the rem­&para;<br>edy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitutional violation, United&para;<br>States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 365, but must not grant a windfall&para;<br>to the defendant or needlessly squander the resources the State&para;<br>properly invested in the criminal prosecution, see United States v.&para;<br>Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72. If the sole advantage is that the defend­&para;<br>ant would have received a lesser sentence under the plea, the court&para;<br>should have an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the de­&para;<br>fendant would have accepted the plea. If so, the court may exercise&para;<br>discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the&para;<br>term offered in the plea, the sentence received at trial, or something&para;<br>in between. However, resentencing based on the conviction at trial&para;<br>may not suffice, e.g., where the offered guilty plea was for less serious&para;<br>counts than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial,&para;<br>or where a mandatory sentence confines a judge’s sentencing discre­&para;<br>tion. In these circumstances, the proper remedy may be to require&para;<br>the prosecution to reoffer the plea. The judge can then exercise dis­&para;<br>cretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and&para;<br>accept the plea, or leave the conviction undisturbed. In either situa­&para;<br>tion, a court must weigh various factors. Here, it suffices to give two&para;<br>relevant considerations. First, a court may take account of a defend­&para;<br>ant’s earlier expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept re­&para;<br>sponsibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary here to&para;<br>decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to disregard&para;<br>any information concerning the crime discovered after the plea offer&para;<br>was made. Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy will open&para;<br>the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their&para;<br>convictions, but in the 30 years that courts have recognized such&para;<br>claims, there has been no indication that the system is overwhelmed&para;<br>or that defendants are receiving windfalls as a result of strategically&para;<br>timed Strickland claims. In addition, the prosecution and trial courts&para;<br>may adopt measures to help ensure against meritless claims. See&para;<br>Frye, ante, at ___. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>3. This case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death&para;<br>Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), but because the Michigan Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals’ analysis of respondent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim&para;<br>was contrary to clearly established federal law, AEDPA presents no&para;<br>bar to relief. Respondent has satisfied Strickland’s two-part test.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>The parties concede the fact of deficient performance. And respond­&para;<br>ent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable&para;<br>probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.&para;<br>In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted&para;<br>at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3½ times greater than he&para;<br>would have received under the plea. As a remedy, the District Court&para;<br>ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but the correct&para;<br>remedy is to order the State to reoffer the plea. If respondent accepts&para;<br>the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determin­&para;<br>ing whether to vacate respondent’s convictions and resentence pur­&para;<br>suant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions&para;<br>and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence&para;<br>resulting from the trial undisturbed.

ANTHONY COOPER&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[March 21, 2012]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In this case, as in Missouri v. Frye, ante, p. ___, also&para;<br>decided today, a criminal defendant seeks a remedy when&para;<br>inadequate assistance of counsel caused nonacceptance of&para;<br>a plea offer and further proceedings led to a less favorable&para;<br>outcome. In Frye, defense counsel did not inform the&para;<br>defendant of the plea offer; and after the offer lapsed the&para;<br>defendant still pleaded guilty, but on more severe terms.&para;<br>Here, the favorable plea offer was reported to the client&para;<br>but, on advice of counsel, was rejected. In Frye there was&para;<br>a later guilty plea. Here, after the plea offer had been&para;<br>rejected, there was a full and fair trial before a jury. After&para;<br>a guilty verdict, the defendant received a sentence harsher&para;<br>than that offered in the rejected plea bargain. The instant&para;<br>case comes to the Court with the concession that counsel’s&para;<br>advice with respect to the plea offer fell below the stand­&para;<br>ard of adequate assistance of counsel guaranteed by the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States through the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On the evening of March 25, 2003, respondent pointed a&para;<br>gun toward Kali Mundy’s head and fired. From the rec­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ord, it is unclear why respondent did this, and at trial it&para;<br>was suggested that he might have acted either in self­&para;<br>defense or in defense of another person. In any event the&para;<br>shot missed and Mundy fled. Respondent followed in pursuit, firing repeatedly. Mundy was shot in her buttock,&para;<br>hip, and abdomen but survived the assault.&para;<br>Respondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm by a&para;<br>felon, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and for being a&para;<br>habitual offender. On two occasions, the prosecution&para;<br>offered to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a&para;<br>sentence of 51 to 85 months for the other two, in exchange&para;<br>for a guilty plea. In a communication with the court re­&para;<br>spondent admitted guilt and expressed a willingness to&para;<br>accept the offer. Respondent, however, later rejected the&para;<br>offer on both occasions, allegedly after his attorney con­&para;<br>vinced him that the prosecution would be unable to estab­&para;<br>lish his intent to murder Mundy because she had been&para;<br>shot below the waist. On the first day of trial the prosecu­&para;<br>tion offered a significantly less favorable plea deal, which&para;<br>respondent again rejected. After trial, respondent was&para;<br>convicted on all counts and received a mandatory mini­&para;<br>mum sentence of 185 to 360 months’ imprisonment.&para;<br>In a so-called Ginther hearing before the state trial&para;<br>court, see People v. Ginther, 390 Mich. 436, 212 N. W. 2d&para;<br>922 (1973), respondent argued his attorney’s advice to&para;<br>reject the plea constituted ineffective assistance. The trial&para;<br>judge rejected the claim, and the Michigan Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals affirmed. People v. Cooper, No. 250583, 2005 WL&para;<br>599740 (Mar. 15, 2005) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>44a. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the claim&para;<br>of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that respondent knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea&para;<br>offers and chose to go to trial. The Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court denied respondent’s application for leave to file an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>appeal. People v. Cooper, 474 Mich. 905, 705 N. W. 2d 118&para;<br>(2005) (table).&para;<br>Respondent then filed a petition for federal habeas relief&para;<br>under 28 U. S. C. §2254, renewing his ineffective­&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim. After finding, as required by&para;<br>the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996&para;<br>(AEDPA), that the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably applied the constitutional standards for effective&para;<br>assistance of counsel laid out in Strickland v. Washington,&para;<br>466 U. S. 668 (1984), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52&para;<br>(1985), the District Court granted a conditional writ.&para;<br>Cooper v. Lafler, No. 06–11068, 2009 WL 817712, *10 (ED&para;<br>Mich., Mar. 26, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a–42a. To&para;<br>remedy the violation, the District Court ordered “specific&para;<br>performance of [respondent’s] original plea agreement, for&para;<br>a minimum sentence in the range of fifty-one to eighty-five&para;<br>months.” Id., at *9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed, 376 Fed. Appx. 563 (2010), finding “[e]ven full&para;<br>deference under AEDPA cannot salvage the state court’s&para;<br>decision,” id., at 569. Applying Strickland, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals found that respondent’s attorney had provided&para;<br>deficient performance by informing respondent of “an&para;<br>incorrect legal rule,” 376 Fed. Appx., at 570–571, and that&para;<br>respondent suffered prejudice because he “lost out on an&para;<br>opportunity to plead guilty and receive the lower sentence&para;<br>that was offered to him.” Id., at 573. This Court granted&para;<br>certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel,&para;<br>a right that extends to the plea-bargaining process. Frye,&para;<br>ante, at 8; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 16); Hill, supra, at 57. During plea&para;<br>negotiations defendants are “entitled to the effective assis­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tance of competent counsel.” McMann v. Richardson, 397&para;<br>U. S. 759, 771 (1970). In Hill, the Court held “the two­&para;<br>part Strickland v. Washington test applies to challenges to&para;<br>guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.”&para;<br>474 U. S., at 58. The performance prong of Strickland&para;<br>requires a defendant to show “ ‘that counsel’s representa­&para;<br>tion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.’ ”&para;<br>474 U. S., at 57 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688). In&para;<br>this case all parties agree the performance of respondent’s&para;<br>counsel was deficient when he advised respondent to reject&para;<br>the plea offer on the grounds he could not be convicted at&para;<br>trial. In light of this concession, it is unnecessary for this&para;<br>Court to explore the issue.&para;<br>The question for this Court is how to apply Strickland’s&para;<br>prejudice test where ineffective assistance results in a rejection of the plea offer and the defendant is convicted at&para;<br>the ensuing trial.&para;<br>B&para;<br>To establish Strickland prejudice a defendant must&para;<br>“show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for&para;<br>counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed­&para;<br>ing would have been different.” Id., at 694. In the context&para;<br>of pleas a defendant must show the outcome of the plea&para;<br>process would have been different with competent advice.&para;<br>See Frye, ante, at 12 (noting that Strickland’s inquiry, as&para;<br>applied to advice with respect to plea bargains, turns on&para;<br>“whether ‘the result of the proceeding would have been&para;<br>different’ ” (quoting Strickland, supra, at 694)); see also&para;<br>Hill, 474 U. S., at 59 (“The . . . ‘prejudice,’ requirement . . .&para;<br>focuses on whether counsel’s constitutionally ineffective&para;<br>performance affected the outcome of the plea process”). In&para;<br>Hill, when evaluating the petitioner’s claim that ineffec­&para;<br>tive assistance led to the improvident acceptance of a&para;<br>guilty plea, the Court required the petitioner to show “that&para;<br>there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>errors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and&para;<br>would have insisted on going to trial.” Ibid.&para;<br>In contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to&para;<br>an offer’s acceptance but to its rejection. Having to stand&para;<br>trial, not choosing to waive it, is the prejudice alleged. In&para;<br>these circumstances a defendant must show that but for&para;<br>the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented&para;<br>to the court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted&para;<br>the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it&para;<br>in light of intervening circumstances), that the court&para;<br>would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or&para;<br>sentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been&para;<br>less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in&para;<br>fact were imposed. Here, the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit agreed with that test for Strickland preju­&para;<br>dice in the context of a rejected plea bargain. This is&para;<br>consistent with the test adopted and applied by other&para;<br>appellate courts without demonstrated difficulties or&para;<br>systemic disruptions. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–573; see&para;<br>also, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d&para;<br>747, 753, n. 1 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); United States v.&para;<br>Gordon, 156 F. 3d 376, 380–381 (CA2 1998) (per curiam);&para;<br>United States v. Day, 969 F. 2d 39, 43–45 (CA3 1992);&para;<br>Beckham v. Wainwright, 639 F. 2d 262, 267 (CA5 1981);&para;<br>Julian v. Bartley, 495 F. 3d 487, 498–500 (CA7 2007);&para;<br>Wanatee v.

Gaviria, 116 F. 3d 1498,&para;<br>1512–1514 (CADC 1997) (per curiam).&para;<br>Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a different,&para;<br>far more narrow, view of the Sixth Amendment. They&para;<br>contend there can be no finding of Strickland prejudice&para;<br>arising from plea bargaining if the defendant is later&para;<br>convicted at a fair trial. The three reasons petitioner and&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Solicitor General offer for their approach are unper­&para;<br>suasive.&para;<br>First, petitioner and the Solicitor General claim that&para;<br>the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the&para;<br>right to a fair trial. Errors before trial, they argue, are not&para;<br>cognizable under the Sixth Amendment unless they affect&para;<br>the fairness of the trial itself. See Brief for Petitioner 12–&para;<br>21; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10–12. The&para;<br>Sixth Amendment, however, is not so narrow in its reach.&para;<br>Cf. Frye, ante, at 11 (holding that a defendant can show&para;<br>prejudice under Strickland even absent a showing that the&para;<br>deficient performance precluded him from going to trial).&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment requires effective assistance of&para;<br>counsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. Its&para;<br>protections are not designed simply to protect the trial,&para;<br>even though “counsel’s absence [in these stages] may&para;<br>derogate from the accused’s right to a fair trial.” United&para;<br>States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). The constitu­&para;<br>tional guarantee applies to pretrial critical stages that are&para;<br>part of the whole course of a criminal proceeding, a pro­&para;<br>ceeding in which defendants cannot be presumed to make&para;<br>critical decisions without counsel’s advice. This is con­&para;<br>sistent, too, with the rule that defendants have a right to&para;<br>effective assistance of counsel on appeal, even though that&para;<br>cannot in any way be characterized as part of the trial.&para;<br>See, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605 (2005); Evitts&para;<br>v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The precedents also estab­&para;<br>lish that there exists a right to counsel during sentencing&para;<br>in both noncapital, see Glover v. United States, 531 U. S.&para;<br>198, 203–204 (2001); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S. 128&para;<br>(1967), and capital cases, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.&para;<br>510, 538 (2003). Even though sentencing does not concern&para;<br>the defendant’s guilt or innocence, ineffective assistance of&para;<br>counsel during a sentencing hearing can result in Strickland prejudice because “any amount of [additional] jail&para;<br>time has Sixth Amendment significance.” Glover, supra,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 203.&para;<br>The Court, moreover, has not followed a rigid rule that&para;<br>an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at the&para;<br>trial itself. It has inquired instead whether the trial cured&para;<br>the particular error at issue. Thus, in Vasquez v. Hillery,&para;<br>474 U. S. 254 (1986), the deliberate exclusion of all&para;<br>African-Americans from a grand jury was prejudicial because a defendant may have been tried on charges that&para;<br>would not have been brought at all by a properly constituted&para;<br>grand jury. Id., at 263; see Ballard v. United States, 329&para;<br>U. S. 187, 195 (1946) (dismissing an indictment returned&para;<br>by a grand jury from which women were excluded); see&para;<br>also Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212, 218–219&para;<br>(1960) (reversing a defendant’s conviction because the jury&para;<br>may have based its verdict on acts not charged in the&para;<br>indictment). By contrast, in United States v. Mechanik,&para;<br>475 U. S. 66 (1986), the complained-of error was a viola­&para;<br>tion of a grand jury rule meant to ensure probable cause&para;<br>existed to believe a defendant was guilty. A subsequent&para;<br>trial, resulting in a verdict of guilt, cured this error. See&para;<br>id., at 72–73.&para;<br>In the instant case respondent went to trial rather than&para;<br>accept a plea deal, and it is conceded this was the result of&para;<br>ineffective assistance during the plea negotiation process.&para;<br>Respondent received a more severe sentence at trial, one&para;<br>3½ times more severe than he likely would have received&para;<br>by pleading guilty. Far from curing the error, the trial&para;<br>caused the injury from the error. Even if the trial itself is&para;<br>free from constitutional flaw, the defendant who goes to&para;<br>trial instead of taking a more favorable plea may be preju­&para;<br>diced from either a conviction on more serious counts or&para;<br>the imposition of a more severe sentence.&para;<br>Second, petitioner claims this Court refined Strickland’s&para;<br>prejudice analysis in Fretwell to add an additional re­&para;<br>quirement that the defendant show that ineffective assis­&para;<br>tance of counsel led to his being denied a substantive or&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>procedural right. Brief for Petitioner 12–13. The Court&para;<br>has rejected the argument that Fretwell modified Strickland before and does so again now. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000) (“The Virginia Supreme&para;<br>Court erred in holding that our decision in Lockhart v.&para;<br>Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), modified or in some way&para;<br>supplanted the rule set down in Strickland”); see also&para;<br>Glover, supra, at 203 (“The Court explained last Term [in&para;<br>Williams] that our holding in Lockhart does not supplant&para;<br>the Strickland analysis”).&para;<br>Fretwell could not show Strickland prejudice resulting&para;<br>from his attorney’s failure to object to the use of a sentenc­&para;<br>ing factor the Eighth Circuit had erroneously (and tempo­&para;<br>rarily) found to be impermissible. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at&para;<br>373. Because the objection upon which his ineffective­&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim was premised was meritless,&para;<br>Fretwell could not demonstrate an error entitling him to&para;<br>relief. The case presented the “unusual circumstance&para;<br>where the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice&para;<br>based on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought not&para;<br>inform the inquiry.” Ibid. (O’Connor, J., concurring). See&para;<br>also ibid. (recognizing “[t]he determinative question—&para;<br>whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for&para;<br>counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed­&para;<br>ing would have been different—remains unchanged” (in­&para;<br>ternal quotation marks and citation omitted)). It is for&para;<br>this same reason a defendant cannot show prejudice based&para;<br>on counsel’s refusal to present perjured testimony, even if&para;<br>such testimony might have affected the outcome of the&para;<br>case. See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 175 (1986)&para;<br>(holding first that counsel’s refusal to present perjured&para;<br>testimony breached no professional duty and second that&para;<br>it cannot establish prejudice under Strickland).&para;<br>Both Fretwell and Nix are instructive in that they&para;<br>demonstrate “there are also situations in which it would&para;<br>be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>outcome as legitimate ‘prejudice,’ ” Williams, supra, at&para;<br>391–392, because defendants would receive a windfall as a&para;<br>result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or&para;<br>a defense strategy outside the law. Here, however, the&para;<br>injured client seeks relief from counsel’s failure to meet a&para;<br>valid legal standard, not from counsel’s refusal to violate&para;<br>it. He maintains that, absent ineffective counsel, he would&para;<br>have accepted a plea offer for a sentence the prosecution&para;<br>evidently deemed consistent with the sound administra­&para;<br>tion of criminal justice. The favorable sentence that elud­&para;<br>ed the defendant in the criminal proceeding appears to be&para;<br>the sentence he or others in his position would have re­&para;<br>ceived in the ordinary course, absent the failings of coun­&para;<br>sel. See Bibas, Regulating the Plea-Bargaining Market:&para;<br>From Caveat Emptor to Consumer Protection, 99 Cal. L.&para;<br>Rev. 1117, 1138 (2011) (“The expected post-trial sentence&para;<br>is imposed in only a few percent of cases. It is like the&para;<br>sticker price for cars: only an ignorant, ill-advised con­&para;<br>sumer would view full price as the norm and anything less&para;<br>a bargain”); see also Frye, ante, at 7–8. If a plea bargain&para;<br>has been offered, a defendant has the right to effective&para;<br>assistance of counsel in considering whether to accept it.&para;<br>If that right is denied, prejudice can be shown if loss of the&para;<br>plea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a conviction on&para;<br>more serious charges or the imposition of a more severe&para;<br>sentence.&para;<br>It is, of course, true that defendants have “no right to be&para;<br>offered a plea . . . nor a federal right that the judge accept&para;<br>it.” Frye, ante, at 12. In the circumstances here, that is&para;<br>beside the point. If no plea offer is made, or a plea deal&para;<br>is accepted by the defendant but rejected by the judge, the&para;<br>issue raised here simply does not arise. Much the same&para;<br>reasoning guides cases that find criminal defendants have&para;<br>a right to effective assistance of counsel in direct appeals&para;<br>even though the Constitution does not require States to&para;<br>provide a system of appellate review at all. See Evitts, 469&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 387; see also Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353&para;<br>(1963). As in those cases, “[w]hen a State opts to act in a&para;<br>field where its action has significant discretionary ele­&para;<br>ments, it must nonetheless act in accord with the dictates&para;<br>of the Constitution.” Evitts, supra, at 401.&para;<br>Third, petitioner seeks to preserve the conviction ob­&para;<br>tained by the State by arguing that the purpose of the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment is to ensure “the reliability of [a] convic­&para;<br>tion following trial.” Brief for Petitioner 13. This argu­&para;<br>ment, too, fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment’s protections; and it is refuted by precedent.&para;<br>Strickland recognized “[t]he benchmark for judging any&para;<br>claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct&para;<br>so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial&para;<br>process that the trial cannot be relied on as having pro­&para;<br>duced a just result.” 466 U. S., at 686. The goal of a just&para;<br>result is not divorced from the reliability of a conviction,&para;<br>see United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984); but&para;<br>here the question is not the fairness or reliability of the&para;<br>trial but the fairness and regularity of the processes that&para;<br>preceded it, which caused the defendant to lose benefits he&para;<br>would have received in the ordinary course but for coun­&para;<br>sel’s ineffective assistance.&para;<br>There are instances, furthermore, where a reliable trial&para;<br>does not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert&para;<br>rights that may have altered the outcome. In Kimmelman&para;<br>v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), the Court held that an&para;<br>attorney’s failure to timely move to suppress evidence&para;<br>during trial could be grounds for federal habeas relief.&para;<br>The Court rejected the suggestion that the “failure to&para;<br>make a timely request for the exclusion of illegally seized&para;<br>evidence” could not be the basis for a Sixth Amendment&para;<br>violation because the evidence “is ‘typically reliable and&para;<br>often the most probative information bearing on the guilt&para;<br>or innocence of the defendant.’ ” Id., at 379 (quoting Stone&para;<br>v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976)). “The constitutional&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rights of criminal defendants,” the Court observed, “are&para;<br>granted to the innocent and the guilty alike. Consequent­&para;<br>ly, we decline to hold either that the guarantee of effective&para;<br>assistance of counsel belongs solely to the innocent or that&para;<br>it attaches only to matters affecting the determination of&para;<br>actual guilt.” 477 U. S., at 380. The same logic applies&para;<br>here. The fact that respondent is guilty does not mean&para;<br>he was not entitled by the Sixth Amendment to effective&para;<br>assistance or that he suffered no prejudice from his attor­&para;<br>ney’s deficient performance during plea bargaining.&para;<br>In the end, petitioner’s three arguments amount to one&para;<br>general contention: A fair trial wipes clean any deficient&para;<br>performance by defense counsel during plea bargaining.&para;<br>That position ignores the reality that criminal justice&para;<br>today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system&para;<br>of trials. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and&para;<br>ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of&para;<br>guilty pleas. See Frye, ante, at 7. As explained in Frye,&para;<br>the right to adequate assistance of counsel cannot be&para;<br>defined or enforced without taking account of the central&para;<br>role plea bargaining plays in securing convictions and&para;<br>determining sentences. Ibid. (“[I]t is insufficient simply&para;<br>to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that&para;<br>inoculates any errors in the pretrial process”).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Even if a defendant shows ineffective assistance of&para;<br>counsel has caused the rejection of a plea leading to a trial&para;<br>and a more severe sentence, there is the question of what&para;<br>constitutes an appropriate remedy. That question must&para;<br>now be addressed.&para;<br>Sixth Amendment remedies should be “tailored to the&para;<br>injury suffered from the constitutional violation and&para;<br>should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.”&para;<br>United States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981).&para;<br>Thus, a remedy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitu­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tional violation, id., at 365, while at the same time not&para;<br>grant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander&para;<br>the considerable resources the State properly invested in&para;<br>the criminal prosecution. See Mechanik, 475 U. S., at 72&para;<br>(“The reversal of a conviction entails substantial social&para;<br>costs: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution,&para;<br>and the defendants to expend further time, energy, and&para;<br>other resources to repeat a trial that has already once&para;<br>taken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturb­&para;<br>ing experiences”).&para;<br>The specific injury suffered by defendants who decline a&para;<br>plea offer as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel&para;<br>and then receive a greater sentence as a result of trial can&para;<br>come in at least one of two forms. In some cases, the sole&para;<br>advantage a defendant would have received under the plea&para;<br>is a lesser sentence. This is typically the case when the&para;<br>charges that would have been admitted as part of the plea&para;<br>bargain are the same as the charges the defendant was&para;<br>convicted of after trial. In this situation the court may&para;<br>conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the&para;<br>defendant has shown a reasonable probability that but for&para;<br>counsel’s errors he would have accepted the plea. If the&para;<br>showing is made, the court may exercise discretion in&para;<br>determining whether the defendant should receive the&para;<br>term of imprisonment the government offered in the plea,&para;<br>the sentence he received at trial, or something in between.&para;<br>In some situations it may be that resentencing alone&para;<br>will not be full redress for the constitutional injury. If, for&para;<br>example, an offer was for a guilty plea to a count or counts&para;<br>less serious than the ones for which a defendant was&para;<br>convicted after trial, or if a mandatory sentence confines a&para;<br>judge’s sentencing discretion after trial, a resentencing&para;<br>based on the conviction at trial may not suffice. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Williams, 571 F. 3d, at 1088; Riggs v. Fairman, 399 F. 3d&para;<br>1179, 1181 (CA9 2005). In these circumstances, the&para;<br>proper exercise of discretion to remedy the constitutional&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>injury may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea&para;<br>proposal. Once this has occurred, the judge can then&para;<br>exercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the con­&para;<br>viction from trial and accept the plea or leave the convic­&para;<br>tion undisturbed.&para;<br>In implementing a remedy in both of these situations,&para;<br>the trial court must weigh various factors; and the bound­&para;<br>aries of proper discretion need not be defined here. Prin­&para;<br>ciples elaborated over time in decisions of state and feder­&para;<br>al courts, and in statutes and rules, will serve to give more&para;<br>complete guidance as to the factors that should bear upon&para;<br>the exercise of the judge’s discretion. At this point, how­&para;<br>ever, it suffices to note two considerations that are of&para;<br>relevance.&para;<br>First, a court may take account of a defendant’s earlier&para;<br>expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept respon­&para;<br>sibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary&para;<br>here to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to prescind (that is to say disregard) any infor­&para;<br>mation concerning the crime that was discovered after the&para;<br>plea offer was made. The time continuum makes it diffi­&para;<br>cult to restore the defendant and the prosecution to the&para;<br>precise positions they occupied prior to the rejection of the&para;<br>plea offer, but that baseline can be consulted in finding a&para;<br>remedy that does not require the prosecution to incur the&para;<br>expense of conducting a new trial.&para;<br>Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy here will&para;<br>open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to&para;<br>unsettle their convictions. See Brief for Petitioner 20.&para;<br>Petitioner’s concern is misplaced. Courts have recognized&para;<br>claims of this sort for over 30 years, see supra, at 5, and&para;<br>yet there is no indication that the system is overwhelmed&para;<br>by these types of suits or that defendants are receiving&para;<br>windfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland&para;<br>claims. See also Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)&para;<br>(“We confronted a similar ‘floodgates’ concern in Hill,” but&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a “flood did not follow in that decision’s wake”). In addi­&para;<br>tion, the “prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some&para;<br>measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabri­&para;<br>cated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer&para;<br>has been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction.”&para;<br>Frye, ante, at 10. See also ibid. (listing procedures cur­&para;<br>rently used by various States). This, too, will help ensure&para;<br>against meritless claims.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The standards for ineffective assistance of counsel when&para;<br>a defendant rejects a plea offer and goes to trial must now&para;<br>be applied to this case. Respondent brings a federal col­&para;<br>lateral challenge to a state-court conviction.&para;<br>Under&para;<br>AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a petition for a writ&para;<br>of habeas corpus unless the state court’s adjudication on&para;<br>the merits was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable&para;<br>application of, clearly established Federal law, as deter­&para;<br>mined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). A decision is contrary to clearly&para;<br>established law if the state court “applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court]&para;<br>cases.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405 (2000)&para;<br>(opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Sixth Circuit could not determine whether&para;<br>the Michigan Court of Appeals addressed respondent’s&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim or, if it did, “what&para;<br>the court decided, or even whether the correct legal rule&para;<br>was identified.” 376 Fed. Appx., at 568–569.&para;<br>The state court’s decision may not be quite so opaque as&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit thought, yet the&para;<br>federal court was correct to note that AEDPA does not&para;<br>present a bar to granting respondent relief. That is be­&para;<br>cause the Michigan Court of Appeals identified respond­&para;<br>ent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim but failed to&para;<br>apply Strickland to assess it. Rather than applying&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Strickland, the state court simply found that respondent’s&para;<br>rejection of the plea was knowing and voluntary. Cooper,&para;<br>2005 WL 599740, *1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. An in­&para;<br>quiry into whether the rejection of a plea is knowing and&para;<br>voluntary, however, is not the correct means by which to&para;<br>address a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See&para;<br>Hill, 474 U. S., at 370 (applying Strickland to assess a&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising out of&para;<br>the plea negotiation process). After stating the incorrect&para;<br>standard, moreover, the state court then made an irrele­&para;<br>vant observation about counsel’s performance at trial and&para;<br>mischaracterized respondent’s claim as a complaint that&para;<br>his attorney did not obtain a more favorable plea bargain.&para;<br>By failing to apply Strickland to assess the ineffective­&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised, the state&para;<br>court’s adjudication was contrary to clearly established&para;<br>federal law. And in that circumstance the federal courts&para;<br>in this habeas action can determine the principles neces­&para;<br>sary to grant relief. See Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.&para;<br>930, 948 (2007).&para;<br>Respondent has satisfied Strickland’s two-part test.&para;<br>Regarding performance, perhaps it could be accepted that&para;<br>it is unclear whether respondent’s counsel believed re­&para;<br>spondent could not be convicted for assault with intent to&para;<br>murder as a matter of law because the shots hit Mundy&para;<br>below the waist, or whether he simply thought this would&para;<br>be a persuasive argument to make to the jury to show lack&para;<br>of specific intent. And, as the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit suggested, an erroneous strategic prediction&para;<br>about the outcome of a trial is not necessarily deficient&para;<br>performance. Here, however, the fact of deficient perfor­&para;<br>mance has been conceded by all parties. The case comes to&para;<br>us on that assumption, so there is no need to address this&para;<br>question.&para;<br>As to prejudice, respondent has shown that but for&para;<br>counsel’s deficient performance there is a reasonable&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>probability he and the trial court would have accepted the&para;<br>guilty plea. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–572. In addition,&para;<br>as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at&para;<br>trial, respondent received a minimum sentence 3½ times&para;<br>greater than he would have received under the plea. The&para;<br>standard for ineffective assistance under Strickland has&para;<br>thus been satisfied.&para;<br>As a remedy, the District Court ordered specific perfor­&para;<br>mance of the original plea agreement. The correct remedy&para;<br>in these circumstances, however, is to order the State to&para;<br>reoffer the plea agreement. Presuming respondent accepts&para;<br>the offer, the state trial court can then exercise its discre­&para;<br>tion in determining whether to vacate the convictions and&para;<br>resentence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to&para;<br>vacate only some of the convictions and resentence re­&para;<br>spondent accordingly, or to leave the convictions and&para;<br>sentence from trial undisturbed. See Mich. Ct. Rule&para;<br>6.302(C)(3) (2011) (“If there is a plea agreement and its&para;<br>terms provide for the defendant’s plea to be made in ex­&para;<br>change for a specific sentence disposition or a prosecutorial sentence recommendation, the court may . . . reject&para;<br>the agreement”). Today’s decision leaves open to the trial&para;<br>court how best to exercise that discretion in all the cir­&para;<br>cumstances of the case.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further&para;<br>proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

J. 1909, 1912 (1992) (hereinafter Scott)). Is it&para;<br>constitutional, for example, for the prosecution to with­&para;<br>draw a plea offer that has already been accepted? Or to&para;<br>withdraw an offer before the defense has had adequate&para;<br>time to consider and accept it?

I respectfully&para;<br>dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case and its companion, Missouri v. Frye, ante,&para;<br>p. ___, raise relatively straightforward questions about the&para;<br>scope of the right to effective assistance of counsel. Our&para;<br>case law originally derived that right from the Due Pro­&para;<br>cess Clause, and its guarantee of a fair trial, see United&para;<br>States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147 (2006), but&para;<br>the seminal case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.&para;<br>668 (1984), located the right within the Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>As the Court notes, ante, at 6, the right to counsel does not&para;<br>begin at trial. It extends to “any stage of the prosecution,&para;<br>formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel’s ab­&para;<br>sence might derogate from the accused’s right to a fair&para;<br>trial.” United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967).&para;<br>Applying that principle, we held that the “entry of a guilty&para;<br>plea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felony charge, ranks&para;<br>as a ‘critical stage’ at which the right to counsel adheres.”&para;<br>Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); see also Hill v.&para;<br>Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985). And it follows from this&para;<br>that acceptance of a plea offer is a critical stage. That, and&para;<br>nothing more, is the point of the Court’s observation in&para;<br>Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at&para;<br>16), that “the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical&para;<br>phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>right to effective assistance of counsel.” The defendant in&para;<br>Padilla had accepted the plea bargain and pleaded guilty,&para;<br>abandoning his right to a fair trial; he was entitled to&para;<br>advice of competent counsel before he did so. The Court&para;<br>has never held that the rule articulated in Padilla, Tovar,&para;<br>and Hill extends to all aspects of plea negotiations, requir­&para;<br>ing not just advice of competent counsel before the defend­&para;<br>ant accepts a plea bargain and pleads guilty, but also the&para;<br>advice of competent counsel before the defendant rejects a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>plea bargain and stands on his constitutional right to a&para;<br>fair trial. The latter is a vast departure from our past&para;<br>cases, protecting not just the constitutionally prescribed&para;<br>right to a fair adjudication of guilt and punishment, but a&para;<br>judicially invented right to effective plea bargaining.&para;<br>It is also apparent from Strickland that bad plea bar­&para;<br>gaining has nothing to do with ineffective assistance of&para;<br>counsel in the constitutional sense. Strickland explained&para;<br>that “[i]n giving meaning to the requirement [of effective&para;<br>assistance], . . . we must take its purpose—to ensure a fair&para;<br>trial—as the guide.” 466 U. S., at 686. Since “the right to&para;<br>the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its&para;<br>own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of&para;<br>the accused to receive a fair trial,” United States v. Cronic,&para;<br>466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984), the “benchmark” inquiry in&para;<br>evaluating any claim of ineffective assistance is whether&para;<br>counsel’s performance “so undermined the proper func­&para;<br>tioning of the adversarial process” that it failed to produce&para;<br>a reliably “just result.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686.&para;<br>That is what Strickland’s requirement of “prejudice” con­&para;<br>sists of: Because the right to effective assistance has as its&para;<br>purpose the assurance of a fair trial, the right is not in­&para;<br>fringed unless counsel’s mistakes call into question the&para;<br>basic justice of a defendant’s conviction or sentence. That&para;<br>has been, until today, entirely clear. A defendant must&para;<br>show “that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive&para;<br>the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is relia­&para;<br>ble.” Id., at 687. See also Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 147.&para;<br>Impairment of fair trial is how we distinguish between&para;<br>unfortunate attorney error and error of constitutional&para;<br>significance.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Rather than addressing the constitutional origins of the right to&para;<br>effective counsel, the Court responds to the broader claim (raised by no&para;<br>one) that “the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the&para;<br>right to a fair trial.” Ante, at 6 (emphasis added).

And until today we have followed&para;<br>that course.&para;<br>In Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), the defi­&para;<br>cient performance at issue was the failure of counsel for a&para;<br>defendant who had been sentenced to death to make an&para;<br>objection that would have produced a sentence of life&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Amendment right to counsel is to secure a fair trial” (emphasis added));&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 12–21 (same). To destroy that straw man, the&para;<br>Court cites cases in which violations of rights other than the right to&para;<br>effective counsel—and, perplexingly, even rights found outside the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment and the Constitution entirely—were not cured by a&para;<br>subsequent trial. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254 (1986) (violation of&para;<br>equal protection in grand jury selection); Ballard v. United States, 329&para;<br>U. S. 187 (1946) (violation of statutory scheme providing that women&para;<br>serve on juries); Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960) (violation&para;<br>of Fifth Amendment right to indictment by grand jury). Unlike the&para;<br>right to effective counsel, no showing of prejudice is required to make&para;<br>violations of the rights at issue in Vasquez, Ballard, and Stirone com­&para;<br>plete. See Vasquez, supra, at 263–264 (“[D]iscrimination in the grand&para;<br>jury undermines the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself,&para;<br>and is not amenable to harmless-error review”); Ballard, supra, at 195&para;<br>(“[R]eversible error does not depend on a showing of prejudice in an&para;<br>individual case”); Stirone, supra, at 217 (“Deprivation of such a basic&para;<br>right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance&para;<br>and then dismissed as harmless error”). Those cases are thus irrele­&para;<br>vant to the question presented here, which is whether a defendant can&para;<br>establish prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668&para;<br>(1984), while conceding the fairness of his conviction, sentence, and&para;<br>appeal.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>imprisonment instead. The objection was fully supported&para;<br>by then-extant Circuit law, so that the sentencing court&para;<br>would have been compelled to sustain it, producing a life&para;<br>sentence that principles of double jeopardy would likely&para;<br>make final. See id., at 383–385 (Stevens, J., dissenting);&para;<br>Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981). By the time&para;<br>Fretwell’s claim came before us, however, the Circuit law&para;<br>had been overruled in light of one of our cases. We deter­&para;<br>mined that a prejudice analysis “focusing solely on mere&para;<br>outcome determination, without attention to whether the&para;<br>result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or&para;<br>unreliable,” would be defective. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at&para;<br>369. Because counsel’s error did not “deprive the defend­&para;<br>ant of any substantive or procedural right to which the&para;<br>law entitles him,” the defendant’s sentencing proceeding&para;<br>was fair and its result was reliable, even though counsel’s&para;<br>error may have affected its outcome. Id., at 372. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391–393 (2000), we ex­&para;<br>plained that even though Fretwell did not mechanically&para;<br>apply an outcome-based test for prejudice, its reasoning&para;<br>was perfectly consistent with Strickland. “Fretwell’s&para;<br>counsel had not deprived him of any substantive or pro­&para;<br>cedural right to which the law entitled him.” 529 U. S.&para;<br>at 392.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), cited by the Court,&para;<br>ante, at 10–11, does not contradict this principle. That case, which&para;<br>predated Fretwell and Williams, considered whether our holding that&para;<br>Fourth Amendment claims fully litigated in state court cannot be&para;<br>raised in federal habeas “should be extended to Sixth Amendment&para;<br>claims of ineffective assistance of counsel where the principal allegation&para;<br>and manifestation of inadequate representation is counsel’s failure to&para;<br>file a timely motion to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation&para;<br>of the Fourth Amendment.” 477 U. S., at 368. Our negative answer to&para;<br>that question had nothing to do with the issue here. The parties in&para;<br>Kimmelman had not raised the question “whether the admission of&para;<br>illegally seized but reliable evidence can ever constitute ‘prejudice’&para;<br>under Strickland”—a question similar to the one presented here—and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Those precedents leave no doubt about the answer to&para;<br>the question presented here. As the Court itself observes,&para;<br>a criminal defendant has no right to a plea bargain. Ante,&para;<br>at 9. “[T]here is no constitutional right to plea bargain;&para;<br>the prosecutor need not do so if he prefers to go to trial.”&para;<br>Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). Coun­&para;<br>sel’s mistakes in this case thus did not “deprive the de­&para;<br>fendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the&para;<br>law entitles him,” Williams, supra, at 393. Far from being “beside the point,” ante, at 9, that is critical to correct&para;<br>application of our precedents. Like Fretwell, this case&para;<br>“concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant&para;<br>attempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations&para;<br>that, as a matter of law, ought not inform the inquiry,”&para;<br>506 U. S., at 373 (O’Connor, J., concurring); he claims&para;<br>“that he might have been denied ‘a right the law simply&para;<br>does not recognize,’ ” id., at 375 (same). Strickland,&para;<br>Fretwell, and Williams all instruct that the pure outcome­&para;<br>based test on which the Court relies is an erroneous&para;<br>measure of cognizable prejudice. In ignoring Strickland’s&para;<br>“ultimate focus . . . on the fundamental fairness of the&para;<br>proceeding whose result is being challenged,” 466 U. S., at&para;<br>696, the Court has lost the forest for the trees, leading it to&para;<br>accept what we have previously rejected, the “novel argu­&para;<br>ment that constitutional rights are infringed by trying the&para;<br>defendant rather than accepting his plea of guilty.”&para;<br>Weatherford, supra, at 561.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>the Court therefore did not address it. Id., at 391 (Powell, J., concur­&para;<br>ring in judgment); see also id., at 380. Kimmelman made clear, how­&para;<br>ever, how the answer to that question is to be determined: “The essence&para;<br>of an ineffective-assistance claim is that counsel’s unprofessional errors&para;<br>so upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that&para;<br>the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect,” id., at 374&para;<br>(emphasis added). “Only those habeas petitioners who can prove under&para;<br>Strickland that they have been denied a fair trial . . . will be granted the&para;<br>writ,” id., at 382 (emphasis added). In short, Kimmelman’s only rele­&para;<br>vance is to prove the Court’s opinion wrong.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER &para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>Novelty alone is the second, independent reason why the&para;<br>Court’s decision is wrong. This case arises on federal&para;<br>habeas, and hence is governed by the Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Since, as&para;<br>the Court acknowledges, the Michigan Court of Appeals&para;<br>adjudicated Cooper’s ineffective-assistance claim on the&para;<br>merits, AEDPA bars federal courts from granting habeas&para;<br>relief unless that court’s decision was “contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court&para;<br>of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Yet the&para;<br>Court concludes that §2254(d)(1) does not bar relief here,&para;<br>because “[b]y failing to apply Strickland to assess the&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised,&para;<br>the state court’s adjudication was contrary to clearly&para;<br>established federal law.” Ante, at 15. That is not so.&para;<br>The relevant portion of the Michigan Court of Appeals&para;<br>decision reads as follows:&para;<br>“To establish ineffective assistance, the defendant&para;<br>must demonstrate that his counsel’s performance fell&para;<br>below an objective standard of reasonableness and&para;<br>that counsel’s representation so prejudiced the de­&para;<br>fendant that he was deprived of a fair trial. With&para;<br>respect to the prejudice aspect of the test, the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,&para;<br>but for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different, and that the attendant proceedings were fundamentally unfair and&para;<br>unreliable.&para;<br>“Defendant challenges the trial court’s finding after&para;<br>a Ginther hearing that defense counsel provided effec­&para;<br>tive assistance to defendant during the plea bargain­&para;<br>ing process. He contends that defense counsel failed&para;<br>to convey the benefits of the plea offer to him and ig­&para;<br>nored his desire to plead guilty, and that these fail­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ures led him to reject a plea offer that he now wishes&para;<br>to accept. However, the record shows that defendant&para;<br>knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers&para;<br>and chose to go to trial. The record fails to support de­&para;<br>fendant’s contentions that defense counsel’s represen­&para;<br>tation was ineffective because he rejected a defense&para;<br>based on [a] claim of self-defense and because he did&para;<br>not obtain a more favorable plea bargain for defend­&para;<br>ant.” People v. Cooper, No. 250583 (Mar. 15, 2005),&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, 2005 WL 599740, *1&para;<br>(per curiam) (footnote and citations omitted).&para;<br>The first paragraph above, far from ignoring Strickland,&para;<br>recites its standard with a good deal more accuracy than&para;<br>the Court’s opinion. The second paragraph, which is&para;<br>presumably an application of the standard recited in the&para;<br>first, says that “defendant knowingly and intelligently&para;<br>rejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial.” This can&para;<br>be regarded as a denial that there was anything “funda­&para;<br>mentally unfair” about Cooper’s conviction and sentence,&para;<br>so that no Strickland prejudice had been shown. On the&para;<br>other hand, the entire second paragraph can be regarded&para;<br>as a contention that Cooper’s claims of inadequate repre­&para;<br>sentation were unsupported by the record. The state&para;<br>court’s analysis was admittedly not a model of clarity, but&para;<br>federal habeas corpus is a “guard against extreme mal­&para;<br>functions in the state criminal justice systems,” not a&para;<br>license to penalize a state court for its opinion-writing&para;<br>technique. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 13) (internal quotation marks omitted). The&para;<br>Court’s readiness to find error in the Michigan court’s&para;<br>opinion is “inconsistent with the presumption that state&para;<br>courts know and follow the law,” Woodford v. Visciotti, 537&para;<br>U. S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam), a presumption borne out&para;<br>here by the state court’s recitation of the correct legal&para;<br>standard.&para;<br>Since it is ambiguous whether the state court’s holding&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was based on a lack of prejudice or rather the court’s&para;<br>factual determination that there had been no deficient&para;<br>performance, to provide relief under AEDPA this Court&para;<br>must conclude that both holdings would have been unrea­&para;<br>sonable applications of clearly established law. See Premo&para;<br>v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7). The first&para;<br>is impossible of doing, since this Court has never held that&para;<br>a defendant in Cooper’s position can establish Strickland&para;<br>prejudice. The Sixth Circuit thus violated AEDPA in&para;<br>granting habeas relief, and the Court now does the same.&para;<br>III&para;<br>It is impossible to conclude discussion of today’s ex­&para;<br>traordinary opinion without commenting upon the remedy&para;<br>it provides for the unconstitutional conviction. It is a&para;<br>remedy unheard-of in American jurisprudence—and, I&para;<br>would be willing to bet, in the jurisprudence of any other&para;<br>country.&para;<br>The Court requires Michigan to “reoffer the plea agree­&para;<br>ment” that was rejected because of bad advice from coun­&para;<br>sel. Ante, at 16. That would indeed be a powerful remedy—&para;<br>but for the fact that Cooper’s acceptance of that reoffered agreement is not conclusive. Astoundingly, “the&para;<br>state trial court can then exercise its discretion in deter­&para;<br>mining whether to vacate the convictions and resentence&para;<br>respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only&para;<br>some of the convictions and resentence respondent accord­&para;<br>ingly, or to leave the convictions and sentence from trial&para;<br>undisturbed.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>Why, one might ask, require a “reoffer” of the plea&para;<br>agreement, and its acceptance by the defendant? If the&para;<br>district court finds (as a necessary element, supposedly, of&para;<br>Strickland prejudice) that Cooper would have accepted the&para;<br>original offer, and would thereby have avoided trial and&para;<br>conviction, why not skip the reoffer-and-reacceptance&para;<br>minuet and simply leave it to the discretion of the state&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>trial court what the remedy shall be? The answer, of&para;<br>course, is camouflage. Trial courts, after all, regularly&para;<br>accept or reject plea agreements, so there seems to be&para;<br>nothing extraordinary about their accepting or rejecting&para;<br>the new one mandated by today’s decision. But the ac­&para;<br>ceptance or rejection of a plea agreement that has no&para;<br>status whatever under the United States Constitution is&para;<br>worlds apart from what this is: “discretionary” specifi­&para;<br>cation of a remedy for an unconstitutional criminal&para;<br>conviction.&para;<br>To be sure, the Court asserts that there are “factors”&para;<br>which bear upon (and presumably limit) exercise of this&para;<br>discretion—factors that it is not prepared to specify in full,&para;<br>much less assign some determinative weight. “Principles&para;<br>elaborated over time in decisions of state and federal&para;<br>courts, and in statutes and rules” will (in the Court’s rosy&para;<br>view) sort all that out. Ante, at 13. I find it extraordinary&para;<br>that “statutes and rules” can specify the remedy for a&para;<br>criminal defendant’s unconstitutional conviction. Or that&para;<br>the remedy for an unconstitutional conviction should ever&para;<br>be subject at all to a trial judge’s discretion. Or, finally,&para;<br>that the remedy could ever include no remedy at all.&para;<br>I suspect that the Court’s squeamishness in fashioning a&para;<br>remedy, and the incoherence of what it comes up with, is&para;<br>attributable to its realization, deep down, that there is no&para;<br>real constitutional violation here anyway. The defendant&para;<br>has been fairly tried, lawfully convicted, and properly&para;<br>sentenced, and any “remedy” provided for this will do&para;<br>nothing but undo the just results of a fair adversarial&para;<br>process.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>In many—perhaps most—countries of the world, American­&para;<br>style plea bargaining is forbidden in cases as serious&para;<br>as this one, even for the purpose of obtaining testimony&para;<br>that enables conviction of a greater malefactor, much less&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>LAFLER v. COOPER&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>for the purpose of sparing the expense of trial. See, e.g.,&para;<br>World Plea Bargaining 344, 363–366 (S. Thaman ed.&para;<br>2010). In Europe, many countries adhere to what they&para;<br>aptly call the “legality principle” by requiring prosecutors&para;<br>to charge all prosecutable offenses, which is typically&para;<br>incompatible with the practice of charge-bargaining. See,&para;<br>e.g., id., at xxii; Langbein, Land Without Plea Bargaining:&para;<br>How the Germans Do It, 78 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 210–211&para;<br>(1979) (describing the “Legalitätsprinzip,” or rule of com­&para;<br>pulsory prosecution, in Germany). Such a system reflects&para;<br>an admirable belief that the law is the law, and those who&para;<br>break it should pay the penalty provided.&para;<br>In the United States, we have plea bargaining a-plenty,&para;<br>but until today it has been regarded as a necessary evil. It&para;<br>presents grave risks of prosecutorial overcharging that&para;<br>effectively compels an innocent defendant to avoid massive&para;<br>risk by pleading guilty to a lesser offense; and for guilty&para;<br>defendants it often—perhaps usually—results in a sen­&para;<br>tence well below what the law prescribes for the actual&para;<br>crime. But even so, we accept plea bargaining because&para;<br>many believe that without it our long and expensive pro­&para;<br>cess of criminal trial could not sustain the burden imposed&para;<br>on it, and our system of criminal justice would grind to a&para;<br>halt. See, e.g., Alschuler, Plea Bargaining and its History,&para;<br>79 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 38 (1979).&para;<br>Today, however, the Supreme Court of the United&para;<br>States elevates plea bargaining from a necessary evil to&para;<br>a constitutional entitlement. It is no longer a somewhat&para;<br>embarrassing adjunct to our criminal justice system;&para;<br>rather, as the Court announces in the companion case to&para;<br>this one, “ ‘it is the criminal justice system.’ ” Frye, ante, at&para;<br>7 (quoting approvingly from Scott 1912). Thus, even&para;<br>though there is no doubt that the respondent here is guilty&para;<br>of the offense with which he was charged; even though he&para;<br>has received the exorbitant gold standard of American&para;<br>justice—a full-dress criminal trial with its innumerable&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

The Court today embraces the sporting­&para;<br>chance theory of criminal law, in which the State functions&para;<br>like a conscientious casino-operator, giving each player a&para;<br>fair chance to beat the house, that is, to serve less time&para;<br>than the law says he deserves. And when a player is&para;<br>excluded from the tables, his constitutional rights have&para;<br>been violated. I do not subscribe to that theory. No one&para;<br>should, least of all the Justices of the Supreme Court.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Today’s decision upends decades of our cases, violates a&para;<br>federal statute, and opens a whole new boutique of consti­&para;<br>tutional jurisprudence (“plea-bargaining law”) without&para;<br>even specifying the remedies the boutique offers. The&para;<br>result in the present case is the undoing of an adjudicatory&para;<br>process that worked exactly as it is supposed to.

COOPER&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would represent an abuse of discretion in at least two&para;<br>circumstances: first, when important new information&para;<br>about a defendant’s culpability comes to light after the&para;<br>offer is rejected, and, second, when the rejection of the&para;<br>plea offer results in a substantial expenditure of scarce&para;<br>prosecutorial or judicial resources.&para;<br>The lower court judges who must implement today’s&para;<br>holding may—and I hope, will—do so in a way that mitigates its potential to produce unjust results. But I would&para;<br>not depend on these judges to come to the rescue. The&para;<br>Court’s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to&para;<br>counsel is unsound, and I therefore respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
