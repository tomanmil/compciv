UNITED STATES EX&para;<br>REL. KIRK&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–188.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 1, 2011—Decided May 16, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>The public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally fore&para;<br>closes private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or&para;<br>fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are “based&para;<br>upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,&para;<br>civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or&para;<br>Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investiga&para;<br>tion, or from the news media.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Respon&para;<br>dent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, pe&para;<br>titioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false&para;<br>claims for payment under its federal contracts. To support his alle&para;<br>gations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor&para;<br>Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed&para;<br>under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. §552.&para;<br>Granting Schindler’s motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded,&para;<br>inter alia, that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdic&para;<br>tion over Kirk’s allegations that were based on information disclosed&para;<br>in a Government “report” or “investigation.” The Second Circuit va&para;<br>cated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agency’s response to a&para;<br>FOIA request is neither a “report” nor an “investigation.”&para;<br>Held: A federal agency’s written response to a FOIA request for records&para;<br>constitutes a “report” within the meaning of the FCA’s public disclo&para;<br>sure bar. Pp. 4–14.&para;<br>(a) “[R]eport” in this context carries its ordinary meaning. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(1) Because the FCA does not define “report,” the Court looks&para;<br>first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Gross v. FBL Finan&para;<br>cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___. Dictionaries define “report” as,&para;<br>for example, something that gives information. This ordinary mean&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>EX REL. KIRK &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>ing is consistent with the public disclosure bar’s generally broad&para;<br>scope, see, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.&para;<br>United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the&para;<br>other sources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially “news&para;<br>media.” Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(2) Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower defini&para;<br>tion of “report.” The Second Circuit committed the very error this&para;<br>Court reversed in Graham County. In applying the noscitur a sociis&para;<br>canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for “report” was man&para;<br>dated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclo&para;<br>sure listed in the statute—in particular, the reference to “news me&para;<br>dia.” See 559 U. S., at ___. Applying the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“report” also does not render superfluous the other sources of public&para;<br>disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A). Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(b) The DOL’s three written FOIA responses in this case, along&para;<br>with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are “reports”&para;<br>within the public disclosure bar’s ordinary meaning. FOIA requires&para;<br>each agency receiving a request to “notify the person making such re&para;<br>quest of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§552(a)(6)(A)(i). Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted&para;<br>FOIA regulations mandating a written response. Such agency re&para;<br>sponses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of “report”&para;<br>as, e.g., something that gives information. Moreover, any records&para;<br>produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as&para;<br>if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report. Pp. 8–&para;<br>9.&para;<br>(c) This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be&para;<br>anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written&para;<br>FOIA responses. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(1) The Court’s holding is not inconsistent with the public disclo&para;<br>sure bar’s drafting history. If anything, the drafting history supports&para;<br>this Court’s holding. Kirk’s case seems a classic example of the “op&para;<br>portunistic” litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to&para;<br>discourage. Id., at ___. Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing&para;<br>and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he dis&para;<br>covers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially&para;<br>reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(2) Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA&para;<br>responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences. Kirk argues&para;<br>that the Court’s ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator pos&para;<br>sessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a&para;<br>request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents&para;<br>by way of a FOIA request. Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unre&para;<br>quested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Court is not troubled by the different treatment. By its plain terms,&para;<br>the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to oth&para;<br>ers. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anoma&para;<br>lous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar’s scope&para;<br>and some did not. Moreover, Kirk’s assertion that potential defen&para;<br>dants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA&para;<br>request for incriminating documents is pure speculation. Cf. id., at&para;<br>___. There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits&para;<br>that have long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within the&para;<br>public disclosure bar’s meaning. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(3) Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,&para;<br>Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define “report”&para;<br>to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents—e.g.,&para;<br>the Justice Department’s annual report of FOIA statistics—that are&para;<br>indisputably reports. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(d) Whether Kirk’s suit is “based upon . . . allegations or transac&para;<br>tions” disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on&para;<br>remand.

VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to&para;<br>agree in each of its contracts that it would “submit VETS–&para;<br>100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.” 48&para;<br>CFR §52.222–37(c) (2008); see also §22.1310(b).&para;<br>Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran&para;<br>who served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and&para;<br>Schindler from 1978 until 2003.

The OFCCP&para;<br>investigated Schindler’s compliance with VEVRAA and found insuffi&para;<br>cient evidence to support Kirk’s claim.

The FCA authorizes both civil actions&para;<br>by the Attorney General and private qui tam actions to&para;<br>enforce its provisions. §3730. When, as here, the Gov&para;<br>ernment chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action, the&para;<br>private relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of&para;<br>the proceeds of the action. §3730(d)(2).&para;<br>In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk al&para;<br>leged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false&para;<br>claims for payment under its Government contracts.&para;<br>According to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA’s&para;<br>reporting requirements by failing to file certain required&para;<br>VETS–100 reports and including false information in&para;<br>those it did file. The company’s claims for payment were&para;<br>false, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified&para;<br>its compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the&para;<br>amount of damages he sought on behalf of the United&para;<br>States, but he asserted that the value of Schindler’s&para;<br>VEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.&para;<br>To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information&para;<br>his wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of&para;<br>Labor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs.&para;<br>Kirk had sought all VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler&para;<br>for the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by&para;<br>letter or e-mail to each request with information about the&para;<br>records found for each year, including years for which no&para;<br>responsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs.&para;<br>Kirk that it found no VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler&para;<br>in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,&para;<br>the DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports&para;<br>filed by Schindler, 99 in all.&para;<br>Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,&para;<br>including that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived&para;<br>the District Court of jurisdiction.

The court effectively held&para;<br>that an agency’s response to a FOIA request is neither a&para;<br>“report” nor an “investigation” within the meaning of the&para;<br>FCA’s public disclosure bar. See id., at 103–111 (agreeing&para;<br>with United States ex rel. Haight v. Catholic Healthcare&para;<br>West, 445 F. 3d 1147 (CA9 2006), and disagreeing with&para;<br>United States ex rel.

C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Because the statute does not define “report,” we look&para;<br>first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See Gross v. FBL&para;<br>Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 7) (“Statutory construction must begin with the lan&para;<br>guage employed by Congress and the assumption that the&para;<br>ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses&para;<br>the legislative purpose” (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted)); Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187&para;<br>(1995) (“When terms used in a statute are undefined, we&para;<br>give them their ordinary meaning”). A “report” is “some&para;<br>thing that gives information” or a “notification,” Webster’s&para;<br>Third New International Dictionary 1925 (1986), or “[a]n&para;<br>official or formal statement of facts or proceedings,”&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990). See also 13&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary 650 (2d ed. 1989) (“[a]n account&para;<br>brought by one person to another”); American Heritage&para;<br>Dictionary 1103 (1981) (“[a]n account or announcement&para;<br>that is prepared, presented, or delivered, usually in formal&para;<br>or organized form”); Random House Dictionary 1634 (2d&para;<br>ed. 1987) (“an account or statement describing in detail an&para;<br>event, situation, or the like”).&para;<br>This broad ordinary meaning of “report” is consistent&para;<br>with the generally broad scope of the FCA’s public disclo&para;<br>sure bar. As we explained last Term, to determine the&para;<br>meaning of one word in the public disclosure bar, we must&para;<br>consider the provision’s “entire text,” read as an “inte&para;<br>grated whole.” Graham County Soil and Water Conserva&para;<br>tion Dist. v.

S. 656, 662 (2001) (“We do not . . . construe&para;<br>the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum”). The other&para;<br>sources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially&para;<br>“news media,” suggest that the public disclosure bar pro&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

The statute also mentions “administrative&para;<br>hearings” twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusive&para;<br>ness even at the risk of redundancy.&para;<br>The phrase “allegations or transactions” in §3730(e)&para;<br>(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclo&para;<br>sure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of&para;<br>“allegations” but also “transactions,” a term that courts&para;<br>have recognized as having a broad meaning. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U. S. 593, 610&para;<br>(1926) (“ ‘Transaction’ is a word of flexible meaning”);&para;<br>Hamilton v.

Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 30, n. 15 (“Each is part of the government’s&para;<br>ongoing effort to fight fraud”). Applying the noscitur a&para;<br>sociis canon, the Court of Appeals then determined that&para;<br>these “ ‘neighboring words’ ” mandated a narrower mean&para;<br>ing for “report” than its ordinary meaning. 601 F. 3d, at&para;<br>107.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals committed the very error we re&para;<br>versed in Graham County. Like the Fourth Circuit in that&para;<br>case, the Second Circuit here applied the noscitur a sociis&para;<br>canon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the&para;<br>exclusion of the rest of the statute.

We emphasized in Graham County that “all of the&para;<br>sources [of public disclosure] listed in §3730(e)(4)(A) pro&para;<br>vide interpretive guidance.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>8). When all of the sources are considered, the reference&para;<br>to “news media”—which the Court of Appeals did not&para;<br>consider—suggests a much broader scope. Ibid.&para;<br>The Government similarly errs by focusing only on&para;<br>the adjectives “congressional, administrative, or [GAO],”5&para;<br>which precede “report.” Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that&para;<br>the public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports&para;<br>“analogous to those that Congress and the GAO would&para;<br>issue or conduct.” Ibid. As we explained in Graham&para;<br>County, however, those three adjectives tell us nothing&para;<br>more than that a “report” must be governmental. See 559&para;<br>U. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 7, n. 7). The governmental&para;<br>nature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.&para;<br>Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of “report” does&para;<br>not render superfluous the other sources of public disclo&para;<br>sure in §3730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading “report”&para;<br>to mean “something that gives information” would sub&para;<br>sume the other words in the phrase “report, hearing,&para;<br>audit, or investigation.” Brief for Respondent 23. But&para;<br>Kirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are&para;<br>processes “to obtain information.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>Those processes are thus clearly different from “something&para;<br>that gives information.” Moreover, the statute contem&para;<br>plates some redundancy: An “audit,” for example, will&para;<br>often be a type of “investigation.”&para;<br>We are not persuaded that we should adopt a “different,&para;<br>somewhat special meaning” of “report” over the word’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>the statute refers to the “Government Accounting Office,”&para;<br>it is undisputed that Congress meant the General Accounting Office,&para;<br>also known as GAO and now renamed the Government Accountability&para;<br>Office.

Indeed, we have cautioned recently&para;<br>against interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way&para;<br>inconsistent with a plain reading of its text. In Graham&para;<br>County, we rejected several arguments for construing the&para;<br>statute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole “touch&para;<br>stone” in the statutory text is “public disclosure.” 559&para;<br>U.

We chose in that case&para;<br>simply to give the text its “most natura[l] read[ing],” id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A written agency response to a FOIA request falls&para;<br>within the ordinary meaning of “report.” FOIA requires&para;<br>each agency receiving a request to “notify the person&para;<br>making such request of [its] determination and the&para;<br>reasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C. §552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an&para;<br>agency denies a request in whole or in part, it must addi&para;<br>tionally “set forth the names and titles or positions of each&para;<br>person responsible for the denial,” “make a reasonable&para;<br>effort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,” and&para;<br>“provide any such estimate to the person making the&para;<br>request.” §§552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted&para;<br>more detailed regulations implementing FOIA and man&para;<br>dating a response in writing. See 29 CFR §70.21(a) (2009)&para;<br>(requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request&para;<br>and a description of the manner in which records will be&para;<br>disclosed); §§70.21(b)–(c) (requiring a “brief statement of&para;<br>the reason or reasons for [a] denial,” as well as written&para;<br>notification if a record “cannot be located or has been&para;<br>destroyed” (italics deleted)). So, too, have other federal&para;<br>agencies. See, e.g., 28 CFR §16.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice);&para;<br>43 CFR §2.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR §1.7 (2010)&para;<br>(Dept. of Agriculture).

It would not be anomalous if some&para;<br>methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the&para;<br>public disclosure bar and some did not.&para;<br>We also are not concerned that potential defendants will&para;<br>now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA&para;<br>request for incriminating documents. This argument&para;<br>assumes that the public disclosure of information in a&para;<br>written FOIA response forever taints that information for&para;<br>purposes of the public disclosure bar.
