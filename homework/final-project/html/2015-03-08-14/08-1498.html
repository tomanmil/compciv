HUMANI-&para;<br>&para;<br>TARIAN LAW PROJECT ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1498. Argued February 23, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010*&para;<br>It is a federal crime to “knowingly provid[e] material support or re&para;<br>sources to a foreign terrorist organization.” 18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1).&para;<br>The authority to designate an entity a “foreign terrorist organization”&para;<br>rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.&para;<br>“[T]he term ‘material support or resources’ means any property, tan&para;<br>gible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary in&para;<br>struments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training,&para;<br>expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or iden&para;<br>tification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal sub&para;<br>stances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or&para;<br>include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious ma&para;<br>terials.” §2339A(b)(1). Over the years, §2339B and the definition of&para;<br>“material support or resources” have been amended, inter alia, to&para;<br>clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group’s des&para;<br>ignation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts,&para;<br>§2339B(a)(1); and to define the terms “training,” §2339A(b)(2), “ex&para;<br>pert advice or assistance,” §2339A(b)(3), and “personnel,” §2339B(h).&para;<br>Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated “foreign&para;<br>terrorist organization[s]” are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK)&para;<br>and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to es&para;<br>tablish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and&para;<br>Tamils in Sri Lanka. Although both groups engage in political and&para;<br>humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist&para;<br>attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens. Claiming&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 09–89, Humanitarian Law Project et al. v.&para;<br>Holder, Attorney General, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>they wish to support those groups’ lawful, nonviolent activities, two&para;<br>U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs)&para;<br>initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support stat&para;<br>ute. The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history. Ulti&para;<br>mately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the&para;<br>material-support statute against plaintiffs. After the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certio&para;<br>rari. The Court granted both petitions.&para;<br>As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge §2339B’s prohibi&para;<br>tion on providing four types of material support—“training,” “expert&para;<br>advice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—asserting violations&para;<br>of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause on the ground that the&para;<br>statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First&para;<br>Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. They claim&para;<br>that §2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging&para;<br>in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use&para;<br>international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK mem&para;<br>bers to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies&para;<br>for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living&para;<br>in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The material-support statute, §2339B, is constitutional as applied&para;<br>to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to&para;<br>foreign terrorist organizations. Pp. 8–36.&para;<br>(a) This preenforcement challenge to §2339B is a justiciable Article&para;<br>III case or controversy. Plaintiffs face “a credible threat of prosecu&para;<br>tion” and “should not be required to await and undergo a criminal&para;<br>prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm&para;<br>Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. P. 10.&para;<br>(b) The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga&para;<br>tion by accepting plaintiffs’ argument that the material-support stat&para;<br>ute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof&para;<br>that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization’s&para;<br>illegal activities. That reading is inconsistent with §2339B’s text,&para;<br>which prohibits “knowingly” providing material support and demon&para;<br>strates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization’s con&para;<br>nection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activi&para;<br>ties, as the necessary mental state for a violation. Plaintiffs’ reading&para;<br>is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding&para;<br>§2339B, which—unlike §2339B—do refer to intent to further terrorist&para;<br>activity. See §§2339A(a), 2339C(a)(1). Finally, there is no textual&para;<br>basis for plaintiffs’ argument that the same language in §2339B&para;<br>should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but&para;<br>not with regard to other forms of material support. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>(c) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not un&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>constitutionally vague. The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plain&para;<br>tiffs’ vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, hold&para;<br>ing that “training,” “service,” and a portion of “expert advice or assis&para;<br>tance” were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected&para;<br>speech—regardless of whether those applications were clear. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals also contravened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who en&para;<br>gages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of&para;<br>the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.” Hoff&para;<br>man Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.&para;<br>The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, “pro&para;<br>vide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohib&para;<br>ited.” United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304. The statutory&para;<br>terms at issue here—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser&para;<br>vice,” and “personnel”—are quite different from the sorts of terms,&para;<br>like “ ‘annoying’ ” and “ ‘indecent,’ ” that the Court has struck down for&para;<br>requiring “wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,&para;<br>narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.” Id., at 306. Congress&para;<br>has increased the clarity of §2339B’s terms by adding narrowing&para;<br>definitions, and §2339B’s knowledge requirement further reduces any&para;<br>potential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.&para;<br>Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dis&para;<br>positive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plain&para;<br>tiffs’ proposed conduct. Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek&para;<br>to engage readily fall within the scope of “training” and “expert ad&para;<br>vice or assistance.” In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly&para;<br>used those terms to describe their own proposed activities. Plaintiffs’&para;<br>resort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of “training” and&para;<br>“expert advice or assistance” is beside the point because this litiga&para;<br>tion does not concern such situations. See Scales v. United States,&para;<br>367 U. S. 203, 223. Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030,&para;<br>1049–1051, distinguished. Plaintiffs’ further contention, that the&para;<br>statute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish&para;<br>to undertake, runs afoul of §2339B(h), which makes clear that “per&para;<br>sonnel” does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independ&para;<br>ently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“service,” which refers to concerted activity, not independent advo&para;<br>cacy. Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a&para;<br>cause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service “to a&para;<br>foreign terrorist organization.” §2339B(a)(1).&para;<br>Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage&para;<br>is not prohibited by §2339B. On the other hand, a person of ordinary&para;<br>intelligence would understand the term “service” to cover advocacy&para;<br>performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign ter&para;<br>rorist organization. Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or co&para;<br>ordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a “service.” Be&para;<br>cause plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the de&para;<br>gree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK&para;<br>and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement&para;<br>challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Repub&para;<br>lican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454. Pp. 13–20.&para;<br>(d) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not&para;<br>violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.&para;<br>Pp. 20–34.&para;<br>(1) Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on&para;<br>this question. Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure&para;<br>political speech. That claim is unfounded because, under the mate&para;<br>rial-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.&para;<br>Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or member&para;<br>ship in the PKK and LTTE. Rather, Congress has prohibited “mate&para;<br>rial support,” which most often does not take the form of speech. And&para;<br>when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow&para;<br>category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with&para;<br>foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.&para;<br>On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only&para;<br>thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the cor&para;<br>rect standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United&para;<br>States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377. That standard is not used to&para;<br>review a content-based regulation of speech, and §2339B regulates&para;<br>plaintiffs’ speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its con&para;<br>tent. Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a&para;<br>regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering&para;<br>coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.&para;<br>Thus, the Court “must [apply] a more demanding standard” than the&para;<br>one described in O’Brien. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403. Pp.&para;<br>20–23.&para;<br>(2) The parties agree that the Government’s interest in combat&para;<br>ing terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs&para;<br>argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech,&para;<br>which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK&para;<br>and LTTE. Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully&para;<br>segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terror&para;<br>ism is an empirical question. Congress rejected plaintiffs’ position on&para;<br>that question when it enacted §2339B, finding that “foreign organiza&para;<br>tions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal&para;<br>conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that&para;<br>conduct.” §301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following §2339B. The record&para;<br>confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs’ view. The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups. It is not difficult to conclude,&para;<br>as Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great&para;<br>that working in coordination with them or at their command legiti&para;<br>mizes and furthers their terrorist means. Moreover, material sup&para;<br>port meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to&para;<br>advance terrorism in multiple ways. The record shows that desig&para;<br>nated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational&para;<br>firewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or finan&para;<br>cial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and&para;<br>those used to carry out terrorist attacks. Providing material support&para;<br>in any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to&para;<br>prevent terrorism and strain the United States’ relationships with its&para;<br>allies, including those that are defending themselves against violent&para;<br>insurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups. Pp. 23–28.&para;<br>(3) The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual infer&para;<br>ences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive&para;<br>Branch’s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government&para;<br>agencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Con&para;<br>gress’s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organiza&para;<br>tions—even those for seemingly benign purposes—further those&para;<br>groups’ terrorist activities. That evaluation of the facts, like Con&para;<br>gress’s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive na&para;<br>tional security and foreign relations interests at stake. The Court&para;<br>does not defer to the Government’s reading of the First Amendment.&para;<br>But respect for the Government’s factual conclusions is appropriate&para;<br>in light of the courts’ lack of expertise with respect to national secu&para;<br>rity and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terror&para;<br>ist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to ob&para;<br>tain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and&para;<br>conclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than&para;<br>concrete evidence. The Court also finds it significant that Congress&para;<br>has been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its ac&para;<br>tions may implicate constitutional concerns. Most importantly, Con&para;<br>gress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed&para;<br>any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by for&para;<br>eign terrorist groups. Given the sensitive interests in national secu&para;<br>rity and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have ade&para;<br>quately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material&para;<br>support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services&para;<br>to foreign terrorist groups serves the Government’s interest in pre&para;<br>venting terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to pro&para;<br>mote only the groups’ nonviolent ends.&para;<br>As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is&para;<br>wholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use in&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ternational law to resolve disputes would provide that group with in&para;<br>formation and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strat&para;<br>egy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.&para;<br>Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could&para;<br>help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of&para;<br>Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot&para;<br>prevail in this preenforcement challenge. The Court does not decide&para;<br>whether any future applications of the material-support statute to&para;<br>speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It simply&para;<br>holds that §2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied&para;<br>to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide. Pp.&para;<br>28–34.&para;<br>(e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs’ First&para;<br>Amendment freedom of association. Plaintiffs argue that the statute&para;<br>criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the&para;<br>LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court’s precedents. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit correctly rejected this claim because §2339B does not penalize&para;<br>mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist&para;<br>groups material support. Any burden on plaintiffs’ freedom of asso&para;<br>ciation caused by preventing them from supporting designated for&para;<br>eign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the&para;<br>same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

Second, plain­&para;<br>tiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.&para;<br>Id., at 1184–1185.&para;<br>Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the&para;<br>District Court granted in part. The District Court held&para;<br>that plaintiffs had not established a probability of success&para;<br>on their First Amendment speech and association claims.&para;<br>See id., at 1196–1197. But the court held that plaintiffs&para;<br>had established a probability of success on their claim&para;<br>that, as applied to them, the statutory terms “personnel”&para;<br>and “training” in the definition of “material support” were&para;<br>impermissibly vague. See id., at 1204.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals affirmed. 205 F. 3d 1130, 1138&para;<br>(CA9 2000). The court rejected plaintiffs’ speech and&para;<br>association claims, including their claim that §2339B&para;<br>violated the First Amendment in barring them from con­&para;<br>tributing money to the PKK and the LTTE. See id., at&para;<br>1133–1136. But the Court of Appeals agreed with the&para;<br>District Court that the terms “personnel” and “training”&para;<br>were vague because it was “easy to imagine protected&para;<br>expression that falls within the bounds” of those terms.&para;<br>Id., at 1138; see id., at 1137.&para;<br>With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the&para;<br>action returned to the District Court, and the parties&para;<br>moved for summary judgment on the merits. The District&para;<br>Court entered a permanent injunction against applying to&para;<br>plaintiffs the bans on “personnel” and “training” support.&para;<br>See No. CV–98–1971 ABC (BQRx), 2001 WL 36105333&para;<br>(CD Cal., Oct. 2, 2001). The Court of Appeals affirmed.&para;<br>352 F. 3d 382 (CA9 2003).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Meanwhile, in 2001, Congress amended the definition of&para;<br>“material support or resources” to add the term “expert&para;<br>advice or assistance.” Uniting and Strengthening America&para;<br>by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and&para;<br>Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act),&para;<br>§805(a)(2)(B), 115 Stat. 377. In 2003, plaintiffs filed a&para;<br>second action challenging the constitutionality of that&para;<br>term as applied to them. 309 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1192 (CD&para;<br>Cal. 2004).&para;<br>In that action, the Government argued that plaintiffs&para;<br>lacked standing and that their preenforcement claims&para;<br>were not ripe. Id., at 1194. The District Court held that&para;<br>plaintiffs’ claims were justiciable because plaintiffs had&para;<br>sufficiently demonstrated a “genuine threat of imminent&para;<br>prosecution,” id., at 1195 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted), and because §2339B had the potential to chill plain­&para;<br>tiffs’ protected expression, see id., at 1197–1198. On the&para;<br>merits, the District Court held that the term “expert ad­&para;<br>vice or assistance” was impermissibly vague. Id., at 1201.&para;<br>The District Court rejected, however, plaintiffs’ First&para;<br>Amendment claims that the new term was substantially&para;<br>overbroad and criminalized associational speech. See id.,&para;<br>at 1202, 1203.&para;<br>The parties cross-appealed. While the cross-appeals&para;<br>were pending, the Ninth Circuit granted en banc rehear­&para;<br>ing of the panel’s 2003 decision in plaintiffs’ first action&para;<br>(involving the terms “personnel” and “training”). See 382&para;<br>F. 3d 1154, 1155 (2004). The en banc court heard reargu­&para;<br>ment on December 14, 2004. See 380 F. Supp. 2d 1134,&para;<br>1138 (CD Cal. 2005). Three days later, Congress again&para;<br>amended §2339B and the definition of “material support&para;<br>or resources.” Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Preven­&para;<br>tion Act of 2004 (IRTPA), §6603, 118 Stat. 3762–3764.&para;<br>In IRTPA, Congress clarified the mental state necessary&para;<br>to violate §2339B, requiring knowledge of the foreign&para;<br>group’s designation as a terrorist organization or the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>group’s commission of terrorist acts. §2339B(a)(1). Con­&para;<br>gress also added the term “service” to the definition of&para;<br>“material support or resources,” §2339A(b)(1), and defined&para;<br>“training” to mean “instruction or teaching designed to&para;<br>impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,”&para;<br>§2339A(b)(2). It also defined “expert advice or assistance”&para;<br>to mean “advice or assistance derived from scientific,&para;<br>technical or other specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3).&para;<br>Finally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term “personnel”&para;<br>by providing:&para;<br>“No person may be prosecuted under [§2339B] in con­&para;<br>nection with the term ‘personnel’ unless that person&para;<br>has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or con­&para;<br>spired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with&para;<br>1 or more individuals (who may be or include himself)&para;<br>to work under that terrorist organization’s direction&para;<br>or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or other­&para;<br>wise direct the operation of that organization. Indi­&para;<br>viduals who act entirely independently of the foreign&para;<br>terrorist organization to advance its goals or objec­&para;<br>tives shall not be considered to be working under the&para;<br>foreign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”&para;<br>§2339B(h).&para;<br>Shortly after Congress enacted IRTPA, the en banc&para;<br>Court of Appeals issued an order in plaintiffs’ first action.&para;<br>393 F. 3d 902, 903 (CA9 2004). The en banc court af­&para;<br>firmed the rejection of plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims&para;<br>for the reasons set out in the Ninth Circuit’s panel deci­&para;<br>sion in 2000. See ibid. In light of IRTPA, however, the en&para;<br>banc court vacated the panel’s 2003 judgment with respect&para;<br>to vagueness, and remanded to the District Court for&para;<br>further proceedings. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit panel as­&para;<br>signed to the cross-appeals in plaintiffs’ second action&para;<br>(relating to “expert advice or assistance”) also remanded in&para;<br>light of IRTPA. See 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1139.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The District Court consolidated the two actions on re­&para;<br>mand. See ibid. The court also allowed plaintiffs to chal­&para;<br>lenge the new term “service.” See id., at 1151, n. 24. The&para;<br>parties moved for summary judgment, and the District&para;<br>Court granted partial relief to plaintiffs on vagueness&para;<br>grounds. See id., at 1156.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals affirmed once more. 552 F. 3d&para;<br>916, 933 (CA9 2009). The court first rejected plaintiffs’&para;<br>claim that the material-support statute would violate due&para;<br>process unless it were read to require a specific intent to&para;<br>further the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.&para;<br>See id., at 926–927. The Ninth Circuit also held that the&para;<br>statute was not overbroad in violation of the First&para;<br>Amendment. See id., at 931–932. As for vagueness, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a&para;<br>“facial vagueness challenge.” Id., at 929, n. 6. The court&para;<br>held that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms “training,”&para;<br>“expert advice or assistance” (when derived from “other&para;<br>specialized knowledge”), and “service” were vague because&para;<br>they “continue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advo­&para;<br>cacy,” but the term “personnel” was not vague because it&para;<br>“no longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the&para;<br>First Amendment.” Id., at 929–931.&para;<br>The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs&para;<br>filed a conditional cross-petition. We granted both peti­&para;<br>tions. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation,&para;<br>we pause to clarify the questions before us. Plaintiffs&para;<br>challenge §2339B’s prohibition on four types of material&para;<br>support—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser­&para;<br>vice,” and “personnel.” They raise three constitutional&para;<br>claims. First, plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates the&para;<br>Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these&para;<br>four statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates their freedom of&para;<br>speech under the First Amendment. Third, plaintiffs&para;<br>claim that §2339B violates their First Amendment free­&para;<br>dom of association.&para;<br>Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in&para;<br>all their applications. Rather, plaintiffs claim that §2339B&para;<br>is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in&para;<br>certain specified activities. See Brief for Plaintiffs 16–17,&para;<br>n. 10. With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those&para;<br>activities are: (1) “train[ing] members of [the] PKK on how&para;<br>to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully&para;<br>resolve disputes”; (2) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on&para;<br>behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey”; and (3) “teach[ing]&para;<br>PKK members how to petition various representative&para;<br>bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at&para;<br>921, n. 1; see 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1136. With respect to the&para;<br>other plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) “train[ing] mem­&para;<br>bers of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related&para;<br>aid to mediators and international bodies”; (2) “offer[ing]&para;<br>their legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements&para;<br>between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government”; and&para;<br>(3) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils&para;<br>who live in Sri Lanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; see 380&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1137.&para;<br>Plaintiffs also state that “the LTTE was recently de­&para;<br>feated militarily in Sri Lanka,” so “[m]uch of the support&para;<br>the Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to&para;<br>provide is now moot.” Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n. 5. Plain­&para;<br>tiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE “as a political&para;<br>organization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of&para;<br>Tamils.” Ibid. Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at&para;<br>oral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the&para;<br>LTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid,&para;<br>because the LTTE now “has no role in Sri Lanka.” Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 63. For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate&para;<br>a peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>well. Thus, we do not consider the application of §2339B&para;<br>to those activities here.&para;<br>One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of&para;<br>a criminal statute. Before addressing the merits, we must&para;<br>be sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under&para;<br>Article III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face “a credi­&para;<br>ble threat of prosecution” and “should not be required to&para;<br>await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole&para;<br>means of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442&para;<br>U. S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>See also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S.&para;<br>118, 128–129 (2007).&para;<br>Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK&para;<br>and the LTTE before the enactment of §2339B and that&para;<br>they would provide similar support again if the statute’s&para;<br>allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.&para;<br>See 309&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 1197. The Government tells us that it has&para;<br>charged about 150 persons with violating §2339B, and&para;<br>that several of those prosecutions involved the enforce­&para;<br>ment of the statutory terms at issue here. See Brief for&para;<br>Government 5. The Government has not argued to this&para;<br>Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what&para;<br>they say they wish to do. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58. See&para;<br>Babbitt, supra, at 302. See also Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milav&para;<br>etz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforce­&para;<br>ment challenge brought under the First Amendment).&para;<br>Based on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs’&para;<br>claims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope&para;<br>after 12 years of litigation).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should&para;<br>affirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of&para;<br>constitutional law. They contend that we should interpret&para;<br>the material-support statute, when applied to speech, to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>require proof that a defendant intended to further a for­&para;<br>eign terrorist organization’s illegal activities. That inter­&para;<br>pretation, they say, would end the litigation because plain­&para;<br>tiffs’ proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do&para;<br>not intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the&para;<br>LTTE.&para;<br>We reject plaintiffs’ interpretation of §2339B because it&para;<br>is inconsistent with the text of the statute. Section&para;<br>2339B(a)(1) prohibits “knowingly” providing material&para;<br>support. It then specifically describes the type of knowl­&para;<br>edge that is required: “To violate this paragraph, a per­&para;<br>son must have knowledge that the organization is a&para;<br>designated terrorist organization . . ., that the organiza­&para;<br>tion has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . ., or&para;<br>that the organization has engaged or engages in terror­&para;<br>ism. . . .” Ibid. Congress plainly spoke to the necessary&para;<br>mental state for a violation of §2339B, and it chose&para;<br>knowledge about the organization’s connection to terror­&para;<br>ism, not specific intent to further the organization’s&para;<br>terrorist activities.&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ interpretation is also untenable in light of the&para;<br>sections immediately surrounding §2339B, both of which&para;<br>do refer to intent to further terrorist activity.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§2339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who&para;<br>“provides material support or resources . . . knowing or&para;<br>intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in&para;<br>carrying out, a violation of” statutes prohibiting violent&para;<br>terrorist acts); §2339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for&para;<br>one who “unlawfully and willfully provides or collects&para;<br>funds with the intention that such funds be used, or with&para;<br>the knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in&para;<br>part, in order to carry out” other unlawful acts). Congress&para;<br>enacted §2339A in 1994 and §2339C in 2002.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (§2339A); §202(a), 116 Stat.&para;<br>724 (§2339C). Yet Congress did not import the intent&para;<br>language of those provisions into §2339B, either when it&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>enacted §2339B in 1996, or when it clarified §2339B’s&para;<br>knowledge requirement in 2004.&para;<br>Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue&para;<br>that a specific intent requirement should apply only when&para;<br>the material-support statute applies to speech. There is&para;<br>no basis whatever in the text of §2339B to read the same&para;<br>provisions in that statute as requiring intent in some&para;<br>circumstances but not others. It is therefore clear that&para;<br>plaintiffs are asking us not to interpret §2339B, but to&para;<br>revise it. “Although this Court will often strain to con­&para;<br>strue legislation so as to save it against constitutional&para;<br>attack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of&para;<br>perverting the purpose of a statute.” Scales v. United&para;<br>States, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961).&para;<br>Scales is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely,&para;<br>but it is readily distinguishable. That case involved the&para;<br>Smith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advo­&para;<br>cating the violent overthrow of the government. The&para;<br>Court held that a person could not be convicted under the&para;<br>statute unless he had knowledge of the group’s illegal&para;<br>advocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent over­&para;<br>throw. Id., at 220–222, 229. This action is different:&para;<br>Section 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a&para;<br>designated foreign terrorist organization. It instead pro­&para;<br>hibits providing “material support” to such a group. See&para;<br>infra, at 20–21, 35. Nothing about Scales suggests the&para;<br>need for a specific intent requirement in such a case. The&para;<br>Court in Scales, moreover, relied on both statutory text&para;<br>and precedent that had interpreted closely related provi­&para;<br>sions of the Smith Act to require specific intent. 367 U. S.,&para;<br>at 209, 221–222. Plaintiffs point to nothing similar here.&para;<br>We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga­&para;<br>tion through plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation of §2339B.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The dissent would interpret the statute along the same lines as the&para;<br>plaintiffs, to prohibit speech and association “only when the defendant&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>IV&para;<br>We turn to the question whether the material-support&para;<br>statute, as applied to plaintiffs, is impermissibly vague&para;<br>under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.&para;<br>“A conviction fails to comport with due process if the stat­&para;<br>ute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of&para;<br>ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is&para;<br>so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously&para;<br>discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams,&para;<br>553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). We consider whether a statute&para;<br>is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for “[a]&para;<br>plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly&para;<br>proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as&para;<br>applied to the conduct of others.” Hoffman Estates v.&para;<br>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982).&para;<br>We have said that when a statute “interferes with the&para;<br>right of free speech or of association, a more stringent&para;<br>vagueness test should apply.” Id., at 499. “But ‘perfect&para;<br>clarity and precise guidance have never been required&para;<br>even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.’ ”&para;<br>Williams, supra, at 304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against&para;<br>Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 794 (1989)).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.&para;<br>Instead, the lower court merged plaintiffs’ vagueness&para;<br>challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding&para;<br>that portions of the material-support statute were uncon­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>knows or intends that those activities will assist the organization’s&para;<br>unlawful terrorist actions.” Post, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Accord­&para;<br>ing to the dissent, this interpretation is “fairly possible” and adopting it&para;<br>would avoid constitutional concerns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The dissent’s interpretation of §2339B fails for essentially the&para;<br>same reasons as plaintiffs’. Congress explained what “knowingly”&para;<br>means in §2339B, and it did not choose the dissent’s interpretation of&para;<br>that term. In fact, the dissent proposes a mental-state requirement&para;<br>indistinguishable from the one Congress adopted in §§2339A and&para;<br>2339C, even though Congress used markedly different language in&para;<br>§2339B.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stitutionally vague because they applied to protected&para;<br>speech—regardless of whether those applications were&para;<br>clear. The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary&para;<br>intelligence understood the scope of the term “training,”&para;<br>that term would “remai[n] impermissibly vague” because&para;<br>it could “be read to encompass speech and advocacy pro­&para;<br>tected by the First Amendment.” 552 F. 3d, at 929. It also&para;<br>found “service” and a portion of “expert advice or assis­&para;<br>tance” to be vague because those terms covered protected&para;<br>speech. Id., at 929–930.&para;<br>Further, in spite of its own statement that it was not&para;<br>addressing a “facial vagueness challenge,” id., at 929, n. 6,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals considered the statute’s application&para;<br>to facts not before it. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied&para;<br>on the Government’s statement that §2339B would bar&para;<br>filing an amicus brief in support of a foreign terrorist&para;<br>organization—which plaintiffs have not told us they wish&para;<br>to do, and which the Ninth Circuit did not say plaintiffs&para;<br>wished to do—to conclude that the statute barred pro­&para;<br>tected advocacy and was therefore vague. See id., at 930.&para;<br>By deciding how the statute applied in hypothetical cir­&para;<br>cumstances, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of vagueness&para;<br>seemed to incorporate elements of First Amendment&para;<br>overbreadth doctrine. See id., at 929–930 (finding it “easy&para;<br>to imagine” protected expression that would be barred by&para;<br>§2339B (internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 930&para;<br>(referring to both vagueness and overbreadth).&para;<br>In both of these respects, the Court of Appeals contra­&para;<br>vened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who engages in some&para;<br>conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the&para;<br>vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.”&para;<br>Hoffman Estates, supra, at 495. That rule makes no ex­&para;<br>ception for conduct in the form of speech. See Parker v.&para;<br>Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 755–757 (1974). Thus, even to the&para;<br>extent a heightened vagueness standard applies, a plain­&para;<br>tiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a suc­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cessful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of&para;<br>the Fifth Amendment for lack of notice. And he certainly&para;<br>cannot do so based on the speech of others. Such a plain­&para;<br>tiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the First&para;<br>Amendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth&para;<br>Amendment vagueness challenge does not turn on&para;<br>whether a law applies to a substantial amount of protected&para;<br>expression. See Williams, supra, at 304; Hoffman Estates,&para;<br>supra, at 494–495, 497. Otherwise the doctrines would be&para;<br>substantially redundant.&para;<br>Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs’ claims of vagueness&para;<br>lack merit. Plaintiffs do not argue that the material­&para;<br>support statute grants too much enforcement discretion to&para;<br>the Government. We therefore address only whether the&para;<br>statute “provide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair&para;<br>notice of what is prohibited.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 304.&para;<br>As a general matter, the statutory terms at issue here&para;<br>are quite different from the sorts of terms that we have&para;<br>previously declared to be vague. We have in the past&para;<br>“struck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to&para;<br>whether the defendant’s conduct was ‘annoying’ or ‘inde­&para;<br>cent’—wholly subjective judgments without statutory&para;<br>definitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.”&para;<br>Id., at 306; see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S.&para;<br>156, n. 1 (1972) (holding vague an ordinance that pun­&para;<br>ished “vagrants,” defined to include “rogues and vaga­&para;<br>bonds,” “persons who use juggling,” and “common night&para;<br>walkers” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Applying&para;<br>the statutory terms in this action—“training,” “expert&para;<br>advice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—does not&para;<br>require similarly untethered, subjective judgments.&para;<br>Congress also took care to add narrowing definitions to&para;<br>the material-support statute over time. These definitions&para;<br>increased the clarity of the statute’s terms.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§2339A(b)(2) (“ ‘training’ means instruction or teaching&para;<br>designed to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>knowledge”); §2339A(b)(3) (“ ‘expert advice or assistance’&para;<br>means advice or assistance derived from scientific, techni­&para;<br>cal or other specialized knowledge”); §2339B(h) (clarifying&para;<br>the scope of “personnel”). And the knowledge requirement&para;<br>of the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness,&para;<br>as we have held with respect to other statutes containing a&para;<br>similar requirement. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703,&para;<br>732 (2000); Posters ‘N’ Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511&para;<br>U. S. 513, 523, 526 (1994); see also Hoffman Estates, 455&para;<br>U. S., at 499.&para;<br>Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may&para;<br>not be clear in every application. But the dispositive point&para;<br>here is that the statutory terms are clear in their applica­&para;<br>tion to plaintiffs’ proposed conduct, which means that&para;<br>plaintiffs’ vagueness challenge must fail. Even assuming&para;<br>that a heightened standard applies because the material­&para;<br>support statute potentially implicates speech, the statu­&para;<br>tory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs. See&para;<br>Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 114–115 (1972)&para;<br>(rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that&para;<br>implicated First Amendment activities); Scales, 367 U. S.,&para;<br>at 223 (same).&para;<br>Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage&para;<br>readily fall within the scope of the terms “training” and&para;<br>“expert advice or assistance.” Plaintiffs want to “train&para;<br>members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and&para;<br>international law to peacefully resolve disputes,” and&para;<br>“teach PKK members how to petition various representa­&para;<br>tive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552&para;<br>F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. A person of ordinary intelligence would&para;<br>understand that instruction on resolving disputes through&para;<br>international law falls within the statute’s definition of&para;<br>“training” because it imparts a “specific skill,” not “general&para;<br>knowledge.” §2339A(b)(2). Plaintiffs’ activities also fall&para;<br>comfortably within the scope of “expert advice or assis­&para;<br>tance”: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the PKK how to petition for humanitarian relief before the&para;<br>United Nations involves advice derived from, as the stat­&para;<br>ute puts it, “specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3). In fact,&para;<br>plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms&para;<br>“training” and “expert advice” throughout this litigation to&para;<br>describe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that&para;<br>these common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs’&para;<br>conduct. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58,&para;<br>59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.&para;<br>Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations&para;<br>designed to test the limits of “training” and “expert advice&para;<br>or assistance.” They argue that the statutory definitions&para;<br>of these terms use words of degree—like “specific,” “gen­&para;<br>eral,” and “specialized”—and that it is difficult to apply&para;<br>those definitions in particular cases. See Brief for Plain­&para;<br>tiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography&para;<br>would constitute training); id., at 29. And they cite Gen&para;<br>tile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030 (1991), in which we&para;<br>found vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a&para;<br>criminal case, when speaking to the press, “may state&para;<br>without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . .&para;<br>defense.” Id., at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Whatever force these arguments might have in the&para;<br>abstract, they are beside the point here. Plaintiffs do not&para;<br>propose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek&para;<br>refuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary&para;<br>between “specific skills” and “general knowledge.” See&para;<br>Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S., at 756. We emphasized this&para;<br>point in Scales, holding that even if there might be theo­&para;<br>retical doubts regarding the distinction between “active”&para;<br>and “nominal” membership in an organization—also terms&para;<br>of degree—the defendant’s vagueness challenge failed&para;<br>because his “case present[ed] no such problem.” 367 U. S.,&para;<br>at 223.&para;<br>Gentile was different. There the asserted vagueness in&para;<br>a state bar rule was directly implicated by the facts before&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Court: Counsel had reason to suppose that his particu­&para;<br>lar statements to the press would not violate the rule, yet&para;<br>he was disciplined nonetheless. See 501 U. S., at 1049–&para;<br>1051. We did not suggest that counsel could escape disci­&para;<br>pline on vagueness grounds if his own speech were plainly&para;<br>prohibited.&para;<br>Plaintiffs also contend that they want to engage in&para;<br>“political advocacy” on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey&para;<br>and Tamils living in Sri Lanka. 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.&para;<br>They are concerned that such advocacy might be regarded&para;<br>as “material support” in the form of providing “personnel”&para;<br>or “service[s],” and assert that the statute is unconstitu­&para;<br>tionally vague because they cannot tell.&para;<br>As for “personnel,” Congress enacted a limiting defini­&para;<br>tion in IRTPA that answers plaintiffs’ vagueness concerns.&para;<br>Providing material support that constitutes “personnel” is&para;<br>defined as knowingly providing a person “to work under&para;<br>that terrorist organization’s direction or control or to&para;<br>organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the op­&para;<br>eration of that organization.” §2339B(h). The statute&para;<br>makes clear that “personnel” does not cover independent&para;<br>advocacy: “Individuals who act entirely independently of&para;<br>the foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or&para;<br>objectives shall not be considered to be working under the&para;<br>foreign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>“[S]ervice” similarly refers to concerted activity, not&para;<br>independent advocacy. See Webster’s Third New Interna­&para;<br>tional Dictionary 2075 (1993) (defining “service” to mean&para;<br>“the performance of work commanded or paid for by an­&para;<br>other: a servant’s duty: attendance on a superior”; or “an&para;<br>act done for the benefit or at the command of another”).&para;<br>Context confirms that ordinary meaning here. The statute&para;<br>prohibits providing a service “to a foreign terrorist organi­&para;<br>zation.” §2339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). The use of the&para;<br>word “to” indicates a connection between the service and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the foreign group. We think a person of ordinary intelli­&para;<br>gence would understand that independently advocating for&para;<br>a cause is different from providing a service to a group&para;<br>that is advocating for that cause.&para;<br>Moreover, if independent activity in support of a terror­&para;<br>ist group could be characterized as a “service,” the stat­&para;<br>ute’s specific exclusion of independent activity in the&para;<br>definition of “personnel” would not make sense. Congress&para;<br>would not have prohibited under “service” what it specifi­&para;<br>cally exempted from prohibition under “personnel.” The&para;<br>other types of material support listed in the statute, in­&para;<br>cluding “lodging,” “weapons,” “explosives,” and “transpor­&para;<br>tation,” §2339A(b)(1), are not forms of support that could&para;<br>be provided independently of a foreign terrorist organiza­&para;<br>tion. We interpret “service” along the same lines. Thus,&para;<br>any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to&para;<br>engage is not prohibited by §2339B. On the other hand, a&para;<br>person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term&para;<br>“service” to cover advocacy performed in coordination with,&para;<br>or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.&para;<br>Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute&para;<br>poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or&para;<br>coordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a&para;<br>“service.” See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 09–89,&para;<br>p. 14 (hereinafter Reply Brief for Plaintiffs) (“Would any&para;<br>communication with any member be sufficient? With a&para;<br>leader? Must the ‘relationship’ have any formal elements,&para;<br>such as an employment or contractual relationship? What&para;<br>about a relationship through an intermediary?”). The&para;<br>problem with these questions is that they are entirely&para;<br>hypothetical. Plaintiffs have not provided any specific&para;<br>articulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate&para;<br>their advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE. They have&para;<br>instead described the form of their intended advocacy only&para;<br>in the most general terms. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs&para;<br>10–11 (plaintiffs “would like, among other things, to offer&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>their services to advocate on behalf of the rights of the&para;<br>Kurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations&para;<br>and the United States Congress” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and alteration omitted)); App. 59 (plaintiffs would&para;<br>like to “write and distribute publications supportive of the&para;<br>PKK and the cause of Kurdish liberation” and “advocate&para;<br>for the freedom of political prisoners in Turkey”).&para;<br>Deciding whether activities described at such a level of&para;<br>generality would constitute prohibited “service[s]” under&para;<br>the statute would require “sheer speculation”—which&para;<br>means that plaintiffs cannot prevail in their preenforce­&para;<br>ment challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Wash&para;<br>ington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454 (2008).&para;<br>It is apparent with respect to these claims that “grada­&para;<br>tions of fact or charge would make a difference as to&para;<br>criminal liability,” and so “adjudication of the reach and&para;<br>constitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact&para;<br>situation.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 20 (1965).&para;<br>V&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We next consider whether the material-support statute,&para;<br>as applied to plaintiffs, violates the freedom of speech&para;<br>guaranteed by the First Amendment. Both plaintiffs and&para;<br>the Government take extreme positions on this question.&para;<br>Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their “pure&para;<br>political speech.” E.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 2, 25, 43. It has&para;<br>not. Under the material-support statute, plaintiffs may&para;<br>say anything they wish on any topic. They may speak and&para;<br>write freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of&para;<br>Turkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international&para;<br>law. They may advocate before the United Nations. As&para;<br>the Government states: “The statute does not prohibit&para;<br>independent advocacy or expression of any kind.” Brief for&para;<br>Government 13. Section 2339B also “does not prevent&para;<br>[plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>or impose any sanction on them for doing so.” Id., at 60.&para;<br>Congress has not, therefore, sought to suppress ideas or&para;<br>opinions in the form of “pure political speech.” Rather,&para;<br>Congress has prohibited “material support,” which most&para;<br>often does not take the form of speech at all. And when it&para;<br>does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow&para;<br>category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordi­&para;<br>nation with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be&para;<br>terrorist organizations.4&para;<br>For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far,&para;<br>claiming that the only thing truly at issue in this litigation&para;<br>is conduct, not speech. Section 2339B is directed at the&para;<br>fact of plaintiffs’ interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the&para;<br>Government contends, and only incidentally burdens their&para;<br>expression. The Government argues that the proper&para;<br>standard of review is therefore the one set out in United&para;<br>States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). In that case, the&para;<br>Court rejected a First Amendment challenge to a convic­&para;<br>tion under a generally applicable prohibition on destroying&para;<br>draft cards, even though O’Brien had burned his card in&para;<br>protest against the draft. See id., at 370, 376, 382. In so&para;<br>doing, we applied what we have since called “intermediate&para;<br>scrutiny,” under which a “content-neutral regulation will&para;<br>be sustained under the First Amendment if it advances&para;<br>important governmental interests unrelated to the sup­&para;<br>pression of free speech and does not burden substantially&para;<br>more speech than necessary to further those interests.”&para;<br>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180,&para;<br>189 (1997) (citing O’Brien, supra, at 377).&para;<br>The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The dissent also analyzes the statute as if it prohibited “[p]eaceful&para;<br>political advocacy” or “pure speech and association,” without more.&para;<br>Post, at 9, 17. Section 2339B does not do that, and we do not address&para;<br>the constitutionality of any such prohibitions. The dissent’s claim that&para;<br>our decision is inconsistent with this Court’s cases analyzing those&para;<br>sorts of restrictions, post, at 11–12, is accordingly unfounded.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to&para;<br>argue that O’Brien provides the correct standard of re­&para;<br>view.5 O’Brien does not provide the applicable standard&para;<br>for reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see&para;<br>R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385–386 (1992); Texas&para;<br>v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403, 406–407 (1989), and&para;<br>§2339B regulates speech on the basis of its content. Plain­&para;<br>tiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether&para;<br>they may do so under §2339B depends on what they say.&para;<br>If plaintiffs’ speech to those groups imparts a “specific&para;<br>skill” or communicates advice derived from “specialized&para;<br>knowledge”—for example, training on the use of interna­&para;<br>tional law or advice on petitioning the United Nations—&para;<br>then it is barred. See Brief for Government 33–34. On the&para;<br>other hand, plaintiffs’ speech is not barred if it imparts&para;<br>only general or unspecialized knowledge. See id., at 32.&para;<br>The Government argues that §2339B should nonethe­&para;<br>less receive intermediate scrutiny because it generally&para;<br>functions as a regulation of conduct. That argument runs&para;<br>headlong into a number of our precedents, most promi­&para;<br>nently Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). Cohen&para;<br>also involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct,&para;<br>barring breaches of the peace. See id., at 16. But when&para;<br>Cohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an&para;<br>epithet, we did not apply O’Brien. See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.&para;<br>Instead, we recognized that the generally applicable law&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Government suggests in passing that, to the extent plaintiffs’&para;<br>activities constitute speech, that speech is wholly unprotected by the&para;<br>First Amendment. The Government briefly analogizes speech coordi­&para;<br>nated with foreign terrorist organizations to speech effecting a crime,&para;<br>like the words that constitute a conspiracy. Brief for Government 46;&para;<br>Reply Brief for Government 31–32, and n. 8. See, e.g., Giboney v.&para;<br>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, 502 (1949). We do not&para;<br>consider any such argument because the Government does not develop&para;<br>it: The Government’s submission is that applying §2339B to plaintiffs&para;<br>triggers intermediate First Amendment scrutiny—not that it triggers&para;<br>no First Amendment scrutiny at all.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was directed at Cohen because of what his speech commu­&para;<br>nicated—he violated the breach of the peace statute be­&para;<br>cause of the offensive content of his particular message.&para;<br>We accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and re­&para;<br>versed his conviction. See id., at 18–19, 26.&para;<br>This suit falls into the same category. The law here&para;<br>may be described as directed at conduct, as the law in&para;<br>Cohen was directed at breaches of the peace, but as ap­&para;<br>plied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under&para;<br>the statute consists of communicating a message. As we&para;<br>explained in Texas v. Johnson: “If the [Government’s]&para;<br>regulation is not related to expression, then the less strin­&para;<br>gent standard we announced in United States v. O’Brien&para;<br>for regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If&para;<br>it is, then we are outside of O’Brien’s test, and we must&para;<br>[apply] a more demanding standard.” 491 U. S., at 403&para;<br>(citation omitted).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The First Amendment issue before us is more refined&para;<br>than either plaintiffs or the Government would have it. It&para;<br>is not whether the Government may prohibit pure political&para;<br>speech, or may prohibit material support in the form of&para;<br>conduct. It is instead whether the Government may pro­&para;<br>hibit what plaintiffs want to do—provide material support&para;<br>to the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.&para;<br>Everyone agrees that the Government’s interest in&para;<br>combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest&para;<br>order. See Brief for Plaintiffs 51. Plaintiffs’ complaint is&para;<br>that the ban on material support, applied to what they&para;<br>wish to do, is not “necessary to further that interest.”&para;<br>Ibid. The objective of combating terrorism does not justify&para;<br>prohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their&para;<br>support will advance only the legitimate activities of the&para;<br>designated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.&para;<br>Id., at 51–52.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully&para;<br>segregate support of their legitimate activities from sup­&para;<br>port of terrorism is an empirical question. When it en­&para;<br>acted §2339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings&para;<br>regarding the serious threat posed by international terror­&para;<br>ism. See AEDPA §§301(a)(1)–(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note&para;<br>following 18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose). One&para;<br>of those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs’ contention&para;<br>that their support would not further the terrorist activities&para;<br>of the PKK and LTTE: “[F]oreign organizations that en­&para;<br>gage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal&para;<br>conduct that any contribution to such an organization&para;<br>facilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Plaintiffs argue that the reference to “any contribution”&para;<br>in this finding meant only monetary support. There is no&para;<br>reason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly&para;<br>because Congress expressly prohibited so much more than&para;<br>monetary support in §2339B. Congress’s use of the term&para;<br>“contribution” is best read to reflect a determination that&para;<br>any form of material support furnished “to” a foreign&para;<br>terrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely&para;<br>what the material-support statute does. Indeed, when&para;<br>Congress enacted §2339B, Congress simultaneously re­&para;<br>moved an exception that had existed in §2339A(a) (1994&para;<br>ed.) for the provision of material support in the form of&para;<br>“humanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved&para;<br>in” terrorist activity. AEDPA §323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress&para;<br>considered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful&para;<br>aid would have no harmful effects.&para;<br>We are convinced that Congress was justified in reject­&para;<br>ing that view. The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.&para;<br>“The PKK’s insurgency has claimed more than 22,000&para;<br>lives.” Declaration of Kenneth R.

It is not difficult to conclude as Con­&para;<br>gress did that the “tain[t]” of such violent activities is so&para;<br>great that working in coordination with or at the com­&para;<br>mand of the PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and&para;<br>further their terrorist means.

Such support frees up&para;<br>other resources within the organization that may be put to&para;<br>violent ends. It also importantly helps lend legitimacy to&para;<br>foreign terrorist groups—legitimacy that makes it easier&para;<br>for those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to&para;<br>raise funds—all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.&para;<br>“Terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational&para;<br>‘firewalls’ that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and&para;<br>commingling of support and benefits.” McKune Affidavit,&para;<br>App. 135, ¶11. “[I]nvestigators have revealed how terror­&para;<br>ist groups systematically conceal their activities behind&para;<br>charitable, social, and political fronts.” M.

C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose).&para;<br>The material-support statute furthers this international&para;<br>effort by prohibiting aid for foreign terrorist groups that&para;<br>harm the United States’ partners abroad: “A number of&para;<br>designated foreign terrorist organizations have attacked&para;<br>moderate governments with which the United States has&para;<br>vigorously endeavored to maintain close and friendly&para;<br>relations,” and those attacks “threaten [the] social, eco­&para;<br>nomic and political stability” of such governments.&para;<br>McKune Affidavit, App. 137, ¶16. “[O]ther foreign terror­&para;<br>ist organizations attack our NATO allies, thereby impli­&para;<br>cating important and sensitive multilateral security ar­&para;<br>rangements.” Ibid.&para;<br>For example, the Republic of Turkey—a fellow member&para;<br>of NATO—is defending itself against a violent insurgency&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent also contends that the particular sort of material sup­&para;<br>port plaintiffs seek to provide cannot be diverted to terrorist activities,&para;<br>in the same direct way as funds or goods. Post, at 8–9. This contention&para;<br>misses the point. Both common sense and the evidence submitted by&para;<br>the Government make clear that material support of a terrorist group’s&para;<br>lawful activities facilitates the group’s ability to attract “funds,” “fi­&para;<br>nancing,” and “goods” that will further its terrorist acts.

Brief for Government 6; App. 128.&para;<br>That nation and our other allies would react sharply to&para;<br>Americans furnishing material support to foreign groups&para;<br>like the PKK, and would hardly be mollified by the expla­&para;<br>nation that the support was meant only to further those&para;<br>groups’ “legitimate” activities. From Turkey’s perspective,&para;<br>there likely are no such activities. See 352 F. 3d, at 389&para;<br>(observing that Turkey prohibits membership in the PKK&para;<br>and prosecutes those who provide support to that group,&para;<br>regardless of whether the support is directed to lawful&para;<br>activities).&para;<br>C&para;<br>In analyzing whether it is possible in practice to distin­&para;<br>guish material support for a foreign terrorist group’s&para;<br>violent activities and its nonviolent activities, we do not&para;<br>rely exclusively on our own inferences drawn from the&para;<br>record evidence. We have before us an affidavit stating&para;<br>the Executive Branch’s conclusion on that question. The&para;<br>State Department informs us that “[t]he experience and&para;<br>analysis of the U. S. government agencies charged with&para;<br>combating terrorism strongly suppor[t]” Congress’s finding&para;<br>that all contributions to foreign terrorist organizations&para;<br>further their terrorism.

S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14–15) (looking to similar&para;<br>affidavits to support according weight to national security&para;<br>claims). In the Executive’s view: “Given the purposes,&para;<br>organizational structure, and clandestine nature of foreign&para;<br>terrorist organizations, it is highly likely that any mate­&para;<br>rial support to these organizations will ultimately inure to&para;<br>the benefit of their criminal, terrorist functions—&para;<br>regardless of whether such support was ostensibly in­&para;<br>tended to support non-violent, non-terrorist activities.”&para;<br>McKune Affidavit, App. 133, ¶8.&para;<br>That evaluation of the facts by the Executive, like Con­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gress’s assessment, is entitled to deference. This litigation&para;<br>implicates sensitive and weighty interests of national&para;<br>security and foreign affairs. The PKK and the LTTE have&para;<br>committed terrorist acts against American citizens abroad,&para;<br>and the material-support statute addresses acute foreign&para;<br>policy concerns involving relationships with our Nation’s&para;<br>allies. See id., at 128–133, 137. We have noted that “nei­&para;<br>ther the Members of this Court nor most federal judges&para;<br>begin the day with briefings that may describe new and&para;<br>serious threats to our Nation and its people.” Boumediene&para;<br>v. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 797 (2008). It is vital in this con­&para;<br>text “not to substitute . . . our own evaluation of evidence&para;<br>for a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.”&para;<br>Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 68 (1981). See Wald,&para;<br>468 U. S., at 242; Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 292 (1981).&para;<br>Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns&para;<br>of national security and foreign relations do not warrant&para;<br>abdication of the judicial role. We do not defer to the&para;<br>Government’s reading of the First Amendment, even when&para;<br>such interests are at stake. We are one with the dissent&para;<br>that the Government’s “authority and expertise in these&para;<br>matters do not automatically trump the Court’s own obli­&para;<br>gation to secure the protection that the Constitution&para;<br>grants to individuals.” Post, at 23. But when it comes to&para;<br>collecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this&para;<br>area, “the lack of competence on the part of the courts is&para;<br>marked,” Rostker, supra, at 65, and respect for the Gov­&para;<br>ernment’s conclusions is appropriate.&para;<br>One reason for that respect is that national security and&para;<br>foreign policy concerns arise in connection with efforts to&para;<br>confront evolving threats in an area where information&para;<br>can be difficult to obtain and the impact of certain conduct&para;<br>difficult to assess. The dissent slights these real con­&para;<br>straints in demanding hard proof—with “detail,” “specific&para;<br>facts,” and “specific evidence”—that plaintiffs’ proposed&para;<br>activities will support terrorist attacks. See post, at 9, 16,&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>23. That would be a dangerous requirement. In this&para;<br>context, conclusions must often be based on informed&para;<br>judgment rather than concrete evidence, and that reality&para;<br>affects what we may reasonably insist on from the Gov­&para;<br>ernment. The material-support statute is, on its face, a&para;<br>preventive measure—it criminalizes not terrorist attacks&para;<br>themselves, but aid that makes the attacks more likely to&para;<br>occur. The Government, when seeking to prevent immi­&para;<br>nent harms in the context of international affairs and&para;<br>national security, is not required to conclusively link all&para;<br>the pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its&para;<br>empirical conclusions. See Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S., at 17&para;<br>(“[B]ecause of the changeable and explosive nature of&para;<br>contemporary international relations, . . . Congress . . .&para;<br>must of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it&para;<br>customarily wields in domestic areas”).&para;<br>This context is different from that in decisions like&para;<br>Cohen. In that case, the application of the statute turned&para;<br>on the offensiveness of the speech at issue. Observing that&para;<br>“one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric,” we invalidated&para;<br>Cohen’s conviction in part because we concluded that&para;<br>“governmental officials cannot make principled distinc­&para;<br>tions in this area.” 403 U. S., at 25. In this litigation, by&para;<br>contrast, Congress and the Executive are uniquely posi­&para;<br>tioned to make principled distinctions between activities&para;<br>that will further terrorist conduct and undermine United&para;<br>States foreign policy, and those that will not.&para;<br>We also find it significant that Congress has been con­&para;<br>scious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions&para;<br>may implicate constitutional concerns. First, §2339B only&para;<br>applies to designated foreign terrorist organizations.&para;<br>There is, and always has been, a limited number of those&para;<br>organizations designated by the Executive Branch, see,&para;<br>e.g., 74 Fed. Reg. 29742 (2009); 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997),&para;<br>and any groups so designated may seek judicial review of&para;<br>the designation. Second, in response to the lower courts’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>holdings in this litigation, Congress added clarity to the&para;<br>statute by providing narrowing definitions of the terms&para;<br>“training,” “personnel,” and “expert advice or assistance,”&para;<br>as well as an explanation of the knowledge required to&para;<br>violate §2339B. Third, in effectuating its stated intent not&para;<br>to abridge First Amendment rights, see §2339B(i), Con­&para;<br>gress has also displayed a careful balancing of interests in&para;<br>creating limited exceptions to the ban on material support.&para;<br>The definition of material support, for example, excludes&para;<br>medicine and religious materials. See §2339A(b)(1). In&para;<br>this area perhaps more than any other, the Legislature’s&para;<br>superior capacity for weighing competing interests means&para;<br>that “we must be particularly careful not to substitute our&para;<br>judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress.” Rost&para;<br>ker, supra, at 68. Finally, and most importantly, Congress&para;<br>has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or&para;<br>indeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or&para;<br>controlled by foreign terrorist groups.&para;<br>At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the consid­&para;<br>ered judgment of Congress and the Executive that provid­&para;<br>ing material support to a designated foreign terrorist&para;<br>organization—even seemingly benign support—bolsters&para;<br>the terrorist activities of that organization. That judg­&para;<br>ment, however, is entitled to significant weight, and we&para;<br>have persuasive evidence before us to sustain it. Given&para;<br>the sensitive interests in national security and foreign&para;<br>affairs at stake, the political branches have adequately&para;<br>substantiated their determination that, to serve the Gov­&para;<br>ernment’s interest in preventing terrorism, it was neces­&para;<br>sary to prohibit providing material support in the form of&para;<br>training, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign&para;<br>terrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote&para;<br>only the groups’ nonviolent ends.&para;<br>We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to&para;<br>undertake. First, plaintiffs propose to “train members of&para;<br>[the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law to peacefully resolve disputes.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.&para;<br>Congress can, consistent with the First Amendment,&para;<br>prohibit this direct training. It is wholly foreseeable that&para;<br>the PKK could use the “specific skill[s]” that plaintiffs&para;<br>propose to impart, §2339A(b)(2), as part of a broader&para;<br>strategy to promote terrorism. The PKK could, for exam­&para;<br>ple, pursue peaceful negotiation as a means of buying time&para;<br>to recover from short-term setbacks, lulling opponents into&para;<br>complacency, and ultimately preparing for renewed at­&para;<br>tacks. See generally A. Marcus, Blood and Belief: The&para;<br>PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence 286–295&para;<br>(2007) (describing the PKK’s suspension of armed struggle&para;<br>and subsequent return to violence). A foreign terrorist&para;<br>organization introduced to the structures of the interna­&para;<br>tional legal system might use the information to threaten,&para;<br>manipulate, and disrupt. This possibility is real, not&para;<br>remote.&para;<br>Second, plaintiffs propose to “teach PKK members how&para;<br>to petition various representative bodies such as the&para;<br>United Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. The&para;<br>Government acts within First Amendment strictures in&para;<br>banning this proposed speech because it teaches the or­&para;<br>ganization how to acquire “relief,” which plaintiffs never&para;<br>define with any specificity, and which could readily in­&para;<br>clude monetary aid. See Brief for Plaintiffs 10–11, 16–17,&para;<br>n. 10; App. 58–59, 80–81. Indeed, earlier in this litigation,&para;<br>plaintiffs sought to teach the LTTE “to present claims for&para;<br>tsunami-related aid to mediators and international bod­&para;<br>ies,” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1, which naturally included&para;<br>monetary relief. Money is fungible, supra, at 26, and&para;<br>Congress logically concluded that money a terrorist group&para;<br>such as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs&para;<br>propose to teach could be redirected to funding the group’s&para;<br>violent activities.&para;<br>Finally, plaintiffs propose to “engage in political advo­&para;<br>cacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey,” and “engage&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live in Sri&para;<br>Lanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. As explained above, su&para;<br>pra, at 19–20, plaintiffs do not specify their expected level&para;<br>of coordination with the PKK or LTTE or suggest what&para;<br>exactly their “advocacy” would consist of. Plaintiffs’ pro­&para;<br>posals are phrased at such a high level of generality that&para;<br>they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge. See&para;<br>supra, at 20; Grange, 552 U. S., at 454; Zemel, 381 U. S.,&para;<br>at 20.&para;<br>In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to ad­&para;<br>dress the real dangers at stake. It instead considers only&para;<br>the possible benefits of plaintiffs’ proposed activities in the&para;<br>abstract. See post, at 13–15. The dissent seems unwilling&para;<br>to entertain the prospect that training and advising a&para;<br>designated foreign terrorist organization on how to take&para;<br>advantage of international entities might benefit that&para;<br>organization in a way that facilitates its terrorist activi­&para;<br>ties. In the dissent’s world, such training is all to the&para;<br>good. Congress and the Executive, however, have con­&para;<br>cluded that we live in a different world: one in which the&para;<br>designated foreign terrorist organizations “are so tainted&para;<br>by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an&para;<br>organization facilitates that conduct.” AEDPA §301(a)(7).&para;<br>One in which, for example, “the United Nations High&para;<br>Commissioner for Refugees was forced to close a Kurdish&para;<br>refugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come&para;<br>under the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to&para;<br>respect its ‘neutral and humanitarian nature.’ ” McKune&para;<br>Affidavit, App. 135–136, ¶13. Training and advice on how&para;<br>to work with the United Nations could readily have helped&para;<br>the PKK in its efforts to use the United Nations camp as a&para;<br>base for terrorist activities.&para;<br>If only good can come from training our adversaries in&para;<br>international dispute resolution, presumably it would&para;<br>have been unconstitutional to prevent American citizens&para;<br>from training the Japanese Government on using interna­&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tional organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes&para;<br>during World War II. It would, under the dissent’s rea­&para;<br>soning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving&para;<br>disputes through “ ‘deliberative forces,’ ” post, at 13 (quot­&para;<br>ing Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)&para;<br>(Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that&para;<br>assisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort&para;<br>more generally. That view is not one the First Amend­&para;<br>ment requires us to embrace.&para;<br>All this is not to say that any future applications of the&para;<br>material-support statute to speech or advocacy will sur­&para;<br>vive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to say that&para;<br>any other statute relating to speech and terrorism would&para;<br>satisfy the First Amendment. In particular, we in no way&para;<br>suggest that a regulation of independent speech would&para;<br>pass constitutional muster, even if the Government were&para;<br>to show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organi­&para;<br>zations. We also do not suggest that Congress could ex­&para;<br>tend the same prohibition on material support at issue&para;<br>here to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in&para;<br>prohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs&para;<br>seek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, §2339B does&para;<br>not violate the freedom of speech.&para;<br>VI&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ final claim is that the material-support stat­&para;<br>ute violates their freedom of association under the First&para;<br>Amendment. Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminal­&para;<br>izes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and&para;<br>the LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like De&para;<br>Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937), and cases in which&para;<br>we have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist&para;<br>Party, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of&para;<br>State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); United States v. Robel,&para;<br>389 U. S. 258 (1967).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim be­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cause the statute does not penalize mere association with&para;<br>a foreign terrorist organization. As the Ninth Circuit put&para;<br>it: “The statute does not prohibit being a member of one of&para;<br>the designated groups or vigorously promoting and sup­&para;<br>porting the political goals of the group. . . . What [§2339B]&para;<br>prohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .” 205&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1133. Plaintiffs want to do the latter. Our deci­&para;<br>sions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or as­&para;<br>sembly are therefore inapposite. See, e.g., Robel, supra, at&para;<br>262 (“It is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indis­&para;<br>criminately across all types of association with Commu­&para;<br>nist-action groups, without regard to the quality and&para;<br>degree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First&para;<br>Amendment”); De Jonge, supra, at 362.&para;<br>Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute&para;<br>burdens their freedom of association because it prevents&para;<br>them from providing support to designated foreign terror­&para;<br>ist organizations, but not to other groups. See Brief for&para;<br>Plaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37–38. Any burden&para;<br>on plaintiffs’ freedom of association in this regard is justi­&para;<br>fied for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs’&para;<br>free speech challenge. It would be strange if the Constitu­&para;<br>tion permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of&para;<br>speech that constitute material support, but did not per­&para;<br>mit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly&para;<br>dangerous and lawless foreign organizations. Congress is&para;<br>not required to ban material support to every group or&para;<br>none at all.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the&para;<br>people of the United States ordained and established that&para;<br>charter of government in part to “provide for the common&para;<br>defence.” As Madison explained, “[s]ecurity against for­&para;<br>eign danger is . . . an avowed and essential object of the&para;<br>American Union.” The Federalist No. 41, p. 269 (J. Cooke&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ed. 1961). We hold that, in regulating the particular forms&para;<br>of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terror­&para;<br>ist organizations, Congress has pursued that objective&para;<br>consistent with the limitations of the First and Fifth&para;<br>Amendments.&para;<br>The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part,&para;<br>and the cases are remanded for further proceedings con­&para;<br>sistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

And I would&para;<br>interpret the statute as normally placing activity of this&para;<br>kind outside its scope. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.&para;<br>22, 62 (1932); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.

Thus, there is&para;<br>no general First Amendment exception that applies here.&para;<br>If the statute is constitutional in this context, it would&para;<br>have to come with a strong justification attached.&para;<br>It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the&para;<br>constitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs’&para;<br>proposed activities, would apply, not the kind of interme&para;<br>diate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct,&para;<br>but “ ‘a more demanding standard.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting&para;<br>Texas v.

Indeed,&para;<br>where, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at&para;<br>least arguably does so on the basis of content-based dis&para;<br>tinctions, I should think we would scrutinize the statute&para;<br>and justifications “strictly”—to determine whether the&para;<br>prohibition is justified by a “compelling” need that cannot&para;<br>be “less restrictively” accommodated. See Houston v. Hill,&para;<br>482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (criminal penalties); Ashcroft v.&para;<br>American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U.

(“A&para;<br>court . . . must ensure that [the interest justifying a stat&para;<br>utory restriction] supports each application of [the]&para;<br>statute”).&para;<br>The Government makes two efforts to answer this ques&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion. First, the Government says that the plaintiffs’ sup&para;<br>port for these organizations is “fungible” in the same sense&para;<br>as other forms of banned support. Being fungible, the&para;<br>plaintiffs’ support could, for example, free up other re&para;<br>sources, which the organization might put to terrorist&para;<br>ends. Brief for Respondents in No. 09–89, pp. 54–56 (here&para;<br>inafter Government Brief).&para;<br>The proposition that the two very different kinds of&para;<br>“support” are “fungible,” however, is not obviously true.&para;<br>There is no obvious way in which undertaking advocacy&para;<br>for political change through peaceful means or teaching&para;<br>the PKK and LTTE, say, how to petition the United Na&para;<br>tions for political change is fungible with other resources&para;<br>that might be put to more sinister ends in the way that&para;<br>donations of money, food, or computer training are fungi&para;<br>ble. It is far from obvious that these advocacy activities&para;<br>can themselves be redirected, or will free other resources&para;<br>that can be directed, towards terrorist ends. Thus, we&para;<br>must determine whether the Government has come for&para;<br>ward with evidence to support its claim.&para;<br>The Government has provided us with no empirical&para;<br>information that might convincingly support this claim.&para;<br>Instead, the Government cites only to evidence that Con&para;<br>gress was concerned about the “fungible” nature in general&para;<br>of resources, predominately money and material goods. It&para;<br>points to a congressional finding that “foreign organiza&para;<br>tions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by&para;<br>their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an&para;<br>organization facilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7), 110&para;<br>Stat. 1247, note following 18 U. S. C. §2339B (emphasis&para;<br>added). It also points to a House Report’s statement that&para;<br>“supply[ing] funds, goods, or services” would “hel[p] defray&para;<br>the cost to the terrorist organization of running the osten&para;<br>sibly legitimate activities,” and “in turn fre[e] an equal&para;<br>sum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.” H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 104–383, p. 81 (1995) (emphasis added). Finally,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Government refers to a State Department official’s&para;<br>affidavit describing how ostensibly charitable contribu&para;<br>tions have either been “redirected” to terrorist ends or,&para;<br>even if spent charitably, have “unencumber[ed] funds&para;<br>raised from other sources for use in facilitating violent,&para;<br>terrorist activities and gaining political support for these&para;<br>activities.” Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 134,&para;<br>136 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The most one can say in the Government’s favor about&para;<br>these statements is that they might be read as offering&para;<br>highly general support for its argument. The statements&para;<br>do not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs’&para;<br>political-advocacy-related activities might actually be&para;<br>“fungible” and therefore capable of being diverted to ter&para;<br>rorist use. Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was&para;<br>concerned with “support” of this kind. The affidavit refers&para;<br>to “funds,” “financing,” and “goods”—none of which en&para;<br>compasses the plaintiffs’ activities. Ibid. The statutory&para;<br>statement and the House Report use broad terms like&para;<br>“contributions” and “services” that might be construed as&para;<br>encompassing the plaintiffs’ activities. But in context,&para;<br>those terms are more naturally understood as referring to&para;<br>contributions of goods, money, or training and other ser&para;<br>vices (say, computer programming) that could be diverted&para;<br>to, or free funding for, terrorist ends. See infra, at 15–16.&para;<br>Peaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into&para;<br>these categories. And the statute itself suggests that&para;<br>Congress did not intend to curtail freedom of speech or&para;<br>association. See §2339B(i) (“Nothing in this section shall&para;<br>be construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of&para;<br>rights guaranteed under the First Amendment”); see also&para;<br>infra, at 18–19.&para;<br>Second, the Government says that the plaintiffs’ pro&para;<br>posed activities will “bolste[r] a terrorist organization’s&para;<br>efficacy and strength in a community” and “undermin[e]&para;<br>this nation’s efforts to delegitimize and weaken those&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>groups.” Government Brief 56 (emphasis added). In the&para;<br>Court’s view, too, the Constitution permits application of&para;<br>the statute to activities of the kind at issue in part because&para;<br>those activities could provide a group that engages in&para;<br>terrorism with “legitimacy.” Ante, at 25. The Court sug&para;<br>gests that, armed with this greater “legitimacy,” these&para;<br>organizations will more readily be able to obtain material&para;<br>support of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban—&para;<br>money, arms, lodging, and the like. See ibid.&para;<br>Yet the Government does not claim that the statute&para;<br>forbids any speech “legitimating” a terrorist group.&para;<br>Rather, it reads the statute as permitting (1) membership&para;<br>in terrorist organizations, (2) “peaceably assembling with&para;<br>members of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion,” or&para;<br>(3) “independent advocacy” on behalf of these organiza&para;<br>tions. Government Brief 66, 61, 13. The Court, too, em&para;<br>phasizes that activities not “coordinated with” the terror&para;<br>ist groups are not banned. See ante, at 21, 26, 31&para;<br>(emphasis added). And it argues that speaking, writing,&para;<br>and teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization’s&para;<br>peaceful political ends could “mak[e] it easier for those&para;<br>groups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds.”&para;<br>Ante, at 25.&para;<br>But this “legitimacy” justification cannot by itself war&para;<br>rant suppression of political speech, advocacy, and asso&para;<br>ciation. Speech, association, and related activities on&para;<br>behalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to le&para;<br>gitimate that group. Thus, were the law to accept a “le&para;<br>gitimating” effect, in and of itself and without qualifica&para;<br>tion, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a&para;<br>ban, the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold&para;<br>instances where it should be won. Once one accepts this&para;<br>argument, there is no natural stopping place. The argu&para;<br>ment applies as strongly to “independent” as to “coordi&para;<br>nated” advocacy. But see ante, at 26–27. That fact is&para;<br>reflected in part in the Government’s claim that the ban&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>here, so supported, prohibits a lawyer hired by a desig&para;<br>nated group from filing on behalf of that group an amicus&para;<br>brief before the United Nations or even before this Court.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47–49, 53.&para;<br>That fact is also reflected in the difficulty of drawing a&para;<br>line designed to accept the legitimacy argument in some&para;<br>instances but not in others. It is inordinately difficult to&para;<br>distinguish when speech activity will and when it will not&para;<br>initiate the chain of causation the Court suggests—a chain&para;<br>that leads from peaceful advocacy to “legitimacy” to in&para;<br>creased support for the group to an increased supply of&para;<br>material goods that support its terrorist activities. Even&para;<br>were we to find some such line of distinction, its applica&para;<br>tion would seem so inherently uncertain that it would&para;<br>often, perhaps always, “chill” protected speech beyond its&para;<br>boundary. In short, the justification, put forward simply&para;<br>in abstract terms and without limitation, must always, or&para;<br>it will never, be sufficient. Given the nature of the plain&para;<br>tiffs’ activities, “always” cannot possibly be the First&para;<br>Amendment’s answer.&para;<br>Regardless, the “legitimacy” justification itself is incon&para;<br>sistent with critically important First Amendment case&para;<br>law. Consider the cases involving the protection the First&para;<br>Amendment offered those who joined the Communist&para;<br>Party intending only to further its peaceful activities. In&para;<br>those cases, this Court took account of congressional find&para;<br>ings that the Communist Party not only advocated theo&para;<br>retically but also sought to put into practice the overthrow&para;<br>of our Government through force and violence. The Court&para;<br>had previously accepted Congress’ determinations that the&para;<br>American Communist Party was a “Communist action&para;<br>organization” which (1) acted under the “control, direction,&para;<br>and discipline” of the world Communist movement, a&para;<br>movement that sought to employ “espionage, sabotage,&para;<br>terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to&para;<br>establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship,” and (2)&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“endeavor[ed]” to bring about “the overthrow of existing&para;<br>governments by . . . force if necessary.” Communist Party&para;<br>of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 367&para;<br>U. S. 1, 5–6 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Nonetheless, the Court held that the First Amendment&para;<br>protected an American’s right to belong to that party—&para;<br>despite whatever “legitimating” effect membership might&para;<br>have had—as long as the person did not share the party’s&para;<br>unlawful purposes. See, e.g., De Jonge, 299 U. S. 353;&para;<br>Scales, 367 U. S., at 228–230; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384&para;<br>U. S. 11, 17 (1966); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ.&para;<br>of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605–610 (1967); Robel, 389&para;<br>U. S. 258 (holding that national security interests did not&para;<br>justify overbroad criminal prohibition on members of&para;<br>Communist-affiliated organizations working in any de&para;<br>fense-related facility). As I have pointed out, those cases&para;<br>draw further support from other cases permitting pure&para;<br>advocacy of even the most unlawful activity—as long as&para;<br>that advocacy is not “directed to inciting or producing&para;<br>imminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or produce&para;<br>such action.” Brandenburg, 395 U. S., at 447. The Gov&para;<br>ernment’s “legitimating” theory would seem to apply to&para;<br>these cases with equal justifying force; and, if recognized,&para;<br>it would have led this Court to conclusions other than&para;<br>those it reached.&para;<br>Nor can the Government overcome these considerations&para;<br>simply by narrowing the covered activities to those that&para;<br>involve coordinated, rather than independent, advocacy.&para;<br>Conversations, discussions, or logistical arrangements&para;<br>might well prove necessary to carry out the speech-related&para;<br>activities here at issue (just as conversations and discus&para;<br>sions are a necessary part of membership in any organiza&para;<br>tion). The Government does not distinguish this kind of&para;<br>“coordination” from any other. I am not aware of any form&para;<br>of words that might be used to describe “coordination” that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would not, at a minimum, seriously chill not only the kind&para;<br>of activities the plaintiffs raise before us, but also the&para;<br>“independent advocacy” the Government purports to per&para;<br>mit. And, as for the Government’s willingness to distin&para;<br>guish independent advocacy from coordinated advocacy,&para;<br>the former is more likely, not less likely, to confer legiti&para;<br>macy than the latter. Thus, other things being equal, the&para;<br>distinction “coordination” makes is arbitrary in respect to&para;<br>furthering the statute’s purposes. And a rule of law that&para;<br>finds the “legitimacy” argument adequate in respect to the&para;<br>latter would have a hard time distinguishing a statute&para;<br>that sought to attack the former.&para;<br>Consider the majority’s development of the Govern&para;<br>ment’s themes. First, the majority discusses the plaintiffs’&para;<br>proposal to “ ‘train members of [the] PKK on how to use&para;<br>humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve&para;<br>disputes.’ ” Ante, at 31–32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1).&para;<br>The majority justifies the criminalization of this activity in&para;<br>significant part on the ground that “peaceful negotia&para;<br>tion[s]” might just “bu[y] time . . . , lulling opponents into&para;<br>complacency.” Ante, at 32. And the PKK might use its&para;<br>new information about “the structures of the international&para;<br>legal system . . . to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>What is one to say about these arguments—arguments&para;<br>that would deny First Amendment protection to the peace&para;<br>ful teaching of international human rights law on the&para;<br>ground that a little knowledge about “the international&para;<br>legal system” is too dangerous a thing; that an opponent’s&para;<br>subsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked, so&para;<br>let’s not teach him how to try? What might be said of&para;<br>these claims by those who live, as we do, in a Nation com&para;<br>mitted to the resolution of disputes through “deliberative&para;<br>forces”? Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)&para;<br>(Brandeis, J., concurring).&para;<br>In my own view, the majority’s arguments stretch the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>concept of “fungibility” beyond constitutional limits.&para;<br>Neither Congress nor the Government advanced these&para;<br>particular hypothetical claims. I am not aware of any case&para;<br>in this Court—not Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652&para;<br>(1925), not Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919),&para;<br>not Abrams, 250 U. S. 616, not the later Communist Party&para;<br>cases decided during the heat of the Cold War—in which&para;<br>the Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or&para;<br>teaching might be criminalized lest it, e.g., buy negotiating&para;<br>time for an opponent who would put that time to bad use.&para;<br>Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put&para;<br>otherwise innocent speech or knowledge to bad use is&para;<br>omnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little more&para;<br>than (even informed) speculation. Hence to accept this&para;<br>kind of argument without more and to apply it to the&para;<br>teaching of a subject such as international human rights&para;<br>law is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitu&para;<br>tion’s text and First Amendment precedent, would auto&para;<br>matically forbid the teaching of any subject in a case&para;<br>where national security interests conflict with the First&para;<br>Amendment. The Constitution does not allow all such&para;<br>conflicts to be decided in the Government’s favor.&para;<br>The majority, as I have said, cannot limit the scope of its&para;<br>arguments through its claim that the plaintiffs remain&para;<br>free to engage in the protected activity as long as it is not&para;<br>“coordinated.” That is because there is no practical way to&para;<br>organize classes for a group (say, wishing to learn about&para;<br>human rights law) without “coordination.” Nor can the&para;<br>majority limit the scope of its argument by pointing to&para;<br>some special limiting circumstance present here. That is&para;<br>because the only evidence the majority offers to support its&para;<br>general claim consists of a single reference to a book about&para;<br>terrorism, which the Government did not mention, and&para;<br>which apparently says no more than that at one time the&para;<br>PKK suspended its armed struggle and then returned to&para;<br>it.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Second, the majority discusses the plaintiffs’ proposal to&para;<br>“ ‘teach PKK members how to petition various representa&para;<br>tive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; emphasis added). The&para;<br>majority’s only argument with respect to this proposal is&para;<br>that the relief obtained “could readily include monetary&para;<br>aid,” which the PKK might use to buy guns. Ante, at 32.&para;<br>The majority misunderstands the word “relief.” In this&para;<br>context, as the record makes clear, the word “relief” does&para;<br>not refer to “money.” It refers to recognition under the&para;<br>Geneva Conventions. See App. 57–58 (2003 Complaint);&para;<br>id., at 79–80 (1998 Complaint); id., at 113 (Fertig Declara&para;<br>tion); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 63 (plaintiffs’ counsel deny&para;<br>ing that plaintiffs seek to teach about obtaining relief in&para;<br>the form of money).&para;<br>Throughout, the majority emphasizes that it would&para;<br>defer strongly to Congress’ “informed judgment.” See, e.g.,&para;<br>ante, at 30. But here, there is no evidence that Congress&para;<br>has made such a judgment regarding the specific activities&para;<br>at issue in these cases. See infra, at 20–21. In any event,&para;<br>“whenever the fundamental rights of free speech and&para;<br>assembly are alleged to have been invaded, it must remain&para;<br>open [for judicial determination] whether there actually&para;<br>did exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger, if&para;<br>any, was imminent; and whether the evil apprehended&para;<br>was one so substantial as to justify the stringent restric&para;<br>tion interposed by the legislature.” Whitney, supra, at&para;<br>378–379 (Brandeis, J., concurring). In such circum&para;<br>stances, the “judicial function commands analysis of&para;<br>whether the specific conduct charged falls within the&para;<br>reach of the statute and if so whether the legislation is&para;<br>consonant with the Constitution.” Landmark Communi&para;<br>cations, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 844 (1978). Hence,&para;<br>a legislative declaration “does not preclude enquiry into&para;<br>the question whether, at the time and under the circum&para;<br>stances, the conditions existed which are essential to&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>validity under the Federal Constitution.” Whitney, supra,&para;<br>at 378; see also Landmark, supra, at 843 (“Deference to a&para;<br>legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First&para;<br>Amendment rights are at stake”).&para;<br>I concede that the Government’s expertise in foreign&para;<br>affairs may warrant deference in respect to many matters,&para;<br>e.g., our relations with Turkey. Cf. ante, at 27–28. But it&para;<br>remains for this Court to decide whether the Government&para;<br>has shown that such an interest justifies criminalizing&para;<br>speech activity otherwise protected by the First Amend&para;<br>ment. And the fact that other nations may like us less for&para;<br>granting that protection cannot in and of itself carry the&para;<br>day.&para;<br>Finally, I would reemphasize that neither the Govern&para;<br>ment nor the majority points to any specific facts that&para;<br>show that the speech-related activities before us are fun&para;<br>gible in some special way or confer some special legitimacy&para;<br>upon the PKK. Rather, their arguments in this respect&para;<br>are general and speculative. Those arguments would&para;<br>apply to virtually all speech-related support for a dual&para;<br>purpose group’s peaceful activities (irrespective of whether&para;<br>the speech-related activity is coordinated). Both First&para;<br>Amendment logic and First Amendment case law prevent&para;<br>us from “sacrific[ing] First Amendment protections for so&para;<br>speculative a gain.” Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.&para;<br>v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 127&para;<br>(1973); see also Consolidated Edison Co., 447 U. S., at 543&para;<br>(rejecting proffered state interest not supported in record&para;<br>because “[m]ere speculation of harm does not constitute a&para;<br>compelling state interest”).&para;<br>II&para;<br>For the reasons I have set forth, I believe application of&para;<br>the statute as the Government interprets it would gravely&para;<br>and without adequate justification injure interests of the&para;<br>kind the First Amendment protects. Thus, there is “a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>serious doubt” as to the statute’s constitutionality. Cro&para;<br>well, 285 U. S., at 62. And where that is so, we must&para;<br>“ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly&para;<br>possible by which the question may be avoided.” Ibid.; see&para;<br>also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis, J.,&para;<br>concurring); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001);&para;<br>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78&para;<br>(1994); United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401&para;<br>(1916).&para;<br>I believe that a construction that would avoid the consti&para;<br>tutional problem is “fairly possible.” In particular, I would&para;<br>read the statute as criminalizing First-Amendment&para;<br>protected pure speech and association only when the&para;<br>defendant knows or intends that those activities will assist&para;<br>the organization’s unlawful terrorist actions. Under this&para;<br>reading, the Government would have to show, at a mini&para;<br>mum, that such defendants provided support that they&para;<br>knew was significantly likely to help the organization&para;<br>pursue its unlawful terrorist aims.&para;<br>A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is&para;<br>aware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likeli&para;<br>hood that his or her conduct will materially support the&para;<br>organization’s terrorist ends. See Allen v. United States,&para;<br>164 U. S. 492, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code&para;<br>§2.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962). See also United States v. Santos, 553&para;<br>U. S. 507, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal&para;<br>Code §2.02(7) (willful blindness); S. Rep. No. 95–605, pt. 1,&para;<br>pp. 59–60 (1977). A person also acts with the requisite&para;<br>intent if it is his “conscious objective” (or purpose) to fur&para;<br>ther those same terrorist ends. See United States v. Bai&para;<br>ley, 444 U. S. 394, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code&para;<br>§§2.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (“When acting knowingly suffices&para;<br>to establish an element, such element also is established if&para;<br>a person acts purposely”). On the other hand, for the&para;<br>reasons I have set out, see supra, at 9–12, knowledge or&para;<br>intent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities)&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>could or would help further terrorism simply by helping to&para;<br>legitimate the organization is not sufficient.&para;<br>This reading of the statute protects those who engage in&para;<br>pure speech and association ordinarily protected by the&para;<br>First Amendment. But it does not protect that activity&para;<br>where a defendant purposefully intends it to help terror&para;<br>ism or where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds him&para;<br>self to the fact) that the activity is significantly likely to&para;<br>assist terrorism. Where the activity fits into these catego&para;<br>ries of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist&para;<br>ends, the act of providing material support to a known&para;<br>terrorist organization bears a close enough relation to&para;<br>terrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited&para;<br>notwithstanding any First Amendment interest.&para;<br>Cf.&para;<br>Brandenburg, 395 U. S. 444. At the same time, this read&para;<br>ing does not require the Government to undertake the&para;<br>difficult task of proving which, as between peaceful and&para;<br>nonpeaceful purposes, a defendant specifically preferred;&para;<br>knowledge is enough. See Bailey, supra, at 405 (defining&para;<br>specific intent).&para;<br>This reading is consistent with the statute’s text. The&para;<br>statute prohibits “knowingly provid[ing] material support&para;<br>or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.”&para;<br>§2339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). Normally we read a crimi&para;<br>nal statute as applying a mens rea requirement to all of&para;<br>the subsequently listed elements of the crime. See FloresFigueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip&para;<br>op., at 6–7). So read, the defendant would have to know or&para;<br>intend (1) that he is providing support or resources, (2)&para;<br>that he is providing that support to a foreign terrorist&para;<br>organization, and (3) that he is providing support that is&para;<br>material, meaning (4) that his support bears a significant&para;<br>likelihood of furthering the organization’s terrorist ends.&para;<br>This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute’s&para;<br>use of the word “material.” That word can mean being of a&para;<br>physical or worldly nature, but it also can mean “being of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>real importance or great consequence.” Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 1392 (1961). Here, it must&para;<br>mean the latter, for otherwise the statute, applying only to&para;<br>physical aid, would not apply to speech at all. See also&para;<br>§2339A(b)(1) (defining “ ‘material support or resources’ ” as&para;<br>“any property, tangible or intangible” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>And if the statute applies only to support that would likely&para;<br>be of real importance or great consequence, it must have&para;<br>importance or consequence in respect to the organization’s&para;<br>terrorist activities. That is because support that is not&para;<br>significantly likely to help terrorist activities, for purposes&para;<br>of this statute, neither has “importance” nor is of “great&para;<br>consequence.”&para;<br>The statutory definition of “material support” poses no&para;<br>problem. The statute defines “material support” through&para;<br>reference to a list of terms, including those at issue here—&para;<br>“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “personnel,” and&para;<br>“service.” §2339B(g)(4); §2339A(b)(1). Since these latter&para;<br>terms all fall under the definition of the term “material&para;<br>support,” these activities fall within the statute’s scope&para;<br>only when they too are “material.” Cf. Stevens, 559 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 12) (citing Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S.&para;<br>1, 11 (2004) (definitional phrase may take meaning from&para;<br>the term to be defined)).&para;<br>Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that&para;<br>the defendant knew the support was material can be read&para;<br>to require the Government to show that the defendant&para;<br>knew that the consequences of his acts had a significant&para;<br>likelihood of furthering the organization’s terrorist, not&para;<br>just its lawful, aims.&para;<br>I need not decide whether this is the only possible read&para;<br>ing of the statute in cases where “material support” takes&para;<br>the form of “currency,” “property,” “monetary instru&para;<br>ments,” “financial securities,” “financial services,” “lodg&para;<br>ing,” “safehouses,” “false documentation or identification,”&para;<br>“weapons,” “lethal substances,” or “explosives,” and the&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>like. §2339A(b)(1). Those kinds of aid are inherently more&para;<br>likely to help an organization’s terrorist activities, either&para;<br>directly or because they are fungible in nature. Thus, to&para;<br>show that an individual has provided support of those&para;<br>kinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assum&para;<br>ing the statute’s other requirements are met). But where&para;<br>support consists of pure speech or association, I would&para;<br>indulge in no such presumption. Rather, the Government&para;<br>would have to prove that the defendant knew he was&para;<br>providing support significantly likely to help the organiza&para;<br>tion pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively,&para;<br>that the defendant intended the support to be so used).&para;<br>The statute’s history strongly supports this reading.&para;<br>That history makes clear that Congress primarily sought&para;<br>to end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations&para;<br>of money or goods. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 104–383, at&para;<br>38, 43–45, 81; supra, at 8–9. It shows that Congress,&para;<br>when referring to “expert services and assistance” for&para;<br>example, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungi&para;<br>ble to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation ex&para;<br>pert’s giving “advice” that “facilitat[es] an aircraft hijack&para;<br>ing” or an accountant’s giving “advice” that will “facilitate&para;<br>the concealment of funds used to support terrorist activi&para;<br>ties.” Hearing on Administration’s Draft Anti-Terrorism&para;<br>Act of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary,&para;<br>107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).&para;<br>And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the&para;<br>Judiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Commit&para;<br>tee, told the Senate:&para;<br>“This bill also includes provisions making it a crime to&para;<br>knowingly provide material support to the terrorist&para;<br>functions of foreign groups designated by a Presiden&para;<br>tial finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.” 142&para;<br>Cong. Rec. S3354 (1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch)&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>He then added:&para;<br>“I am convinced we have crafted a narrow but effec&para;<br>tive designation provision which meets these obliga&para;<br>tions while safeguarding the freedom to associate,&para;<br>which none of us would willingly give up.” Id., at&para;<br>S3360.&para;<br>Consistent with this view, the statute itself says:&para;<br>“Nothing in this section shall be construed or applied&para;<br>so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed un&para;<br>der the First Amendment to the Constitution of the&para;<br>United States.” §2339B(i).&para;<br>In any event, the principle of constitutional avoidance&para;<br>demands this interpretation. As Part II makes clear,&para;<br>there is a “serious” doubt—indeed, a “grave” doubt—about&para;<br>the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to&para;<br>criminalize the activities before us. Crowell, 285 U. S., at&para;<br>62; see also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis,&para;<br>J., concurring); Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. We there&para;<br>fore must “read the statute to eliminate” that constitu&para;<br>tional “doub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly&para;<br>contrary to the intent of Congress.” X-Citement Video,&para;<br>Inc., 513 U. S., at 78.&para;<br>For this reason, the majority’s statutory claim that&para;<br>Congress did not use the word “knowingly” as I would use&para;<br>it, ante, at 12–13, and n. 3, is beside the point. Our conse&para;<br>quent reading is consistent with the statute’s text; it is&para;<br>consistent with Congress’ basic intent; it interprets but&para;<br>does not significantly add to what the statute otherwise&para;<br>contains. Cf. e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photo&para;<br>graphs, 402 U. S. 363, 373–374 (1971) (constitutionally&para;<br>compelled to add requirement that “forfeiture proceedings&para;<br>be commenced within 14 days and completed within 60&para;<br>days” despite absence of any statutory time limits); NLRB&para;<br>v.

HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(constitutionally compelled to interpret “employer” as&para;<br>implicitly excluding “church-operated schools” despite&para;<br>silence and eight other different but explicit exceptions).&para;<br>We should adopt it.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Having interpreted the statute to impose the mens rea&para;<br>requirement just described, I would remand the cases so&para;<br>that the lower courts could consider more specifically the&para;<br>precise activities in which the plaintiffs still wish to en&para;<br>gage and determine whether and to what extent a grant of&para;<br>declaratory and injunctive relief were warranted. I do not&para;<br>see why the majority does not also remand the cases for&para;<br>consideration of the plaintiffs’ activities relating to “advo&para;<br>cating” for the organizations’ peaceful causes. See ante, at&para;<br>19–20, 32–33.&para;<br>The majority does not remand, apparently because it&para;<br>believes the plaintiffs lose automatically in that these&para;<br>“advocacy” claims are too general. It adds that the plain&para;<br>tiffs did not “suggest what exactly their ‘advocacy’ would&para;<br>consist of.” Ante, at 33. But the majority is wrong about&para;<br>the lack of specificity. The record contains complaints and&para;<br>affidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy&para;<br>these groups have previously engaged in and in which&para;<br>they would like to continue to engage. See App. 56–63,&para;<br>78–87, 95–99, 110–123.&para;<br>Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Govern&para;<br>ment’s argument that the plaintiffs’ speech-related activi&para;<br>ties amount to “conduct” and should be reviewed as such.&para;<br>Government Brief 44–57. Hence, I should think the ma&para;<br>jority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect&para;<br>of the cases, applying a proper standard of review. See,&para;<br>e.g., Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U. S. 346, 357–&para;<br>358 (2007); Johnson v. California 543 U. S. 499, 515&para;<br>(2005); cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.

When deciding such cases, courts are aware&para;<br>and must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to&para;<br>the Executive and Legislative Branches the power to&para;<br>provide for the national defense, and that it grants par&para;<br>ticular authority to the President in matters of foreign&para;<br>affairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that&para;<br>authority and expertise in these matters do not automati&para;<br>cally trump the Court’s own obligation to secure the pro&para;<br>tection that the Constitution grants to individuals. Cf.&para;<br>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.

In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I&para;<br>believe the Court has failed to examine the Government’s&para;<br>justifications with sufficient care. It has failed to insist&para;<br>upon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It&para;<br>has failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling&para;<br>ends. And ultimately it deprives the individuals before us&para;<br>of the protection that the First Amendment demands.&para;<br>That is why, with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
