ESPINOSA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1134. Argued December 1, 2009—Decided March 23, 2010&para;<br>A plan proposed under Bankruptcy Code (Code) Chapter 13 becomes&para;<br>effective upon confirmation, see 11 U. S. C. §§1324, 1325, and will re&para;<br>sult in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor com&para;<br>pletes the payments the plan requires, see §1328(a). A debtor may&para;<br>obtain a discharge of government-sponsored student loan debts only&para;<br>if failure to discharge that debt would impose an “undue hardship” on&para;<br>the debtor and his dependents. §§523(a)(8); 1328. Bankruptcy courts&para;<br>must make this undue hardship determination in an adversary pro&para;<br>ceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001(6), which the party seeking&para;<br>the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint&para;<br>on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008. Respondent Espinosa’s&para;<br>plan proposed repaying the principal on his student loan debt and&para;<br>discharging the interest once the principal was repaid, but he did not&para;<br>initiate the required adversary proceeding. The student loan credi&para;<br>tor, petitioner United, received notice of the plan from the Bank&para;<br>ruptcy Court and did not object to the plan or to Espinosa’s failure to&para;<br>initiate the required proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed&para;<br>the plan without holding such a proceeding or making a finding of&para;<br>undue hardship. Once Espinosa paid his student loan principal, the&para;<br>court discharged the interest. A few years later, the Department of&para;<br>Education sought to collect that interest. In response, Espinosa&para;<br>asked the court to enforce the confirmation order by directing the&para;<br>Department and United to cease any collection efforts. United op&para;<br>posed the motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside as void the confirmation or&para;<br>der because the plan provision authorizing discharge of Espinosa’s&para;<br>student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code and the Bank&para;<br>ruptcy Rules, and because United’s due process rights were violated&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>when Espinosa failed to serve it with the required summons and&para;<br>complaint.&para;<br>Rejecting those arguments, the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>granted Espinosa’s motion in relevant part and denied the cross&para;<br>motion. The District Court reversed, holding that United was denied&para;<br>due process when the confirmation order was issued without the re&para;<br>quired service. The Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed. It concluded&para;<br>that by confirming Espinosa’s plan without first finding undue hard&para;<br>ship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most&para;<br>committed a legal error that United might have successfully ap&para;<br>pealed, but that such error was no basis for setting aside the order as&para;<br>void under Rule 60(b)(4). It also held that Espinosa’s failure to serve&para;<br>United was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void be&para;<br>cause United received actual notice of the plan and failed to object.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation order is not void under&para;<br>Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 6–14.&para;<br>(a) That order was a final judgment from which United did not&para;<br>appeal. Such finality ordinarily would “stan[d] in the way of chal&para;<br>lenging [the order’s] enforceability,” Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bai&para;<br>ley, 557 U. S. ___, ___. However, Rule 60(b)(4) allows a party to seek&para;<br>relief from a final judgment that “is void,” but only in the rare in&para;<br>stance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of ju&para;<br>risdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a&para;<br>party of notice or the opportunity to be heard. United’s alleged error&para;<br>falls in neither category. Conceding that the Bankruptcy Court had&para;<br>jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order, United contends that the&para;<br>judgment is void because United did not receive adequate notice of&para;<br>Espinosa’s proposed discharge. Espinosa’s failure to serve the sum&para;<br>mons and complaint as required by the Bankruptcy Rules deprived&para;<br>United of a right granted by a procedural rule. United could have&para;<br>timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse rul&para;<br>ing on its objection. But this deprivation did not amount to a viola&para;<br>tion of due process, which requires notice “reasonably calculated, un&para;<br>der all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the&para;<br>pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present&para;<br>their objections,” Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339&para;<br>U. S. 306, 314. Here, United’s actual notice of the filing and contents&para;<br>of Espinosa’s plan more than satisfied its due process rights. Thus,&para;<br>Espinosa’s failure to make the required service does not entitle&para;<br>United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(b) Contrary to United’s claim, the confirmation order is not void&para;<br>because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm&para;<br>Espinosa’s plan absent an undue hardship finding under §523(a)(8).&para;<br>Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Section&para;<br>523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction over student&para;<br>loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a&para;<br>denial of due process. Instead, it requires a court to make a certain&para;<br>findings before confirming a student loan debt’s discharge. ‘That this&para;<br>requirement is “ ‘self-executing,’ ” Tennessee Student Assistance Cor&para;<br>poration v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, 450, means only that the bankruptcy&para;<br>court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does&para;<br>not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy court’s failure to&para;<br>make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for&para;<br>Rule 60(b)(4) purposes. Although the Bankruptcy Court’s failure to&para;<br>find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is en&para;<br>forceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the&para;<br>error and failed to object or timely appeal. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>2. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must&para;<br>confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without&para;<br>an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless&para;<br>the creditor timely raises a specific objection. A Chapter 13 plan pro&para;<br>posing such a discharge without the required determination violates&para;<br>§§1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this self-executing&para;<br>requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to&para;<br>object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court&para;<br>may confirm only a plan that, inter alia, complies with the “applica&para;<br>ble provisions” of the Code. §1325(a). Neither the Code nor the Rules&para;<br>prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue&para;<br>hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons&para;<br>and complaint. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>3. Expanding the availability of Rule 60(b)(4) relief is not an ap&para;<br>propriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from fil&para;<br>ing Chapter 13 plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship&para;<br>requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the&para;<br>proposal and the creditor will not object. Such bad-faith efforts&para;<br>should be deterred by the specter of penalties that “[d]ebtors and&para;<br>their attorneys face . . . under various provisions for engaging in im&para;<br>proper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,” Taylor v. Freeland &amp;&para;<br>Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644. And Congress may enact additional provi&para;<br>sions to address any difficulties should existing sanctions prove in&para;<br>adequate.

S. C. §§523(a)(8), 1328. The&para;<br>Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require bank­&para;<br>ruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination&para;<br>in an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6), which the&para;<br>party seeking the determination must initiate by serving a&para;<br>summons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003,&para;<br>7004, 7008. The debtor in this case filed a plan with the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Court that proposed to discharge a portion of&para;<br>his student loan debt, but he failed to initiate the adver­&para;<br>sary proceeding as required for such discharge. The credi­&para;<br>tor received notice of, but did not object to, the plan, and&para;<br>failed to file an appeal after the Bankruptcy Court subse­&para;<br>quently confirmed the plan. Years later, the creditor filed&para;<br>a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4)&para;<br>asking the Bankruptcy Court to rule that its order con­&para;<br>firming the plan was void because the order was issued in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v.

In 1992, Espinosa filed&para;<br>a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13. That Chapter&para;<br>permits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or&para;<br>a portion of their debts over a period of time specified in&para;<br>the plan. See Nobelman v. American Savings Bank, 508&para;<br>U. S. 324, 327 (1993); see also §§301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule&para;<br>Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b). A proposed bankruptcy plan be­&para;<br>comes effective upon confirmation, see §§1324, 1325, and&para;<br>will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if&para;<br>the debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see&para;<br>§1328(a).&para;<br>Espinosa’s plan listed his student loan debt as his only&para;<br>specific indebtedness. App. 15–18. The plan proposed to&para;<br>repay only the principal on that debt, stating that the&para;<br>remainder—the accrued interest—would be discharged&para;<br>once Espinosa repaid the principal. Id., at 26.&para;<br>As the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require,&para;<br>the clerk of the Bankruptcy Court mailed notice and a&para;<br>copy of Espinosa’s plan to petitioner United Student Aid&para;<br>Funds, Inc.

The plan also noted the deadlines for filing a&para;<br>proof of claim or an objection to the plan. Id., at 26–27.&para;<br>United received this notice and, in response, filed a&para;<br>proof of claim for $17,832.15, an amount representing both&para;<br>the principal and the accrued interest on Espinosa’s stu­&para;<br>dent loans. Id., at 35. United did not object to the plan’s&para;<br>proposed discharge of Espinosa’s student loan interest&para;<br>without a determination of undue hardship, nor did it&para;<br>object to Espinosa’s failure to initiate an adversary pro­&para;<br>ceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.&para;<br>In May 1993, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed&para;<br>Espinosa’s plan without holding an adversary proceeding&para;<br>or making a finding of undue hardship. One month later,&para;<br>the Chapter 13 trustee mailed United a form notice stat­&para;<br>ing that “[t]he amount of the claim filed differs from the&para;<br>amount listed for payment in the plan” and that “[y]our&para;<br>claim will be paid as listed in the plan.” Id., at 44. The&para;<br>form also apprised United that if United “wishe[d] to&para;<br>dispute the above stated treatment of the claim,” it had&para;<br>the “responsibility” to notify the trustee within 30 days.&para;<br>Ibid. United did not respond to that notice.&para;<br>In May 1997, Espinosa completed the payments on his&para;<br>student loan principal, as required by the plan. Shortly&para;<br>thereafter, the Bankruptcy Court discharged Espinosa’s&para;<br>student loan interest.2&para;<br>In 2000, the United States Department of Education&para;<br>commenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on Espi­&para;<br>nosa’s student loans.3 In response, Espinosa filed a mo­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The discharge order contained an apparent clerical error that the&para;<br>courts below considered and addressed in adjudicating these proceed­&para;<br>ings. See n. 4, infra.&para;<br>3 After Espinosa completed payments under the plan, United as­&para;<br>signed Espinosa’s loans to the Department under a reinsurance agree­&para;<br>ment. After these proceedings began, United requested and received a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its&para;<br>1997 discharge order by directing the Department and&para;<br>United to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on&para;<br>his student loan debt.&para;<br>United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion&para;<br>under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to&para;<br>set aside as void the Bankruptcy Court’s 1993 order con­&para;<br>firming Espinosa’s plan. United made two arguments in&para;<br>support of its motion. First, United claimed that the&para;<br>provision of Espinosa’s plan authorizing the discharge of&para;<br>his student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code,&para;<br>which requires a court to find undue hardship before&para;<br>discharging a student loan debt, §§523(a)(8), 1328(a), and&para;<br>with the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to&para;<br>make the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceed­&para;<br>ing, see Rule 7001(6). Second, United argued that its due&para;<br>process rights had been violated because Espinosa failed&para;<br>to serve it with the summons and complaint the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial&para;<br>proceeding. See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted&para;<br>Espinosa’s motion in relevant part, denied United’s cross­&para;<br>motion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their&para;<br>collection efforts. United sought review in the District&para;<br>Court, which reversed. That court held that United was&para;<br>denied due process because the confirmation order was&para;<br>issued without service of the summons and complaint the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Rules require.&para;<br>Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit, which issued an initial per curiam opinion re­&para;<br>manding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider&para;<br>correcting an apparent clerical error in its discharge or­&para;<br>der.4 530 F. 3d 895, 899 (2008). The Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>——————&para;<br>recall of the loans from the Department.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>corrected the error, after which the Court of Appeals&para;<br>resubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the&para;<br>District Court. The Court of Appeals concluded that by&para;<br>confirming Espinosa’s plan without first finding undue&para;<br>hardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court at most committed a legal error that United might&para;<br>have successfully appealed, but that any such legal error&para;<br>was not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as&para;<br>void under Rule 60(b). 553 F. 3d 1193, 1198–1202 (2008).5&para;<br>In addition, the Court of Appeals held that although&para;<br>Espinosa’s failure to serve United with a summons and&para;<br>complaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan&para;<br>debt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service&para;<br>was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void&para;<br>because United received actual notice of Espinosa’s plan&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>to exclude “ ‘any debt . . . for a student loan’ ” from the discharge. 530 &para;<br>&para;<br>F. 3d 895, 896 (CA9 2008). That provision appeared irreconcilable with&para;<br>the confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the inter­&para;<br>est on Espinosa’s student loan debt. Suggesting that the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Court may have automatically generated the discharge order without&para;<br>tailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the&para;<br>discharge order to conform to the confirmation order. Id., at 899; see&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to “correct a clerical&para;<br>mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission”). On remand,&para;<br>the Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order except­&para;<br>ing Espinosa’s student loan debt from discharge “was inserted because&para;<br>of a clerical mistake” and struck that language from the order. App. 48.&para;<br>Although certain amici press the point, United has not challenged&para;<br>the substance of the Bankruptcy Court’s amendment to the order or&para;<br>asked us to consider whether such amendment was proper under Rule&para;<br>60(a). See Brief for Petitioner 42; Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. Thus,&para;<br>we express no view on those issues. See Kamen v. Kemper Financial&para;<br>Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 97, n. 4 (1991) (noting that “we do not&para;<br>ordinarily address issues raised only by amici”).&para;<br>5 In so doing, the Court of Appeals disagreed with two other Courts of&para;<br>Appeals.

The “does not dis­&para;<br>charge” language in §523(a), which applies generally to every&para;<br>enumerated paragraph in that section—and to which we never referred&para;<br>in Hood—was not relevant to our analysis.

The Court of&para;<br>Appeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined&para;<br>to confirm such plans “even when the creditor fail[ed] to&para;<br>object to the plan.” 553 F. 3d, at 1205.
